The Last Wish CHAPTER 1 BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY The house was three miles from the station but before the dusty hired fly had rattled along for five minutes the children began to put their heads out of the carriage window and to say Arent we nearly there
And every time they passed a house which was not very often they all said Oh is THIS it
But it never was till they reached the very top of the hill just past the chalkquarry and before you come to the gravelpit
And then there was a white house with a green garden and an orchard beyond and mother said Here we are
How white the house is said Robert
And look at the roses said Anthea
And the plums said Jane
It is rather decent Cyril admitted
The Baby said Wanty go walky and the fly stopped with a last rattle and jolt
Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to get out of the carriage that very minute but no one seemed to mind
Mother curiously enough was in no hurry to get out and even when she had come down slowly and by the step and with no jump at all she seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in and even to pay the driver instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and the orchard and the thorny thistly briery brambly wilderness beyond the broken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house
But the children were wiser for once
It was not really a pretty house at all it was quite ordinary and mother thought it was rather inconvenient and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves to speak of and hardly a cupboard in the place
Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architects nightmare
But the house was deep in the country with no other house in sight and the children had been in London for two years without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise
For London is like prison for children especially if their relations are not rich
Of course there are the shops and the theatres and Maskelyne and Cooks and things but if your people are rather poor you dont get taken to the theatres and you cant buy things out of the shops and London has none of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the things or themselves  such as trees and sand and woods and waters
And nearly everything in London is the wrong sort of shape  all straight lines and flat streets instead of being all sorts of odd shapes like things are in the country
Trees are all different as you know and I am sure some tiresome person must have told you that there are no two blades of grass exactly alike
But in streets where the blades of grass dont grow everything is like everything else
This is why so many children who live in towns are so extremely naughty
They do not know what is the matter with them and no more do their fathers and mothers aunts uncles cousins tutors governesses and nurses but I know
And so do you now
Children in the country are naughty sometimes too but that is for quite different reasons
The children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly before they were caught and cleaned for tea and they saw quite well that they were certain to be happy at the White House
They thought so from the first moment but when they found the back of the house covered with jasmine an in white flower and smelling like a bottle of the most expensive scent that is ever given for a birthday present and when they had seen the lawn all green and smooth and quite different from the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town and when they had found the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left they were almost certain and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled out of it and got a lump on his head the size of an egg and Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep rabbits in if you ever had any they had no longer any doubts whatever
The best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to places and not doing things
In London almost everything is labelled You mustnt touch and though the label is invisible its just as bad because you know its there or if you dont you jolly soon get told
The White House was on the edge of a hill with a wood behind it  and the chalkquarry on one side and the gravelpit on the other
Down at the bottom of the hill was a level plain with queershaped white buildings where people burnt lime and a big red brewery and other houses and when the big chimneys were smoking and the sun was setting the valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist and the limekilns and oasthouses glimmered and glittered till they were like an enchanted city out of the Arabian Nights
Now that I have begun to tell you about the place I feel that I could go on and make this into a most interesting story about all the ordinary things that the children did  just the kind of things you do yourself you know  and you would believe every word of it and when I told about the childrens being tiresome as you are sometimes your aunts would perhaps write in the margin of the story with a pencil How true
or How like life
and you would see it and very likely be annoyed
So I will only tell you the really astonishing things that happened and you may leave the book about quite safely for no aunts and uncles either are likely to write How true
on the edge of the story
Grownup people find it very difficult to believe really wonderful things unless they have what they call proof
But children will believe almost anything and grownups know this
That is why they tell you that the earth is round like an orange when you can see perfectly well that it is flat and lumpy and why they say that the earth goes round the sun when you can see for yourself any day that the sun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night like a good sun as it is and the earth knows its place and lies as still as a mouse
Yet I daresay you believe all that about the earth and the sun and if so you will find it quite easy to believe that before Anthea and Cyril and the others had been a week in the country they had found a fairy
At least they called it that because that was what it called itself and of course it knew best but it was not at all like any fairy you ever saw or heard of or read about
It was at the gravelpits
Father had to go away suddenly on business and mother had gone away to stay with Granny who was not very well
They both went in a great hurry and when they were gone the house seemed dreadfully quiet and empty and the children wandered from one room to another and looked at the bits of paper and string on the floors left over from the packing and not yet cleared up and wished they had something to do
It was Cyril who said I say lets take our Margate spades and go and dig in the gravelpits
We can pretend its seaside
Father said it was once Anthea said he says there are shells there thousands of years old
So they went
Of course they had been to the edge of the gravelpit and looked over but they had not gone down into it for fear father should say they mustnt play there and the same with the chalkquarry
The gravelpit is not really dangerous if you dont try to climb down the edges but go the slow safe way round by the road as if you were a cart
Each of the children carried its own spade and took it in turns to carry the Lamb
He was the baby and they called him that because Baa was the first thing he ever said
They called Anthea Panther which seems silly when you read it but when you say it it sounds a little like her name
The gravelpit is very large and wide with grass growing round the edges at the top and dry stringy wildflowers purple and yellow
It is like a giants washhand basin
And there are mounds of gravel and holes in the sides of the basin where gravel has been taken out and high up in the steep sides there are the little holes that are the little front doors of the little sandmartins little houses
The children built a castle of course but castlebuilding is rather poor fun when you have no hope of the swishing tide ever coming in to fill up the moat and wash away the drawbridge and at the happy last to wet everybody up to the waist at least
Cyril wanted to dig out a cave to play smugglers in but the others thought it might bury them alive so it ended in all spades going to work to dig a hole through the castle to Australia
These children you see believed that the world was round and that on the other side the little Australian boys and girls were really walking wrong way up like flies on the ceiling with their heads hanging down into the air
The children dug and they dug and they dug and their hands got sandy and hot and red and their faces got damp and shiny
The Lamb had tried to eat the sand and had cried so hard when he found that it was not as he had supposed brown sugar that he was now tired out and was lying asleep in a warm fat bunch in the middle of the halffinished castle
This left his brothers and sisters free to work really hard and the hole that was to come out in Australia soon grew so deep that Jane who was called Pussy for short begged the others to Stop
Suppose the bottom of the hole gave way suddenly she said and you tumbled out among the little Australians all the sand would get in their eyes
Yes said Robert and they would hate us and throw stones at us and not let us see the kangaroos or opossums or bluegums or Emu Brand birds or anything
Cyril and Anthea knew that Australia was not quite so near as all that but they agreed to stop using the spades and go on with their hands
This was quite easy because the sand at the bottom of the hole was very soft and fine and dry like seasand
And there were little shells in it
Fancy it having been wet sea here once all sloppy and shiny said Jane with fishes and congereels and coral and mermaids
And masts of ships and wrecked Spanish treasure
I wish we could find a gold doubloon or something Cyril said
How did the sea get carried away
Robert asked
Not in a pail silly said his brother
Father says the earth got too hot underneath like you do in bed sometimes so it just hunched up its shoulders and the sea had to slip off like the blankets do off us and the shoulder was left sticking out and turned into dry land
Lets go and look for shells I think that little cave looks likely and I see something sticking out there like a bit of wrecked ships anchor and its beastly hot in the Australian hole
The others agreed but Anthea went on digging
She always liked to finish a thing when she had once begun it
She felt it would be a disgrace to leave that hole without getting through to Australia
The cave was disappointing because there were no shells and the wrecked ships anchor turned out to be only the broken end of a pickaxe handle and the cave party were just making up their minds that the sand makes you thirstier when it is not by the seaside and someone had suggested going home for lemonade when Anthea suddenly screamed Cyril
Come here
Oh come quick
Its alive
Itll get away
Quick
They all hurried back
Its a rat I shouldnt wonder said Robert
Father says they infest old places  and this must be pretty old if the sea was here thousands of years ago
Perhaps it is a snake said Jane shuddering
Lets look said Cyril jumping into the hole
Im not afraid of snakes
I like them
If it is a snake Ill tame it and it will follow me everywhere and Ill let it sleep round my neck at night
No you wont said Robert firmly
He shared Cyrils bedroom
But you may if its a rat
Oh dont be silly
said Anthea its not a rat its MUCH bigger
And its not a snake
Its got feet I saw them and fur
No  not the spade
Youll hurt it
Dig with your hands
And let IT hurt ME instead
Thats so likely isnt it
said Cyril seizing a spade
Oh dont
said Anthea
Squirrel DONT
I  it sounds silly but it said something
It really and truly did
What
It said You let me alone
But Cyril merely observed that his sister must have gone off her nut and he and Robert dug with spades while Anthea sat on the edge of the hole jumping up and down with hotness and anxiety
They dug carefully and presently everyone could see that there really was something moving in the bottom of the Australian hole
Then Anthea cried out IM not afraid
Let me dig and fell on her knees and began to scratch like a dog does when he has suddenly remembered where it was that he buried his bone
Oh I felt fur she cried half laughing and half crying
I did indeed
I did
when suddenly a dry husky voice in the sand made them all jump back and their hearts jumped nearly as fast as they did
Let me alone it said
And now everyone heard the voice and looked at the others to see if they had too
But we want to see you said Robert bravely
I wish youd come out said Anthea also taking courage
Oh well  if thats your wish the voice said and the sand stirred and spun and scattered and something brown and furry and fat came rolling out into the hole and the sand fell off it and it sat there yawning and rubbing the ends of its eyes with its hands
I believe I must have dropped asleep it said stretching itself
The children stood round the hole in a ring looking at the creature they had found
It was worth looking at
Its eyes were on long horns like a snails eyes and it could move them in and out like telescopes it had ears like a bats ears and its tubby body was shaped like a spiders and covered with thick soft fur its legs and arms were furry too and it had hands and feet like a monkeys
What on earth is it
Jane said
Shall we take it home
The thing turned its long eyes to look at her and said Does she always talk nonsense or is it only the rubbish on her head that makes her silly
It looked scornfully at Janes hat as it spoke
She doesnt mean to be silly Anthea said gently we none of us do whatever you may think
Dont be frightened we dont want to hurt you you know
Hurt ME
it said
ME frightened
Upon my word
Why you talk as if I were nobody in particular
All its fur stood out like a cats when it is going to fight
Well said Anthea still kindly perhaps if we knew who you are in particular we could think of something to say that wouldnt make you cross
Everything weve said so far seems to have
Who are you
And dont get angry
Because really we dont know
You dont know
it said
Well I knew the world had changed  but  well really  do you mean to tell me seriously you dont know a Psammead when you see one
A Sammyadd
Thats Greek to me
So it is to everyone said the creature sharply
Well in plain English then a SANDFAIRY
Dont you know a Sandfairy when you see one
It looked so grieved and hurt that Jane hastened to say Of course I see you are now
Its quite plain now one comes to look at you
You came to look at me several sentences ago it said crossly beginning to curl up again in the sand
Oh  dont go away again
Do talk some more Robert cried
I didnt know you were a Sandfairy but I knew directly I saw you that you were much the wonderfullest thing Id ever seen
The Sandfairy seemed a shade less disagreeable after this
It isnt talking I mind it said as long as youre reasonably civil
But Im not going to make polite conversation for you
If you talk nicely to me perhaps Ill answer you and perhaps I wont
Now say something
Of course no one could think of anything to say but at last Robert thought of How long have you lived here
and he said it at once
Oh ages  several thousand years replied the Psammead
Tell us all about it
Do
Its all in books
You arent
Jane said
Oh tell us everything you can about yourself
We dont know anything about you and you are so nice
The Sandfairy smoothed his long ratlike whiskers and smiled between them
Do please tell
said the children all together
It is wonderful how quickly you get used to things even the most astonishing
Five minutes before the children had had no more idea than you that there was such a thing as a sandfairy in the world and now they were talking to it as though they had known it all their lives
It drew its eyes in and said How very sunny it is  quite like old times
Where do you get your Megatheriums from now
What
said the children all at once
It is very difficult always to remember that what is not polite especially in moments of surprise or agitation
Are Pterodactyls plentiful now
the Sandfairy went on
The children were unable to reply
What do you have for breakfast
the Fairy said impatiently and who gives it you
Eggs and bacon and breadandmilk and porridge and things
Mother gives it us
What are Megawhatsitsnames and Pterowhatdoyoucallthems
And does anyone have them for breakfast
Why almost everyone had Pterodactyl for breakfast in my time
Pterodactyls were something like crocodiles and something like birds  I believe they were very good grilled
You see it was like this of course there were heaps of sandfairies then and in the morning early you went out and hunted for them and when youd found one it gave you your wish
People used to send their little boys down to the seashore early in the morning before breakfast to get the days wishes and very often the eldest boy in the family would be told to wish for a Megatherium ready jointed for cooking
It was as big as an elephant you see so there was a good deal of meat on it
And if they wanted fish the Ichthyosaurus was asked for  he was twenty to forty feet long so there was plenty of him
And for poultry there was the Plesiosaurus there were nice pickings on that too
Then the other children could wish for other things
But when people had dinnerparties it was nearly always Megatheriums and Ichthyosaurus because his fins were a great delicacy and his tail made soup
There must have been heaps and heaps of cold meat left over said Anthea who meant to be a good housekeeper some day
Oh no said the Psammead that would never have done
Why of course at sunset what was left over turned into stone
You find the stone bones of the Megatherium and things all over the place even now they tell me
Who tell you
asked Cyril but the Sandfairy frowned and began to dig very fast with its furry hands
Oh dont go
they all cried tell us more about it when it was Megatheriums for breakfast
Was the world like this then
It stopped digging
Not a bit it said it was nearly all sand where I lived and coal grew on trees and the periwinkles were as big as teatrays  you find them now theyre turned into stone
We sandfairies used to live on the seashore and the children used to come with their little flintspades and flintpails and make castles for us to live in
Thats thousands of years ago but I hear that children still build castles on the sand
Its difficult to break yourself of a habit
But why did you stop living in the castles
asked Robert
Its a sad story said the Psammead gloomily
It was because they WOULD build moats to the castles and the nasty wet bubbling sea used to come in and of course as soon as a sandfairy got wet it caught cold and generally died
And so there got to be fewer and fewer and whenever you found a fairy and had a wish you used to wish for a Megatherium and eat twice as much as you wanted because it might be weeks before you got another wish
And did YOU get wet
Robert inquired
The Sandfairy shuddered
Only once it said the end of the twelfth hair of my top left whisker  I feel the place still in damp weather
It was only once but it was quite enough for me
I went away as soon as the sun had dried my poor dear whisker
I scurried away to the back of the beach and dug myself a house deep in warm dry sand and there Ive been ever since
And the sea changed its lodgings afterwards
And now Im not going to tell you another thing
Just one more please said the children
Can you give wishes now
Of course said it didnt I give you yours a few minutes ago
You said I wish youd come out and I did
Oh please maynt we have another
Yes but be quick about it
Im tired of you
I daresay you have often thought what you would do if you had three wishes given you and have despised the old man and his wife in the blackpudding story and felt certain that if you had the chance you could think of three really useful wishes without a moments hesitation
These children had often talked this matter over but now the chance had suddenly come to them they could not make up their minds
Quick said the Sandfairy crossly
No one could think of anything only Anthea did manage to remember a private wish of her own and janes which they had never told the boys
She knew the boys would not care about it  but still it was better than nothing
I wish we were all as beautiful as the day she said in a great hurry
The children looked at each other but each could see that the others were not any betterlooking than usual
The Psammead pushed out its long eyes and seemed to be holding its breath and swelling itself out till it was twice as fat and furry as before
Suddenly it let its breath go in a long sigh
Im really afraid I cant manage it it said apologetically I must be out of practice
The children were horribly disappointed
Oh DO try again
they said
Well said the Sandfairy the fact is I was keeping back a little strength to give the rest of you your wishes with
If youll be contented with one wish a day amongst the lot of you I daresay I can screw myself up to it
Do you agree to that
Yes oh yes
said Jane and Anthea
The boys nodded
They did not believe the Sandfairy could do it
You can always make girls believe things much easier than you can boys
It stretched out its eyes farther than ever and swelled and swelled and swelled
I do hope it wont hurt itself said Anthea
Or crack its skin Robert said anxiously
Everyone was very much relieved when the Sandfairy after getting so big that it almost filled up the hole in the sand suddenly let out its breath and went back to its proper size
Thats all right it said panting heavily
Itll come easier tomorrow
Did it hurt much
asked Anthea
Only my poor whisker thank you said he but youre a kind and thoughtful child
Good day
It scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet and disappeared in the sand
Then the children looked at each other and each child suddenly found itself alone with three perfect strangers all radiantly beautiful
They stood for some moments in perfect silence
Each thought that its brothers and sisters had wandered off and that these strange children had stolen up unnoticed while it was watching the swelling form of the Sandfairy
Anthea spoke first  Excuse me she said very politely to Jane who now had enormous blue eyes and a cloud of russet hair but have you seen two little boys and a little girl anywhere about
I was just going to ask you that said Jane
And then Cyril cried Why its YOU
I know the hole in your pinafore
You ARE Jane arent you
And youre the Panther I can see your dirty handkerchief that you forgot to change after youd cut your thumb
Crikey
The wish has come off after all
I say am I as handsome as you are
If youre Cyril I liked you much better as you were before said Anthea decidedly
You look like the picture of the young chorister with your golden hair youll die young I shouldnt wonder
And if thats Robert hes like an Italian organgrinder
His hairs all black
You two girls are like Christmas cards then  thats all  silly Christmas cards said Robert angrily
And janes hair is simply carrots
It was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists
Well its no use finding fault with each other said Anthea lets get the Lamb and lug it home to dinner
The servants will admire us most awfully youll see
Baby was just waking when they got to him and not one of the children but was relieved to find that he at least was not as beautiful as the day but just the same as usual
I suppose hes too young to have wishes naturally said Jane
We shall have to mention him specially next time
Anthea ran forward and held out her arms
Come to own Panther ducky she said
The Baby looked at her disapprovingly and put a sandy pink thumb in his mouth Anthea was his favourite sister
Come then she said
Gway long
said the Baby
Come to own Pussy said Jane
Wants my Panty said the Lamb dismally and his lip trembled
Here come on Veteran said Robert come and have a yidey on Yobbys back
Yah narky narky boy howled the Baby giving way altogether
Then the children knew the worst
THE BABY DID NOT KNOW THEM
They looked at each other in despair and it was terrible to each in this dire emergency to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect strangers instead of the merry friendly commonplace twinkling jolly little eyes of its own brothers and sisters
This is most truly awful said Cyril when he had tried to lift up the Lamb and the Lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a bull
Weve got to MAKE FRIENDS with him
I cant carry him home screaming like that
Fancy having to make friends with our own baby
 its too silly
That however was exactly what they had to do
It took over an hour and the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the Lamb was by this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert
At last he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by turns but as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances he was a dead weight and most exhausting
Thank goodness were home
said Jane staggering through the iron gate to where Martha the nursemaid stood at the front door shading her eyes with her hand and looking out anxiously
Here
Do take Baby
Martha snatched the Baby from her arms
Thanks be HES safe back she said
Where are the others and whoever to goodness gracious are all of you
Were US of course said Robert
And whos US when youre at home
asked Martha scornfully
I tell you its US only were beautiful as the day said Cyril
Im Cyril and these are the others and were jolly hungry
Let us in and dont be a silly idiot
Martha merely dratted Cyrils impudence and tried to shut the door in his face
I know we LOOK different but Im Anthea and were so tired and its long past dinnertime
Then go home to your dinners whoever you are and if our children put you up to this playacting you can tell them from me theyll catch it so they know what to expect
With that she did bang the door
Cyril rang the bell violently
No answer
Presently cook put her head out of a bedroom window and said If you dont take yourselves off and that precious sharp Ill go and fetch the police
And she slammed down the window
Its no good said Anthea
Oh do do come away before we get sent to prison
The boys said it was nonsense and the law of England couldnt put you in prison for just being as beautiful as the day but all the same they followed the others out into the lane
We shall be our proper selves after sunset I suppose said Jane
I dont know Cyril said sadly it maynt be like that now  things have changed a good deal since Megatherium times
Oh cried Anthea suddenly perhaps we shall turn into stone at sunset like the Megatheriums did so that there maynt be any of us left over for the next day
She began to cry so did Jane
Even the boys turned pale
No one had the heart to say anything
It was a horrible afternoon
There was no house near where the children could beg a crust of bread or even a glass of water
They were afraid to go to the village because they had seen Martha go down there with a basket and there was a local constable
True they were all as beautiful as the day but that is a poor comfort when you are as hungry as a hunter and as thirsty as a sponge
Three times they tried in vain to get the servants in the White House to let them in and listen to their tale
And then Robert went alone hoping to be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door to the others
But all the windows were out of reach and Martha emptied a toiletjug of cold water over him from a top window and said Go along with you you nasty little Eyetalian monkey
It came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge with their feet in a dry ditch waiting for sunset and wondering whether when the sun did set they would turn into stone or only into their own old natural selves and each of them still felt lonely and among strangers and tried not to look at the others for though their voices were their own their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite irritating to look at
I dont believe we SHALL turn to stone said Robert breaking a long miserable silence because the Sandfairy said hed give us another wish tomorrow and he couldnt if we were stone could he
The others said No but they werent at all comforted
Another silence longer and more miserable was broken by Cyrils suddenly saying I dont want to frighten you girls but I believe its beginning with me already
My foots quite dead
Im turning to stone I know I am and so will you in a minute
Never mind said Robert kindly perhaps youll be the only stone one and the rest of us will be all right and well cherish your statue and hang garlands on it
But when it turned out that Cyrils foot had only gone to sleep through his sitting too long with it under him and when it came to life in an agony of pins and needles the others were quite cross
Giving us such a fright for nothing
said Anthea
The third and miserablest silence of all was broken by Jane
She said If we DO come out of this all right well ask the Sammyadd to make it so that the servants dont notice anything different no matter what wishes we have
The others only grunted
They were too wretched even to make good resolutions
At last hunger and fright and crossness and tiredness  four very nasty things  all joined together to bring one nice thing and that was sleep
The children lay asleep in a row with their beautiful eyes shut and their beautiful mouths open
Anthea woke first
The sun had set and the twilight was coming on
Anthea pinched herself very hard to make sure and when she found she could still feel pinching she decided that she was not stone and then she pinched the others
They also were soft
Wake up she said almost in tears of joy its all right were not stone
And oh Cyril how nice and ugly you do look with your old freckles and your brown hair and your little eyes
And so do you all
she added so that they might not feel jealous
When they got home they were very much scolded by Martha who told them about the strange children
A goodlooking lot I must say but that impudent
I know said Robert who knew by experience how hopeless it would be to try to explain things to Martha
And where on earth have you been all this time you naughty little things you
In the lane
Why didnt you come home hours ago
We couldnt because of THEM said Anthea
Who
The children who were as beautiful as the day
They kept us there till after sunset
We couldnt come back till theyd gone
You dont know how we hated them
Oh do do give us some supper  we are so hungry
Hungry
I should think so said Martha angrily out all day like this
Well I hope itll be a lesson to you not to go picking up with strange children  down here after measles as likely as not
Now mind if you see them again dont you speak to them  not one word nor so much as a look  but come straight away and tell me
Ill spoil their beauty for them
If ever we DO see them again well tell you Anthea said and Robert fixing his eyes fondly on the cold beef that was being brought in on a tray by cook added in heartfelt undertones  And well take jolly good care we never DO see them again
And they never have
CHAPTER 2 GOLDEN GUINEAS Anthea woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream in which she was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day without any umbrella
The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain and were all growling gloomily
When she awoke both the growling and the rain went on just the same
The growling was the heavy regular breathing of her sister Jane who had a slight cold and was still asleep
The rain fell in slow drops on to Antheas face from the wet corner of a bathtowel which her brother Robert was gently squeezing the water out of to wake her up as he now explained
Oh drop it
she said rather crossly so he did for he was not a brutal brother though very ingenious in applepie beds boobytraps original methods of awakening sleeping relatives and the other little accomplishments which make home happy
I had such a funny dream Anthea began
So did I said Jane wakening suddenly and without warning
I dreamed we found a Sandfairy in the gravelpits and it said it was a Sammyadd and we might have a new wish every day and  But thats what I dreamed said Robert
I was just going to tell you  and we had the first wish directly it said so
And I dreamed you girls were donkeys enough to ask for us all to be beautiful as the day and we jolly well were and it was perfectly beastly
But CAN different people all dream the same thing
said Anthea sitting up in bed because I dreamed all that as well as about the Zoo and the rain and Baby didnt know us in my dream and the servants shut us out of the house because the radiantness of our beauty was such a complete disguise and  The voice of the eldest brother sounded from across the landing
Come on Robert it said youll be late for breakfast again  unless you mean to shirk your bath like you did on Tuesday
I say come here a sec Robert replied
I didnt shirk it I had it after brekker in fathers dressingroom because ours was emptied away
Cyril appeared in the doorway partially clothed
Look here said Anthea weve all had such an odd dream
Weve all dreamed we found a Sandfairy
Her voice died away before Cyrils contemptuous glance
Dream
he said you little sillies its TRUE
I tell you it all happened
Thats why Im so keen on being down early
Well go up there directly after brekker and have another wish
Only well make up our minds solid before we go what it is we do want and no one must ask for anything unless the others agree first
No more peerless beauties for this child thank you
Not if I know it
The other three dressed with their mouths open
If all that dream about the Sandfairy was real this real dressing seemed very like a dream the girls thought
Jane felt that Cyril was right but Anthea was not sure till after they had seen Martha and heard her full and plain reminders about their naughty conduct the day before
Then Anthea was sure
Because said she servants never dream anything but the things in the Dreambook like snakes and oysters and going to a wedding  that means a funeral and snakes are a false female friend and oysters are babies
Talking of babies said Cyril wheres the Lamb
Marthas going to take him to Rochester to see her cousins
Mother said she might
Shes dressing him now said Jane in his very best coat and hat
Breadandbutter please
She seems to like taking him too said Robert in a tone of wonder
Servants do like taking babies to see their relations Cyril said
Ive noticed it before  especially in their best things
I expect they pretend theyre their own babies and that theyre not servants at all but married to noble dukes of high degree and they say the babies are the little dukes and duchesses Jane suggested dreamily taking more marmalade
I expect thats what Marthall say to her cousin
Shell enjoy herself most frightfully She wont enjoy herself most frightfully carrying our infant duke to Rochester said Robert not if shes anything like me  she wont
Fancy walking to Rochester with the Lamb on your back
Oh crikey
said Cyril in full agreement
Shes going by carrier said Jane
Lets see them off then we shall have done a polite and kindly act and we shall be quite sure weve got rid of them for the day
So they did
Martha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple so tight in the chest that it made her stoop and her blue hat with the pink cornflowers and white ribbon
She had a yellowlace collar with a green bow
And the Lamb had indeed his very best creamcoloured silk coat and hat
It was a smart party that the carriers cart picked up at the Cross Roads
When its white tilt and red wheels had slowly vanished in a swirl of chalkdust  And now for the Sammyadd
said Cyril and off they went
As they went they decided on the wish they would ask for
Although they were all in a great hurry they did not try to climb down the sides of the gravelpit but went round by the safe lower road as if they had been carts
They had made a ring of stones round the place where the Sandfairy had disappeared so they easily found the spot
The sun was burning and bright and the sky was deep blue  without a cloud
The sand was very hot to touch
Oh  suppose it was only a dream after all Robert said as the boys uncovered their spades from the sandheap where they had buried them and began to dig
Suppose you were a sensible chap said Cyril ones quite as likely as the other
Suppose you kept a civil tongue in your head Robert snapped
Suppose we girls take a turn said Jane laughing
You boys seem to be getting very warm
Suppose you dont come shoving your silly oar in said Robert who was now warm indeed
We wont said Anthea quickly
Robert dear dont be so grumpy  we wont say a word you shall be the one to speak to the Fairy and tell him what weve decided to wish for
Youll say it much better than we shall
Suppose you drop being a little humbug said Robert but not crossly
Look out  dig with your hands now
So they did and presently uncovered the spidershaped brown hairy body long arms and legs bats ears and snails eyes of the Sandfairy himself
Everyone drew a deep breath of satisfaction for now of course it couldnt have been a dream
The Psammead sat up and shook the sand out of its fur
Hows your left whisker this morning
said Anthea politely
Nothing to boast of said it it had rather a restless night
But thank you for asking
I say said Robert do you feel up to giving wishes today because we very much want an extra besides the regular one
The extras a very little one he added reassuringly
Humph
said the Sandfairy
If you read this story aloud please pronounce humph exactly as it is spelt for that is how he said it
Humph
Do you know until I heard you being disagreeable to each other just over my head and so loud too I really quite thought I had dreamed you all
I do have very odd dreams sometimes
Do you
Jane hurried to say so as to get away from the subject of disagreeableness
I wish she added politely youd tell us about your dreams  they must be awfully interesting
Is that the days wish
said the Sandfairy yawning
Cyril muttered something about just like a girl and the rest stood silent
If they said Yes then goodbye to the other wishes they had decided to ask for
If they said No it would be very rude and they had all been taught manners and had learned a little too which is not at all the same thing
A sigh of relief broke from all lips when the Sandfairy said If I do I shant have strength to give you a second wish not even good tempers or common sense or manners or little things like that
We dont want you to put yourself out at all about these things we can manage them quite well ourselves said Cyril eagerly while the others looked guiltily at each other and wished the Fairy would not keep all on about good tempers but give them one good rowing if it wanted to and then have done with it
Well said the Psammead putting out his long snails eyes so suddenly that one of them nearly went into the round boys eyes of Robert lets have the little wish first
We dont want the servants to notice the gifts you give us
Are kind enough to give us said Anthea in a whisper
Are kind enough to give us I mean said Robert
The Fairy swelled himself out a bit let his breath go and said  Ive done THAT for you  it was quite easy
People dont notice things much anyway
Whats the next wish
We want said Robert slowly to be rich beyond the dreams of something or other
Avarice said Jane
So it is said the Fairy unexpectedly
But it wont do you much good thats one comfort it muttered to itself
Come  I cant go beyond dreams you know
How much do you want and will you have it in gold or notes
Gold please  and millions of it
This gravelpit full be enough
said the Fairy in an offhand manner
Oh YES
Then get out before I begin or youll be buried alive in it
It made its skinny arms so long and waved them so frighteningly that the children ran as hard as they could towards the road by which carts used to come to the gravelpits
Only Anthea had presence of mind enough to shout a timid Goodmorning I hope your whisker will be better tomorrow as she ran
On the road they turned and looked back and they had to shut their eyes and open them very slowly a little bit at a time because the sight was too dazzling for their eyes to be able to bear it
It was something like trying to look at the sun at high noon on Midsummer Day
For the whole of the sandpit was full right up to the very top with new shining gold pieces and all the little sandmartins little front doors were covered out of sight
Where the road for the carts wound into the gravelpit the gold lay in heaps like stones lie by the roadside and a great bank of shining gold shelved down from where it lay flat and smooth between the tall sides of the gravelpit
And all the gleaming heap was minted gold
And on the sides and edges of these countless coins the midday sun shone and sparkled and glowed and gleamed till the quarry looked like the mouth of a smelting furnace or one of the fairy halls that you see sometimes in the sky at sunset
The children stood with their mouths open and no one said a word
At last Robert stopped and picked up one of the loose coins from the edge of the heap by the cartroad and looked at it
He looked on both sides
Then he said in a low voice quite different to his own Its not sovereigns
Its gold anyway said Cyril
And now they all began to talk at once
They all picked up the golden treasure by handfuls and let it run through their fingers like water and the chink it made as it fell was wonderful music
At first they quite forgot to think of spending the money it was so nice to play with
Jane sat down between two heaps of gold and Robert began to bury her as you bury your father in sand when you are at the seaside and he has gone to sleep on the beach with his newspaper over his face
But Jane was not half buried before she cried out Oh stop its too heavy
It hurts
Robert said Bosh
and went on
Let me out I tell you cried Jane and was taken out very white and trembling a little
Youve no idea what its like said she its like stones on you  or like chains
Look here Cyril said if this is to do us any good its no good our staying gasping at it like this
Lets fill our pockets and go and buy things
Dont you forget it wont last after sunset
I wish wed asked the Sammyadd why things dont turn to stone
Perhaps this will
Ill tell you what theres a pony and cart in the village
Do you want to buy that
asked Jane
No silly  well HIRE it
And then well go to Rochester and buy heaps and heaps of things
Look here lets each take as much as we can carry
But its not sovereigns
Theyve got a mans head on one side and a thing like the ace of spades on the other
Fill your pockets with it I tell you and come along
You can jaw as we go  if you must jaw
Cyril sat down and began to fill his pockets
You made fun of me for getting father to have nine pockets in my Norfolks said he but now you see
They did
For when Cyril had filled his nine pockets and his handkerchief and the space between himself and his shirt front with the gold coins he had to stand up
But he staggered and had to sit down again in a hurry Throw out some of the cargo said Robert
Youll sink the ship old chap
That comes of nine pockets
And Cyril had to
Then they set off to walk to the village
It was more than a mile and the road was very dusty indeed and the sun seemed to get hotter and hotter and the gold in their pockets got heavier and heavier
It was Jane who said I dont see how were to spend it all
There must be thousands of pounds among the lot of us
Im going to leave some of mine behind this stump in the hedge
And directly we get to the village well buy some biscuits I know its long past dinnertime
She took out a handful or two of gold and hid it in the hollows of an old hornbeam
How round and yellow they are she said
Dont you wish they were gingerbread nuts and we were going to eat them
Well theyre not and were not said Cyril
Come on
But they came on heavily and wearily
Before they reached the village more than one stump in the hedge concealed its little hoard of hidden treasure
Yet they reached the village with about twelve hundred guineas in their pockets
But in spite of this inside wealth they looked quite ordinary outside and no one would have thought they could have more than a halfcrown each at the outside
The haze of heat the blue of the wood smoke made a sort of dim misty cloud over the red roofs of the village
The four sat down heavily on the first bench they came to It happened to be outside the Blue Boar Inn
It was decided that Cyril should go into the Blue Boar and ask for gingerbeer because as Anthea said It is not wrong for men to go into public houses only for children
And Cyril is nearer to being a man than us because he is the eldest
So he went
The others sat in the sun and waited
Oh hats how hot it is
said Robert
Dogs put their tongues out when theyre hot I wonder if it would cool us at all to put out ours
We might tryJane said and they all put their tongues out as far as ever they could go so that it quite stretched their throats but it only seemed to make them thirstier than ever besides annoying everyone who went by
So they took their tongues in again just as Cyril came back with the gingerbeer
I had to pay for it out of my own twoandsevenpence though that I was going to buy rabbits with he said
They wouldnt change the gold
And when I pulled out a handful the man just laughed and said it was cardcounters
And I got some spongecakes too out of a glass jar on the barcounter
And some biscuits with caraways in
The spongecakes were both soft and dry and the biscuits were dry too and yet soft which biscuits ought not to be
But the gingerbeer made up for everything
Its my turn now to try to buy something with the money Anthea said Im next eldest
Where is the ponycart kept
It was at The Chequers and Anthea went in the back way to the yard because they all knew that little girls ought not to go into the bars of publichouses
She came out as she herself said pleased but not proud
Hell be ready in a brace of shakes he says she remarked and hes to have one sovereign  or whatever it is  to drive us in to Rochester and back besides waiting there till weve got everything we want
I think I managed very well
You think yourself jolly clever I daresay said Cyril moodily
How did you do it
I wasnt jolly clever enough to go taking handfuls of money out of my pocket to make it seem cheap anyway she retorted
I just found a young man doing something to a horses leg with a sponge and a pail
And I held out one sovereign and I said Do you know what this is
He said No and hed call his father
And the old man came and he said it was a spade guinea and he said was it my own to do as I liked with and I said Yes and I asked about the ponycart and I said he could have the guinea if hed drive us in to Rochester
And his name is S Crispin
And he said Right oh
It was a new sensation to be driven in a smart ponytrap along pretty country roads it was very pleasant too which is not always the case with new sensations quite apart from the beautiful plans of spending the money which each child made as they went along silently of course and quite to itself for they felt it would never have done to let the old innkeeper hear them talk in the affluent sort of way they were thinking
The old man put them down by the bridge at their request
If you were going to buy a carriage and horses where would you go
asked Cyril as if he were only asking for the sake of something to say
Billy Peasemarsh at the Saracens Head said the old man promptly
Though all forbid I should recommend any man where its a question of horses no more than Id take anybody elses recommending if I was abuying one
But if your pas thinking of a turnout of any sort there aint a straighter man in Rochester nor a civiller spoken than Billy though I says it
Thank you said Cyril
The Saracens Head
And now the children began to see one of the laws of nature turn upside down and stand on its head like an acrobat
Any grownup persons would tell you that money is hard to get and easy to spend
But the fairy money had been easy to get and spending it was not only hard it was almost impossible
The tradespeople of Rochester seemed to shrink to a tradesperson from the glittering fairy gold furrin money they called it for the most part
To begin with Anthea who had had the misfortune to sit on her hat earlier in the day wished to buy another
She chose a very beautiful one trimmed with pink roses and the blue breasts of peacocks
It was marked in the window Paris Model three guineas
Im glad she said because if it says guineas it means guineas and not sovereigns which we havent got
But when she took three of the spade guineas in her hand which was by this time rather dirty owing to her not having put on gloves before going to the gravelpit the blacksilk young lady in the shop looked very hard at her and went and whispered something to an older and uglier lady also in black silk and then they gave her back the money and said it was not current coin
Its good money said Anthea and its my own
I daresay said the lady but its not the kind of money thats fashionable now and we dont care about taking it
I believe they think weve stolen it said Anthea rejoining the others in the street if we had gloves they wouldnt think we were so dishonest
Its my hands being so dirty fills their minds with doubts
So they chose a humble shop and the girls bought cotton gloves the kind at sixpence threefarthings but when they offered a guinea the woman looked at it through her spectacles and said she had no change so the gloves had to be paid for out of Cyrils twoandsevenpence that he meant to buy rabbits with and so had the green imitation crocodileskin purse at ninepencehalfpenny which had been bought at the same time
They tried several more shops the kinds where you buy toys and scent and silk handkerchiefs and books and fancy boxes of stationery and photographs of objects of interest in the vicinity
But nobody cared to change a guinea that day in Rochester and as they went from shop to shop they got dirtier and dirtier and their hair got more and more untidy and Jane slipped and fell down on a part of the road where a watercart had just gone by
Also they got very hungry but they found no one would give them anything to eat for their guineas
After trying two pastrycooks in vain they became so hungry perhaps from the smell of the cake in the shops as Cyril suggested that they formed a plan of campaign in whispers and carried it out in desperation
They marched into a third pastrycooks  Beale his name was  and before the people behind the counter could interfere each child had seized three new penny buns clapped the three together between its dirty hands and taken a big bite out of the triple sandwich
Then they stood at bay with the twelve buns in their hands and their mouths very full indeed
The shocked pastrycook bounded round the corner
Here said Cyril speaking as distinctly as he could and holding out the guinea he got ready before entering the shop pay yourself out of that
Mr Beale snatched the coin bit it and put it in his pocket
Off you go he said brief and stern like the man in the song
But the change
said Anthea who had a saving mind
Change
said the man
Ill change you
Hout you goes and you may think yourselves lucky I dont send for the police to find out where you got it
In the Castle Gardens the millionaires finished the buns and though the curranty softness of these were delicious and acted like a charm in raising the spirits of the party yet even the stoutest heart quailed at the thought of venturing to sound Mr Billy Peasemarsh at the Saracens Head on the subject of a horse and carriage
The boys would have given up the idea but Jane was always a hopeful child and Anthea generally an obstinate one and their earnestness prevailed
The whole party by this time indescribably dirty therefore betook itself to the Saracens Head
The yardmethod of attack having been successful at The Chequers was tried again here
Mr Peasemarsh was in the yard and Robert opened the business in these terms  They tell me you have a lot of horses and carriages to sell
It had been agreed that Robert should be spokesman because in books it is always the gentlemen who buy horses and not ladies and Cyril had had his go at the Blue Boar
They tell you true young man said Mr Peasemarsh
He was a long lean man with very blue eyes and a tight mouth and narrow lips
We should like to buy some please said Robert politely
I daresay you would
Will you show us a few please
To choose from
Who are you akiddin of
inquired Mr Billy Peasemarsh
Was you sent here of a message
I tell you said Robert we want to buy some horses and carriages and a man told us you were straight and civil spoken but I shouldnt wonder if he was mistaken
Upon my sacred
said Mr Peasemarsh
Shall I trot the whole stable out for your Honours worship to see
Or shall I send round to the Bishops to see if hes a nag or two to dispose of
Please do said Robert if its not too much trouble
It would be very kind of you
Mr Peasemarsh put his hands in his pockets and laughed and they did not like the way he did it
Then he shouted Willum
A stooping ostler appeared in a stable door
Here Willum come and look at this ere young dook
Wants to buy the whole stud lock stock and barl
And aint got tuppence in his pocket to bless hisself with Ill go bail
Willums eyes followed his masters pointing thumb with contemptuous interest
Do e for sure
he said
But Robert spoke though both the girls were now pulling at his jacket and begging him to come along
He spoke and he was very angry he said Im not a young duke and I never pretended to be
And as for tuppence  what do you call this
And before the others could stop him he had pulled out two fat handfuls of shining guineas and held them out for Mr Peasemarsh to look at
He did look
He snatched one up in his finger and thumb
He bit it and Jane expected him to say The best horse in my stables is at your service
But the others knew better
Still it was a blow even to the most desponding when he said shortly Willum shut the yard doors and Willum grinned and went to shut them
Goodafternoon said Robert hastily we shant buy any of your horses now whatever you say and I hope itll be a lesson to you
He had seen a little side gate open and was moving towards it as he spoke
But Billy Peasemarsh put himself in the way
Not so fast you young offscouring
he said
Willum fetch the pleece
Willum went
The children stood huddled together like frightened sheep and Mr Peasemarsh spoke to them till the pleece arrived
He said many things
Among other things he said Nice lot you are arent you coming tempting honest men with your guineas
They ARE our guineas said Cyril boldly
Oh of course we dont know all about that no more we dont  oh no  course not
And dragging little gells into it too
Ere  Ill let the gells go if youll come along to the pleece quiet
We wont be let go said Jane heroically not without the boys
Its our money just as much as theirs you wicked old man
Whered you get it then
said the man softening slightly which was not at all what the boys expected when Jane began to call names
Jane cast a silent glance of agony at the others
Lost your tongue eh
Got it fast enough when its for calling names with
Come speak up
Whered you get it
Out of the gravelpit said truthful Jane
Next article said the man
I tell you we did Jane said
Theres a fairy there  all over brown fur  with ears like a bats and eyes like a snails and he gives you a wish a day and they all come true
Touched in the head eh
said the man in a low voice all the more shame to you boys dragging the poor afflicted child into your sinful burglaries
Shes not mad its true said Anthea there is a fairy
If I ever see him again Ill wish for something for you at least I would if vengeance wasnt wicked  so there
Lor lumme said Billy Peasemarsh if there aint another on em
And now Willum came back with a spiteful grin on his face and at his back a policeman with whom Mr Peasemarsh spoke long in a hoarse earnest whisper
I daresay youre right said the policeman at last
Anyway Ill take em up on a charge of unlawful possession pending inquiries
And the magistrate will deal with the case
Send the afflicted ones to a home as likely as not and the boys to a reformatory
Now then come along youngsters
No use making a fuss
You bring the gells along Mr Peasemarsh sir and Ill shepherd the boys
Speechless with rage and horror the four children were driven along the streets of Rochester
Tears of anger and shame blinded them so that when Robert ran right into a passerby he did not recognize her till a wellknown voice said Well if ever I did
Oh Master Robert whatever have you been a doing of now
And another voice quite as well known said Panty want go own Panty
They had run into Martha and the baby
Martha behaved admirably
She refused to believe a word of the policemans story or of Mr Peasemarshs either even when they made Robert turn out his pockets in an archway and show the guineas
I dont see nothing she said
Youve gone out of your senses you two
There aint any gold there  only the poor childs hands all over crock and dirt and like the very chimbley
Oh that I should ever see the day
And the children thought this very noble of Martha even if rather wicked till they remembered how the Fairy had promised that the servants should never notice any of the fairy gifts
So of course Martha couldnt see the gold and so was only speaking the truth and that was quite right of course but not extra noble
It was getting dusk when they reached the policestation
The policeman told his tale to an inspector who sat in a large bare room with a thing like a clumsy nurseryfender at one end to put prisoners in
Robert wondered whether it was a cell or a dock
Produce the coins officer said the inspector
Turn out your pockets said the constable
Cyril desperately plunged his hands in his pockets stood still a moment and then began to laugh  an odd sort of laugh that hurt and that felt much more like crying
His pockets were empty
So were the pockets of the others
For of course at sunset all the fairy gold had vanished away
Turn out your pockets and stop that noise said the inspector
Cyril turned out his pockets every one of the nine which enriched his Norfolk suit
And every pocket was empty
Well
said the inspector
I dont know how they done it  artful little beggars
They walked in front of me the ole way so as for me to keep my eye on them and not to attract a crowd and obstruct the traffic
Its very remarkable said the inspector frowning
If youve quite done abrowbeating of the innocent children said Martha Ill hire a private carriage and well drive home to their papas mansion
Youll hear about this again young man
 I told you they hadnt got any gold when you were pretending to see it in their poor helpless hands
Its early in the day for a constable on duty not to be able to trust his own eyes
As to the other one the less said the better he keeps the Saracens Head and he knows best what his liquors like
Take them away for goodness sake said the inspector crossly
But as they left the policestation he said Now then
to the policeman and Mr Pease marsh and he said it twenty times as crossly as he had spoken to Martha
Martha was as good as her word
She took them home in a very grand carriage because the carriers cart was gone and though she had stood by them so nobly with the police she was so angry with them as soon as they were alone for trapseing into Rochester by themselves that none of them dared to mention the old man with the ponycart from the village who was waiting for them in Rochester
And so after one day of boundless wealth the children found themselves sent to bed in deep disgrace and only enriched by two pairs of cotton gloves dirty inside because of the state of the hands they had been put on to cover an imitation crocodileskin purse and twelve penny buns long since digested
The thing that troubled them most was the fear that the old gentlemans guinea might have disappeared at sunset with all the rest so they went down to the village next day to apologize for not meeting him in Rochester and to see
They found him very friendly
The guinea had NOT disappeared and he had bored a hole in it and hung it on his watchchain
As for the guinea the baker took the children felt they could not care whether it had vanished or not which was not perhaps very honest but on the other hand was not wholly unnatural
But afterwards this preyed on Antheas mind and at last she secretly sent twelve stamps by post to Mr Beale Baker Rochester
Inside she wrote To pay for the buns
I hope the guinea did disappear for that pastrycook was really not at all a nice man and besides penny buns are seven for sixpence in all really respectable shops
CHAPTER 3 BEING WANTED The morning after the children had been the possessors of boundless wealth and had been unable to buy anything really useful or enjoyable with it except two pairs of cotton gloves twelve penny buns an imitation crocodileskin purse and a ride in a ponycart they awoke without any of the enthusiastic happiness which they had felt on the previous day when they remembered how they had had the luck to find a Psammead or Sandfairy and to receive its promise to grant them a new wish every day
For now they had had two wishes Beauty and Wealth and neither had exactly made them happy
But the happening of strange things even if they are not completely pleasant things is more amusing than those times when nothing happens but meals and they are not always completely pleasant especially on the days when it is cold mutton or hash
There was no chance of talking things over before breakfast because everyone overslept itself as it happened and it needed a vigorous and determined struggle to get dressed so as to be only ten minutes late for breakfast
During this meal some efforts were made to deal with the question of the Psammead in an impartial spirit but it is very difficult to discuss anything thoroughly and at the same time to attend faithfully to your baby brothers breakfast needs
The Baby was particularly lively that morning
He not only wriggled his body through the bar of his high chair and hung by his head choking and purple but he collared a tablespoon with desperate suddenness hit Cyril heavily on the head with it and then cried because it was taken away from him
He put his fat fist in his breadandmilk and demanded nam which was only allowed for tea
He sang he put his feet on the table  he clamoured to go walky
The conversation was something like this Look here  about that Sandfairy  Look out
 hell have the milk over
Milk removed to a safe distance
Yes  about that Fairy  No Lamb dear give Panther the narky poon
Then Cyril tried
Nothing weve had yet has turned out  He nearly had the mustard that time
I wonder whether wed better wish  Hullo
youve done it now my boy
And in a flash of glass and pink babypaws the bowl of golden carp in the middle of the table rolled on its side and poured a flood of mixed water and goldfish into the Babys lap and into the laps of the others
Everyone was almost as much upset as the goldfish the Lamb only remaining calm
When the pool on the floor had been mopped up and the leaping gasping goldfish had been collected and put back in the water the Baby was taken away to be entirely redressed by Martha and most of the others had to change completely
The pinafores and jackets that had been bathed in goldfishandwater were hung out to dry and then it turned out that Jane must either mend the dress she had torn the day before or appear all day in her best petticoat
It was white and soft and frilly and trimmed with lace and very very pretty quite as pretty as a frock if not more so
Only it was NOT a frock and Marthas word was law
She wouldnt let Jane wear her best frock and she refused to listen for a moment to Roberts suggestion that Jane should wear her best petticoat and call it a dress
Its not respectable she said
And when people say that its no use anyones saying anything
You will find this out for yourselves some day
So there was nothing for it but for Jane to mend her frock
The hole had been torn the day before when she happened to tumble down in the High Street of Rochester just where a watercart had passed on its silvery way
She had grazed her knee and her stocking was much more than grazed and her dress was cut by the same stone which had attended to the knee and the stocking
Of course the others were not such sneaks as to abandon a comrade in misfortune so they all sat on the grassplot round the sundial and Jane darned away for dear life
The Lamb was still in the hands of Martha having its clothes changed so conversation was possible
Anthea and Robert timidly tried to conceal their inmost thought which was that the Psammead was not to be trusted but Cyril said Speak out  say what youve got to say  I hate hinting and dont know and sneakish ways like that
So then Robert said as in honour bound Sneak yourself  Anthea and me werent so goldfishy as you two were so we got changed quicker and weve had time to think it over and if you ask me  I didnt ask you said Jane biting off a needleful of thread as she had always been strictly forbidden to do
I dont care who asks or who doesnt said Robert but Anthea and I think the Sammyadd is a spiteful brute
If it can give us our wishes I suppose it can give itself its own and I feel almost sure it wishes every time that our wishes shant do us any good
Lets let the tiresome beast alone and just go and have a jolly good game of forts on our own in the chalkpit
You will remember that the happily situated house where these children were spending their holidays lay between a chalkquarry and a gravelpit
Cyril and Jane were more hopeful  they generally were
I dont think the Sammyadd does it on purpose Cyril said and after all it WAS silly to wish for boundless wealth
Fifty pounds in twoshilling pieces would have been much more sensible
And wishing to be beautiful as the day was simply donkeyish
I dont want to be disagreeable but it was
We must try to find a really useful wish and wish it
Jane dropped her work and said I think so too its too silly to have a chance like this and not use it
I never heard of anyone else outside a book who had such a chance there must be simply heaps of things we could wish for that wouldnt turn out Dead Sea fish like these two things have
Do lets think hard and wish something nice so that we can have a real jolly day  what there is left of it
Jane darned away again like mad for time was indeed getting on and everyone began to talk at once
If you had been there you could not possibly have made head or tail of the talk but these children were used to talking by fours as soldiers march and each of them could say what it had to say quite comfortably and listen to the agreeable sound of its own voice and at the same time have threequarters of two sharp ears to spare for listening to what the others said
That is an easy example in multiplication of vulgar fractions but as I daresay you cant do even that I wont ask you to tell me whether 34 X 2  1 12 but I will ask you to believe me that this was the amount of ear each child was able to lend to the others
Lending ears was common in Roman times as we learn from Shakespeare but I fear I am getting too instructive
When the frock was darned the start for the gravelpit was delayed by Marthas insisting on everybodys washing its hands  which was nonsense because nobody had been doing anything at all except Jane and how can you get dirty doing nothing
That is a difficult question and I cannot answer it on paper
In real life I could very soon show you  or you me which is much more likely
During the conversation in which the six ears were lent there were four children so THAT sum comes right it had been decided that fifty pounds in twoshilling pieces was the right wish to have
And the lucky children who could have anything in the wide world by just wishing for it hurriedly started for the gravelpit to express their wishes to the Psammead
Martha caught them at the gate and insisted on their taking the Baby with them
Not want him indeed
Why everybody ud want him a duck
with all their hearts they would and you know you promised your ma to take him out every blessed day said Martha
I know we did said Robert in gloom but I wish the Lamb wasnt quite so young and small
It would be much better fun taking him out
Hell mend of his youngness with time said Martha and as for his smallness I dont think youd fancy carrying of him any more however big he was
Besides he can walk a bit bless his precious fat legs a ducky
He feels the benefit of the newlaid air so he does a pet
With this and a kiss she plumped the Lamb into Antheas arms and went back to make new pinafores on the sewingmachine
She was a rapid performer on this instrument
The Lamb laughed with pleasure and said Walky wif Panty and rode on Roberts back with yells of joy and tried to feed Jane with stones and altogether made himself so agreeable that nobody could long be sorry that he was of the party
The enthusiastic Jane even suggested that they should devote a weeks wishes to assuring the Babys future by asking such gifts for him as the good fairies give to Infant Princes in proper fairytales but Anthea soberly reminded her that as the Sandfairys wishes only lasted till sunset they could not ensure any benefit to the Babys later years and Jane owned that it would be better to wish for fifty pounds in twoshilling pieces and buy the Lamb a threepoundfifteen rockinghorse like those in the Army and Navy Stores list with part of the money
It was settled that as soon as they had wished for the money and got it they would get Mr Crispin to drive them into Rochester again taking Martha with them if they could not get out of taking her
And they would make a list of the things they really wanted before they started
Full of high hopes and excellent resolutions they went round the safe slow cartroad to the gravelpits and as they went in between the mounds of gravel a sudden thought came to them and would have turned their ruddy cheeks pale if they had been children in a book
Being real live children it only made them stop and look at each other with rather blank and silly expressions
For now they remembered that yesterday when they had asked the Psammead for boundless wealth and it was getting ready to fill the quarry with the minted gold of bright guineas  millions of them  it had told the children to run along outside the quarry for fear they should be buried alive in the heavy splendid treasure
And they had run
And so it happened that they had not had time to mark the spot where the Psammead was with a ring of stones as before
And it was this thought that put such silly expressions on their faces
Never mind said the hopeful Jane well soon find him
But this though easily said was hard in the doing
They looked and they looked and though they found their seaside spades nowhere could they find the Sandfairy
At last they had to sit down and rest  not at all because they were weary or disheartened of course but because the Lamb insisted on being put down and you cannot look very carefully after anything you may have happened to lose in the sand if you have an active baby to look after at the same time
Get someone to drop your best knife in the sand next time you go to the seaside and then take your baby brother with you when you go to look for it and you will see that I am right
The Lamb as Martha had said was feeling the benefit of the country air and he was as frisky as a sandhopper
The elder ones longed to go on talking about the new wishes they would have when or if they found the Psammead again
But the Lamb wished to enjoy himself
He watched his opportunity and threw a handful of sand into Antheas face and then suddenly burrowed his own head in the sand and waved his fat legs in the air
Then of course the sand got into his eyes as it had into Antheas and he howled
The thoughtful Robert had brought one solid brown bottle of gingerbeer with him relying on a thirst that had never yet failed him
This had to be uncorked hurriedly  it was the only wet thing within reach and it was necessary to wash the sand out of the Lambs eyes somehow
Of course the ginger hurt horribly and he howled more than ever
And amid his anguish of kicking the bottle was upset and the beautiful gingerbeer frothed out into the sand and was lost for ever
It was then that Robert usually a very patient brother so far forgot himself as to say Anybody would want him indeed
Only they dont Martha doesnt not really or shed jolly well keep him with her
Hes a little nuisance thats what he is
Its too bad
I only wish everybody DID want him with all their hearts we might get some peace in our lives
The Lamb stopped howling now because Jane had suddenly remembered that there is only one safe way of taking things out of little childrens eyes and that is with your own soft wet tongue
It is quite easy if you love the Baby as much as you ought to
Then there was a little silence
Robert was not proud of himself for having been so cross and the others were not proud of him either
You often notice that sort of silence when someone has said something it ought not to  and everyone else holds its tongue and waits for the one who oughtnt to have said it is sorry
The silence was broken by a sigh  a breath suddenly let out
The childrens heads turned as if there had been a string tied to each nose and someone had pulled all the strings at once
And everyone saw the Sandfairy sitting quite close to them with the expression which it used as a smile on its hairy face
Goodmorning it said I did that quite easily
Everyone wants him now
It doesnt matter said Robert sulkily because he knew he had been behaving rather like a pig
No matter who wants him  theres no one here to  anyhow
Ingratitude said the Psammead is a dreadful vice
Were not ungratefulJane made haste to say but we didnt REALLY want that wish
Robert only just said it
Cant you take it back and give us a new one
No  I cant the Sandfairy said shortly chopping and changing  its not business
You ought to be careful what you do wish
There was a little boy once hed wished for a Plesiosaurus instead of an Ichthyosaurus because he was too lazy to remember the easy names of everyday things and his father had been very vexed with him and had made him go to bed before teatime and wouldnt let him go out in the nice flint boat along with the other children  it was the annual schooltreat next day  and he came and flung himself down near me on the morning of the treat and he kicked his little prehistoric legs about and said he wished he was dead
And of course then he was
How awful
said the children all together
Only till sunset of course the Psammead said still it was quite enough for his father and mother
And he caught it when he woke up  I can tell you
He didnt turn to stone  I forget why  but there must have been some reason
They didnt know being dead is only being asleep and youre bound to wake up somewhere or other either where you go to sleep or in some better place
You may be sure he caught it giving them such a turn
Why he wasnt allowed to taste Megatherium for a month after that
Nothing but oysters and periwinkles and common things like that
All the children were quite crushed by this terrible tale
They looked at the Psammead in horror
Suddenly the Lamb perceived that something brown and furry was near him
Poof poof poofy he said and made a grab
Its not a pussy Anthea was beginning when the Sandfairy leaped back
Oh my left whisker
it said dont let him touch me
Hes wet
Its fur stood on end with horror  and indeed a good deal of the gingerbeer had been spilt on the blue smock of the Lamb
The Psammead dug with its hands and feet and vanished in an instant and a whirl of sand
The children marked the spot with a ring of stones
We may as well get along home said Robert
Ill say Im sorry but anyway if its no good its no harm and we know where the sandy thing is for tomorrow
The others were noble
No one reproached Robert at all
Cyril picked up the Lamb who was now quite himself again and off they went by the safe cartroad
The cartroad from the gravelpits joins the road almost directly
At the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from Cyrils back to Roberts
And as they paused a very smart open carriage came in sight with a coachman and a groom on the box and inside the carriage a lady  very grand indeed with a dress all white lace and red ribbons and a parasol all red and white  and a white fluffy dog on her lap with a red ribbon round its neck
She looked at the children and particularly at the Baby and she smiled at him
The children were used to this for the Lamb was as all the servants said a very taking child
So they waved their hands politely to the lady and expected her to drive on
But she did not
Instead she made the coachman stop
And she beckoned to Cyril and when he went up to the carriage she said What a dear darling duck of a baby
Oh I SHOULD so like to adopt it
Do you think its mother would mind
Shed mind very much indeed said Anthea shortly
Oh but I should bring it up in luxury you know
I am Lady Chittenden
You must have seen my photograph in the illustrated papers
They call me a beauty you know but of course thats all nonsense
Anyway  She opened the carriage door and jumped out
She had the wonderfullest red highheeled shoes with silver buckles
Let me hold him a minute she said
And she took the Lamb and held him very awkwardly as if she was not used to babies
Then suddenly she jumped into the carriage with the Lamb in her arms and slammed the door and said Drive on
The Lamb roared the little white dog barked and the coachman hesitated
Drive on I tell you
cried the lady and the coachman did for as he said afterwards it was as much as his place was worth not to
The four children looked at each other and then with one accord they rushed after the carriage and held on behind
Down the dusty road went the smart carriage and after it at doublequick time ran the twinkling legs of the Lambs brothers and sisters
The Lamb howled louder and louder but presently his howls changed by slow degree to hiccupy gurgles and then all was still and they knew he had gone to sleep
The carriage went on and the eight feet that twinkled through the dust were growing quite stiff and tired before the carriage stopped at the lodge of a grand park
The children crouched down behind the carriage and the lady got out
She looked at the Baby as it lay on the carriage seat and hesitated
The darling  I wont disturb it she said and went into the lodge to talk to the woman there about a setting of Buff Orpington eggs that had not turned out well
The coachman and footman sprang from the box and bent over the sleeping Lamb
Fine boy  wish he was mine said the coachman
He wouldnt favour YOU much said the groom sourly too andsome
The coachman pretended not to hear
He said Wonder at her now  I do really
Hates kids
Got none of her own and cant abide other folkses
The children crouching in the white dust under the carriage exchanged uncomfortable glances
Tell you what the coachman went on firmly blowed if I dont hide the little nipper in the hedge and tell her his brothers took im
Then Ill come back for him afterwards
No you dont said the footman
Ive took to that kid so as never was
If anyones to have him its me  so there
Stow your gab
the coachman rejoined
You dont want no kids and if you did one kids the same as another to you
But Im a married man and a judge of breed
I knows a firstrate yearling when I sees him
Im agoin to ave him an least said soonest mended
I should a thought said the footman sneeringly youd amost enough
What with Alfred an Albert an Louise an Victor Stanley and Helena Beatrice and another  The coachman hit the footman in the chin  the foot man hit the coachman in the waistcoat  the next minute the two were fighting here and there in and out up and down and all over everywhere and the little dog jumped on the box of the carriage and began barking like mad
Cyril still crouching in the dust waddled on bent legs to the side of the carriage farthest from the battlefield
He unfastened the door of the carriage  the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel to notice anything  took the Lamb in his arms and still stooping carried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile led into a wood
The others followed and there among the hazels and young oaks and sweet chestnuts covered by high strongscented bracken they all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were hushed at the angry voice of the redandwhite lady and after a long and anxious search the carriage at last drove away
My only hat
said Cyril drawing a deep breath as the sound of wheels at last died away
Everyone DOES want him now  and no mistake
That Sammyadd has done us again
Tricky brute
For any sake lets get the kid safe home
So they peeped out and finding on the right hand only lonely white road and nothing but lonely white road on the left they took courage and the road Anthea carrying the sleeping Lamb
Adventures dogged their footsteps
A boy with a bundle of faggots on his back dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby and then offered to carry him but Anthea was not to be caught that way twice
They all walked on but the boy followed and Cyril and Robert couldnt make him go away till they had more than once invited him to smell their fists
Afterwards a little girl in a blueandwhite checked pinafore actually followed them for a quarter of a mile crying for the precious Baby and then she was only got rid of by threats of tying her to a tree in the wood with all their pockethandkerchiefs
So that the bears can come and eat you as soon as it gets dark said Cyril severely
Then she went off crying
It presently seemed wise to the brothers and sisters of the Baby who was wanted by everyone to hide in the hedge whenever they saw anyone coming and thus they managed to prevent the Lamb from arousing the inconvenient affection of a milkman a stonebreaker and a man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at the back of it
They were nearly home when the worst thing of all happened
Turning a corner suddenly they came upon two vans a tent and a company of gipsies encamped by the side of the road
The vans were hung all round with wicker chairs and cradles and flowerstands and feather brushes
A lot of ragged children were industriously making dustpies in the road two men lay on the grass smoking and three women were doing the family washing in an old red wateringcan with the top broken off
In a moment all the gipsies men women and children surrounded Anthea and the Baby
Let me hold him little lady said one of the gipsy women who had a mahoganycoloured face and dustcoloured hair I wont hurt a hair of his head the little picture
Id rather not said Anthea
Let me have him said the other woman whose face was also of the hue of mahogany and her hair jetblack in greasy curls
Ive nineteen of my own so I have
No said Anthea bravely but her heart beat so that it nearly choked her
Then one of the men pushed forward
Swelp me if it aint
he cried my own longlost cheild
Have he a strawberry mark on his left ear
No
Then hes my own babby stolen from me in hinnocent hinfancy
And im over  and well not ave the law on yer this time
He snatched the Baby from Anthea who turned scarlet and burst into tears of pure rage
The others were standing quite still this was much the most terrible thing that had ever happened to them
Even being taken up by the police in Rochester was nothing to this
Cyril was quite white and his hands trembled a little but he made a sign to the others to shut up
He was silent a minute thinking hard
Then he said We dont want to keep him if hes yours
But you see hes used to us
You shall have him if you want him
No no
cried Anthea  and Cyril glared at her
Of course we want him said the women trying to get the Baby out of the mans arms
The Lamb howled loudly
Oh hes hurt
shrieked Anthea and Cyril in a savage undertone bade her Stow it
You trust to me he whispered
Look here he went on hes awfully tiresome with people he doesnt know very well
Suppose we stay here a bit till he gets used to you and then when its bedtime I give you my word of honour well go away and let you keep him if you want to
And then when were gone you can decide which of you is to have him as you all want him so much
Thats fair enough said the man who was holding the Baby trying to loosen the red neckerchief which the Lamb had caught hold of and drawn round his mahogany throat so tight that he could hardly breathe
The gipsies whispered together and Cyril took the chance to whisper too
He said Sunset
well get away then
And then his brothers and sisters were filled with wonder and admiration at his having been so clever as to remember this
Oh do let him come to us
said Jane
See well sit down here and take care of him for you till he gets used to you
What about dinner
said Robert suddenly
The others looked at him with scorn
Fancy bothering about your beastly dinner when your br  I mean when the Baby  Jane whispered hotly
Robert carefully winked at her and went on You wont mind my just running home to get our dinner
he said to the gipsy I can bring it out here in a basket
His brother and sisters felt themselves very noble and despised him
They did not know his thoughtful secret intention
But the gipsies did in a minute
Oh yes
they said and then fetch the police with a pack of lies about it being your baby instead of ours
Djever catch a weasel asleep
they asked
If youre hungry you can pick a bit along of us said the lighthaired gipsy woman not unkindly
Here Levi that blessed kidll howl all his buttons off
Give him to the little lady and lets see if they cant get him used to us a bit
So the Lamb was handed back but the gipsies crowded so closely that he could not possibly stop howling
Then the man with the red handkerchief said Here Pharaoh make up the fire and you girls see to the pot
Give the kid a chanst
So the gipsies very much against their will went off to their work and the children and the Lamb were left sitting on the grass
Hell be all right at sunsetJane whispered
But oh it is awful
Suppose they are frightfully angry when they come to their senses
They might beat us or leave us tied to trees or something
No they wont Anthea said
Oh my Lamb dont cry any more its all right Pantys got oo duckie
They arent unkind people or they wouldnt be going to give us any dinner
Dinner
said Robert
I wont touch their nasty dinner
It would choke me
The others thought so too then
But when the dinner was ready  it turned out to be supper and happened between four and five  they were all glad enough to take what they could get
It was boiled rabbit with onions and some bird rather like a chicken but stringier about its legs and with a stronger taste
The Lamb had bread soaked in hot water and brown sugar sprinkled on the top
He liked this very much and consented to let the two gipsy women feed him with it as he sat on Antheas lap
All that long hot afternoon Robert and Cyril and Anthea and Jane had to keep the Lamb amused and happy while the gipsies looked eagerly on
By the time the shadows grew long and black across the meadows he had really taken to the woman with the light hair and even consented to kiss his hand to the children and to stand up and bow with his hand on his chest  like a gentleman  to the two men
The whole gipsy camp was in raptures with him and his brothers and sisters could not help taking some pleasure in showing off his accomplishments to an audience so interested and enthusiastic
But they longed for sunset
Were getting into the habit of longing for sunset Cyril whispered
How I do wish we could wish something really sensible that would be of some use so that we should be quite sorry when sunset came
The shadows got longer and longer and at last there were no separate shadows any more but one soft glowing shadow over everything for the sun was out of sight  behind the hill  but he had not really set yet
The people who make the laws about lighting bicycle lamps are the people who decide when the sun sets he has to do it too to the minute or they would know the reason why
But the gipsies were getting impatient
Now young uns the redhandkerchief man saidits time you were laying of your heads on your pillowses  so it is
The kids all right and friendly with us now  so you just hand him over and sling that hook o yours like you said
The women and children came crowding round the Lamb arms were held out fingers snapped invitingly friendly faces beaming with admiring smiles but all failed to tempt the loyal Lamb
He clung with arms and legs to Jane who happened to be holding him and uttered the gloomiest roar of the whole day
Its no good the woman said hand the little poppet over miss
Well soon quiet him
And still the sun would not set
Tell her about how to put him to bed whispered Cyril anything to gain time  and be ready to bolt when the sun really does make up its silly old mind to set
Yes Ill hand him over in just one minute Anthea began talking very fast  but do let me just tell you he has a warm bath every night and cold in the morning and he has a crockery rabbit to go into the warm bath with him and little Samuel saying his prayers in white china on a red cushion for the cold bath and if you let the soap get into his eyes the Lamb  Lamb kyes said he  he had stopped roaring to listen
The woman laughed
As if I hadnt never bathd a babby
she said
Come  give us a hold of him
Come to Melia my precious
Gway ugsie
replied the Lamb at once
Yes but Anthea went on about his meals you really MUST let me tell you he has an apple or a banana every morning and breadandmilk for breakfast and an egg for his tea sometimes and  Ive brought up ten said the blackringleted woman besides the others
Come miss and im over  I cant bear it no longer
I just must give him a hug
We aint settled yet whose hes to be Esther said one of the men
It wont be you Esther with seven of em at your tail aready
I aint so sure of that said Esthers husband
And aint I nobody to have a say neither
said the husband of Melia
Zillah the girl said An me
Im a single girl  and no one but im to look after  I ought to have him
Hold yer tongue
Shut your mouth
Dont you show me no more of your imperence
Everyone was getting very angry
The dark gipsy faces were frowning and anxiouslooking
Suddenly a change swept over them as if some invisible sponge had wiped away these cross and anxious expressions and left only a blank
The children saw that the sun really HAD set
But they were afraid to move
And the gipsies were feeling so muddled because of the invisible sponge that had washed all the feelings of the last few hours out of their hearts that they could not say a word
The children hardly dared to breathe
Suppose the gipsies when they recovered speech should be furious to think how silly they had been all day
It was an awkward moment
Suddenly Anthea greatly daring held out the Lamb to the redhandkerchief man
Here he is
she said
The man drew back
I shouldnt like to deprive you miss he said hoarsely
Anyone who likes can have my share of him said the other man
After all Ive got enough of my own said Esther
Hes a nice little chap though said Amelia
She was the only one who now looked affectionately at the whimpering Lamb
Zillah said If I dont think I must have had a touch of the sun
I dont want him
Then shall we take him away
said Anthea
Well suppose you do said Pharaoh heartily and well say no more about it
And with great haste all the gipsies began to be busy about their tents for the night
All but Amelia
She went with the children as far as the bend in the road  and there she said Let me give him a kiss miss  I dont know what made us go for to behave so silly
Us gipsies dont steal babies whatever they may tell you when youre naughty
Weve enough of our own mostly
But Ive lost all mine
She leaned towards the Lamb and he looking in her eyes unexpectedly put up a grubby soft paw and stroked her face
Poor poor
said the Lamb
And he let the gipsy woman kiss him and what is more he kissed her brown cheek in return  a very nice kiss as all his kisses are and not a wet one like some babies give
The gipsy woman moved her finger about on his forehead as if she had been writing something there and the same with his chest and his hands and his feet then she said May he be brave and have the strong head to think with and the strong heart to love with and the strong hands to work with and the strong feet to travel with and always come safe home to his own
Then she said something in a strange language no one could understand and suddenly added Well I must be saying so long  and glad to have made your acquaintance
And she turned and went back to her home  the tent by the grassy roadside
The children looked after her till she was out of sight
Then Robert said How silly of her
Even sunset didnt put her right
What rot she talked
Well said Cyril if you ask me I think it was rather decent of her  Decent
said Anthea it was very nice indeed of her
I think shes a dear
Shes just too frightfully nice for anything said Jane
And they went home  very late for tea and unspeakably late for dinner
Martha scolded of course
But the Lamb was safe
I say  it turned out we wanted the Lamb as much as anyone said Robert later
Of course
But do you feel different about it now the suns set
No said all the others together
Then its lasted over sunset with us
No it hasnt Cyril explained
The wish didnt do anything to US
We always wanted him with all our hearts when we were our proper selves only we were all pigs this morning especially you Robert
Robert bore this much with a strange calm
I certainly THOUGHT I didnt want him this morning said he
Perhaps I was a pig
But everything looked so different when we thought we were going to lose him
CHAPTER 4 WINGS The next day was very wet  too wet to go out and far too wet to think of disturbing a Sandfairy so sensitive to water that he still after thousands of years felt the pain of once having had his left whisker wetted
It was a long day and it was not till the afternoon that all the children suddenly decided to write letters to their mother
It was Robert who had the misfortune to upset the inkpot  an unusually deep and full one  straight into that part of Antheas desk where she had long pretended that an arrangement of gum and cardboard painted with Indian ink was a secret drawer
It was not exactly Roberts fault it was only his misfortune that he chanced to be lifting the ink across the desk just at the moment when Anthea had got it open and that that same moment should have been the one chosen by the Lamb to get under the table and break his squeaking bird
There was a sharp convenient wire inside the bird and of course the Lamb ran the wire into Roberts leg at once and so without anyones meaning to the secret drawer was flooded with ink
At the same time a stream was poured over Antheas halffinished letter
So that her letter was something like this DARLING MOTHER I hope you are quite well and I hope Granny is better
The other day we  Then came a flood of ink and at the bottom these words in pencil  It was not me upset the ink but it took such a time clearing up so no more as it is posttime
 From your loving daughter ANTHEA
Roberts letter had not even been begun
He had been drawing a ship on the blottingpaper while he was trying to think of what to say
And of course after the ink was upset he had to help Anthea to clean out her desk and he promised to make her another secret drawer better than the other
And she said Well make it now
So it was posttime and his letter wasnt done
And the secret drawer wasnt done either
Cyril wrote a long letter very fast and then went to set a trap for slugs that he had read about in the Homemade Gardener and when it was posttime the letter could not be found and it never was found
Perhaps the slugs ate it
janes letter was the only one that went
She meant to tell her mother all about the Psammead  in fact they had all meant to do this  but she spent so long thinking how to spell the word that there was no time to tell the story properly and it is useless to tell a story unless you do tell it properly so she had to be contented with this  MY DEAR MOTHER DEAR We are all as as good as we can like you told us to and the Lamb has a little cold but Martha says it is nothing only he upset the goldfish into himself yesterday morning
When we were up at the sandpit the other day we went round by the safe way where carts go and we found a  Half an hour went by before Jane felt quite sure that they could none of them spell Psammead
And they could not find it in the dictionary either though they looked
Then Jane hastily finished her letter
We found a strange thing but it is nearly posttime so no more at present from your little girl JANE
Ps
 If you could have a wish come true what would you have
Then the postman was heard blowing his horn and Robert rushed out in the rain to stop his cart and give him the letter
And that was how it happened that though all the children meant to tell their mother about the Sandfairy somehow or other she never got to know
There were other reasons why she never got to know but these come later
The next day Uncle Richard came and took them all to Maidstone in a wagonette  all except the Lamb
Uncle Richard was the very best kind of uncle
He bought them toys at Maidstone
He took them into a shop and let them choose exactly what they wanted without any restrictions about price and no nonsense about things being instructive
It is very wise to let children choose exactly what they like because they are very foolish and inexperienced and sometimes they will choose a really instructive thing without meaning to
This happened to Robert who chose at the last moment and in a great hurry a box with pictures on it of winged bulls with mens heads and winged men with eagles heads
He thought there would be animals inside the same as on the box
When he got it home it was a Sunday puzzle about ancient Nineveh
The others chose in haste and were happy at leisure
Cyril had a model engine and the girls had two dolls as well as a china teaset with forgetmenots on it to be between them
The boys between them was bow and arrows
Then Uncle Richard took them on the beautiful Medway in a boat and then they all had tea at a beautiful pastrycooks and when they reached home it was far too late to have any wishes that day
They did not tell Uncle Richard anything about the Psammead
I do not know why
And they do not know why
But I daresay you can guess
The day after Uncle Richard had behaved so handsomely was a very hot day indeed
The people who decide what the weather is to be and put its orders down for it in the newspapers every morning said afterwards that it was the hottest day there had been for years
They had ordered it to be warmer  some showers and warmer it certainly was
In fact it was so busy being warmer that it had no time to attend to the order about showers so there werent any
Have you ever been up at five oclock on a fine summer morning
It is very beautiful
The sunlight is pinky and yellowy and all the grass and trees are covered with dewdiamonds
And all the shadows go the opposite way to the way they do in the evening which is very interesting and makes you feel as though you were in a new other world
Anthea awoke at five
She had made herself wake and I must tell you how it is done even if it keeps you waiting for the story to go on
You get into bed at night and lie down quite flat on your little back with your hands straight down by your sides
Then you say I must wake up at five or six or seven or eight or nine or whatever the time is that you want and as you say it you push your chin down on to your chest and then bang your head back on the pillow
And you do this as many times as there are ones in the time you want to wake up at
It is quite an easy sum
Of course everything depends on your really wanting to get up at five or six or seven or eight or nine if you dont really want to its all of no use
But if you do  well try it and see
Of course in this as in doing Latin proses or getting into mischief practice makes perfect
Anthea was quite perfect
At the very moment when she opened her eyes she heard the blackandgold clock down in the diningroom strike eleven
So she knew it was three minutes to five
The blackandgold clock always struck wrong but it was all right when you knew what it meant
It was like a person talking a foreign language
If you know the language it is just as easy to understand as English
And Anthea knew the clock language
She was very sleepy but she jumped out of bed and put her face and hands into a basin of cold water
This is a fairy charm that prevents your wanting to get back into bed again
Then she dressed and folded up her nightgown
She did not tumble it together by the sleeves but folded it by the seams from the hem and that will show you the kind of wellbroughtup little girl she was
Then she took her shoes in her hand and crept softly down the stairs
She opened the diningroom window and climbed out
It would have been just as easy to go out by the door but the window was more romantic and less likely to be noticed by Martha
I will always get up at five she said to herself
It was quite too awfully pretty for anything
Her heart was beating very fast for she was carrying out a plan quite her own
She could not be sure that it was a good plan but she was quite sure that it would not be any better if she were to tell the others about it
And she had a feeling that right or wrong she would rather go through with it alone
She put on her shoes under the iron veranda on the redandyellow shining tiles and then she ran straight to the sandpit and found the Psammeads place and dug it out it was very cross indeed
Its too bad it said fluffing up its fur like pigeons do their feathers at Christmas time
The weathers arctic and its the middle of the night
Im so sorry said Anthea gently and she took off her white pinafore and covered the Sandfairy up with it all but its head its bats ears and its eyes that were like a snails eyes
Thank you it said thats better
Whats the wish this morning
I dont know said she thats just it
You see weve been very unlucky so far
I wanted to talk to you about it
But  would you mind not giving me any wishes till after breakfast
Its so hard to talk to anyone if they jump out at you with wishes you dont really want
You shouldnt say you wish for things if you dont wish for them
In the old days people almost always knew whether it was Megatherium or Ichthyosaurus they really wanted for dinner
Ill try not said Anthea but I do wish  Look out
said the Psammead in a warning voice and it began to blow itself out
Oh this isnt a magic wish  its just  I should be so glad if youd not swell yourself out and nearly burst to give me anything just now
Wait till the others are here
Well well it said indulgently but it shivered
Would you asked Anthea kindly  would you like to come and sit on my lap
Youd be warmer and I could turn the skirt of my frock up round you
Id be very careful
Anthea had never expected that it would but it did
Thank you it said you really are rather thoughtful
It crept on to her lap and snuggled down and she put her arms round it with a rather frightened gentleness
Now then
it said
Well then said Anthea everything we have wished has turned out rather horrid
I wish you would advise us
You are so old you must be very wise
I was always generous from a child said the Sandfairy
Ive spent the whole of my waking hours in giving
But one thing I wont give  thats advice
You see Anthea went on its such a wonderful thing  such a splendid glorious chance
Its so good and kind and dear of you to give us our wishes and it seems such a pity it should all be wasted just because we are too silly to know what to wish for
Anthea had meant to say that  and she had not wanted to say it before the others
Its one thing to say youre silly and quite another to say that other people are
Child said the Sandfairy sleepily I can only advise you to think before you speak  But I thought you never gave advice
That piece doesnt count it said
Youll never take it
Besides its not original
Its in all the copybooks
But wont you just say if you think wings would be a silly wish
Wings
it said
I should think you might do worse
Only take care you arent flying high at sunset
There was a little Ninevite boy I heard of once
He was one of King Sennacheribs sons and a traveller brought him a Psammead
He used to keep it in a box of sand on the palace terrace
It was a dreadful degradation for one of us of course still the boy was the Assyrian Kings son
And one day he wished for wings and got them
But he forgot that they would turn into stone at sunset and when they did he fell slap on to one of the winged lions at the top of his fathers great staircase and what with HIS stone wings and the lions stone wings  well its not a pretty story
But I believe the boy enjoyed himself very much till then
Tell me said Anthea why dont our wishes turn into stone now
Why do they just vanish
Autres temps autres moeurs said the creature
Is that the Ninevite language
asked Anthea who had learned no foreign language at school except French
What I mean is the Psammead went on that in the old days people wished for good solid everyday gifts  Mammoths and Pterodactyls and things  and those could be turned into stone as easy as not
But people wish such highflying fanciful things nowadays
How are you going to turn being beautiful as the day or being wanted by everybody into stone
You see it cant be done
And it would never do to have two rules so they simply vanish
If being beautiful as the day COULD be turned into stone it would last an awfully long time you know  much longer than you would
just look at the Greek statues
Its just as well as it is
Goodbye
I AM so sleepy
It jumped off her lap  dug frantically and vanished
Anthea was late for breakfast
It was Robert who quietly poured a spoonful of treacle down the Lambs frock so that he had to be taken away and washed thoroughly directly after breakfast
And it was of course a very naughty thing to do yet it served two purposes  it delighted the Lamb who loved above all things to be completely sticky and it engaged Marthas attention so that the others could slip away to the sandpit without the Lamb
They did it and in the lane Anthea breathless from the scurry of that slipping panted out  I want to propose we take turns to wish
Only nobodys to have a wish if the others dont think its a nice wish
Do you agree
Whos to have first wish
asked Robert cautiously
Me if you dont mind said Anthea apologetically
And Ive thought about it  and its wings
There was a silence
The others rather wanted to find fault but it was hard because the word wings raised a flutter of joyous excitement in every breast
Not so dusty said Cyril generously and Robert added Really Panther youre not quite such a fool as you look
Jane said I think it would be perfectly lovely
Its like a bright dream of delirium
They found the Sandfairy easily
Anthea said I wish we all had beautiful wings to fly with
The Sandfairy blew himself out and next moment each child felt a funny feeling half heaviness and half lightness on its shoulders
The Psammead put its head on one side and turned its snails eyes from one to the other
Not so dusty it said dreamily
But really Robert youre not quite such an angel as you look
Robert almost blushed
The wings were very big and more beautiful than you can possibly imagine  for they were soft and smooth and every feather lay neatly in its place
And the feathers were of the most lovely mixed changing colours like the rainbow or iridescent glass or the beautiful scum that sometimes floats on water that is not at all nice to drink
Oh  but can we fly
Jane said standing anxiously first on one foot and then on the other
Look out
said Cyril youre treading on my wing
Does it hurt
asked Anthea with interest but no one answered for Robert had spread his wings and jumped up and now he was slowly rising in the air
He looked very awkward in his knickerbocker suit  his boots in particular hung helplessly and seemed much larger than when he was standing in them
But the others cared but little how he looked  or how they looked for that matter
For now they all spread out their wings and rose in the air
Of course you all know what flying feels like because everyone has dreamed about flying and it seems so beautifully easy  only you can never remember how you did it and as a rule you have to do it without wings in your dreams which is more clever and uncommon but not so easy to remember the rule for
Now the four children rose flapping from the ground and you cant think how good the air felt running against their faces
Their wings were tremendously wide when they were spread out and they had to fly quite a long way apart so as not to get in each others way
But little things like this are easily learned
All the words in the English Dictionary and in the Greek Lexicon as well are I find of no use at all to tell you exactly what it feels like to be flying so I Will not try
But I will say that to look DOWN on the fields and woods instead of along at them is something like looking at a beautiful live map where instead of silly colours on paper you have real moving sunny woods and green fields laid out one after the other
As Cyril said and I cant think where he got hold of such a strange expression It does you a fair treat
It was most wonderful and more like real magic than any wish the children had had yet
They flapped and flew and sailed on their great rainbow wings between green earth and blue sky and they flew right over Rochester and then swerved round towards Maidstone and presently they all began to feel extremely hungry
Curiously enough this happened when they were flying rather low and just as they were crossing an orchard where some early plums shone red and ripe
They paused on their wings
I cannot explain to you how this is done but it is something like treading water when you are swimming and hawks do it extremely well
Yes I daresay said Cyril though no one had spoken
But stealing is stealing even if youve got wings
Do you really think so
said Jane briskly
If youve got wings youre a bird and no one minds birds breaking the commandments
At least they MAY mind but the birds always do it and no one scolds them or sends them to prison
It was not so easy to perch on a plumtree as you might think because the rainbow wings were so very large but somehow they all managed to do it and the plums were certainly very sweet and juicy
Fortunately it was not till they had all had quite as many plums as were good for them that they saw a stout man who looked exactly as though he owned the plumtrees come hurrying through the orchard gate with a thick stick and with one accord they disentangled their wings from the plumladen branches and began to fly
The man stopped short with his mouth open
For he had seen the boughs of his trees moving and twitching and he had said to himself The young varmints  at it again
And he had come out at once for the lads of the village had taught him in past seasons that plums want looking after
But when he saw the rainbow wings flutter up out of the plumtree he felt that he must have gone quite mad and he did not like the feeling at all
And when Anthea looked down and saw his mouth go slowly open and stay so and his face become green and mauve in patches she called out Dont be frightened and felt hastily in her pocket for a threepennybit with a hole in it which she had meant to hang on a ribbon round her neck for luck
She hovered round the unfortunate plumowner and said We have had some of your plums we thought it wasnt stealing but now I am not so sure
So heres some money to pay for them
She swooped down towards the terrorstricken grower of plums and slipped the coin into the pocket of his jacket and in a few flaps she had rejoined the others
The farmer sat down on the grass suddenly and heavily
Well  Im blessed
he said
This here is what they call delusions I suppose
But this here threepenny  he had pulled it out and bitten it  THATS real enough
Well from this day forth Ill be a better man
Its the kind of thing to sober a chap for life this is
Im glad it was only wings though
Id rather see birds as arent there and couldnt be even if they pretend to talk than some things as I could name
He got up slowly and heavily and went indoors and he was so nice to his wife that day that she felt quite happy and said to herself Law whatever have acome to the man
and smartened herself up and put a blue ribbon bow at the place where her collar fastened on and looked so pretty that he was kinder than ever
So perhaps the winged children really did do one good thing that day
If so it was the only one for really there is nothing like wings for getting you into trouble
But on the other hand if you arc in trouble there is nothing like wings for getting you out of it
This was the case in the matter of the fierce dog who sprang out at them when they had folded up their wings as small as possible and were going up to a farm door to ask for a crust of bread and cheese for in spite of the plums they were soon just as hungry as ever again
Now there is no doubt whatever that if the four had been ordinary wingless children that black and fierce dog would have had a good bite out of the brownstockinged leg of Robert who was the nearest
But at first growl there was a flutter of wings and the dog was left to strain at his chain and stand on his hindlegs as if he were trying to fly too
They tried several other farms but at those where there were no dogs the people were far too frightened to do anything but scream and at last when it was nearly four oclock and their wings were getting miserably stiff and tired they alighted on a churchtower and held a council of war
We cant possibly fly all the way home without dinner or tea said Robert with desperate decision
And nobody will give us any dinner or even lunch let alone tea said Cyril
Perhaps the clergyman here might suggested Anthea
He must know all about angels  Anybody could see were not that said Jane
Look at Roberts boots and Squirrels plaid necktie
Well said Cyril firmly if the country youre in wont SELL provisions you TAKE them
In wars I mean
Im quite certain you do
And even in other stories no good brother would allow his little sisters to starve in the midst of plenty
Plenty
repeated Robert hungrily and the others looked vaguely round the bare leads of the church tower and murmured In the midst of
Yes said Cyril impressively
There is a larder window at the side of the clergymans house and I saw things to eat inside  custard pudding and cold chicken and tongue  and pies  and jam
Its rather a high window  but with wings  How clever of you
said Jane
Not at all said Cyril modestly any born general  Napoleon or the Duke of Marlborough  would have seen it just the same as I did
It seems very wrong said Anthea
Nonsense said Cyril
What was it Sir Philip Sidney said when the soldier wouldnt stand him a drink
 My necessity is greater than his
Well club our money though and leave it to pay for the things wont we
Anthea was persuasive and very nearly in tears because it is most trying to feel enormously hungry and unspeakably sinful at one and the same time
Some of it was the cautious reply
Everyone now turned out its pockets on the lead roof of the tower where visitors for the last hundred and fifty years had cut their own and their sweethearts initials with penknives in the soft lead
There was fiveandsevenpencehalfpenny altogether and even the upright Anthea admitted that that was too much to pay for four peoples dinners
Robert said he thought eighteen pence
And halfacrown was finally agreed to be hand some
So Anthea wrote on the back of her last terms report which happened to be in her pocket and from which she first tore her own name and that of the school the following letter DEAR REVEREND CLERGYMAN We are very hungry indeed because of having to fly all day and we think it is not stealing when you are starving to death
We are afraid to ask you for fear you should say No because of course you know about angels but you would not think we were angels
We will only take the nessessities of life and no pudding or pie to show you it is not grediness but true starvation that makes us make your larder stand and deliver
But we are not highwaymen by trade
Cut it short said the others with one accord
And Anthea hastily added Our intentions are quite honourable if you only knew
And here is halfacrown to show we are sinseer and grateful
Thank you for your kind hospitality
FROM Us FOUR
The halfcrown was wrapped in this letter and all the children felt that when the clergyman had read it he would understand everything as well as anyone could who had not seen the wings
Now said Cyrilof course theres some risk wed better fly straight down the other side of the tower and then flutter low across the churchyard and in through the shrubbery
There doesnt seem to be anyone about
But you never know
The window looks out into the shrubbery
It is embowered in foliage like a window in a story
Ill go in and get the things
Robert and Anthea can take them as I hand them out through the window and Jane can keep watch  her eyes are sharp  and whistle if she sees anyone about
Shut up Robert
she can whistle quite well enough for that anyway
It ought not to be a very good whistle  itll sound more natural and birdlike
Now then  off we go
I cannot pretend that stealing is right
I can only say that on this occasion it did not look like stealing to the hungry four but appeared in the light of a fair and reasonable business transaction
They had never happened to learn that a tongue  hardly cut into  a chicken and a half a loaf of bread and a syphon of sodawater cannot be bought in shops for halfacrown
These were the necessaries of life which Cyril handed out of the larder window when quite unobserved and without hindrance or adventure he had led the others to that happy spot
He felt that to refrain from jam apple turnovers cake and mixed candied peel was a really heroic act  and I agree with him
He was also proud of not taking the custard pudding  and there I think he was wrong  because if he had taken it there would have been a difficulty about returning the dish no one however starving has a right to steal china piedishes with little pink flowers on them
The sodawater syphon was different
They could not do without something to drink and as the makers name was on it they felt sure it would be returned to him wherever they might leave it
If they had time they would take it back themselves
The man appeared to live in Rochester which would not be much out of their way home
Everything was carried up to the top of the tower and laid down on a sheet of kitchen paper which Cyril had found on the top shelf of the larder
As he unfolded it Anthea said I dont think THATS a necessity of life
Yes it is said he
We must put the things down somewhere to cut them up and I heard father say the other day people got diseases from germans in rainwater
Now there must be lots of rainwater here  and when it dries up the germans are left and theyd get into the things and we should all die of scarlet fever
What are germans
Little waggly things you see with microscopes said Cyril with a scientific air
They give you every illness you can think of
Im sure the paper was a necessary just as much as the bread and meat and water
Now then
Oh my eyes I am hungry
I do not wish to describe the picnic party on the top of the tower
You can imagine well enough what it is like to carve a chicken and a tongue with a knife that has only one blade  and that snapped off short about halfway down
But it was done
Eating with your fingers is greasy and difficult  and paper dishes soon get to look very spotty and horrid
But one thing you CANT imagine and that is how sodawater behaves when you try to drink it straight out of a syphon  especially a quite full one
But if imagination will not help you experience will and you can easily try it for yourself if you can get a grownup to give you the syphon
If you want to have a really thorough experience put the tube in your mouth and press the handle very suddenly and very hard
You had better do it when you are alone  and out of doors is best for this experiment
However you eat them tongue and chicken and new bread are very good things and no one minds being sprinkled a little with sodawater on a really fine hot day
So that everyone enjoyed the dinner very much indeed and everyone ate as much as it possibly could first because it was extremely hungry and secondly because as I said tongue and chicken and new bread are very nice
Now I daresay you will have noticed that if you have to wait for your dinner till long after the proper time and then eat a great deal more dinner than usual and sit in the hot sun on the top of a churchtower  or even anywhere else  you become soon and strangely sleepy
Now Anthea and Jane and Cyril and Robert were very like you in many ways and when they had eaten all they could and drunk all there was they became sleepy strangely and soon  especially Anthea because she had got up so early
One by one they left off talking and leaned back and before it was a quarter of an hour after dinner they had all curled round and tucked themselves up under their large soft warm wings and were fast asleep
And the sun was sinking slowly in the west
I must say it was in the west because it is usual in books to say so for fear careless people should think it was setting in the east
In point of fact it was not exactly in the west either  but thats near enough
The sun I repeat was sinking slowly in the west and the children slept warmly and happily on  for wings are cosier than eiderdown quilts to sleep under
The shadow of the churchtower fell across the churchyard and across the Vicarage and across the field beyond and presently there were no more shadows and the sun had set and the wings were gone
And still the children slept
But not for long
Twilight is very beautiful but it is chilly and you know however sleepy you are you wake up soon enough if your brother or sister happens to be up first and pulls your blankets off you
The four wingless children shivered and woke
And there they were  on the top of a churchtower in the dusky twilight with blue stars coming out by ones and twos and tens and twenties over their heads  miles away from home with threeandthreehalfpence in their pockets and a doubtful act about the necessities of life to be accounted for if anyone found them with the sodawater syphon
They looked at each other
Cyril spoke first picking up the syphon Wed better get along down and get rid of this beastly thing
Its dark enough to leave it on the clergymans doorstep I should think
Come on
There was a little turret at the corner of the tower and the little turret had a door in it
They had noticed this when they were eating but had not explored it as you would have done in their place
Because of course when you have wings and can explore the whole sky doors seem hardly worth exploring
Now they turned towards it
Of course said Cyril this is the way down
It was
But the door was locked on the inside
And the world was growing darker and darker
And they were miles from home
And there was the sodawater syphon
I shall not tell you whether anyone cried nor if so how many cried nor who cried
You will be better employed in making up your minds what you would have done if you had been in their place
CHAPTER 5 NO WINGS Whether anyone cried or not there was certainly an interval during which none of the party was quite itself
When they grew calmer Anthea put her handkerchief in her pocket and her arm round Jane and said It cant be for more than one night
We can signal with our handkerchiefs in the morning
Theyll be dry then
And someone will come up and let us out  And find the syphon said Cyril gloomily and we shall be sent to prison for stealing  You said it wasnt stealing
You said you were sure it wasnt
Im not sure NOW said Cyril shortly
Lets throw the beastly thing slap away among the trees said Robert then no one can do anything to us
Oh yes  Cyrils laugh was not a lighthearted one  and hit some chap on the head and be murderers as well as  as the other thing
But we cant stay up here all night said Jane and I want my tea
You CANT want your tea said Robert youve only just had your dinner
But I do want it she said especially when you begin talking about stopping up here all night
Oh Panther  I want to go home
I want to go home
Hush hush Anthea said
Dont dear
Itll be all right somehow
Dont dont  Let her cry said Robert desperately if she howls loud enough someone may hear and come and let us out
And see the sodawater thing said Anthea swiftly
Robert dont be a brute
Oh Jane do try to be a man
Its just the same for all of us
Jane did try to be a man  and reduced her howls to sniffs
There was a pause
Then Cyril said slowly Look here
We must risk that syphon
Ill button it up inside my jacket  perhaps no one will notice it
You others keep well in front of me
There are lights in the clergymans house
Theyve not gone to bed yet
We must just yell as loud as ever we can
Now all scream when I say three
Robert you do the yell like the railway engine and Ill do the cooee like fathers
The girls can do as they please
One two three
A fourfold yell rent the silent peace of the evening and a maid at one of the Vicarage windows paused with her hand on the blindcord
One two three
Another yell piercing and complex startled the owls and starlings to a flutter of feathers in the belfry below
The maid fled from the Vicarage window and ran down the Vicarage stairs and into the Vicarage kitchen and fainted as soon as she had explained to the manservant and the cook and the cooks cousin that she had seen a ghost
It was quite untrue of course but I suppose the girls nerves were a little upset by the yelling
One two three
The Vicar was on his doorstep by this time and there was no mistaking the yell that greeted him
Goodness me he said to his wife my dear someones being murdered in the church
Give me my hat and a thick stick and tell Andrew to come after me
I expect its the lunatic who stole the tongue
The children had seen the flash of light when the Vicar opened his front door
They had seen his dark form on the doorstep and they had paused for breath and also to see what he would do
When he turned back for his hat Cyril said hastily He thinks he only fancied he heard something
You dont half yell
Now
One two three
It was certainly a whole yell this time and the Vicars wife flung her arms round her husband and screamed a feeble echo of it
You shant go
she said not alone
Jessie
 the maid unfainted and came out of the kitchen  send Andrew at once
Theres a dangerous lunatic in the church and he must go immediately and catch it
I expect he WILL catch it too said Jessie to herself as she went through the kitchen door
Here Andrew she said theres someone screaming like mad in the church and the missus says youre to go along and catch it
Not alone I dont said Andrew in low firm tones
To his master he merely said Yes sir
You heard those screams
I did think I noticed a sort of something said Andrew
Well come on then said the Vicar
My dear I MUST go
He pushed her gently into the sittingroom banged the door and rushed out dragging Andrew by the arm
A volley of yells greeted them
As it died into silence Andrew shouted Hullo you there
Did you call
Yes shouted four faraway voices
They seem to be in the air said the Vicar
Very remarkable
Where are you
shouted Andrew and Cyril replied in his deepest voice very slow and loud CHURCH
TOWER
TOP
Come down then
said Andrew and the same voice replied CANT
DOOR LOCKED
My goodness
said the Vicar
Andrew fetch the stable lantern
Perhaps it would be as well to fetch another man from the village
With the rest of the gang about very likely
No sir if this ere aint a trap  well may I never
Theres cooks cousin at the back door now
Hes a keeper sir and used to dealing with vicious characters
And hes got his gun sir
Hullo there
shouted Cyril from the churchtower come up and let us out
Were acoming said Andrew
Im agoing to get a policeman and a gun
Andrew Andrew said the Vicar thats not the truth
Its near enough sir for the likes of them
So Andrew fetched the lantern and the cooks cousin and the Vicars wife begged them all to be very careful
They went across the churchyard  it was quite dark now  and as they went they talked
The Vicar was certain a lunatic was on the churchtower  the one who had written the mad letter and taken the cold tongue and things
Andrew thought it was a trap the cooks cousin alone was calm
Great cry little wool said he dangerous chaps is quieter
He was not at all afraid
But then he had a gun
That was why he was asked to lead the way up the worn steep dark steps of the churchtower
He did lead the way with the lantern in one hand and the gun in the other
Andrew went next
He pretended afterwards that this was because he was braver than his master but really it was because he thought of traps and he did not like the idea of being behind the others for fear someone should come soffly up behind him and catch hold of his legs in the dark
They went on and on and round and round the little corkscrew staircase  then through the bellringers loft where the bellropes hung with soft furry ends like giant caterpillars  then up another stair into the belfry where the big quiet bells are  and then on up a ladder with broad steps  and then up a little stone stair
And at the top of that there was a little door
And the door was bolted on the stair side
The cooks cousin who was a gamekeeper kicked at the door and said Hullo you there
The children were holding on to each other on the other side of the door and trembling with anxiousness  and very hoarse with their howls
They could hardly speak but Cyril managed to reply huskily Hullo you there
How did you get up there
It was no use saying We flew up so Cyril said We got up  and then we found the door was locked and we couldnt get down
Let us out  do
How many of you are there
asked the keeper
Only four said Cyril
Are you armed
Are we what
Ive got my gun handy  so youd best not try any tricks said the keeper
If we open the door will you promise to come quietly down and no nonsense
Yes  oh YES
said all the children together
Bless me said the Vicar surely that was a female voice
Shall I open the door Sir
said the keeper
Andrew went down a few steps to leave room for the others he said afterwards
Yes said the Vicar open the door
Remember he said through the keyhole we have come to release you
You will keep your promise to refrain from violence
How this bolt do stick said the keeper anyone ud think it hadnt been drawed for half a year
As a matter of fact it hadnt
When all the bolts were drawn the keeper spoke deepchested words through the keyhole
I dont open said he till youve gone over to the other side of the tower
And if one of you comes at me I fire
Now
Were all over on the other side said the voices
The keeper felt pleased with himself and owned himself a bold man when he threw open that door and stepping out into the leads flashed the full light of the stable lantern on to the group of desperadoes standing against the parapet on the other side of the tower
He lowered his gun and he nearly dropped the lantern
So help me he cried if they aint a pack of kiddies
The Vicar now advanced
How did you come here
he asked severely
Tell me at once 
Oh take us down said Jane catching at his coat and well tell you anything you like
You wont believe us but it doesnt matter
Oh take us down
The others crowded round him with the same entreaty
All but Cyril
He had enough to do with the sodawater syphon which would keep slipping down under his jacket
It needed both hands to keep it steady in its place
But he said standing as far out of the lantern light as possible Please do take us down
So they were taken down
It is no joke to go down a strange churchtower in the dark but the keeper helped them  only Cyril had to be independent because of the sodawater syphon
It would keep trying to get away
Halfway down the ladder it all but escaped
Cyril just caught it by its spout and as nearly as possible lost his footing
He was trembling and pale when at last they reached the bottom of the winding stair and stepped out on to the flags of the churchporch
Then suddenly the keeper caught Cyril and Robert each by an arm
You bring along the gells sir said he you and Andrew can manage them
Let go
said Cyril we arent running away
We havent hurt your old church
Leave go
You just come along said the keeper and Cyril dared not oppose him with violence because just then the syphon began to slip again
So they were all marched into the Vicarage study and the Vicars wife came rushing in
Oh William are you safe
she cried
Robert hastened to allay her anxiety
Yes he said hes quite safe
We havent hurt him at all
And please were very late and theyll be anxious at home
Could you send us home in your carriage
Or perhaps theres a hotel near where we could get a carriage from said Anthea
Martha will be very anxious as it is
The Vicar had sunk into a chair overcome by emotion and amazement
Cyril had also sat down and was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees because of that sodawater syphon
But how did you come to be locked up in the churchtower
asked the Vicar
We went up said Robert slowly and we were tired and we all went to sleep and when we woke up we found the door was locked so we yelled
I should think you did
said the Vicars wife
Frightening everybody out of their wits like this
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves
We are said Jane gently
But who locked the door
asked the Vicar
I dont know at all said Robert with perfect truth
Do please send us home
Well really said the Vicar I suppose wed better
Andrew put the horse to and you can take them home
Not alone I dont said Andrew to himself
And the Vicar went on let this be a lesson to you  He went on talking and the children listened miserably
But the keeper was not listening
He was looking at the unfortunate Cyril
He knew all about poachers of course so he knew how people look when theyre hiding something
The Vicar had just got to the part about trying to grow up to be a blessing to your parents and not a trouble and a disgrace when the keeper suddenly said Arst him what hes got there under his jacket and Cyril knew that concealment was at an end
So he stood up and squared his shoulders and tried to look noble like the boys in books that no one can look in the face of and doubt that they come of brave and noble families and will be faithful to the death and he pulled out the sodawater syphon and said Well there you are then
There was a silence
Cyril went on  there was nothing else for it Yes we took this out of your larder and some chicken and tongue and bread
We were very hungry and we didnt take the custard or jam
We only took bread and meat and water  and we couldnt help its being the soda kind just the necessaries of life and we left halfacrown to pay for it and we left a letter
And were very sorry
And my father will pay a fine or anything you like but dont send us to prison
Mother would be so vexed
You know what you said about not being a disgrace
Well dont you go and do it to us  thats all
Were as sorry as we can be
There
However did you get up to the larder window
said Mrs Vicar
I cant tell you that said Cyril firmly
Is this the whole truth youve been telling me
asked the clergyman
No answered Jane suddenly its all true but its not the whole truth
We cant tell you that
Its no good asking
Oh do forgive us and take us home
She ran to the Vicars wife and threw her arms round her
The Vicars wife put her arms round Jane and the keeper whispered behind his hand to the Vicar Theyre all right sir  I expect its a pal theyre standing by
Someone put em up to it and they wont peach
Game little kids
Tell me said the Vicar kindly are you screening someone else
Had anyone else anything to do with this
Yes said Anthea thinking of the Psammead but it wasnt their fault
Very well my dears said the Vicar then lets say no more about it
Only just tell us why you wrote such an odd letter
I dont know said Cyril
You see Anthea wrote it in such a hurry and it really didnt seem like stealing then
But afterwards when we found we couldnt get down off the churchtower it seemed just exactly like it
We are all very sorry  Say no more about it said the Vicars wife but another time just think before you take other peoples tongues
Now  some cake and milk before you go home
When Andrew came to say that the horse was put to and was he expected to be led alone into the trap that he had plainly seen from the first he found the children eating cake and drinking milk and laughing at the Vicars jokes
Jane was sitting on the Vicars wifes lap
So you see they got off better than they deserved
The gamekeeper who was the cooks cousin asked leave to drive home with them and Andrew was only too glad to have someone to protect him from the trap he was so certain of
When the wagonette reached their own house between the chalkquarry and the gravelpit the children were very sleepy but they felt that they and the keeper were friends for life
Andrew dumped the children down at the iron gate without a word
You get along home said the Vicarage cooks cousin who was a gamekeeper
Ill get me home on Shanks mare
So Andrew had to drive off alone which he did not like at all and it was the keeper that was cousin to the Vicarage cook who went with the children to the door and when they had been swept to bed in a whirlwind of reproaches remained to explain to Martha and the cook and the housemaid exactly what had happened
He explained so well that Martha was quite amiable the next morning
After that he often used to come over and see Martha and in the end  but that is another story as dear Mr Kipling says
Martha was obliged to stick to what she had said the night before about keeping the children indoors the next day for a punishment
But she wasnt at all snarky about it and agreed to let Robert go out for half an hour to get something he particularly wanted
This of course was the days wish
Robert rushed to the gravelpit found the Psammead and presently wished for  But that too is another story
CHAPTER 6 A CASTLE AND NO DINNER The others were to be kept in as a punishment for the misfortunes of the day before
Of course Martha thought it was naughtiness and not misfortune  so you must not blame her
She only thought she was doing her duty
You know grownup people often say they do not like to punish you and that they only do it for your own good and that it hurts them as much as it hurts you  and this is really very often the truth
Martha certainly hated having to punish the children quite as much as they hated to be punished
For one thing she knew what a noise there would be in the house all day
And she had other reasons
I declare she said to the cook it seems almost a shame keeping of them indoors this lovely day but they are that audacious theyll be walking in with their heads knocked off some of these days if I dont put my foot down
You make them a cake for tea tomorrow dear
And well have Baby along of us soon as weve got a bit forrard with our work
Then they can have a good romp with him out of the way
Now Eliza come get on with them beds
Heres ten oclock nearly and no rabbits caught
People say that in Kent when they mean and no work done
So all the others were kept in but Robert as I have said was allowed to go out for half an hour to get something they all wanted
And that of course was the days wish
He had no difficulty in finding the Sandfairy for the day was already so hot that it had actually for the first time come out of its own accord and it was sitting in a sort of pool of soft sand stretching itself and trimming its whiskers and turning its snails eyes round and round
Ha
it said when its left eye saw Robert Ive been looking out for you
Where are the rest of you
Not smashed themselves up with those wings I hope
No said Robert but the wings got us into a row just like all the wishes always do
So the others are kept indoors and I was only let out for halfanhour  to get the wish
So please let me wish as quickly as I can
Wish away said the Psammead twisting itself round in the sand
But Robert couldnt wish away
He forgot all the things he had been thinking about and nothing would come into his head but little things for himself like toffee a foreign stamp album or a clasp knife with three blades and a corkscrew
He sat down to think better but it was no use
He could only think of things the others would not have cared for  such as a football or a pair of legguards or to be able to lick Simpkins minor thoroughly when he went back to school
Well said the Psammead at last youd better hurry up with that wish of yours
Time flies
I know it does said Robert
I cant think what to wish for
I wish you could give one of the others their wish without their having to come here to ask for it
Oh DONT
But it was too late
The Psammead had blown itself out to about three times its proper size and now it collapsed like a pricked bubble and with a deep sigh leaned back against the edge of its sandpool quite faint with the effort
There
it said in a weak voice it was tremendously hard  but I did it
Run along home or theyre sure to wish for something silly before you get there
They were  quite sure Robert felt this and as he ran home his mind was deeply occupied with the sort of wishes he might find they had wished in his absence
They might wish for rabbits or white mice or chocolate or a fine day tomorrow or even  and that was most likely  someone might have said I do wish to goodness Robert would hurry up
Well he WAS hurrying up and so they would have their wish and the day would be wasted
Then he tried to think what they could wish for  something that would be amusing indoors
That had been his own difficulty from the beginning
So few things are amusing indoors when the sun is shining outside and you maynt go out however much you want to
Robert was running as fast as he could but when he turned the corner that ought to have brought him within sight of the architects nightmare  the ornamental ironwork on the top of the house  he opened his eyes so wide that he had to drop into a walk for you cannot run with your eyes wide open
Then suddenly he stopped short for there was no house to be seen
The frontgarden railings were gone too and where the house had stood  Robert rubbed his eyes and looked again
Yes the others HAD wished  there was no doubt about that  and they must have wished that they lived in a castle for there the castle stood black and stately and very tall and broad with battlements and lancet windows and eight great towers and where the garden and the orchard had been there were white things dotted like mushrooms
Robert walked slowly on and as he got nearer he saw that these were tents and men in armour were walking about among the tents  crowds and crowds of them
Oh crikey
said Robert fervently
They HAVE
Theyve wished for a castle and its being besieged
Its just like that Sandfairy
I wish wed never seen the beastly thing
At the little window above the great gateway across the moat that now lay where the garden had been but half an hour ago someone was waving something pale dustcoloured
Robert thought it was one of Cyrils handkerchiefs
They had never been white since the day when he had upset the bottle of Combined Toning and Fixing Solution into the drawer where they were
Robert waved back and immediately felt that he had been unwise
For his signal had been seen by the besieging force and two men in steelcaps were coming towards him
They had high brown boots on their long legs and they came towards him with such great strides that Robert remembered the shortness of his own legs and did not run away
He knew it would be useless to himself and he feared it might be irritating to the foe
So he stood still and the two men seemed quite pleased with him
By my halidom said one a brave varlet this
Robert felt pleased at being CALLED brave and somehow it made him FEEL brave
He passed over the varlet
It was the way people talked in historical romances for the young he knew and it was evidently not meant for rudeness
He only hoped he would be able to understand what they said to him
He had not always been able quite to follow the conversations in the historical romances for the young
His garb is strange said the other
Some outlandish treachery belike
Say lad what brings thee hither
Robert knew this meant Now then youngster what are you up to here eh
 so he said If you please I want to go home
Go then
said the man in the longest boots none hindereth and nought lets us to follow
Zooks
he added in a cautious undertone I misdoubt me but he beareth tidings to the besieged
Where dwellest thou young knave
inquired the man with the largest steelcap
Over there said Robert and directly he had said it he knew he ought to have said Yonder
Ha  sayest so
rejoined the longest boots
Come hither boy
This is a matter for our leader
And to the leader Robert was dragged forthwith  by the reluctant ear
The leader was the most glorious creature Robert had ever seen
He was exactly like the pictures Robert had so often admired in the historical romances
He had armour and a helmet and a horse and a crest and feathers and a shield and a lance and a sword
His armour and his weapons were all I am almost sure of quite different periods
The shield was thirteenthcentury while the sword was of the pattern used in the Peninsular War
The cuirass was of the time of Charles I and the helmet dated from the Second Crusade
The arms on the shield were very grand  three red running lions on a blue ground
The tents were of the latest brand and the whole appearance of camp army and leader might have been a shock to some
But Robert was dumb with admiration and it all seemed to him perfectly correct because he knew no more of heraldry or archaeology than the gifted artists who usually drew the pictures for the historical romances
The scene was indeed exactly like a picture
He admired it all so much that he felt braver than ever
Come hither lad said the glorious leader when the men in Cromwellian steelcaps had said a few low eager words
And he took off his helmet because he could not see properly with it on
He had a kind face and long fair hair
Have no fear thou shalt take no scathe he said
Robert was glad of that
He wondered what scathe was and if it was nastier than the senna tea which he had to take sometimes
Unfold thy tale without alarm said the leader kindly
Whence comest thou and what is thine intent
My what
said Robert
What seekest thou to accomplish
What is thine errand that thou wanderest here alone among these rough menatarms
Poor child thy mothers heart aches for thee een now Ill warrant me
I dont think so said Robert you see she doesnt know Im out
The leader wiped away a manly tear exactly as a leader in a historical romance would have done and said Fear not to speak the truth my child thou hast nought to fear from Wulfric de Talbot
Robert had a wild feeling that this glorious leader of the besieging party  being himself part of a wish  would be able to understand better than Martha or the gipsies or the policeman in Rochester or the clergyman of yesterday the true tale of the wishes and the Psammead
The only difficulty was that he knew he could never remember enough quothas and beshrew mes and things like that to make his talk sound like the talk of a boy in a historical romance
However he began boldly enough with a sentence straight out of Ralph de Courcy or The Boy Crusader
He said Grammercy for thy courtesy fair sir knight
The fact is its like this  and I hope youre not in a hurry because the storys rather a breather
Father and mother are away and when we were down playing in the sandpits we found a Psammead
I cry thee mercy
A Sammyadd
said the knight
Yes a sort of  of fairy or enchanter  yes thats it an enchanter and he said we could have a wish every day and we wished first to be beautiful
Thy wish was scarce granted muttered one of the menatarms looking at Robert who went on as if he had not heard though he thought the remark very rude indeed
And then we wished for money  treasure you know but we couldnt spend it
And yesterday we wished for wings and we got them and we had a ripping time to begin with  Thy speech is strange and uncouth said Sir Wulfric de Talbot
Repeat thy words  what hadst thou
A ripping  I mean a jolly  no  we were contented with our lot  thats what I mean only after that we got into an awful fix
What is a fix
A fray mayhap
No  not a fray
A  a  a tight place
A dungeon
Alas for thy youthful fettered limbs
said the knight with polite sympathy
It wasnt a dungeon
We just  just encountered undeserved misfortunes Robert explained and today we are punished by not being allowed to go out
Thats where I live  he pointed to the castle
The others are in there and theyre not allowed to go out
Its all the Psammeads  I mean the enchanters fault
I wish wed never seen him
He is an enchanter of might
Oh yes  of might and main
Rather
And thou deemest that it is the spells of the enchanter whom thou hast angered that have lent strength to the besieging party said the gallant leader but know thou that Wulfric de Talbot needs no enchanters aid to lead his followers to victory
No Im sure you dont said Robert with hasty courtesy of course not  you wouldnt you know
But all the same its partly his fault but were most to blame
You couldnt have done anything if it hadnt been for us
How now bold boy
asked Sir Wulfric haughtily
Thy speech is dark and eke scarce courteous
Unravel me this riddle
Oh said Robert desperately of course you dont know it but youre not REAL at all
Youre only here because the others must have been idiots enough to wish for a castle  and when the sun sets youll just vanish away and itll be all right
The captain and the menatarms exchanged glances at first pitying and then sterner as the longestbooted man said Beware noble my lord the urchin doth but feign madness to escape from our clutches
Shall we not bind him
Im no more mad than you are said Robert angrily perhaps not so much  only I was an idiot to think youd understand anything
Let me go  I havent done anything to you
Whither
asked the knight who seemed to have believed all the enchanter story till it came to his own share in it
Whither wouldst thou wend
Home of course
Robert pointed to the castle
To carry news of succour
Nay
All right then said Robert struck by a sudden idea then let me go somewhere else
His mind sought eagerly among his memories of the historical romance
Sir Wulfric de Talbot he said slowly should think foul scorn to  to keep a chap  I mean one who has done him no hurt  when he wants to cut off quietly  I mean to depart without violence
This to my face
Beshrew thee for a knave
replied Sir Wulfric
But the appeal seemed to have gone home
Yet thou sayest sooth he added thoughtfully
Go where thou wilt he added nobly thou art free
Wulfric de Talbot warreth not with babes and Jakin here shall bear thee company
All right said Robert wildly
Jakin will enjoy himself I think
Come on Jakin
Sir Wulfric I salute thee
He saluted after the modern military manner and set off running to the sandpit Jakins long boots keeping up easily
He found the Fairy
He dug it up he woke it up he implored it to give him one more wish
Ive done two today already it grumbled and one was as stiff a bit of work as ever I did
Oh do do do do DO
said Robert while Jakin looked on with an expression of openmouthed horror at the strange beast that talked and gazed with its snails eyes at him
Well what is it
snapped the Psammead with cross sleepiness
I wish I was with the others said Robert
And the Psammead began to swell
Robert never thought of wishing the castle and the siege away
Of course he knew they had all come out of a wish but swords and daggers and pikes and lances seemed much too real to be wished away
Robert lost consciousness for an instant
When he opened his eyes the others were crowding round him
We never heard you come in they said
How awfully jolly of you to wish it to give us our wish
Of course we understood that was what youd done
But you ought to have told us
Suppose wed wished something silly
Silly
said Robert very crossly indeed
How much sillier could you have been Id like to know
You nearly settled ME  I can tell you
Then he told his story and the others admitted that it certainly had been rough on him
But they praised his courage and cleverness so much that he presently got back his lost temper and felt braver than ever and consented to be captain of the besieged force
We havent done anything yet said Anthea comfortably we waited for you
Were going to shoot at them through these little loopholes with the bow and arrows uncle gave you and you shall have first shot
I dont think I would said Robert cautiously you dont know what theyre like near to
Theyve got REAL bows and arrows  an awful length  and swords and pikes and daggers and all sorts of sharp things
Theyre all quite quite real
Its not just a  a picture or a vision or anything they can hurt us  or kill us even I shouldnt wonder
I can feel my ear all sore still
Look here  have you explored the castle
Because I think wed better let them alone as long as they let us alone
I heard that Jakin man say they werent going to attack till just before sundown
We can be getting ready for the attack
Are there any soldiers in the castle to defend it
We dont know said Cyril
You see directly Id wished we were in a besieged castle everything seemed to go upside down andwhen it came straight we looked out of the window and saw the camp and things and you  and of course we kept on looking at everything
Isnt this room jolly
Its as real as real
It was
It was square with stone walls four feet thick and great beams for ceiling
A low door at the corner led to a flight of steps up and down
The children went down they found themselves in a great arched gatehouse  the enormous doors were shut and barred
There was a window in a little room at the bottom of the round turret up which the stair wound rather larger than the other windows and looking through it they saw that the drawbridge was up and the portcullis down the moat looked very wide and deep
Opposite the great door that led to the moat was another great door with a little door in it
The children went through this and found themselves in a big paved courtyard with the great grey walls of the castle rising dark and heavy on all four sides
Near the middle of the courtyard stood Martha moving her right hand backwards and forwards in the air
The cook was stooping down and moving her hands also in a very curious way
But
the oddest and at the same time most terrible thing was the Lamb who was sitting on nothing about three feet from the ground laughing happily
The children ran towards him
Just as Anthea was reaching out her arms to take him Martha said crossly Let him alone  do miss when he is good
But whats he DOING
said Anthea
Doing
Why asetting in his high chair as good as gold a precious watching me doing of the ironing
Get along with you do  my irons cold again
She went towards the cook and seemed to poke an invisible fire with an unseen poker  the cook seemed to be putting an unseen dish into an invisible oven
Run along with you do she said Im behindhand as it is
You wont get no dinner if you come ahindering of me like this
Come off you goes or Ill pin a dishcloth to some of your tails
Youre sure the Lambs all right
asked Jane anxiously
Right as ninepence if you dont come unsettling of him
I thought youd like to be rid of him for today but take him if you want him for gracious sake
No no they said and hastened away
They would have to defend the castle presently and the Lamb was safer even suspended in midair in an invisible kitchen than in the guardroom of a besieged castle
They went through the first doorway they came to and sat down helplessly on a wooden bench that ran along the room inside
How awful
said Anthea and Jane together and Jane added I feel as if I was in a mad asylum
What does it mean
Anthea said
Its creepy I dont like it
I wish wed wished for something plain  a rockinghorse or a donkey or something
Its no use wishing NOW said Robert bitterly and Cyril said Do dry up a sec I want to think
He buried his face in his hands and the others looked about them
They were in a long room with an arched roof
There were wooden tables along it and one across at the end of the room on a sort of raised platform
The room was very dim and dark
The floor was strewn with dry things like sticks and they did not smell nice
Cyril sat up suddenly and said Look here  its all right
I think its like this
You know we wished that the servants shouldnt notice any difference when we got wishes
And nothing happens to the Lamb unless we specially wish it to
So of course they dont notice the castle or anything
But then the castle is on the same place where our house was  is I mean  and the servants have to go on being in the house or else they would notice
But you cant have a castle mixed up with our house  and so we cant see the house because we see the castle and they cant see the castle because they go on seeing the house and so  Oh DONT
said Jane you make my head go all swimmy like being on a roundabout
It doesnt matter
Only I hope we shall be able to see our dinner thats all  because if its invisible itll be unfeelable as well and then we cant eat it
I KNOW it will because I tried to feel if I could feel the Lambs chair and there was nothing under him at all but air
And we cant eat air and I feel just as if I hadnt had any breakfast for years and years
Its no use thinking about it said Anthea
Lets go on exploring
Perhaps we might find something to eat
This lighted hope in every breast and they went on exploring the castle
But though it was the most perfect and delightful castle you can possibly imagine and furnished in the most complete and beautiful manner neither food nor menatarms were to be found in it
If only youd thought of wishing to be besieged in a castle thoroughly garrisoned and provisioned
said Jane reproachfully
You cant think of everything you know said Anthea
I should think it must be nearly dinnertime by now
It wasnt but they hung about watching the strange movements of the servants in the middle of the courtyard because of course they couldnt be sure where the diningroom of the invisible house was
Presently they saw Martha carrying an invisible tray across the courtyard for it seemed that by the most fortunate accident the diningroom of the house and the banquetinghall of the castle were in the same place
But oh how their hearts sank when they perceived that the tray was invisible
They waited in wretched silence while Martha went through the form of carving an unseen leg of mutton and serving invisible greens and potatoes with a spoon that no one could see
When she had left the room the children looked at the empty table and then at each other
This is worse than anything said Robert who had not till now been particularly keen on his dinner
Im not so very hungry said Anthea trying to make the best of things as usual
Cyril tightened his belt ostentatiously
Jane burst into tears
CHAPTER 7 A SIEGE AND BED The children were sitting in the gloomy banquetinghall at the end of one of the long bare wooden tables
There was now no hope
Martha had brought in the dinner and the dinner was invisible and unfeelable too for when they rubbed their hands along the table they knew but too well that for them there was nothing there BUT table
Suddenly Cyril felt in his pocket
Right oh
he cried
Look here
Biscuits
Rather broken and crumbled certainly but still biscuits
Three whole ones and a generous handful of crumbs and fragments
I got them this morning  cook  and Id quite forgotten he explained as he divided them with scrupulous fairness into four heaps
They were eaten in a happy silence though they tasted a little oddly because they had been in Cyrils pocket all the morning with a hank of tarred twine some green fircones and a ball of cobblers wax
Yes but look here Squirrel said Robert youre so clever at explaining about invisibleness and all that
How is it the biscuits are here and all the bread and meat and things have disappeared
I dont know said Cyril after a pause unless its because WE had them
Nothing about us has changed
Everythings in my pocket all right
Then if we HAD the mutton it would be real said Robert
Oh dont I wish we could find it
But we cant find it
I suppose it isnt ours till weve got it in our mouths
Or in our pockets said Jane thinking of the biscuits
Who puts mutton in their pockets goosegirl
said Cyril
But I know  at any rate Ill try it
He leaned over the table with his face about an inch from it and kept opening and shutting his mouth as if he were taking bites out of air
Its no good said Robert in deep dejection
Youll only  Hullo
Cyril stood up with a grin of triumph holding a square piece of bread in his mouth
It was quite real
Everyone saw it
It is true that directly he bit a piece off the rest vanished but it was all right because he knew he had it in his hand though he could neither see nor feel it
He took another bite from the air between his fingers and it turned into bread as he bit
The next moment all the others were following his example and opening and shutting their mouths an inch or so from the barelooking table
Robert captured a slice of mutton and  but I think I will draw a veil over the rest of this painful scene
It is enough to say that they all had enough mutton and that when Martha came to change the plates she said she had never seen such a mess in all her born days
The pudding was fortunately a plain suet rolypoly and in answer to Marthas questions the children all with one accord said that they would NOT have treacle on it  nor jam nor sugar  Just plain please they said
Martha said Well I never  what next I wonder
and went away
Then ensued another scene on which I will not dwell for nobody looks nice picking up slices of suet pudding from the table in its mouth like a dog
The great thing after all was that they had had dinner and now everyone felt more courage to prepare for the attack that was to be delivered before sunset
Robert as captain insisted on climbing to the top of one of the towers to reconnoitre so up they all went
And now they could see all round the castle and could see too that beyond the moat on every side the tents of the besieging party were pitched
Rather uncomfortable shivers ran down the childrens backs as they saw that all the men were very busy cleaning or sharpening their arms restringing their bows and polishing their shields
A large party came along the road with horses dragging along the great trunk of a tree and Cyril felt quite pale because he knew this was for a batteringram
What a good thing weve got a moat he said and what a good thing the drawbridge is up  I should never have known how to work it
Of course it would be up in a besieged castle
Youd think there ought to have been soldiers in it wouldnt you
said Robert
You see you dont know how long its been besieged said Cyril darkly perhaps most of the brave defenders were killed quite early in the siege and all the provisions eaten and now there are only a few intrepid survivors  thats us and we are going to defend it to the death
How do you begin  defending to the death I mean
asked Anthea
We ought to be heavily armed  and then shoot at them when they advance to the attack
They used to pour boiling lead down on besiegers when they got too close said Anthea
Father showed me the holes on purpose for pouring it down through at Bodiam Castle
And there are holes like it in the gatetower here
I think Im glad its only a game it IS only a game isnt it
said Jane
But no one answered
The children found plenty of strange weapons in the castle and if they were armed at all it was soon plain that they would be as Cyril said armed heavily  for these swords and lances and crossbows were far too weighty even for Cyrils manly strength and as for the longbows none of the children could even begin to bend them
The daggers were better but Jane hoped that the besiegers would not come close enough for daggers to be of any use
Never mind we can hurl them like javelins said Cyril or drop them on peoples heads
I say  there are lots of stones on the other side of the courtyard
If we took some of those up just to drop on their heads if they were to try swimming the moat
So a heap of stones grew apace up in the room above the gate and another heap a shiny spiky dangerouslooking heap of daggers and knives
As Anthea was crossing the courtyard for more stones a sudden and valuable idea came to her
She went to Martha and said May we have just biscuits for tea
Were going to play at besieged castles and wed like the biscuits to provision the garrison
Put mine in my pocket please my hands are so dirty
And Ill tell the others to fetch theirs
This was indeed a happy thought for now with four generous handfuls of air which turned to biscuit as Martha crammed it into their pockets the garrison was well provisioned till sundown
They brought up some iron pots of cold water to pour on the besiegers instead of hot lead with which the castle did not seem to be provided
The afternoon passed with wonderful quickness
It was very exciting but none of them except Robert could feel all the time that this was real deadly dangerous work
To the others who had only seen the camp and the besiegers from a distance the whole thing seemed half a game of makebelieve and half a splendidly distinct and perfectly safe dream
But it was only now and then that Robert could feel this
When it seemed to be teatime the biscuits were eaten with water from the deep well in the courtyard drunk out of horns
Cyril insisted on putting by eight of the biscuits in case anyone should feel faint in stress of battle
just as he was putting away the reserve biscuits in a sort of little stone cupboard without a door a sudden sound made him drop three
It was the loud fierce cry of a trumpet
You see it IS real said Robert and they are going to attack
All rushed to the narrow windows
Yes said Robert theyre all coming out of their tents and moving about like ants
Theres that Jakin dancing about where the bridge joins on
I wish he could see me put my tongue out at him
Yah
The others were far too pale to wish to put their tongues out at anybody
They looked at Robert with surprised respect
Anthea said You really ARE brave Robert
Rot
Cyrils pallor turned to redness now all in a minute
Hes been getting ready to be brave all the afternoon
And I wasnt ready thats all
I shall be braver than he is in half a jiffy
Oh dear
said Jane what does it matter which of you is the bravest
I think Cyril was a perfect silly to wish for a castle and I dont want to play
It ISNT  Robert was beginning sternly but Anthea interrupted  Oh yes you do she said coaxingly its a very nice game really because they cant possibly get in and if they do the women and children are always spared by civilized armies
But are you quite quite sure they ARE civilized
asked Jane panting
They seem to be such a long time ago
Of course they are
Anthea pointed cheerfully through the narrow window
Why look at the little flags on their lances how bright they are  and how fine the leader is
Look thats him  isnt it Robert
 on the grey horse
Jane consented to look and the scene was almost too pretty to be alarming
The green turf the white tents the flash of pennoned lances the gleam of armour and the bright colours of scarf and tunic  it was just like a splendid coloured picture
The trumpets were sounding and when the trumpets stopped for breath the children could hear the clingclang of armour and the murmur of voices
A trumpeter came forward to the edge of the moat which now seemed very much narrower than at first and blew the longest and loudest blast they had yet heard
When the blaring noise had died away a man who was with the trumpeter shouted What ho within there
and his voice came plainly to the garrison in the gatehouse
Hullo there
Robert bellowed back at once
In the name of our Lord the King and of our good lord and trusty leader Sir Wulfric de Talbot we summon this castle to surrender  on pain of fire and sword and no quarter
Do ye surrender
No bawled Robert of course we dont
Never Never NEVER
The man answered back Then your fate be on your own heads
Cheer said Robert in a fierce whisper
Cheer to show them we arent afraid and rattle the daggers to make more noise
One two three
Hip hip hooray
Again  Hip hip hooray
One more  Hip hip hooray
The cheers were rather high and weak but the rattle of the daggers lent them strength and depth
There was another shout from the camp across the moat  and then the beleaguered fortress felt that the attack had indeed begun
It was getting rather dark in the room above the great gate and Jane took a very little courage as she remembered that sunset couldnt be far off now
The moat is dreadfully thin said Anthea
But they cant get into the castle even if they do swim over said Robert
And as he spoke he heard feet on the stair outside  heavy feet and the clank of steel
No one breathed for a moment
The steel and the feet went on up the turret stairs
Then Robert sprang softly to the door
He pulled off his shoes
Wait here he whispered and stole quickly and softly after the boots and the spurclank
He peeped into the upper room
The man was there  and it was Jakin all dripping with moatwater and he was fiddling about with the machinery which Robert felt sure worked the drawbridge
Robert banged the door suddenly and turned the great key in the lock just as Jakin sprang to the inside of the door
Then he tore downstairs and into the little turret at the foot of the tower where the biggest window was
We ought to have defended THIS
he cried to the others as they followed him
He was just in time
Another man had swum over and his fingers were on the windowledge
Robert never knew how the man had managed to climb up out of the water
But he saw the clinging fingers and hit them as hard as he could with an iron bar that he caught up from the floor
The man fell with a plopplash into the moatwater
In another moment Robert was outside the little room had banged its door and was shooting home the enormous bolts and calling to Cyril to lend a hand
Then they stood in the arched gatehouse breathing hard and looking at each other
janes mouth was open
Cheer up jenny said Robert  it wont last much longer
There was a creaking above and something rattled and shook
The pavement they stood on seemed to tremble
Then a crash told them that the drawbridge had been lowered to its place
Thats that beast Jakin said Robert
Theres still the portcullis Im almost certain thats worked from lower down
And now the drawbridge rang and echoed hollowly to the hoofs of horses and the tramp of armed men
Up  quick
cried Robert
Lets drop things on them
Even the girls were feeling almost brave now
They followed Robert quickly and under his directions began to drop stones out through the long narrow windows
There was a confused noise below and some groans
Oh dear
said Anthea putting down the stone she was just going to drop out
Im afraid weve hurt somebody
Robert caught up the stone in a fury
I should just hope we HAD
he said Id give something for a jolly good boiling kettle of lead
Surrender indeed
And now came more tramping and a pause and then the thundering thump of the batteringram
And the little room was almost quite dark
Weve held it cried Robert we wont surrender
The sun MUST set in a minute
Here  theyre all jawing underneath again
Pity theres no time to get more stones
Here pour that water down on them
Its no good of course but theyll hate it
Oh dear
said Jane dont you think wed better surrender
Never
said Robert well have a parley if you like but well never surrender
Oh Ill be a soldier when I grow up  you just see if I dont
I wont go into the Civil Service whatever anyone says
Lets wave a handkerchief and ask for a parley Jane pleaded
I dont believe the suns going to set tonight at all
Give them the water first  the brutes
said the bloodthirsty Robert
So Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest leadhole and poured
They heard a splash below but no one below seemed to have felt it
And again the ram battered the great door
Anthea paused
How idiotic said Robert lying flat on the floor and putting one eye to the lead hole
Of course the holes go straight down into the gatehouse  thats for when the enemy has got past the door and the portcullis and almost all is lost
Here hand me the pot
He crawled on to the threecornered windowledge in the middle of the wall and taking the pot from Anthea poured the water out through the arrowslit
And as he began to pour the noise of the batteringram and the trampling of the foe and the shouts of Surrender
and De Talbot for ever
all suddenly stopped and went out like the snuff of a candle the little dark room seemed to whirl round and turn topsyturvy and when the children came to themselves there they were safe and sound in the big front bedroom of their own house  the house with the ornamental nightmare irontop to the roof
They all crowded to the window and looked out
The moat and the tents and the besieging force were all gone  and there was the garden with its tangle of dahlias and marigolds and asters and late roses and the spiky iron railings and the quiet white road
Everyone drew a deep breath
And thats all right
said Robert
I told you so
And I say we didnt surrender did we
Arent you glad now I wished for a castle
asked Cyril
I think I am NOW said Anthea slowly
But I wouldnt wish for it again I think Squirrel dear
Oh it was simply splendid
said Jane unexpectedly
I wasnt frightened a bit
Oh I say
Cyril was beginning but Anthea stopped him
Look here she said its just come into my head
This is the very first thing weve wished for that hasnt got us into a row
And there hasnt been the least little scrap of a row about this
Nobodys raging downstairs were safe and sound weve had an awfully jolly day  at least not jolly exactly but you know what I mean
And we know now how brave Robert is  and Cyril too of course she added hastily and Jane as well
And we havent got into a row with a single grownup
The door was opened suddenly and fiercely
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves said the voice of Martha and they could tell by her voice that she was very angry indeed
I thought you couldnt last through the day without getting up to some doggery
A person cant take a breath of air on the front doorstep but you must be emptying the washhand jug on to their heads
Off you go to bed the lot of you and try to get up better children in the morning
Now then  dont let me have to tell you twice
If I find any of you not in bed in ten minutes Ill let you know it thats all
A new cap and everything
She flounced out amid a disregarded chorus of regrets and apologies
The children were very sorry but really it was not their faults
You cant help it if you are pouring water on a besieging foe and your castle suddenly changes into your house  and everything changes with it except the water and that happens to fall on somebody elses clean cap
I dont know why the water didnt change into nothing though said Cyril
Why should it
asked Robert
Waters water all the world over
I expect the castle well was the same as ours in the stableyard said Jane
And that was really the case
I thought we couldnt get through a wishday without a row said Cyril it was much too good to be true
Come on Bobs my military hero
If we lick into bed sharp she wont be so frumious and perhaps shell bong us up some supper
Im jolly hungry
Goodnight kids
Goodnight
I hope the castle wont come creeping back in the night said Jane
Of course it wont said Anthea briskly but Martha will  not in the night but in a minute
Here turn round Ill get that knot out of your pinafore strings
Wouldnt it have been degrading for Sir Wulfric de Talbot said Jane dreamily if he could have known that half the besieged garrison wore pinafores
And the other half knickerbockers
Yes  frightfully
Do stand still  youre only tightening the knot said Anthea
CHAPTER 8 BIGGER THAN THE BAKERS BOY Look here said Cyril
Ive got an idea
Does it hurt much
said Robert sympathetically
Dont be a jackape
Im not humbugging
Shut up Bobs
said Anthea
Silence for the Squirrels oration said Robert
Cyril balanced himself on the edge of the waterbutt in the backyard where they all happened to be and spoke
Friends Romans countrymen  and women  we found a Sammyadd
We have had wishes
Weve had wings and being beautiful as the day  ugh
 that was pretty jolly beastly if you like  and wealth and castles and that rotten gipsy business with the Lamb
But were no forrader
We havent really got anything worth having for our wishes
Weve had things happening said Robert thats always something
Its not enough unless theyre the right things said Cyril firmly
Now Ive been thinking  Not really
whispered Robert
In the silent whatsitsnames of the night
Its like suddenly being asked something out of history  the date of the Conquest or something you know it all right all the time but when youre asked it all goes out of your head
Ladies and gentlemen you know jolly well that when were all rotting about in the usual way heaps of things keep cropping up and then real earnest wishes come into the heads of the beholder  Hear hear
said Robert
 of the beholder however stupid he is Cyril went on
Why even Robert might happen to think of a really useful wish if he didnt injure his poor little brains trying so hard to think
 Shut up Bobs I tell you
 Youll have the whole show over
A struggle on the edge of a waterbutt is exciting but damp
When it was over and the boys were partially dried Anthea said It really was you began it Bobs
Now honour is satisfied do let Squirrel go on
Were wasting the whole morning
Well then said Cyril still wringing the water out of the tails of his jacket Ill call it pax if Bobs will
Pax then said Robert sulkily
But Ive got a lump as big as a cricket ball over my eye
Anthea patiently offered a dustcoloured handkerchief and Robert bathed his wounds in silence
Now Squirrel she said
Well then  lets just play bandits or forts or soldiers or any of the old games
Were dead sure to think of something if we try not to
You always do
The others consented
Bandits was hastily chosen for the game
Its as good as anything else said Jane gloomily
It must be owned that Robert was at first but a halfhearted bandit but when Anthea had borrowed from Martha the redspotted handkerchief in which the keeper had brought her mushrooms that morning and had tied up Roberts head with it so that he could be the wounded hero who had saved the bandit captains life the day before he cheered up wonderfully
All were soon armed
Bows and arrows slung on the back look well and umbrellas and cricket stumps stuck through the belt give a fine impression of the wearers being armed to the teeth
The white cotton hats that men wear in the country nowadays have a very brigandish effect when a few turkeys feathers are stuck in them
The Lambs mailcart was covered with a redandblue checked tablecloth and made an admirable baggagewagon
The Lamb asleep inside it was not at all in the way
So the banditti set out along the road that led to the sandpit
We ought to be near the Sammyadd said Cyril in case we think of anything suddenly
It is all very well to make up your minds to play bandits  or chess or pingpong or any other agreeable game  but it is not easy to do it with spirit when all the wonderful wishes you can think of or cant think of are waiting for you round the corner
The game was dragging a little and some of the bandits were beginning to feel that the others were disagreeable things and were saying so candidly when the bakers boy came along the road with loaves in a basket
The opportunity was not one to be lost
Stand and deliver
cried Cyril
Your money or your life
said Robert
And they stood on each side of the bakers boy
Unfortunately he did not seem to enter into the spirit of the thing at all
He was a bakers boy of an unusually large size
He merely said Chuck it now dye hear
and pushed the bandits aside most disrespectfully
Then Robert lassoed him with janes skippingrope and instead of going round his shoulders as Robert intended it went round his feet and tripped him up
The basket was upset the beautiful new loaves went bumping and bouncing all over the dusty chalky road
The girls ran to pick them up and all in a moment Robert and the bakers boy were fighting it out man to man with Cyril to see fair play and the skippingrope twisting round their legs like an interested snake that wished to be a peacemaker
It did not succeed indeed the way the boxwood handles sprang up and hit the fighters on the shins and ankles was not at all peacemaking
I know this is the second fight  or contest  in this chapter but I cant help it
It was that sort of day
You know yourself there are days when rows seem to keep on happening quite without your meaning them to
If I were a writer of tales of adventure such as those which used to appear in The Boys of England when I was young of course I should be able to describe the fight but I cannot do it
I never can see what happens during a fight even when it is only dogs
Also if I had been one of these Boys of England writers Robert would have got the best of it
But I am like George Washington  I cannot tell a lie even about a cherrytree much less about a fight and I cannot conceal from you that Robert was badly beaten for the second time that day
The bakers boy blacked his other eye and being ignorant of the first rules of fair play and gentlemanly behaviour he also pulled Roberts hair and kicked him on the knee
Robert always used to say he could have licked the butcher if it hadnt been for the girls
But I am not sure
Anyway what happened was this and very painful it was to selfrespecting boys
Cyril was just tearing off his coat so as to help his brother in proper style when Jane threw her arms round his legs and began to cry and ask him not to go and be beaten too
That too was very nice for Robert as you can imagine  but it was nothing to what he felt when Anthea rushed in between him and the bakers boy and caught that unfair and degraded fighter round the waist imploring him not to fight any more
Oh dont hurt my brother any more
she said in floods of tears
He didnt mean it  its only play
And Im sure hes very sorry
You see how unfair this was to Robert
Because if the bakers boy had had any right and chivalrous instincts and had yielded to Antheas pleading and accepted her despicable apology Robert could not in honour have done anything to him at a future time
But Roberts fears if he had any were soon dispelled
Chivalry was a stranger to the breast of the bakers boy
He pushed Anthea away very roughly and he chased Robert with kicks and unpleasant conversation right down the road to the sandpit and there with one last kick he landed him in a heap of sand
ID larn you you young varmint
he said and went off to pick up his loaves and go about his business
Cyril impeded by Jane could do nothing without hurting her for she clung round his legs with the strength of despair
The bakers boy went off red and damp about the face abusive to the last he called them a pack of silly idiots and disappeared round the corner
Then janes grasp loosened
Cyril turned away in silent dignity to follow Robert and the girls followed him weeping without restraint
It was not a happy party that flung itself down in the sand beside the sobbing Robert
For Robert was sobbing  mostly with rage
Though of course I know that a really heroic boy is always dryeyed after a fight
But then he always wins which had not been the case with Robert
Cyril was angry with Jane Robert was furious with Anthea the girls were miserable and not one of the four was pleased with the bakers boy
There was as French writers say a silence full of emotion
Then Robert dug his toes and his hands into the sand and wriggled in his rage
Hed better wait till Im grown up  the cowardly brute
Beast
 I hate him
But Ill pay him out
just because hes bigger than me
You began said Jane incautiously
I know I did silly  but I was only rotting  and he kicked me  look here  Robert tore down a stocking and showed a purple bruise touched up with red
I only wish I was bigger than him thats all
He dug his fingers in the sand and sprang up for his hand had touched something furry
It was the Psammead of course  On the lookout to make sillies of them as usual as Cyril remarked later
And of course the next moment Roberts wish was granted and he was bigger than the bakers boy
Oh but much much bigger
He was bigger than the big policeman who used to be at the crossing at the Mansion House years ago  the one who was so kind in helping old ladies over the crossing  and he was the biggest man I have ever seen as well as the kindest
No one had a footrule in its pocket so Robert could not be measured  but he was taller than your father would be if he stood on your mothers head which I am sure he would never be unkind enough to do
He must have been ten or eleven feet high and as broad as a boy of that height ought to be
his Norfolk suit had fortunately grown too and now he stood up in it  with one of his enormous stockings turned down to show the gigantic bruise on his vast leg
Immense tears of fury still stood on his flushed giant face
He looked so surprised and he was so large to be wearing an Eton collar that the others could not help laughing
The Sammyadds done us again said Cyril
Not us  ME said Robert
If youd got any decent feeling youd try to make it make you the same size
Youve no idea how silly it feels he added thoughtlessly
And I dont want to I can jolly well see how silly it looks Cyril was beginning but Anthea said Oh DONT
I dont know whats the matter with you boys today
Look here Squirrel lets play fair
It is hateful for poor old Bobs all alone up there
Lets ask the Sammyadd for another wish and if it will I do really think we ought to be made the same size
The others agreed but not gaily but when they found the Psammead it wouldnt
Not I it said crossly rubbing its face with its feet
Hes a rude violent boy and itll do him good to be the wrong size for a bit
What did he want to come digging me out with his nasty wet hands for
He nearly touched me
Hes a perfect savage
A boy of the Stone Age would have had more sense
Roberts hands had indeed been wet  with tears
Go away and leave me in peace do the Psammead went on
I cant think why you dont wish for something sensible  something to eat or drink or good manners or good tempers
Go along with you do
It almost snarled as it shook its whiskers and turned a sulky brown back on them
The most hopeful felt that further parley was vain
They turned again to the colossal Robert
Whatever shall we do
they said and they all said it
First said Robert grimly Im going to reason with that bakers boy
I shall catch him at the end of the road
Dont hit a chap littler than yourself old man said Cyril
Do I look like hitting him
said Robert scornfully
Why I should KILL him
But Ill give him something to remember
Wait till I pull up my stocking
He pulled up his stocking which was as large as a small bolstercase and strode off
His strides were six or seven feet long so that it was quite easy for him to be at the bottom of the hill ready to meet the bakers boy when he came down swinging the empty basket to meet his masters cart which had been leaving bread at the cottages along the road
Robert crouched behind a haystack in the farmyard that is at the corner and when he heard the boy come whistling along he jumped out at him and caught him by the collar
Now he said and his voice was about four times its usual size just as his body was four times its Im going to teach you to kick boys smaller than you
He lifted up the bakers boy and set him on the top of the haystack which was about sixteen feet from the ground and then he sat down on the roof of the cowshed and told the bakers boy exactly what he thought of him
I dont think the boy heard it all  he was in a sort of trance of terror
When Robert had said everything he could think of and some things twice over he shook the boy and said And now get down the best way you can and left him
I dont know how the bakers boy got down but I do know that he missed the cart and got into the very hottest of hot water when he turned up at last at the bakehouse
I am sorry for him but after all it was quite right that he should be taught that English boys mustnt use their feet when they fight but their fists
Of course the water he got into only became hotter when he tried to tell his master about the boy he had licked and the giant as high as a church because no one could possibly believe such a tale as that
Next day the tale was believed  but that was too late to be of any use to the bakers boy
When Robert rejoined the others he found them in the garden
Anthea had thoughtfully asked Martha to let them have dinner out there  because the diningroom was rather small and it would have been so awkward to have a brother the size of Robert in there
The Lamb who had slept peacefully during the whole stormy morning was now found to be sneezing and Martha said he had a cold and would be better indoors
And really its just as well said Cyril for I dont believe hed ever have stopped screaming if hed once seen you the awful size you are
Robert was indeed what a draper would call an outsize in boys
He found himself able to step right over the iron gate in the front garden
Martha brought out the dinner  it was cold veal and baked potatoes with sago pudding and stewed plums to follow
She of course did not notice that Robert was anything but the usual size and she gave him as much meat and potatoes as usual and no more
You have no idea how small your usual helping of dinner looks when you are many times your proper size
Robert groaned and asked for more bread
But Martha would not go on giving more bread for ever
She was in a hurry because the keeper intended to call on his way to Benenhurst Fair and she wished to be dressed smartly before he came
I wish WE were going to the Fair said Robert
You cant go anywhere that size said Cyril
Why not
said Robert
They have giants at fairs much bigger ones than me
Not much they dont Cyril was beginning when Jane screamed Oh
with such loud suddenness that they all thumped her on the back and asked whether she had swallowed a plumstone
No she said breathless from being thumped its  its not a plumstone
its an idea
Lets take Robert to the Fair and get them to give us money for showing him
Then we really shall get something out of the old Sammyadd at last
Take me indeed
said Robert indignantly
Much more likely me take you
And so it turned out
The idea appealed irresistibly to everyone but Robert and even he was brought round by Antheas suggestion that he should have a double share of any money they might make
There was a little old ponytrap in the coachhouse  the kind that is called a governesscart
It seemed desirable to get to the Fair as quickly as possible so Robert  who could now take enormous steps and so go very fast indeed  consented to wheel the others in this
It was as easy to him now as wheeling the Lamb in the mailcart had been in the morning
The Lambs cold prevented his being of the party
It was a strange sensation being wheeled in a ponycarriage by a giant
Everyone enjoyed the journey except Robert and the few people they passed on the way
These mostly went into what looked like some kind of standingup fits by the roadside as Anthea said
just outside Benenhurst Robert hid in a barn and the others went on to the Fair
There were some swings and a hooting tooting blaring merrygoround and a shootinggallery and coconut shies
Resisting an impulse to win a coconut  or at least to attempt the enterprise  Cyril went up to the woman who was loading little guns before the array of glass bottles on strings against a sheet of canvas
Here you are little gentleman
she said
Penny a shot
No thank you said Cyril we are here on business not on pleasure
Whos the master
The what
The master  the head  the boss of the show
Over there she said pointing to a stout man in a dirty linen jacket who was sleeping in the sun but I dont advise you to wake him sudden
His tempers contrary especially these hot days
Better have a shot while youre waiting
Its rather important said Cyril
Itll be very profitable to him
I think hell be sorry if we take it away
Oh if its money in his pocket said the woman
No kid now
What is it
Its a GIANT
You ARE kidding
Come along and see said Anthea
The woman looked doubtfully at them then she called to a ragged little girl in striped stockings and a dingy white petticoat that came below her brown frock and leaving her in charge of the shootinggallery she turned to Anthea and said Well hurry up
But if you ARE kidding youd best say so
Im as mild as milk myself but my Bill hes a fair terror and  Anthea led the way to the barn
It really IS a giant she said
Hes a giant little boy  in Norfolks like my brothers there
And we didnt bring him up to the Fair because people do stare so and they seem to go into kind of standingup fits when they see him
And we thought perhaps youd like to show him and get pennies and if you like to pay us something you can  only itll have to be rather a lot because we promised him he should have a double share of whatever we made
The woman murmured something indistinct of which the children could only hear the words Swelp me
balmy and crumpet which conveyed no definite idea to their minds
She had taken Antheas hand and was holding it very firmly and Anthea could not help wondering what would happen if Robert should have wandered off or turned his proper size during the interval
But she knew that the Psammeads gifts really did last till sunset however inconvenient their lasting might be and she did not think somehow that Robert would care to go out alone while he was that size
When they reached the barn and Cyril called Robert
there was a stir among the loose hay and Robert began to come out
His hand and arm came first  then a foot and leg
When the woman saw the hand she said My
but when she saw the foot she said Upon my civvy
and when by slow and heavy degrees the whole of Roberts enormous bulk was at last completely disclosed she drew a long breath and began to say many things compared with which balmy and crumpet seemed quite ordinary
She dropped into understandable English at last
Whatll you take for him
she said excitedly
Anything in reason
Wed have a special van built  leastways I know where theres a secondhand one would do up handsome  what a baby elephant had as died
Whatll you take
Hes soft aint he
Them giants mostly is  but I never see  no never
Whatll you take
Down on the nail
Well treat him like a king and give him firstrate grub and a doss fit for a bloomin dook
He must be dotty or he wouldnt need you kids to cart him about
Whatll you take for him
They wont take anything said Robert sternly
Im no more soft than you are  not so much I shouldnt wonder
Ill come and be a show for today if youll give me  he hesitated at the enormous price he was about to ask  if youll give me fifteen shillings
Done said the woman so quickly that Robert felt he had been unfair to himself and wished he had asked thirty
Come on now  and see my Bill  and well fix a price for the season
I dessay you might get as much as two quid a week reglar
Come on  and make yourself as small as you can for gracious sake
This was not very small and a crowd gathered quickly so that it was at the head of an enthusiastic procession that Robert entered the trampled meadow where the Fair was held and passed over the stubbly yellow dusty grass to the door of the biggest tent
He crept in and the woman went to call her Bill
He was the big sleeping man and he did not seem at all pleased at being awakened
Cyril watching through a slit in the tent saw him scowl and shake a heavy fist and a sleepy head
Then the woman went on speaking very fast
Cyril heard Strewth and biggest draw you ever so help me
and he began to share Roberts feeling that fifteen shillings was indeed far too little
Bill slouched up to the tent and entered
When he beheld the magnificent proportions of Robert he said but little  Strike me pink
were the only words the children could afterwards remember  but he produced fifteen shillings mainly in sixpences and coppers and handed it to Robert
Well fix up about what youre to draw when the shows over tonight he said with hoarse heartiness
Lor love a duck
youll be that happy with us youll never want to leave us
Can you do a song now  or a bit of a breakdown
Not today said Robert rejecting the idea of trying to sing As once in May a favourite of his mothers and the only song he could think of at the moment
Get Levi and clear them bloomin photos out
Clear the tent
Stick up a curtain or suthink the man went on
Lor what a pity we aint got no tights his size
But well have em before the weeks out
Young man your fortunes made
Its a good thing you came to me and not to some chaps as I could tell you on
Ive known blokes as beat their giants and starved em too so Ill tell you straight youre in luck this day if you never was afore
Cos Im a lamb I am  and I dont deceive you
Im not afraid of anyones beating ME said Robert looking down on the lamb
Robert was crouched on his knees because the tent was not big enough for him to stand upright in but even in that position he could still look down on most people
But Im awfully hungry I wish youd get me something to eat
Here Becca said the hoarse Bill
Get him some grub  the best youve got mind
Another whisper followed of which the children only heard Down in black and white  first thing tomorrow
Then the woman went to get the food  it was only bread and cheese when it came but it was delightful to the large and empty Robert and the man went to post sentinels round the tent to give the alarm if Robert should attempt to escape with his fifteen shillings
As if we werent honest said Anthea indignantly when the meaning of the sentinels dawned on her
Then began a very strange and wonderful afternoon
Bill was a man who knew his business
In a very little while the photographic views the spyglasses you look at them through so that they really seem rather real and the lights you see them by were all packed away
A curtain  it was an old redandblack carpet really  was run across the tent
Robert was concealed behind and Bill was standing on a trestletable outside the tent making a speech
It was rather a good speech
It began by saying that the giant it was his privilege to introduce to the public that day was the eldest son of the Emperor of San Francisco compelled through an unfortunate love affair with the Duchess of the Fiji Islands to leave his own country and take refuge in England  the land of liberty  where freedom was the right of every man no matter how big he was
It ended by the announcement that the first twenty who came to the tent door should see the giant for threepence apiece
After that said Bill the price is riz and I dont undertake to say what it wont be riz to
So nows yer time
A young man squiring his sweetheart on her afternoon out was the first to come forward
For that occasion his was the princely attitude  no expense spared  money no object
His girl wished to see the giant
Well she should see the giant even though seeing the giant cost threepence each and the other entertainments were all penny ones
The flap of the tent was raised  the couple entered
Next moment a wild shriek from the girl thrilled through all present
Bill slapped his leg
Thats done the trick
he whispered to Becca
It was indeed a splendid advertisement of the charms of Robert
When the girl came out she was pale and trembling and a crowd was round the tent
What was it like
asked a bailiff
Oh
 horrid
 you wouldnt believe she said
Its as big as a barn and that fierce
It froze the blood in my bones
I wouldnt ha missed seeing it for anything
The fierceness was only caused by Roberts trying not to laugh
But the desire to do that soon left him and before sunset he was more inclined to cry than to laugh and more inclined to sleep than either
For by ones and twos and threes people kept coming in all the afternoon and Robert had to shake hands with those who wished it and allow himself to be punched and pulled and patted and thumped so that people might make sure he was really real
The other children sat on a bench and watched and waited and were very bored indeed
It seemed to them that this was the hardest way of earning money that could have been invented
And only fifteen shillings
Bill had taken four times that already for the news of the giant had spread and tradespeople in carts and gentlepeople in carriages came from far and near
One gentleman with an eyeglass and a very large yellow rose in his buttonhole offered Robert in an obliging whisper ten pounds a week to appear at the Crystal Palace
Robert had to say No
I cant he said regretfully
Its no use promising what you cant do
Ah poor fellow bound for a term of years I suppose
Well heres my card when your times up come to me
I will  if Im the same size then said Robert truthfully
If you grow a bit so much the better said the gentleman
When he had gone Robert beckoned Cyril and said Tell them I must and will have an easy
And I want my tea
Tea was provided and a paper hastily pinned on the tent
It said CLOSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE THE GIANT GETS HIS TEA Then there was a hurried council
How am I to get away
said Robert
Ive been thinking about it all the afternoon
Why walk out when the sun sets and youre your right size
They cant do anything to us
Robert opened his eyes
Why theyd nearly kill us he said when they saw me get my right size
No we must think of some other way
We MUST be alone when the sun sets
I know said Cyril briskly and he went to the door outside which Bill was smoking a clay pipe and talking in a low voice to Becca
Cyril heard him say  Good as havin a fortune left you
Look here said Cyril you can let people come in again in a minute
Hes nearly finished his tea
But he must be left alone when the sun sets
Hes very queer at that time of day and if hes worried I wont answer for the consequences
Why  what comes over him
asked Bill
I dont know its  its a sort of a change said Cyril candidly
He isnt at all like himself  youd hardly know him
Hes very queer indeed
Someonell get hurt if hes not alone about sunset
This was true
Hell pull round for the evening I spose
Oh yes  half an hour after sunset hell be quite himself again
Best humour him said the woman
And so at what Cyril judged was about half an hour before sunset the tent was again closed whilst the giant gets his supper
The crowd was very merry about the giants meals and their coming so close together
Well he can pick a bit Bill owned
You see he has to eat hearty being the size he is
Inside the tent the four children breathlessly arranged a plan of retreat
You go NOW said Cyril to the girls and get along home as fast as you can
Oh never mind the beastly ponycart well get that tomorrow
Robert and I are dressed the same
Well manage somehow like Sydney Carton did
Only you girls MUST get out or its all no go
We can run but you cant  whatever you may think
No Jane its no good Robert going out and knocking people down
The police would follow him till he turned his proper size and then arrest him like a shot
Go you must
If you dont Ill never speak to you again
It was you got us into this mess really hanging round peoples legs the way you did this morning
Go I tell you
And Jane and Anthea went
Were going home they said to Bill
Were leaving the giant with you
Be kind to him
And that as Anthea said afterwards was very deceitful but what were they to do
When they had gone Cyril went to Bill
Look here he said he wants some ears of corn  theres some in the next field but one
Ill just run and get it
Oh and he says cant you loop up the tent at the back a bit
He says hes stifling for a breath of air
Ill see no one peeps in at him
Ill cover him up and he can take a nap while I go for the corn
He WILL have it  theres no holding him when he gets like this
The giant was made comfortable with a heap of sacks and an old tarpaulin
The curtain was looped up and the brothers were left alone
They matured their plan in whispers
Outside the merrygoround blared out its comic tunes screaming now and then to attract public notice
Half a minute after the sun had set a boy in a Norfolk suit came out past Bill
Im off for the corn he said and mingled quickly with the crowd
At the same instant a boy came out of the back of the tent past Becca posted there as sentinel
Im off after the corn said this boy also
And he too moved away quietly and was lost in the crowd
The frontdoor boy was Cyril the backdoor was Robert  now since sunset once more his proper size
They walked quickly through the field and along the road where Robert caught Cyril up
Then they ran
They were home as soon as the girls were for it was a long way and they ran most of it
It was indeed a very long way as they found when they had to go and drag the ponytrap home next morning with no enormous Robert to wheel them in it as if it were a mailcart and they were babies and he was their gigantic nursemaid
I cannot possibly tell you what Bill and Becca said when they found that the giant had gone
For one thing I do not know
CHAPTER 9 GROWN UP Cyril had once pointed out that ordinary life is full of occasions on which a wish would be most useful
And this thought filled his mind when he happened to wake early on the morning after the morning after Robert had wished to be bigger than the bakers boy and had been it
The day that lay between these two days had been occupied entirely by getting the governesscart home from Benenhurst
Cyril dressed hastily he did not take a bath because tin baths are so noisy and he had no wish to rouse Robert and he slipped off alone as Anthea had once done and ran through the dewy morning to the sandpit
He dug up the Psammead very carefully and kindly and began the conversation by asking it whether it still felt any ill effects from the contact with the tears of Robert the day before yesterday
The Psammead was in a good temper
It replied politely
And now what can I do for you
it said
I suppose youve come here so early to ask for something for yourself something your brothers and sisters arent to know about eh
Now do be persuaded for your own good
Ask for a good fat Megatherium and have done with it
Thank you  not today I think said Cyril cautiously
What I really wanted to say was  you know how youre always wishing for things when youre playing at anything
I seldom play said the Psammead coldly
Well you know what I mean Cyril went on impatiently
What I want to say is wont you let us have our wish just when we think of it and just where we happen to be
So that we dont have to come and disturb you again added the crafty Cyril
Itll only end in your wishing for something you dont really want like you did about the castle said the Psammead stretching its brown arms and yawning
Its always the same since people left off eating really wholesome things
However have it your own way
Goodbye
Goodbye said Cyril politely
Ill tell you what said the Psammead suddenly shooting out its long snails eyes  Im getting tired of you  all of you
You have no more sense than so many oysters
Go along with you
And Cyril went
What an awful long time babies STAY babies said Cyril after the Lamb had taken his watch out of his pocket while he wasnt noticing and with coos and clucks of naughty rapture had opened the case and used the whole thing as a garden spade and when even immersion in a washhand basin had failed to wash the mould from the works and make the watch go again
Cyril had said several things in the heat of the moment but now he was calmer and had even consented to carry the Lamb part of the way to the woods
Cyril had persuaded the others to agree to his plan and not to wish for anything more till they really did wish it
Meantime it seemed good to go to the woods for nuts and on the mossy grass under a sweet chestnuttree the five were sitting
The Lamb was pulling up the moss by fat handfuls and Cyril was gloomily contemplating the ruins of his watch
He does grow said Anthea
Doesnt oo precious
Me grow said the Lamb cheerfully  me grow big boy have guns an mouses  an  an  Imagination or vocabulary gave out here
But anyway it was the longest speech the Lamb had ever made and it charmed everyone even Cyril who tumbled the Lamb over and rolled him in the moss to the music of delighted squeals
I suppose hell be grown up some day Anthea was saying dreamily looking up at the blue of the sky that showed between the long straight chestnutleaves
But at that moment the Lamb struggling gaily with Cyril thrust a stoutlyshod little foot against his brothers chest there was a crack
 the innocent Lamb had broken the glass of fathers secondbest Waterbury watch which Cyril had borrowed without leave
Grow up some day
said Cyril bitterly plumping the Lamb down on the grass
I daresay he will when nobody wants him to
I wish to goodness he would  OH take care
cried Anthea in an agony of apprehension
But it was too late  like music to a song her words and Cyrils came out together  Anthea  Oh take care
Cyril  Grow up now
The faithful Psammead was true to its promise and there before the horrified eyes of its brothers and sisters the Lamb suddenly and violently grew up
It was the most terrible moment
The change was not so sudden as the wishchanges usually were
The Babys face changed first
It grew thinner and larger lines came in the forehead the eyes grew more deepset and darker in colour the mouth grew longer and thinner most terrible of all a little dark moustache appeared on the lip of one who was still  except as to the face  a twoyearold baby in a linen smock and white openwork socks
Oh I wish it wouldnt
Oh I wish it wouldnt
You boys might wish as well
They all wished hard for the sight was enough to dismay the most heartless
They all wished so hard indeed that they felt quite giddy and almost lost consciousness but the wishing was quite vain for when the wood ceased to whirl round their dazzled eyes were riveted at once by the spectacle of a very properlooking young man in flannels and a straw hat  a young man who wore the same little black moustache which just before they had actually seen growing upon the Babys lip
This then was the Lamb  grown up
Their own Lamb
It was a terrible moment
The grownup Lamb moved gracefully across the moss and settled himself against the trunk of the sweet chestnut
He tilted the straw hat over his eyes
He was evidently weary
He was going to sleep
The Lamb  the original little tiresome beloved Lamb often went to sleep at odd times and in unexpected places
Was this new Lamb in the grey flannel suit and the pale green necktie like the other Lamb
or had his mind grown up together with his body
That was the question which the others in a hurried council held among the yellowing bracken a few yards from the sleeper debated eagerly
Whichever it is itll be just as awful said Anthea
If his inside senses are grown up too he wont stand our looking after him and if hes still a baby inside of him how on earth are we to get him to do anything
And itll be getting on for dinnertime in a minute And we havent got any nuts said Jane
Oh bother nuts
said Robert but dinners different  I didnt have half enough dinner yesterday
Couldnt we tie him to the tree and go home to our dinners and come back afterwards
A fat lot of dinner we should get if we went back without the Lamb
said Cyril in scornful misery
And itll be just the same if we go back with him in the state he is now
Yes I know its my doing dont rub it in
I know Im a beast and not fit to live you can take that for settled and say no more about it
The question is what are we going to do
Lets wake him up and take him into Rochester or Maidstone and get some grub at a pastrycooks said Robert hopefully
Take him
repeated Cyril
Yes  do
Its all MY fault  I dont deny that  but youll find youve got your work cut out for you if you try to take that young man anywhere
The Lamb always was spoilt but now hes grown up hes a demon  simply
I can see it
Look at his mouth
Well then said Robert lets wake him up and see what HELL do
Perhaps HELL take us to Maidstone and stand Sam
He ought to have a lot of money in the pockets of those extraspecial bags
We MUST have dinner anyway
They drew lots with little bits of bracken
It fell to janes lot to waken the grownup Lamb
She did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of wild honeysuckle
He said Bother the flies
twice and then opened his eyes
Hullo kiddies
he said in a languid tone still here
Whats the giddy hour
Youll be late for your grub
I know we shall said Robert bitterly
Then cut along home said the grownup Lamb
What about your grub though
asked Jane
Oh how far is it to the station do you think
Ive a sort of notion that Ill run up to town and have some lunch at the club
Blank misery fell like a pall on the four others
The Lamb  alone  unattended  would go to town and have lunch at a club
Perhaps he would also have tea there
Perhaps sunset would come upon him amid the dazzling luxury of clubland and a helpless cross sleepy baby would find itself alone amid unsympathetic waiters and would wail miserably for Panty from the depths of a club armchair
The picture moved Anthea almost to tears
Oh no Lamb ducky you mustnt do that
she cried incautiously
The grownup Lamb frowned
My dear Anthea he said how often am I to tell you that my name is Hilary or St Maur or Devereux
 any of my baptismal names are free to my little brothers and sisters but NOT Lamb  a relic of foolish and faroff childhood
This was awful
He was their elder brother now was he
Well of course he was if he was grown up  since they werent
Thus in whispers Anthea and Robert
But the almost daily adventures resulting from the Psammead wishes were making the children wise beyond their years
Dear Hilary said Anthea and the others choked at the name you know father didnt wish you to go to London
He wouldnt like us to be left alone without you to take care of us
Oh deceitful beast that I am
she added to herself
Look here said Cyril if youre our elder brother why not behave as such and take us over to Maidstone and give us a jolly good blowout and well go on the river afterwards
Im infinitely obliged to you said the Lamb courteously but I should prefer solitude
Go home to your lunch  I mean your dinner
Perhaps I may look in about teatime  or I may not be home till after you are in your beds
Their beds
Speaking glances flashed between the wretched four
Much bed there would be for them if they went home without the Lamb
We promised mother not to lose sight of you if we took you outJane said before the others could stop her
Look here Jane said the grownup Lamb putting his hands in his pockets and looking down at her little girls should be seen and not heard
You kids must learn not to make yourselves a nuisance
Run along home now  and perhaps if youre good Ill give you each a penny tomorrow
Look here said Cyril in the best man to man tone at his command where are you going old man
You might let Bobs and me come with you  even if you dont want the girls
This was really rather noble of Cyril for he never did care much about being seen in public with the Lamb who of course after sunset would be a baby again
The man to man tone succeeded
I shall just run over to Maidstone on my bike said the new Lamb airily fingering the little black moustache
I can lunch at The Crown  and perhaps Ill have a pull on the river but I cant take you all on the machine  now can I
Run along home like good children
The position was desperate
Robert exchanged a despairing look with Cyril
Anthea detached a pin from her waistband a pin whose withdrawal left a gaping chasm between skirt and bodice and handed it furtively to Robert  with a grimace of the darkest and deepest meaning
Robert slipped away to the road
There sure enough stood a bicycle  a beautiful new freewheel
Of course Robert understood at once that if the Lamb was grown up he MUST have a bicycle
This had always been one of Roberts own reasons for wishing to be grown up
He hastily began to use the pin  eleven punctures in the back tyre seven in the front
He would have made the total twentytwo but for the rustling of the yellow hazelleaves which warned him of the approach of the others
He hastily leaned a hand on each wheel and was rewarded by the whish of what was left of the air escaping from eighteen neat pinholes
Your bikes run down said Robert wondering how he could so soon have learned to deceive
So it is said Cyril
Its a puncture said Anthea stooping down and standing up again with a thorn which she had got ready for the purpose
Look here
The grownup Lamb or Hilary as I suppose one must now call him fixed his pump and blew up the tyre
The punctured state of it was soon evident
I suppose theres a cottage somewhere near  where one could get a pail of water
said the Lamb
There was and when the number of punctures had been made manifest it was felt to be a special blessing that the cottage provided teas for cyclists
It provided an odd sort of teaandhammy meal for the Lamb and his brothers
This was paid for out of the fifteen shillings which had been earned by Robert when he was a giant  for the Lamb it appeared had unfortunately no money about him
This was a great disappointment for the others but it is a thing that will happen even to the most grownup of us
However Robert had enough to eat and that was something
Quietly but persistently the miserable four took it in turns to try to persuade the Lamb or St Maur to spend the rest of the day in the woods
There was not very much of the day left by the time he had mended the eighteenth puncture
He looked up from the completed work with a sigh of relief and suddenly put his tie straight
Theres a lady coming he said briskly  for goodness sake get out of the way
Go home  hide  vanish somehow
I cant be seen with a pack of dirty kids
His brothers and sisters were indeed rather dirty because earlier in the day the Lamb in his infant state had sprinkled a good deal of garden soil over them
The grownup Lambs voice was so tyrantlike as Jane said afterwards that they actually retreated to the back garden and left him with his little moustache and his flannel suit to meet alone the young lady who now came up the front garden wheeling a bicycle
The woman of the house came out and the young lady spoke to her  the Lamb raised his hat as she passed him  and the children could not hear what she said though they were craning round the corner by the pigpail and listening with all their ears
They felt it to be perfectly fair as Robert said with that wretched Lamb in that condition
When the Lamb spoke in a languid voice heavy with politeness they heard well enough
A puncture
he was saying
Can I not be of any assistance
If you could allow me 
There was a stifled explosion of laughter behind the pigpail  the grownup Lamb otherwise Devereux turned the tail of an angry eye in its direction
Youre very kind said the lady looking at the Lamb
She looked rather shy but as the boys put it there didnt seem to be any nonsense about her
But oh whispered Cyril behind the pigpail I should have thought hed had enough bicyclemending for one day  and if she only knew that really and truly hes only a whinypiny silly little baby
Hes not Anthea murmured angrily
Hes a dear  if people only let him alone
Its our own precious Lamb still whatever silly idiots may turn him into  isnt he Pussy
Jane doubtfully supposed so
Now the Lamb  whom I must try to remember to call St Maur  was examining the ladys bicycle and talking to her with a very grownup manner indeed
No one could possibly have supposed to see and hear him that only that very morning he had been a chubby child of two years breaking other peoples Waterbury watches
Devereux as he ought to be called for the future took out a gold watch when he had mended the ladys bicycle and all the onlookers behind the pigpail said Oh
 because it seemed so unfair that the Baby who had only that morning destroyed two cheap but honest watches should now in the grownupness Cyrils folly had raised him to have a real gold watch  with a chain and seals
Hilary as I will now term him withered his brothers and sisters with a glance and then said to the lady  with whom he seemed to be quite friendly If you will allow me I will ride with you as far as the Cross Roads it is getting late and there are tramps about
No one will ever know what answer the young lady intended to give to this gallant offer for directly Anthea heard it made she rushed out knocking against the pigpail which overflowed in a turbid stream and caught the Lamb I suppose I ought to say Hilary by the arm
The others followed and in an instant the four dirty children were visible beyond disguise
Dont let him said Anthea to the lady and she spoke with intense earnestness hes not fit to go with anyone
Go away little girl
said St Maur as we will now call him in a terrible voice
Go home at once
Youd much better not have anything to do with him the now reckless Anthea went on
He doesnt know who he is
Hes something very different from what you think he is
What do you mean
asked the lady not unnaturally while Devereux as I must term the grownup Lamb tried vainly to push Anthea away
The others backed her up and she stood solid as a rock
You just let him go with you said Anthea youll soon see what I mean
How would you like to suddenly see a poor little helpless baby spinning along downhill beside you with its feet up on a bicycle it had lost control Of
The lady had turned rather pale
Who are these very dirty children
she asked the grownup Lamb sometimes called St Maur in these pages
I dont know he lied miserably
Oh Lamb
how can you
cried Jane  when you know perfectly well youre our own little baby brother that were so fond of
Were his big brothers and sisters she explained turning to the lady who with trembling hands was now turning her bicycle towards the gate and weve got to take care of him
And we must get him home before sunset or I dont know whatever will become of us
You see hes sort of under a spell  enchanted  you know what I mean
Again and again the Lamb Devereux I mean had tried to stop Janes eloquence but Robert and Cyril held him one by each leg and no proper explanation was possible
The lady rode hastily away and electrified her relatives at dinner by telling them of her escape from a family of dangerous lunatics
The little girls eyes were simply those of a maniac
I cant think how she came to be at large she said
When her bicycle had whizzed away down the road Cyril spoke gravely
Hilary old chap he said you must have had a sunstroke or something
And the things youve been saying to that lady
Why if we were to tell you the things youve said when you are yourself again say to morrow morning you wouldnt even understand them  let alone believe them
You trust to me old chap and come home now and if youre not yourself in the morning well ask the milkman to ask the doctor to come
The poor grownup Lamb St Maur was really one of his Christian names seemed now too bewildered to resist
Since you seem all to be as mad as the whole worshipful company of hatters he said bitterly I suppose I HAD better take you home
But youre not to suppose I shall pass this over
I shall have something to say to you all tomorrow morning
Yes you will my Lamb said Anthea under her breath but it wont be at all the sort of thing you think its going to be
In her heart she could hear the pretty soft little loving voice of the baby Lamb  so different from the affected tones of the dreadful grownup Lamb one of whose names was Devereux  saying Me love Panty  wants to come to own Panty
Oh lets get home for goodness sake she said
You shall say whatever you like in the morning  if you can she added in a whisper
It was a gloomy party that went home through the soft evening
During Antheas remarks Robert had again made play with the pin and the bicycle tyre and the Lamb whom they had to call St Maur or Devereux or Hilary seemed really at last to have had his fill of bicyclemending
So the machine was wheeled
The sun was just on the point of setting when they arrived at the White House
The four elder children would have liked to linger in the lane till the complete sunsetting turned the grownup Lamb whose Christian names I will not further weary you by repeating into their own dear tiresome baby brother
But he in his grownupness insisted on going on and thus he was met in the front garden by Martha
Now you remember that as a special favour the Psammead had arranged that the servants in the house should never notice any change brought about by the wishes of the children
Therefore Martha merely saw the usual party with the baby Lamb about whom she had been desperately anxious all the afternoon trotting beside Anthea on fat baby legs while the children of course still saw the grownup Lamb never mind what names he was christened by and Martha rushed at him and caught him in her arms exclaiming Come to his own Martha then  a precious poppet
The grownup Lamb whose names shall now be buried in oblivion struggled furiously
An expression of intense horror and annoyance was seen on his face
But Martha was stronger than he
She lifted him up and carried him into the house
None of the children will ever forget that picture
The neat greyflannelsuited grownup young man with the green tie and the little black moustache  fortunately he was slightly built and not tall  struggling in the sturdy arms of Martha who bore him away helpless imploring him as she went to be a good boy now and come and have his nice bremmilk
Fortunately the sun set as they reached the doorstep the bicycle disappeared and Martha was seen to carry into the house the real live darling sleepy twoyearold Lamb
The grownup Lamb nameless hence forth was gone for ever
For ever said Cyril because as soon as ever the Lambs old enough to be bullied we must jolly well begin to bully him for his own sake  so that he maynt grow up like that
You shant bully him said Anthea stoutly not if I can stop it
We must tame him by kindness said Jane
You see said Robert if he grows up in the usual way therell be plenty of time to correct him as he goes along
The awful thing today was his growing up so suddenly
There was no time to improve him at all
He doesnt want any improving said Anthea as the voice of the Lamb came cooing through the open door just as she had heard it in her heart that afternoon Me loves Panty  wants to come to own Panty
CHAPTER 10 SCALPS Probably the day would have been a greater success if Cyril had not been reading The Last of the Mohicans
The story was running in his head at breakfast and as he took his third cup of tea he said dreamily I wish there were Red Indians in England  not big ones you know but little ones just about the right size for us to fight
Everyone disagreed with him at the time and no one attached any importance to the incident
But when they went down to the sandpit to ask for a hundred pounds in twoshilling pieces with Queen Victorias head on to prevent mistakes  which they had always felt to be a really reasonable wish that must turn out well  they found out that they had done it again
For the Psammead which was very cross and sleepy said Oh dont bother me
Youve had your wish
I didnt know it said Cyril
Dont you remember yesterday
said the Sandfairy still more disagreeably
You asked me to let you have your wishes wherever you happened to be and you wished this morning and youve got it
Oh have we
said Robert
What is it
So youve forgotten
said the Psammead beginning to burrow
Never mind youll know soon enough
And I wish you joy of it
A nice thing youve let yourselves in for
We always do somehow said Jane sadly
And now the odd thing was that no one could remember anyones having wished for anything that morning
The wish about the Red Indians had not stuck in anyones head
It was a most anxious morning
Everyone was trying to remember what had been wished for and no one could and everyone kept expecting something awful to happen every minute
It was most agitating they knew from what the Psammead had said that they must have wished for something more than usually undesirable and they spent several hours in most agonizing uncertainty
It was not till nearly dinnertime that Jane tumbled over The Last of the Mohicans  which had of course been left face downwards on the floor  and when Anthea had picked her and the book up she suddenly said I know
and sat down flat on the carpet
Oh Pussy how awful
It was Indians he wished for  Cyril  at breakfast dont you remember
He said I wish there were Red Indians in England  and now there are and theyre going about scalping people all over the country like as not
Perhaps theyre only in Northumberland and Durham said Jane soothingly
It was almost impossible to believe that it could really hurt people much to be scalped so far away as that
Dont you believe it
said Anthea
The Sammyadd said wed let ourselves in for a nice thing
That means theyll come HERE
And suppose they scalped the Lamb
Perhaps the scalping would come right again at sunset said Jane but she did not speak so hopefully as usual
Not it
said Anthea
The things that grow out of the wishes dont go
Look at the fifteen shillings
Pussy Im going to break something and you must let me have every penny of money youve got
The Indians will come HERE dont you see
That spiteful Psammead as good as said so
You see what my plan is
Come on
Jane did not see at all
But she followed her sister meekly into their mothers bedroom
Anthea lifted down the heavy waterjug  it had a pattern of storks and long grasses on it which Anthea never forgot
She carried it into the dressingroom and carefully emptied the water out of it into the bath
Then she took the jug back into the bedroom and dropped it on the floor
You know how a jug always breaks if you happen to drop it by accident
If you happen to drop it on purpose it is quite different
Anthea dropped that jug three times and it was as unbroken as ever
So at last she had to take her fathers boottree and break the jug with that in cold blood
It was heartless work
Next she broke open the missionarybox with the poker
Jane told her that it was wrong of course but Anthea shut her lips very tight and then said Dont be silly  its a matter of life and death
There was not very much in the missionarybox  only sevenandfourpence  but the girls between them had nearly four shillings
This made over eleven shillings as you will easily see
Anthea tied up the money in a corner of her pockethandkerchief
Come on Jane
she said and ran down to the farm
She knew that the farmer was going into Rochester that afternoon
In fact it had been arranged that he was to take the four children with him
They had planned this in the happy hour when they believed that they were going to get that hundred pounds in twoshilling pieces out of the Psammead
They had arranged to pay the farmer two shillings each for the ride
Now Anthea hastily explained to him that they could not go but would he take Martha and the Baby instead
He agreed but he was not pleased to get only halfacrown instead of eight shillings
Then the girls ran home again
Anthea was agitated but not flurried
When she came to think it over afterwards she could not help seeing that she had acted with the most farseeing promptitude just like a born general
She fetched a little box from her corner drawer and went to find Martha who was laying the cloth and not in the best of tempers
Look here said Anthea
Ive broken the toiletjug in mothers room
Just like you  always up to some mischief said Martha dumping down a saltcellar with a bang
Dont be cross Martha dear said Anthea
Ive got enough money to pay for a new one  if only youll be a dear and go and buy it for us
Your cousins keep a chinashop dont they
And I would like you to get it today in case mother comes home tomorrow
You know she said she might perhaps
But youre all going into town yourselves said Martha
We cant afford to if we get the new jug said Anthea but well pay for you to go if youll take the Lamb
And I say Martha look here  Ill give you my Liberty box if youll go
Look its most awfully pretty  all inlaid with real silver and ivory and ebony like King Solomons temple
I see said Martha no I dont want your box miss
What you want is to get the precious Lamb off your hands for the afternoon
Dont you go for to think I dont see through you
This was so true that Anthea longed to deny it at once  Martha had no business to know so much
But she held her tongue
Martha set down the bread with a bang that made it jump off its trencher
I DO want the jug got said Anthea softly
You WILL go wont you
Well just for this once I dont mind but mind you dont get into none of your outrageous mischief while Im gone  thats all
Hes going earlier than he thought said Anthea eagerly
Youd better hurry and get dressed
Do put on that lovely purple frock Martha and the hat with the pink cornflowers and the yellowlace collar
Janell finish laying the cloth and Ill wash the Lamb and get him ready
As she washed the unwilling Lamb and hurried him into his best clothes Anthea peeped out of the window from time to time so far all was well  she could see no Red Indians
When with a rush and a scurry and some deepening of the damask of Marthas complexion she and the Lamb had been got off Anthea drew a deep breath
HES safe
she said and to janes horror flung herself down on the floor and burst into floods of tears
Jane did not understand at all how a person could be so brave and like a general and then suddenly give way and go flat like an airballoon when you prick it
It is better not to go flat of course but you will observe that Anthea did not give way till her aim was accomplished
She had got the dear Lamb out of danger  she felt certain the Red Indians would be round the White House or nowhere  the farmers cart would not come back till after sunset so she could afford to cry a little
It was partly with joy that she cried because she had done what she meant to do
She cried for about three minutes while Jane hugged her miserably and said at fivesecond intervals Dont cry Panther dear
Then she jumped up rubbed her eyes hard with the corner of her pinafore so that they kept red for the rest of the day and started to tell the boys
But just at that moment cook rang the dinnerbell and nothing could be said till they had all been helped to minced beef
Then cook left the room and Anthea told her tale
But it is a mistake to tell a thrilling tale when people are eating minced beef and boiled potatoes
There seemed somehow to be something about the food that made the idea of Red Indians seem flat and unbelievable
The boys actually laughed and called Anthea a little silly
Why said Cyril Im almost sure it was before I said that that Jane said she wished it would be a fine day
It wasnt said Jane briefly
Why if it was Indians Cyril went on  salt please and mustard  I must have something to make this mush go down  if it was Indians theyd have been infesting the place long before this  you know they would
I believe its the fine day
Then why did the Sammyadd say wed let ourselves in for a nice thing
asked Anthea
She was feeling very cross
She knew she had acted with nobility and discretion and after that it was very hard to be called a little silly especially when she had the weight of a burglared missionarybox and about sevenandfourpence mostly in coppers lying like lead upon her conscience
There was a silence during which cook took away the mincy plates and brought in the treaclepudding
As soon as she had retired Cyril began again
Of course I dont mean to say he admitted that it wasnt a good thing to get Martha and the Lamb out of the light for the afternoon but as for Red Indians  why you know jolly well the wishes always come that very minute
If there was going to be Red Indians theyd be here now
I expect they are said Anthea theyre lurking amid the undergrowth for anything you know
I do think youre most beastly unkind
Indians almost always DO lurk really though dont they
put in Jane anxious for peace
No they dont said Cyril tartly
And Im not unkind Im only truthful
And I say it was utter rot breaking the waterjug and as for the missionarybox I believe its a treasoncrime and I shouldnt wonder if you could be hanged for it if any of us was to split  Shut up cant you
said Robert but Cyril couldnt
You see he felt in his heart that if there SHOULD be Indians they would be entirely his own fault so he did not wish to believe in them
And trying not to believe things when in your heart you are almost sure they are true is as bad for the temper as anything I know
Its simply idiotic he said talking about Indians when you can see for yourselves that its Jane whos got her wish
Look what a fine day it is  OH   He had turned towards the window to point out the fineness of the day  the others turned too  and a frozen silence caught at Cyril and none of the others felt at all like breaking it
For there peering round the corner of the window among the red leaves of the Virginia creeper was a face  a brown face with a long nose and a tight mouth and very bright eyes
And the face was painted in coloured patches
It had long black hair and in the hair were feathers
Every childs mouth in the room opened and stayed open
The treaclepudding was growing white and cold on their plates
No one could move
Suddenly the feathered head was cautiously withdrawn and the spell was broken
I am sorry to say that Antheas first words were very like a girl
There now
she said
I told you so
Treaclepudding had now definitely ceased to charm
Hastily wrapping their portions in a Spectator of the week before the week before last they hid them behind the crinkledpaper stoveornament and fled upstairs to reconnoitre and to hold a hurried council
Pax said Cyril handsomely when they reached their mothers bedroom
Panther Im sorry if I was a brute
All right said Anthea but you see now
No further trace of Indians however could be discerned from the windows
Well said Robert what are we to do
The only thing I can think of said Anthea who was now generally admitted to be the heroine of the day is  if we dressed up as like Indians as we can and looked out of the windows or even went out
They might think we were the powerful leaders of a large neighbouring tribe and  and not do anything to us you know for fear of awful vengeance
But Eliza and the cook
said Jane
You forget  they cant notice anything said Robert
They wouldnt notice anything out of the way even if they were scalped or roasted at a slow fire
But would they come right at sunset
Of course
You cant be really scalped or burned to death without noticing it and youd be sure to notice it next day even if it escaped your attention at the time said Cyril
I think Antheas right but we shall want a most awful lot of feathers
Ill go down to the henhouse said Robert
Theres one of the turkeys in there  its not very well
I could cut its feathers without it minding much
Its very bad  doesnt seem to care what happens to it
Get me the cuttingout scissors
Earnest reconnoitring convinced them all that no Indians were in the poultryyard
Robert went
In five minutes he came back  pale but with many feathers
Look here he said this is jolly serious
I cut off the feathers and when I turned to come out there was an Indian squinting at me from under the old hencoop
I just brandished the feathers and yelled and got away before he could get the coop off the top of himself
Panther get the coloured blankets off our beds and look slippy cant you
It is wonderful how like an Indian you can make yourselves with blankets and feathers and coloured scarves
Of course none of the children happened to have long black hair but there was a lot of black calico that had been got to cover schoolbooks with
They cut strips of this into a sort of fine fringe and fastened it round their heads with the ambercoloured ribbons off the girls Sunday dresses
Then they stuck turkeys feathers in the ribbons
The calico looked very like long black hair especially when the strips began to curl up a bit
But our faces said Anthea theyre not at all the right colour
Were all rather pale and Im sure I dont know why but Cyril is the colour of putty
Im not said Cyril
The real Indians outside seem to be brownish said Robert hastily
I think we ought to be really RED  its sort of superior to have a red skin if you are one
The red ochre cook used for the kitchen bricks seemed to be about the reddest thing in the house
The children mixed some in a saucer with milk as they had seen cook do for the kitchen floor
Then they carefully painted each others faces and hands with it till they were quite as red as any Red Indian need be  if not redder
They knew at once that they must look very terrible when they met Eliza in the passage and she screamed aloud
This unsolicited testimonial pleased them very much
Hastily telling her not to be a goose and that it was only a game the four blanketed feathered really and truly Redskins went boldly out to meet the foe
I say boldly
That is because I wish to be polite
At any rate they went
Along the hedge dividing the wilderness from the garden was a row of dark heads all highly feathered
Its our only chance whispered Anthea
Much better than to wait for their bloodfreezing attack
We must pretend like mad
Like that game of cards where you pretend youve got aces when you havent
Fluffing they call it I think
Now then
Whoop
With four wild warwhoops  or as near them as English children could be expected to go without any previous practice  they rushed through the gate and struck four warlike attitudes in face of the line of Red Indians
These were all about the same height and that height was Cyrils
I hope to goodness they can talk English said Cyril through his attitude
Anthea knew they could though she never knew how she came to know it
She had a white towel tied to a walkingstick
This was a flag of truce and she waved it in the hope that the Indians would know what it was
Apparently they did  for one who was browner than the others stepped forward
Ye seek a powwow
he said in excellent English
I am Golden Eagle of the mighty tribe of Rockdwellers
And I said Anthea with a sudden inspiration am the Black Panther  chief of the  the  the  Mazawattee tribe
My brothers  I dont mean  yes I do  the tribe  I mean the Mazawattees  are in ambush below the brow of yonder hill
And what mighty warriors be these
asked Golden Eagle turning to the others
Cyril said he was the great chief Squirrel of the Moning Congo tribe and seeing that Jane was sucking her thumb and could evidently think of no name for herself he added This great warrior is Wild Cat  Pussy Ferox we call it in this land  leader of the vast Phiteezi tribe
And thou valorous Redskin
Golden Eagle inquired suddenly of Robert who taken unawares could only reply that he was Bobs leader of the Cape Mounted Police
And now said Black Panther our tribes if we just whistle them up will far outnumber your puny forces so resistance is useless
Return therefore to your own land O brother and smoke pipes of peace in your wampums with your squaws and your medicinemen and dress yourselves in the gayest wigwams and eat happily of the juicy freshcaught moccasins
Youve got it all wrong murmured Cyril angrily
But Golden Eagle only looked inquiringly at her
Thy customs are other than ours O Black Panther he said
Bring up thy tribe that we may hold powwow in state before them as becomes great chiefs
Well bring them up right enough said Anthea with their bows and arrows and tomahawks and scalpingknives and everything you can think of if you dont look sharp and go
She spoke bravely enough but the hearts of all the children were beating furiously and their breath came in shorter and shorter gasps
For the little real Red Indians were closing up round them  coming nearer and nearer with angry murmurs  so that they were the centre of a crowd of dark cruel faces
Its no go whispered Robert
I knew it wouldnt be
We must make a bolt for the Psammead
It might help us
If it doesnt  well I suppose we shall come alive again at sunset
I wonder if scalping hurts as much as they say
Ill wave the flag again said Anthea
If they stand back well run for it
She waved the towel and the chief commanded his followers to stand back
Then charging wildly at the place where the line of Indians was thinnest the four children started to run
Their first rush knocked down some halfdozen Indians over whose blanketed bodies the children leaped and made straight for the sandPit
This was no time for the safe easy way by which carts go down  right over the edge of the sandpit they went among the yellow and pale purple flowers and dried grasses past the little sandmartins little front doors skipping clinging bounding stumbling sprawling and finally rolling
Yellow Eagle and his followers came up with them just at the very spot where they had seen the Psammead that morning
Breathless and beaten the wretched children now awaited their fate
Sharp knives and axes gleamed round them but worse than these was the cruel light in the eyes of Golden Eagle and his followers
Ye have lied to us O Black Panther of the Mazawattees  and thou too Squirrel of the Moning Congos
These also Pussy Ferox of the Phiteezi and Bobs of the Cape Mounted Police  these also have lied to us if not with their tongue yet by their silence
Ye have lied under the cover of the Truceflag of the Paleface
Ye have no followers
Your tribes are far away  following the hunting trail
What shall be their doom
he concluded turning with a bitter smile to the other Red Indians
Build we the fire
shouted his followers and at once a dozen ready volunteers started to look for fuel
The four children each held between two strong little Indians cast despairing glances round them
Oh if they could only see the Psammead
Do you mean to scalp us first and then roast us
asked Anthea desperately
Of course
Redskin opened his eyes at her
Its always done
The Indians had formed a ring round the children and now sat on the ground gazing at their captives
There was a threatening silence
Then slowly by twos and threes the Indians who had gone to look for firewood came back and they came back emptyhanded
They had not been able to find a single stick of wood for a fire
No one ever can as a matter of fact in that part of Kent
The children drew a deep breath of relief but it ended in a moan of terror
For bright knives were being brandished all about them
Next moment each child was seized by an Indian each closed its eyes and tried not to scream
They waited for the sharp agony of the knife
It did not come
Next moment they were released and fell in a trembling heap
Their heads did not hurt at all
They only felt strangely cool
Wild warwhoops rang in their ears
When they ventured to open their eyes they saw four of their foes dancing round them with wild leaps and screams and each of the four brandished in his hand a scalp of long flowing black hair
They put their hands to their heads  their own scalps were safe
The poor untutored savages had indeed scalped the children
But they had only so to speak scalped them of the black calico ringlets
The children fell into each others arms sobbing and laughing
Their scalps are ours chanted the chief illrooted were their illfated hairs
They came off in the hands of the victors  without struggle without resistance they yielded their scalps to the conquering Rockdwellers
Oh how little a thing is a scalp so lightly won
Theyll take our real ones in a minute you see if they dont said Robert trying to rub some of the red ochre off his face and hands on to his hair
Cheated of our just and fiery revenge are we the chant went on  but there are other torments than the scalpingknife and the flames
Yet is the slow fire the correct thing
O strange unnatural country wherein a man may find no wood to burn his enemy
 Ah for the boundless forests of my native land where the great trees for thousands of miles grow but to furnish firewood wherewithal to burn our foes
Ah would we were but in our native forest once more
Suddenly like a flash of lightning the golden gravel shone all round the four children instead of the dusky figures
For every single Indian had vanished on the instant at their leaders word
The Psammead must have been there all the time
And it had given the Indian chief his wish
Martha brought home a jug with a pattern of storks and long grasses on it
Also she brought back all Antheas money
My cousin she give me the jug for luck she said it was an odd one what the basin of had got smashed
Oh Martha you arc a dear
sighed Anthea throwing her arms round her
Yes giggled Martha youd better make the most of me while youve got me
I shall give your ma notice directly minute she comes back
Oh Martha we havent been so very horrid to you have we
asked Anthea aghast
Oh it aint that miss
Martha giggled more than ever
Im agoin to be married
Its Beale the gamekeeper
Hes been aproposin to me off and on ever since you come home from the clergymans where you got locked up on the churchtower
And today I said the word an made him a happy man
Anthea put the sevenandfourpence back in the missionarybox and pasted paper over the place where the poker had broken it
She was very glad to be able to do this and she does not know to this day whether breaking open a missionarybox is or is not a hanging matter
CHAPTER 11 THE LAST WISH Of course you who see above that this is the eleventh and last chapter know very well that the day of which this chapter tells must be the last on which Cyril Anthea Robert and Jane will have a chance of getting anything out of the Psammead or Sandfairy
But the children themselves did not know this
They were full of rosy visions and whereas on other days they had often found it extremely difficult to think of anything really nice to wish for their brains were now full of the most beautiful and sensible ideas
This as Jane remarked afterwards is always the way
Everyone was up extra early that morning and these plans were hopefully discussed in the garden before breakfast
The old idea of one hundred pounds in modern florins was still first favourite but there were others that ran it close  the chief of these being the pony each idea
This had a great advantage
You could wish for a pony each during the morning ride it all day have it vanish at sunset and wish it back again next day
Which would be an economy of litter and stabling
But at breakfast two things happened
First there was a letter from mother
Granny was better and mother and father hoped to be home that very afternoon
A cheer arose
And of course this news at once scattered all the beforebreakfast wishideas
For everyone saw quite plainly that the wish for the day must be something to please mother and not to please themselves
I wonder what she WOULD like pondered Cyril
Shed like us all to be good said Jane primly
Yes  but thats so dull for us Cyril rejoined and besides I should hope we could be that without sandfairies to help us
No it must be something splendid that we couldnt possibly get without wishing for
Look out said Anthea in a warning voice dont forget yesterday
Remember we get our wishes now just wherever we happen to be when we say I wish
Dont lets let ourselves in for anything silly  today of all days
All right said Cyril
You neednt jaw
just then Martha came in with a jug full of hot water for the teapot  and a face full of importance for the children
A blessing were all alive to eat our breakfasses
she said darkly
Why whatevers happened
everybody asked
Oh nothing said Martha only it seems nobodys safe from being murdered in their beds nowadays
Why said Jane as an agreeable thrill of horror ran down her back and legs and out at her toes has anyone been murdered in their beds
Well  not exactly said Martha but they might just as well
Theres been burglars over at Peasmarsh Place  Beales just told me  and theyve took every single one of Lady Chittendens diamonds and jewels and things and shes agoin out of one fainting fit into another with hardly time to say Oh my diamonds
in between
And Lord Chittendens away in London
Lady Chittenden said Anthea weve seen her
She wears a redandwhite dress and she has no children of her own and cant abide other folkses
Thats her said Martha
Well shes put all her trust in riches and you see how shes served
They say the diamonds and things was worth thousands of thousands of pounds
There was a necklace and a river  whatever that is  and no end of bracelets and a tarrer and ever so many rings
But there I mustnt stand talking and all the place to clean down afore your ma comes home
I dont see why she should ever have had such lots of diamonds said Anthea when Martha had Bounced off
She was rather a nasty lady I thought
And mother hasnt any diamonds and hardly any jewels  the topaz necklace and the sapphire ring daddy gave her when they were engaged and the garnet star and the little pearl brooch with greatgrandpapas hair in it  thats about all
When Im grown up Ill buy mother no end of diamonds said Robert if she wants them
I shall make so much money exploring in Africa I shant know what to do with it
Wouldnt it be jolly said Jane dreamily if mother could find all those lovely things necklaces and rivers of diamonds and tarrers
TIARAS said Cyril
Tiaras then  and rings and everything in her room when she came home
I wish she would
The others gazed at her in horror
Well she WILL said Robert youve wished my good Jane  and our only chance now is to find the Psammead and if its in a good temper it MAY take back the wish and give us another
If not  well  goodness knows what were in for
 the police of course and  Dont cry silly
Well stand by you
Father says we need never be afraid if we dont do anything wrong and always speak the truth
But Cyril and Anthea exchanged gloomy glances
They remembered how convincing the truth about the Psammead had been once before when told to the police
It was a day of misfortunes
Of course the Psammead could not be found
Nor the jewels though every one Of the children searched their mothers room again and again
Of course Robert said WE couldnt find them
Itll be mother wholl do that
Perhaps shell think theyve been in the house for years and years and never know they are the stolen ones at all
Oh yes
Cyril was very scornful then mother will be a receiver of stolen goods and you know jolly well what THATS worse than
Another and exhaustive search of the sandpit failed to reveal the Psammead so the children went back to the house slowly and sadly
I dont care said Anthea stoutly well tell mother the truth and shell give back the jewels  and make everything all right
Do you think so
said Cyril slowly
Do you think Shell believe us
Could anyone believe about a Sammyadd unless theyd seen it
Shell think were pretending
Or else shell think were raving mad and then we shall be sent to Bedlam
How would you like it
 he turned suddenly on the miserable Jane  how would you like it to be shut up in an iron cage with bars and padded walls and nothing to do but stick straws in your hair all day and listen to the howlings and ravings of the other maniacs
Make up your minds to it all of you
Its no use telling mother
But its true said Jane
Of course it is but its not true enough for grownup people to believe it said Anthea
Cyrils right
Lets put flowers in all the vases and try not to think about diamonds
After all everything has come right in the end all the other times
So they filled all the pots they could find with flowers  asters and zinnias and looseleaved late red roses from the wall of the stableyard till the house was a perfect bower
And almost as soon as dinner was cleared away mother arrived and was clasped in eight loving arms
It was very difficult indeed not to tell her all about the Psammead at once because they had got into the habit of telling her everything
But they did succeed in not telling her
Mother on her side had plenty to tell them  about Granny and Grannys pigeons and Auntie Emmas lame tame donkey
She was very delighted with the floweryboweryness of the house and everything seemed so natural and pleasant now that she was home again that the children almost thought they must have dreamed the Psammead
But when mother moved towards the stairs to go UP to her bedroom and take off her bonnet the eight arms clung round her just as if she only had two children one the Lamb and the other an octopus
Dont go up mummy darling said Anthea let me take your things up for you
Or I will said Cyril
We want you to come and look at the rosetree said Robert
Oh dont go up
said Jane helplessly
Nonsense dears said mother briskly Im not such an old woman yet that I cant take my bonnet off in the proper place
Besides I must wash these black hands of mine
So up she went and the children following her exchanged glances of gloomy foreboding
Mother took off her bonnet  it was a very pretty hat really with white roses on it  and when she had taken it off she went to the dressingtable to do her pretty hair
On the table between the ringstand and the pincushion lay a green leather case
Mother opened it
Oh how lovely
she cried
It was a ring a large pearl with shining manylighted diamonds set round it
Wherever did this come from
mother asked trying it on her wedding finger which it fitted beautifully
However did it come here
I dont know said each of the children truthfully
Father must have told Martha to put it here mother said
Ill run down and ask her
Let me look at it said Anthea who knew Martha would not be able to see the ring
But when Martha was asked of course she denied putting the ring there and so did Eliza and cook
Mother came back to her bedroom very much interested and pleased about the ring
But when she opened the dressingtable drawer and found a long case containing an almost priceless diamond necklace she was more interested still though not so pleased
In the wardrobe when she went to put away her bonnet she found a tiara and several brooches and the rest of the jewellery turned up in various parts of the room during the next halfhour
The children looked more and more uncomfortable and now Jane began to sniff
Mother looked at her gravely
Jane she said I am sure you know something about this
Now think before you speak and tell me the truth
We found a Fairy said Jane obediently
No nonsense please said her mother sharply
Dont be silly Jane Cyril interrupted
Then he went on desperately
Look here mother weve never seen the things before but Lady Chittenden at Peasmarsh Place lost all her jewellery by wicked burglars last night
Could this possibly be it
All drew a deep breath
They were saved
But how could they have put it here
And why should they
asked mother not unreasonably
Surely it would have been easier and safer to make off with it
Suppose said Cyril they thought it better to wait for  for sunset  nightfall I mean before they went off with it
No one but us knew that you were coming back today
I must send for the police at once said mother distractedly
Oh how I wish daddy were here
Wouldnt it be better to wait till he DOES come
asked Robert knowing that his father would not be home before sunset
No no I cant wait a minute with all this on my mind cried mother
All this was the heap of jewelcases on the bed
They put them all in the wardrobe and mother locked it
Then mother called Martha
Martha she said has any stranger been into MY room since Ive been away
Now answer me truthfully
No mum answered Martha leastways what I mean to say  She stopped
Come said her mistress kindly I see someone has
You must tell me at once
Dont be frightened
Im sure you havent done anything wrong
Martha burst into heavy sobs
I was agoin to give you warning this very day mum to leave at the end of my month so I was  on account of me being going to make a respectable young man happy
A gamekeeper he is by trade mum  and I wouldnt deceive you  of the name of Beale
And its as true as I stand here it Was your coming home in such a hurry and no warning given out of the kindness of his heart it was as he says Martha my beauty he says  which I aint and never was but you know how them men will go on  I cant see you atoiling and amoiling and not lend a elping and which mine is a strong arm and its yours Martha my dear says he
And so he helped me acleanin of the windows but outside mum the whole time and me in if I never say another breathing word its the gospel truth
Were you with him the whole time
asked her mistress
Him outside and me in I was said Martha except for fetching up a fresh pail and the leather that that slut of a Eliza d hidden away behind the mangle
That will do said the childrens mother
I am not pleased with you Martha but you have spoken the truth and that counts for something
When Martha had gone the children clung round their mother
Oh mummy darling cried Anthea it isnt Beales fault it isnt really
Hes a great dear he is truly and honourably and as honest as the day
Dont let the police take him mummy
oh dont dont dont
It was truly awful
Here was an innocent man accused of robbery through that silly wish of Janes and it was absolutely useless to tell the truth
All longed to but they thought of the straws in the hair and the shrieks of the other frantic maniacs and they could not do it
Is there a cart hereabouts
asked mother feverishly
A trap of any sort
I must drive in to Rochester and tell the police at once
All the children sobbed Theres a cart at the farm but oh dont go
 dont go
 oh dont go
 wait till daddy comes home
Mother took not the faintest notice
When she had set her mind on a thing she always went straight through with it she was rather like Anthea in this respect
Look here Cyril she said sticking on her hat with long sharp violetheaded pins I leave you in charge
Stay in the dressingroom
You can pretend to be swimming boats in the bath or something
Say I gave you leave
But stay there with the landing door open Ive locked the other
And dont let anyone go into my room
Remember no one knows the jewels are there except me and all of you and the wicked thieves who put them there
Robert you stay in the garden and watch the windows
If anyone tries to get in you must run and tell the two farm men that Ill send up to wait in the kitchen
Ill tell them there are dangerous characters about  thats true enough
Now remember I trust you both
But I dont think theyll try it till after dark so youre quite safe
Goodbye darlings
And she locked her bedroom door and went off with the key in her pocket
The children could not help admiring the dashing and decided way in which she had acted
They thought how useful she would have been in organizing escape from some of the tight places in which they had found themselves of late in consequence of their illtimed wishes
Shes a born general said Cyril  but I dont know whats going to happen to us
Even if the girls were to hunt for that beastly Sammyadd and find it and get it to take the jewels away again mother would only think we hadnt looked out properly and let the burglars sneak in and nick them  or else the police will think WEVE got them  or else that shes been fooling them
Oh its a pretty decent average ghastly mess this time and no mistake
He savagely made a paper boat and began to float it in the bath as he had been told to do
Robert went into the garden and sat down on the worn yellow grass with his miserable head between his helpless hands
Anthea and Jane whispered together in the passage downstairs where the coconut matting was  with the hole in it that you always caught your foot in if you were not careful
Marthas voice could be heard in the kitchen  grumbling loud and long
Its simply quite too dreadfully awful said Anthea
How do you know all the diamonds are there too
If they arent the police will think mother and father have got them and that theyve only given up some of them for a kind of desperate blind
And theyll be put in prison and we shall be branded outcasts the children of felons
And it wont be at all nice for father and mother either she added by a candid afterthought
But what can WE do
asked Jane
Nothing  at least we might look for the Psammead again
Its a very very hot day
He may have come out to warm that whisker of his
He wont give us any more beastly wishes today said Jane flatly
He gets crosser and crosser every time we see him
I believe he hates having to give wishes
Anthea had been shaking her head gloomily  now she stopped shaking it so suddenly that it really looked as though she were pricking up her ears
What is it
asked Jane
Oh have you thought of something
Our one chance cried Anthea dramatically the last lonelorn forlorn hope
Come on
At a brisk trot she led the way to the sandpit
Oh joy
 there was the Psammead basking in a golden sandy hollow and preening its whiskers happily in the glowing afternoon sun
The moment it saw them it whisked round and began to burrow  it evidently preferred its own company to theirs
But Anthea was too quick for it
She caught it by its furry shoulders gently but firmly and held it
Here  none of that
said the Psammead
Leave go of me will you
But Anthea held him fast
Dear kind darling Sammyadd she said breathlessly
Oh yes  its all very well it said you want another wish I expect
But I cant keep on slaving from morning till night giving people their wishes
I must have SOME time to myself
Do you hate giving wishes
asked Anthea gently and her voice trembled with excitement
Of course I do it said
Leave go of me or Ill bite
 I really will  I mean it
Oh well if you choose to risk it
Anthea risked it and held on
Look here she said dont bite me  listen to reason
If youll only do what we want today well never ask you for another wish as long as we live
The Psammead was much moved
Id do anything it said in a tearful voice
Id almost burst myself to give you one wish after another as long as I held out if youd only never never ask me to do it after today
If you knew how I hate to blow myself out with other peoples wishes and how frightened I am always that I shall strain a muscle or something
And then to wake up every morning and know youve GOT to do it
You dont know what it is  you dont know what it is you dont
Its voice cracked with emotion and the last dont was a squeak
Anthea set it down gently on the sand
Its all over now she said soothingly
We promise faithfully never to ask for another wish after today
Well go ahead said the Psammead lets get it over
How many can you do
I dont know  as long as I can hold out
Well first I wish Lady Chittenden may find shes never lost her jewels
The Psammead blew itself out collapsed and said Done
I wish said Anthea more slowly mother maynt get to the police
Done said the creature after the proper interval
I wish said Jane suddenly mother could forget all about the diamonds
Done said the Psammead but its voice was weaker
Wouldnt you like to rest a little
asked Anthea considerately
Yes please said the Psammead and before we go further will you wish something for me
Cant you do wishes for yourself
Of course not it said we were always expected to give each other our wishes  not that we had any to speak of in the good old Megatherium days
just wish will you that you may never be able any of you to tell anyone a word about ME
Why
asked Jane
Why dont you see if you told grownups I should have no peace of my life
Theyd get hold of me and they wouldnt wish silly things like you do but real earnest things and the scientific people would hit on some way of making things last after sunset as likely as not and theyd ask for a graduated incometax and oldage pensions and manhood suffrage and free secondary education and dull things like that and get them and keep them and the whole world would be turned topsyturvy
Do wish it
Quick
Anthea repeated the Psammeads wish and it blew itself out to a larger size than they had yet seen it attain
And now it said as it collapsed can I do anything more for you
Just one thing and I think that clears everything up doesnt it Jane
I wish Martha to forget about the diamond ring and mother to forget about the keeper cleaning the windows
Its like the Brass Bottle said Jane
Yes Im glad we read that or I should never have thought of it
Now said the Psammead faintly Im almost worn out
Is there anything else
No only thank you kindly for all youve done for us and I hope youll have a good long sleep and I hope we shall see you again some day
Is that a wish
it said in a weak voice
Yes please said the two girls together
Then for the last time in this story they saw the Psammead blow itself out and collapse suddenly
It nodded to them blinked its long snails eyes burrowed and disappeared scratching fiercely to the last and the sand closed over it
I hope weve done right
said Jane
Im sure we have said Anthea
Come on home and tell the boys
Anthea found Cyril glooming over his paper boats and told him
Jane told Robert
The two tales were only just ended when mother walked in hot and dusty
She explained that as she was being driven into Rochester to buy the girls autumn schooldresses the axle had broken and but for the narrowness of the lane and the high soft hedges she would have been thrown out
As it was she was not hurt but she had had to walk home
And oh my dearest dear chicks she said I am simply dying for a cup of tea
Do run and see if the kettle boils
So you see its all rightJane whispered
She doesnt remember
No more does Martha said Anthea who had been to ask after the state of the kettle
As the servants sat at their tea Beale the gamekeeper dropped in
He brought the welcome news that Lady Chittendens diamonds had not been lost at all
Lord Chittenden had taken them to be reset and cleaned and the maid who knew about it had gone for a holiday
So that was all right
I wonder if we ever shall see the Psammead again said Jane wistfully as they walked in the garden while mother was putting the Lamb to bed
Im sure we shall said Cyril if you really wished it
Weve promised never to ask it for another wish said Anthea
I never want to said Robert earnestly
They did see it again of course but not in this story
And it was not in a sandpit either but in a very very very different place
It was in a  But I must say no more
