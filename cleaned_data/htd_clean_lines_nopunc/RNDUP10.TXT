THE ROUNDUP CHAPTER I The Cactus Cross Down an old trail in the Ghost Range in northwestern Mexico just across the Arizona border a mounted prospector wound his way his horse carefully picking its steps among the broken granite blocks which had tumbled upon the ancient path from the mountain wall above
A burro followed laden heavily with pack bedroll pick fryingpan and battered coffeepot yet stepping along surefootedly as the mountainsheep that first formed the trail ages ago and whose petrified hoofprints still remain to afford footing for the scarcely larger hoofs of the packanimal
An awful stillness hung over the scene that was broken only by the click of hoofs of horse and burro upon the rocks and the clatter of the loose stones they dislodged that rolled and skipped down the side
Not a breath of air was stirring and the sun blazed down from the zenith with such fierce and direct radiation that the wayfarer needed not to observe the shadows to note its exact position in the heavens
Singly among the broken blocks and in banks along the ledges the cactus had burst under the heat as it were into the spontaneous combustion of flowery flame
To the traveler passing beside them their red blooms blazed with the irritating superfluity of a torchlight procession at noonday
The trail leads down to a flat ledge which overlooks the desert and which is the observatory whither countless generations of mountainsheep have been wont to resort to survey the strange world beneath themwith what purpose and what feelings it remains for some imaginative writer of animalstories to inform us
From the ledge to the valley below the trail is free from obstructions and broader more beaten and less devious than above indicating that it has been formed by the generations of men toiling up from the valley to the natural watchtower on the heights
Reaching the ledge the prospector found that what seemed from the angle above to be an irregular pile of large boulders was an artificial fortification the highest wall being toward the mountains
Entering the enclosure the prospector dismounted relieved his horse of its saddle and his burro of its pack and proceeded to prepare his midday meal
Looking for the best place where he might light a fire he observed in the most protected corner a flat stone marked by fire and near it in the rocky ground a pothole evidently formed for grinding maize
The ashes of ancient fires were scattered about and in cleaning them off his newfound hearth the man discovered a potsherd apparently of a native olla or waterjar and a chipped fragment of flint too small to indicate whether it had formed part of an Indian arrowhead or had dropped from an old flintlock musket
Lucky strike
observed the prospector
I was down to my last match
And gathering some mesquit brush for fuel and rubbing a dead branch into tinder he drew out a knife and rapidly and repeatedly striking the back of its blade with the flint produced a stream of sparks which fell on the tinder
Blowing the while he started a flame
When the fire was ready the man shook his canteen
Precious little drink left he said
I wish that potsherd carried water as the flintchip does fire
However theres lots of cactus around here and theyre natural waterjars
My knife may get me a drink out of the deserts thorns as well as kindle a fire from its stones
And right heres my watermelon the bisnaga the first one Ive found in months he exclaimed going over to the edge of the cliff above the level of which peered the fat head of a cactus covered with spines that were barbed like a fishhook
Its short taproot was fixed in a crevice a few feet below the parapet
Lying on the edge of the cliff the man sliced off the top of the cactus and began jabbing into its interior breaking down the fibrous walls of the watercells of which the topheavy plant is almost entirely composed
In a few moments he arose
Now I can empty my canteen in the coffeepot sure of a fresh supply of water by the time I am ready to mosey along
He filled the pot set it on the fire and then pressed the uncorked and empty canteen down into the macerated interior of the bisnaga
While his coffee was boiling the prospector continued his examination of the fortification beginning in the manner of his kind with the more minute signs and ending with what to a tourist would have been the first and only subject of observationthe view
On the inner side of the large boulder in the wall he discerned the faint outline of a cross painted with red ochre
Scraping with his pick beneath the rock to see if the emblem was the sign of hidden treasure or relic he unearthed a rattlesnake
Before it could strike with a quick fling of his tool he sent the reptile whirling high in the air toward the precipice
But from the clump of cactus growth along the parapet arose a sahuaro with branching arms and against this the snake was flung
Wrapped around the thorny top by the momentum of the cast it hung hissing and rattling with pain and hatred
The prospector looked up at the impaled rattlesnake with a smile
Reminiscences of Sundayschool flashed across his mind
Gee Im a regular Moses he ejaculated
First I bring water from the face of the rock and then I lift up the serpent in the wilderness
The year Ive spent in the mountains and desert seem like forty to me and now at last I have a sight of the Promised Land
God what a magnificent view
Dropping his pick he stretched out his arms with instinctive symbolization of the wide prospect and expression of an exiles yearning for his native land
Over there is Gods country sure enough he continued giving the trite phrase a reverential tone which he had not used in his first expression of the name of Deity
Thank Him the parallel with old Moses stops right here
Many a time I thought I would never get out of the mountains alive and that my grave would be unmarked by so much as a boulder with a red cross upon it
But now before night Ill be back in States and in three more days at home on the ranch
I promised to return in a year and Ill make good to the hour
I sure did hate to leave that strike though after all the hard luck I had been having
Sixty dollars a day and growing richer
But the last horn was blowing
No tobacco six matches and nothing left of the bacon but rinds
Well the gold is there and the claimll bring whatever I choose to ask for it
And Echo shall have a home as good as Allen Hacienda and a ranch as fine as Bar Oneyes by God itll be Bar None my ranch
Out of the sea of molten air that stretched before him that nebulous chaos of quivering bars and belts of heated atmosphere which remains above the desert as a memorial of the first stage of the entire planets existence the imagination of the prospector created a paradise of his own
There took shape before his eyes a Mexican hacienda larger and more beautiful even than that of Echos father the beauideal of a home to his limited fancy
And on the piazza in front covered with flowering vines there stood awaiting him the slender figure of a woman with outstretched arms and dark eyes tender with yearning love
EchoEcho Allen
he murmured fondly repeating the name
No not Echo Allen but Echo Lane for Dick Lane has redeemed his promise and returns to claim you as his own
As he gazed upon the shimmering heat waves which distorted and displaced the objects within and beneath them a group of horsemen suddenly appeared to him in the distance and as suddenly vanished in thin air
Rurales
ejaculated Lane
I wonder if they are chasing Apaches
That infernal mirage gives you no idea of distance or direction
If the red devils have got away from Crook and slipped by these Greaser rangers over the border theyll sure be making straight for the Ghost Range and by this very trail
If so Im at the best place on it to meet them and here I stay till the coast is clear
Turning to the red cross on the rock he reflected Perhaps after all its a case of Nebos lonely mountain
Lane had hardly reached this conclusion before he found it justified by the sight of a mounted Apache in the regalia of war emerging from a hidden dip in the trail below the fortification
Lane dropped behind the parapet evidently before he was observed as the steadily increasing number and loudness of the hoofbeats on the rocky trail indicated to the listener
Crawling back to his horse and burro he made them lie down against the upper wall and picketed them with short lengths of rope to the ground for he foresaw that danger could come only from the mountainside
Taking his Winchester he returned to the parapet and halfseated halfreclining behind it opened fire on the unsuspecting Apaches
The leader shot through the head fell from his horse which reared and backed wildly down the trail
Other bullets must have found their billets also but because of the confusion which ensued among the Indians the prospector was unable to tell how many of them he had put out of action
In a flash every rider had leaped off his horse and protecting himself by its body was scrambling with his mount to the protecting declivity in the rear
The prospector was sorely tempted to pump his cartridges into the group as it poured back over the rim of the hollow but he desisted from the useless slaughter of horses alone knowing that he could be attacked only on foot and that every one of his slender store of cartridges must find a human mark if he would return to the States alive
Theyve got to put me out of business before they can go on he ruminated
An Apache is a good deal of a coward when hes fighting for pleasure but just corner him and great snakes and spittin wildcats what a game he does put up
I must save my cartridges for one things sure they wont waste any of theirs
Theyre not as good shots as white men for ammunition is too scarce with them for use in gun practise so they wont fire till theyve got me dead to rights
Let me see theres about a dozen left in the party and I have fifteen cartridgesthats three in reserve for my own outfit if some of the others fail to get their men
Those red devils enjoy skinning an animal alive as much as torturing a man and you can bet they wont save me any bullets by shooting Nance and Jinny
Reasoning that the Indians would not dare to attack by way of the open trail in front and that it would take some time for them to make the detour necessary to approach him from above since they would have to leave their ponies below and climb on hands and knees over jutting ledges and around broken granite blocks Lane coolly proceeded to drink his coffee and eat his lunch of hard bread and cold baconrind
After he had finished he gave a lump of sugar to each of his animals and pressed his cheek with an affectionate hug against the side of his horses head
Old girl he said
Im sorry we cant take a parting drink for Im afraid neither of us will reach our next waterhole
But you can count on me that the red devils wont get you
Then going to his pack he undid it and took out a double handful of yellow nuggets and a number of canvas bags
These he deposited in the pothole and prying up the flat stone of the fireplace laid it over them and covered the stone with embers
Its a ten to one shot that they finish me he reflected but the wages Ive paid for by a year of hard work and absence from her side stay just as near Echo Allen as I can bring them alive and if theres any truth in what they say about spirits disclosing in dreams the place of buried treasure with the chance of my getting them to her after I am dead
Taking the useless boulders from the edge of the cliff but carefully so as not to expose himself to the fire of the Apaches he piled them on top of the upper wall in such a fashion as to form little turrets
He left an opening in each through which he could observe in turn each point of the compass whence danger might be expected and could fire his Winchester without exposing himself
Then he began going from post to post on a continuous round of selfimposed sentinel duty
If I could only climb the sahuaro he thought and fly my red shirt as a flag to let the Rurales know Ive flanked the enemy it might hurry them along in time to put a crimp in these devils before they get me
But itll have to be Hold the Fort without any Oh Say Can You See
business
Anyhow Im flying the rattlesnake flag of Bunker Hill Dont Tread on Me
Whether the Rurales see it or not Ive saved their hides
If the Apaches had got to this fort first gee how they would have crumpled up the Greasers as they came along the trail
Rendered thirsty by his exertions Lane remembered the canteen in the bisnaga which he had forgotten among his other preparations for defense
He cautiously reached his hand over the ledge and secured the precious vessel but as he was withdrawing it PING
came a bullet through the canteen knocking it out of his hand
As it fell clattering down the side of the ledge he groaned Damned good shooting
Theyve probably left their best marksman below with the ponies
No hope for escape on that side
Well theres some consolation in the thought that theyll undoubtedly finish me before I get too damned thirsty
Glad it wasnt my hand
Although the period he spent waiting for the attack was less than an hour by his watch it seemed to last so long that he had hopes that the Rurales would appear in time to rescue him
His spirits rose with the prospect
Looking about him at the walls the fireplace and the red cross he reflected I am not the first man or even the first white man that has withstood an attack in this place
In imagination he constructed the history of the fort
Here in ages remote a tribe of Indians defeated and driven to the mountains had constructed an outpost against their enemies of the plain but these had captured the stronghold and fortified it against its former occupants
Later a band of Spanish goldseekers had made a stand here against natives whom they had roused against them by oppression
Or perhaps as indicated by the cross it had afforded refuge to the Mission Fathers those heroic souls who had faced the horrors of the infernolike desert in their saintly efforts to convert its fiendish inhabitants
With the symbol of Christianity in his mind Lane turned toward the giant cactus which he had heretofore regarded chiefly in the aspect of a flagpole and saw in its columnar trunk and opposing branches a distinct resemblance to a cross
The plant was dead and dry as punk
Suddenly there flashed into his mind a hideous suggestion
More cruel than even the Romans the inventors of crucifixion the Apaches are wont to bind their captives to these dead cacti which supply at once scourging thorns binding stake and consuming fuel and kindling a fire at the top leave it to burn slowly down to the victim and long before it despatches him to twist his body and limbs into what appear to the Apache sense of humor to be exquisitely ludicrous contortions
With his mind occupied by these horrible apprehensions Lane looked at the rattlesnake upon the sahuaro whose struggles by this time had diminished to a movement of the tail
Poor old rattler he thought
I wish I could spare a cartridge to put you out of your misery
At length as Lane peered up the mountainside he saw a bush on a ledge a little to the left of the trail quiver as if stirred by a passing breath of wind
He aimed his Winchester through a crack in the wall at the spot and when a moment later an Apache rose up from the ground and leaped toward the shelter of a rock below Lane fired and the savage fell crumpling
Like an echo of the explosion a rifle on the right spoke and a bullet struck the rock by Lanes head
He marked the spot whence the shot came and quickly ran to another part of the wall
From here he saw the edge of an Indians thigh exposed by the side of the boulder he had noted
CRACK
went Lanes Winchester the leg was suddenly withdrawn and at the same moment a head appeared on the other side of the rock as if the Indian had stretched himself involuntarily
CRACK
again and Lane had got his man
Two shots to an Indian is expensive thought the prospector otherwise this game of tipjack would be very interesting
There was a cry in the Apache tongue and suddenly nine halfnaked bodies arose from behind rocks and bushes extending in an irregular crescent above the fort and rushed forward ten fifteen and even twenty yards to the next cover
Lane did not count number or distance at the time but he figured these out in his next period of waiting from the photograph flashed on his subconscious mind
At the time of the rush he was otherwise occupied
CRACK
CRACK
and two of the Indians fell dead in midcareer
CRACK
and a third crawled wounded to the cover he had almost safely attained
CRACK
and an eaglefeather in the head of the fourth Indian shot at was cut off at the stem and fell forward on the rock behind which its wearer had dropped just in time to save his life
There was an answering volley from the rifles of the remaining Apaches which was directed against the lookout of loose stones from which the prospectors fire had come
One of the bullets penetrated the opening and plowed a furrow through Lanes scalp toppling him to his knees
He scrambled quickly to his feet and hastily pressing his long hair back from his forehead to stanch the bleeding wound sought the protection the middle lookout
He congratulated himself
Lucky for me they didnt follow the first rush immediately with a second
Now I know to wait for their signal
Six and possibly seven of them are left and they will storm my works in two more attempts
Here they come
The call again sounded
Six Apaches leaped forward and from the rock that concealed the wounded warrior a shot rang out in advance of the first discharge from Lanes Winchester
The Indians bullet scored the top of the turret and filled the eyes of the man behind it with powdered stone
The prospector already dazed by his wound fired wildly and missed his mark
Quickly recovering himself he fired again and again severely wounding two Apaches
These lay clawing the ground within twenty yards of the wall
The four remaining Indians were safely concealed at the same distance protected no less by the fortification than by the loose boulders behind which they crouched for the final spring
Lane realized the fact that his next shots to be effective must be at a downward angle and to fire them he must expose himself
This is my finish he thought to himself
Better be killed instantly than tortured
I hope all four will hit me
Goodby JinnyCRACK
went his rifle
Goodby NanceCRACK
again
At the two shots surmising that the prospector had shot himself and his horse the Apaches did not wait for the signal but sprang forward and climbed upon the wall before Lane had had time to mount it
Two of them he shot as they leaped down within the enclosure
As he reversed his Winchester to kill himself with the last cartridge he noted that the two remaining Apaches had dropped their rifles and were leaping upon him to take him alive
He brought his clubbed weapon down upon the head of one of them crushing his skull
At the same instant Lane was borne to the ground by the other Apache who seizing him by the throat began throttling him into insensibility
In desperation Lane bethought himself of the cliff and by a mighty effort whirled over upon his captor toward the precipice
The ground sloped slightly in that direction and the combatants rolled over and over to the very edge of the cliff where the Indian for the first time realizing that the prospectors purpose was to hurl both of them to destruction loosened his hold upon the prospectors throat that he might use his hands to brace himself against the otherwise inevitable plunge into the valley below
In an instant Lanes hands were at the Indians throat and in another turn he was uppermost and kneeling upon his foe at the very verge of the precipice
Both combatants were now thoroughly exhausted
Lane concentrated all his remaining strength in throttling the savage
But just as the tense form beneath him grew lax with evident unconsciousness and head fell limply back extending over the edge of cliff his own head was jerked violently backward by a noose cast around his lacerated neck
When Lane recovered consciousness he found himself lying on his back bound hand and foot by a lariat and looking up into a grinning face that he recognized
Buck McKee
he gasped
This is certainly white of you considering the circumstances of our last meeting
Did you come with the Rurales
Hell no
I come ahead of em
In fact Dick Lane you air jist a leetle bit off in your idees about which party I belong to
When you damned me fer a thievin halfbreed and run me off the range an tole me to go to the Injuns whar I belonged I tuk yer advice
Im what you might call the rearguard of the outfit youve jist been havin your shootinmatch with
Or I was the rearguard for youve wiped out the whole dam battalion so fur as I can see
Served em right fur detailin me the only decent shooter in the bunch to watch the horses
I got one shot in as it wuz
Well as the last of the outfit I own a string of ten ponies
All I need now to set up in business is to have some prospector who haint long to live leave me his little pile uv dust an nuggets an the claims hes located back in the mountains
You look a leetle mite like the man
Itll save vallible time if you make yer dear friend Buck McKee administrater uv yer estate without too much persuadin
You had some objection oncet to my slittin a calfs tongue
Well you neednt be scared just yet
Thats the last thing Ill do to you
Come wheres your cache
I know youve got one hereabouts fer I foun signs of the dust in your pack
Lane set his teeth in a firm resolutions not to say a word
The taunts of his captor were harder to bear in silence than the prospects of torture
Stubborn hey
Well well try a little Pache persuadin
And the renegade dragged his helpless captive up to the thorny sahuaro and bound his back against it with the dead horses bridle
McKee searched through Lanes pockets until he found a match
Last one hey
Kinder propriate
Las drink from the old canteen las catridge last look at the scenery and las will an testyment
Oh times precious but Ill spare you enough to map out in yer mind jes where them claims is located
The Rurales wont be along fer an hour yet if they haint turned back after our other party
McKee pulled off Lanes boots
It aint decent fer a man to die with em on he said
He then kindled a fire on the stone beneath which if he but knew it lay the treasure he sought
He returned with a burning brand to the captive
For the first time he observed the snake impaled on the sahuaro writhing but feebly
Hullo ole rattler he exclaimed heres somethin to stir you up and he tossed the brand upon the top of the cactus
Taking another burning stick from the fire he applied it to the soles of his victims feet
Lane writhed and groaned under the excruciating torture but uttered no word or cry
McKee brought other brands and began piling them about his captives feet
In the meantime the sahuaro had caught fire at the top and was burning down through the interior
A thin column of smoke rose straight above it in the still air
The Rurales in the valley below who had reached the beginning of the ascending trail and were on the point of giving up the pursuit saw the smoke and inferred that the Apaches either through overconfidence or because of their superstitious fear of the mountains which they supposed inhabited by spirits had camped on the edge of the valley and were signaling to their other party
Accordingly the Mexicans renewed the chase with increased vigor
As McKee bent over his captives feet piling against them the burning ends of the sticks the rattlesnake on the sahuaro incited by the fire above struggled free from the impaling thorns by a desperate effort and dropped on the back of the halfbreed
It struck its fangs into his neck
McKee springing up with an energy that scattered the sticks he was piling tore the reptile loose hurled it upon the ground and stamped it into the earth
Then he picked up one of the brands and with it cauterized the wound
All the while he was cursing volublythe snake himself and even Dick Lane who was now lying in a dead faint caused by the torture
Damn such a prospector
Not a drop of whisky in his outfit
Id slit his tongue fer him if he wasnt already done fer
I must keep movinmovin or Im a dead man
I must hustle along to the mountains leadin my horse
Up there Ill find yarbs to cure snakebite that my Cherokee grandmother showed me
The Rurales will have to get the other ponies but some day Ill come back after Lanes cache
A halfhour later the Mexican guards appeared upon the scene and unbound Lanes unconscious form from the sahuaro which the fire had consumed to a foot of his bowed head
They deluged his face and back and bathed his tortured feet with the contents of their canteens and brought him back to life but alas
not to reason
Six months later there limped out of Chihuahua hospital a discharged patient wrynecked crookbacked with drawn features and hair and beard streaked with gray
It was Dick Lane restored to old physical strength so far as the distortion of his spine caused by his torture permitted and to the full possession of his mental faculties
He mounted one of the captured ponies and rode off with the proceeds of the sales of the others in his pocket to purchase provisions for a return to his prospecting
Before plunging into the wilderness he wrote a letter Chihuahua Mexico Mr John Payson Sweetwater Ranch Florence Arizona Territory USA Dear Jack I have been sick and out of my head in the hospital here for the last six months
Just about the time you all were expecting me home I had a run in with the Apaches
And who do you think was with them
Buck McKee the halfbreed that I ran off the range two years ago for tongueslitting
After I had done for all the rest he got me andwell the storys too long to write
I rather think McKee has made off with the gold I had cached just before the fight
Im going back to see and if he did Ill hustle around to find a buyer for one of my claims
I dont want to sell my big mine Jack
I tell you I struck it richbut that story can wait till I get back
Your loan cant though so expect to receive 3000 by express some time before I put in an appearance
I hope you got the mortgage renewed at the end of the year
If my failure to show up then has caused you trouble youll forgive me old fellow I know under the circumstances
Ill make it up to you
I owe you everything
Youre the best friend a man ever had
Thats why Im writing to you instead of to Uncle Jim for I want you to do me another friendly service
Just break it gently to Echo Allen that Im alive and well though pretty badly damaged by that renegade McKee and tell her that it wasnt my fault I wasnt home the day I promised
Shell forgive me I know and be patient a while longer
Its all for her sake Im staying away
Give her the letter I enclose
Your old bunkie Dick Lane CHAPTER II The Heart of a Girl Jim Allen was the sole owner and proprietor of Allen Hacienda
His ranch the Bar One stretched for miles up and down the Sweetwater Valley
Bounded on the east and west by the foothills the tract was one of the garden spots of Arizona
Southward lay the Sweetwater Ranch owned by Jack Payson
Northward was the home ranch of the Lazy K an Ishmaelitish outfit ever at petty war with the other settlers in the district
It was a miscellaneous and constantly changing crowd recruited from rustlers from Wyoming gamblers from California halfbreed outlaws from the Indian Territory in short bad men from every section of the Western country
They had a special grudge against Allen and Payson whom they held to be accountable for the sudden disappearance about a year before of their leader Buck McKee a halfbreed from the Cherokee Strip
However no other leader had arisen equal to that masterful spirit and their enmity expressed itself only in such petty depredations as changing brands on stray cattle from the Bar One and Sweetwater Ranches and the slitting of the tongues of young calves so that would be unable to feed properly and as a result be disowned by their mothers whereupon the Lazy K outfit would slap its brand on them as mavericks
Allen was a Kentuckian who had served in the Confederate Army as one of Morgans raiders and so had received by popular brevet the title of colonel
At the close of the war he had come to Arizona with his young wife Josephine and had founded a home on the Sweetwater
He was now one of the cattle barons of the great Southwest
Prosperity had not spoiled him
Careless in his attire cordial in his manner he was a man who was loved and respected by his men from the newest tenderfoot to the veteran of the bunkhouse
His wife however was not so highly regarded for she had never been able to recognize changes in time or location and so was in perpetual conflict with her environment
She attempted to make the free and independent cowboys of the Arizona plains stand around like the house servants of the Kentucky Bluegrass and she persisted in the effort to manage her husband by the feminine artifice of weeping
In days of her youth and beauty this had been very effective but now that these had passed it was productive only of goodhumored raillery from him and mirth from the bystanders
No wonder Jim has the finest ranch in Arizony the cowboys were wont to say with Josephine a irrigatin it all the time
Allen Hacienda was certainly a garden spot in that desert country
The building was of the old Mexican style an architecture found by centuries of experience to be suited best to the climate and the materials of the land
The house was only one story in height
The rooms and outbuildings sprawled over a wide expanse of ground
The walls were of native stone and adobe clay over them clambered grapevines
In front of the home Mrs Allen had planted a garden
A dobe wall cut off the house from the corral and the bunkhouse
A heavy girder spanned the distance from the low roof to the top of the barrier
Latticework supporting a gravevine formed with a girder a gateway through which one could catch from the piazza a view of a second cultivated plot
Palms and flowering cacti added color and life to the near prospect
Through the arbor a glimpse of the Tortilla Mountains forty miles away held the eye
The Sweetwater its path across the plains outlined by the trees fringing its banks flowed past the ranch
Yucca palms and sahuaroes threw a scanty shade over the garden
Shortly after the arrival of the Allens in Arizona they were blessed with a daughter the first white child born in that region
They waited for a Protestant clergyman to come along before christening her and as such visits were few and far between the child was beginning to talk before she received a name
From a cunning habit she had of repeating last words of questions put to her her father provisionally dubbed her Echo which name when the preacher came he insisted upon her retaining
As Echo grew older in order that she might have a companion Colonel Allen went to Kentucky and brought back with him a little orphan girl who was a distant relative of his wife
Polly Hope her name was and Polly Hope she insisted on remaining though the Allens would gladly have adopted her
Colonel Allen trained the girls in all the craft of the plains just as if they were boys
He taught them to ride astride to shoot to rope cattle
They accompanied him everywhere he went cantering on broncos by the side of his Kentucky thoroughbred
Merry darkeyed blackhaired Echo always rode upon the off side and saucy Polly with golden curls blue eyes and tiptilted nose upon the near
The exConfederate soldier dubbed them in military style his right and left wings
As the three would make a raid upon Florence the county town the inhabitants did not need to look out of doors to ascertain who were coming for the merriment of the little girls gave sufficient indication
Here comes Jim Allen ridin like the destroyin angel said young Sheriff Hoover on one of these occasions I know him by the rustlin of his wings
The household was again increased a few years later by the generous response of the Allens to an appeal from a Childrens Aid Society in an Eastern city to give a home to two orphaned brothers Richard and Henry Lane
Dick and Buddy shortened in time to Bud as they were called being taken young quickly adapted themselves to their new environment and by the time they arrived at manhood had proved themselves the equals of any cowboy on the range in horsemanship and kindred accomplishments
Dick the elder brother was a steady reliable fellow modest as he was brave and remarkably quickwitted and resourceful in emergencies
He gave his confidence over readily to his fellows but if he ever found himself deceived withdrew it absolutely
It was probably this last characteristic that attracted to him Echo Allens especial regard for it was also her distinguishing trait
You have got to act square with Echo her father was wont to say for if you dont youll never make it square with her afterward
Bud was a generoushearted impetuous boy who responded warmly to affection
He repaid his elder brothers protecting care with a loyalty that knew no bounds
The Colonel who was a strict disciplinarian frequently punished him in his boyhood for wayward acts and the little fellow made no resistanceonly sobbed in deep penitence
Once however when Uncle Jim as the boys and Polly called him felt compelled to apply to rod to Dick unjustly as it afterward appearedBud burst into a tempest of passionate tears and leaping upon the Colonels back clung there clawing and striking like a wildcat until Allen was forced to let Dick go
It is shrewdly indicative of the Colonels character that not only did he refrain from punishing Bud on that occasion but when floggings were subsequently due the little fellow laid on the rod less heavily out of regard for the loyalty to his brother he had then displayed
This attack also won the admiration of Polly Hope who was something of a spitfire herself
A little jealous of Dick for the chief place he held in Buds affection she openly claimed the younger brother as her sweetheart and attempted to constitute him her knightthough with repeated discouragements for Bud was a bashful lad and though he had a true affection for the girl boylike concealed it by a show of indifference
The tender relations of these boys and girls persisted naturally into young manhood and womanhood
No word of love passed between Dick and Echo until that time when the nesting impulse the desire to have a home of his own prompted the young man to go out into the world and win his fortune
For a year he had acted as foreman of the Allen ranch working in neighborly cooperation with Jack Payson of Sweetwater Ranch a man of about his own age
The two young men became the closest of comrades
When the fever of adventure seized upon Lane and he became dissatisfied with the plodding career of a wageearner Payson insisted on mortgaging Sweetwater Ranch for three thousand dollars and in lending Dick the money for a years prospecting in the mountains of Sonora Mexico in search of a fabulous rich Lost Mine of the Aztecs
Traditions of lost mines are plentiful in Arizona and northern Mexico
First taken up by the Spanish invaders of three hundred years ago from the native Indians they have been passed down to each subsequent influx of white men
The directions are always vague
The inquirer cannot pin his informant down to any definite data
Over the mountains always lies the road
Hundreds of lives have been sacrificed and cruelty unparalleled practised upon innocent men women and children by goldseekers in their lust for conquest
Prosperous Indian villages have been laid waste and whole bands of adventurers have gone into the desert in the search of these mines never to return
When the time for Lanes departure came Echo wept at the thought of losing for so long a time the close companion of her childhood and the sympathetic confidant of her youthful thoughts and aspirations
Dick in whom friendship for Echo had long before ripened into conscious love took her tears as evidence that she was similarly affected toward him and he allowed all the suppressed passion of his nature full vent in a declaration of love
The girl was deeply moved by this revelation of the heart of a strong man made tender as a womans by a power centering in her own humble self and being utterly without experience of the emotion even in its protective form of calflove which is the varioloid of the genuine infection she imagined through sheer sympathy that she shared his passion
So she assented with maidenly reserve to his plea that she promise to marry him when he should return and provide a home for her
Her more cautious mother secured a modification of this pledge by limiting the time that Echo should wait for him to one year
If at the expiration of that period Lane did not return to claim her promise or did not write making satisfactory arrangements for continuance of the engagement Echo was to be considered free to marry whom she chose
Soon after Lanes departure Mrs Allen persuaded the Colonel to send Echo east to a New England finishingschool for girls where her mother hoped that her budding love for Lane might be nipped in the frigid atmosphere of intellectual culture if not indeed supplanted by a saving interest in young men in general and perhaps in some particular scion of a blueblooded Boston family
The plan succeeded in part only
The companionship of her schoolfellows her music and artlessons her books during the limited periods allotted to serious study and reading and above all her attrition at receptions with another order of men than that she had known in the rough uncultured West occupied her mind so fully that poor Dick Lane who was putting a thought of Echo Allen in every blow of his pick received only the scraps of her attention
Dick had few opportunities to mail a letter and none of them for receiving one
Unpractised in writing his epistolary compositions were crude in the extreme being wholly confined to bald statements of fact
Had he been as tender on paper as he was in his words and accents when he kissed away her tears at parting her regard for him would have had fuel to feed on and might have kindled into genuine love
As it was she was forced to admit that in comparison with the brilliant university men with whom she conversed Dick Lane intellectually was as quartz to diamond
On the other band she contrasted Dick in the essential point of manliness most favorably with the male butterflies of society that hovered around her
What one of them was so essentially chivalrous as the Western man so modest so selfsacrificing so brave and resolute and resourceful
Dick Lane or Jack Payson for that matter in all save the adventitious points of education and culture was the higher type of manhood and Jack at least if not poor Dick could hold his own in mental and artistic perception with the brightest most cultured of Harvard graduates
At the end of the year she came back home to await Dicks return from the wilds of Mexico
There was great anxiety about his safety for Geronimo attacked by Crook in the Apache stronghold of the Tonto Basin had escaped to the mountains of northwestern Mexico with his band of fierce Chiricahuas
Now Dick Lane had not been heard from in this region
When he neither made appearance nor sent a message upon the day appointed for his return his brother Bud was for setting out instantly to find him and rescue him if he were in difficulties
Then it was that Echo Allen discovered the true nature of her affection for her lover that it was sisterly regard differing only in degree but not in kind from that which she felt for his brother
She joined with Polly in opposing Buds going urging his recklessness as a reason
You are certain to be killed she said and I cannot lose you both
Jack Payson for whom Bud was working then came forward and offered to accompany him and keep him with bounds
Again there was a revelation of her heart Echo and one that terrified her with a sense of disloyalty
It was Jack she really loved noble chivalric wonderful Jack Payson whom with a Southern intensity of feeling she had unconsciously come to regard as her standard of all that makes for manhood
Plausible objections could not be urged against his sacrificing himself for his friend
With an irresistible impulse she cast herself upon his breast and said I cannot BEAR to see you go
Payson gently disengaged her arms
I must Echo
It is what Dick would do for me if I were in his place
However while Payson and Bud were preparing for their departure Buck McKee appeared in the region and reported that Dick Lane had been killed by the Apaches
He told with convincing details of how he had met Lane as each was returning from a successful prospecting trip in the Ghost Range and how they had sunk their differences in standing together against an attack of the Indians
He extolled Dicks bravery relating how severely wounded he had stood off the savages to enable himself to escape
When he handed over Dicks watch to Echofor he had learned on his return that she was betrothed to Laneas a last token from her lover no doubt remained in the minds of his hearers of the truth of his story and Payson and Bud Lane gave up their purposed expedition
The owner of Sweetwater Ranch while accepting McKees account could not wholly forget the halfbreeds former evil reputation and was reserved in his reception of the advances of the exrustler who was anxious to curry favor
Warmhearted impulsive Bud however whose fraternal loyalty had increased under his bereavement to the supreme passion of life took the insinuating halfbreed into the aching vacancy made by his brothers death
The two became boon companions to the great detriment of the younger mans morals
McKee had plenty of money which he spent liberally gambling and carousing in company with Bud
Polly was wild with indignation at her sweethearts desertion and savagely upbraided him for his conduct whenever they met which may be inferred grew less and less frequently
It was in revenge she made advances to another man who long loved her from afar
This was William Henry Harrison Hoover sheriff of the county known as Slim Hoover by the humorous propensity of men on the range to give nicknames on the principle of contraries for he was fattest man in Pinal County
Slim was one of those fleshy men who have nerves of steel and muscles of iron
A round boyish face twinkling blue eyes flaming red hair gave him an appearance entirely at variance with his personality
A vein of sentiment made him all the more lovable
His associates ranchers men of the plains soldiers and the owners and frequenters of the frontier barroomrespected him greatly
Hes square as Slim was the best recommendation ever given of a man in that region
Pinal County settlers had made Slim sheriff term after term because he was the one citizen supremely fitted for the place
He had ridden the range and busted broncos before election After it he hunted wrongdoers
Right was right and wrong was wrong to him
There was no shading in the meaning
All he asked of men was to ride fast shoot straight and deal squarely in any game
He admitted that murder horsestealing and branding another mans calves were subjects for the unwritten law
But in his code this law meant death only after a fair trial with neighbors for a jury
He was not scrupulous that a judge should be present
His duties were ended when he brought in his prisoner
Hoovers rule had been marked by the taming of bad men in Florence and a truce declared in the guerrilla warfare between the cattlemen and the sheepmen on the range
Slims seemingly superfluous flesh was really of great advantage to him it served as a mask for his remarkable athletic abilities and so lulled the outlaws with whom he had to deal into a false sense of superiority and security
Slow and lethargic in his ordinary movementsin an emergency he was quick as a panther never failing to get the drop on his man
Furthermore his fat exerted a beneficial influence on his character in keeping him humbleminded
Being the most popular man in the county he would probably have been swollen with vanity had there been any space left vacant for it in his huge frame
He was especially admired by the women but was at ease only in the company of those who were married
It was his fate to see the few girls of the region with every one of whom by turns he was in love grow up to marry each some less diffident wooer
Dangnation take it
he used to say I dont git up enough spunk to cut a heifer out o the herd until somebody else has roped her and slapped his brand onto her
Talk about too many irons in the fire why Ive only got one and its het up red all the time waitin fer the right chanct to use it but some how I never git it out o the coals
Hell
whats the use anyhow
Nobody loves a fat man
Slim was inordinately puffed up by Pollys preference of him which she showed by all sorts of feminine tyrannies and he was forced continually to slap his huge paunch to remind himself of what he considered his disabling deformity
Miss Polly he would apostrophize the absent lady you dont know what a volcano of seethin fiery love this here mountain of flesh is that your walkin over
Some day Ill erupt and jest eternally calcify you if you dont look out
The sheriff took no stock in Buck McKees professed reformation and was greatly worried over the influence he had acquired over Bud Lane who had before this been Slims protege
Accordingly he readily conspired with her to break off the relations between the former outlaw and the young horsewrangler but thus far had met with no success
Payson feeling himself absolved by the death of Dick Lane from all obligations to his friend began openly to woo Echo Allen but without presuming upon the revelation of her love for him which she had made at his proposition to go into the desert to Lanes rescue
She responded to his courteous advances as frankly and naturally as a bud opens to the gentle wooing of the April sun
Softened by her grief for Dick as for a departed brother as the flower is by the morning dew the petals of her affection opened and laid bare her heart of purest gold
The gentle diffident girl expanded into a glorious woman conscious of her powers and proud and happy that she was fulfilling the highest function of womanhood that of loving and aiding with her love a noble man
Jack Payson however failed to get the proper credit for this sudden flowering of Echos beauty and charm
These were ascribed to her years schooling in the East and her proud mother was offended by the way in which she accepted the young ranchmans advances
You hold yourself too cheap she said
It is at least due to the memory of poor Dick Lane whom now that he was safely dead she idealized as a type of perfect manhood that you make Jack wait as long as you did him
When Payson reasonably objected to this delay by pointing out he was fully able to support a wife as Lane had not been and proposed with Echos assent six months as the limit of waiting Mrs Allen resorted to her expedienttears
BOOHOO
you are going to take away my only daughter
The Colonel however though he had loved Dick as if he were his own son was delighted to the bottom of his hospitable soul that it was a man not already in the family circle who was to marry Echo especially when he was a royal fellow like Jack Payson so he arranged a compromise between the time proposed by Mrs Allen and that desired by the lovers and the date of the wedding was fixed nine months ahead
It will fall in June said the old fellow who knew exactly how to handle his fractions wife the month when swell folks back in the East do all their hitchin up
Why come to think of it it was the very month I ran off with you in though I didnt know then that we was elopin so strictly accordin to the Book of Etikwet
CHAPTER III A Womans Loyalty The first instinctive thought of a man reveals innate character those that follow the moral that he has acquired through environment and circumstances
That Jack Payson was at bottom good man is shown by his first emotion which was joy and his first impulse which was to impart the glad news to everybody upon receiving the letter from Dick Lane telling that he was alive and soon to come home
He was in his house at the time
Bud Lane had just brought in the packet of mail from Florence and was riding away
Jack uttered a cry of joy which brought the young man back to the door
What is it
asked Bud
But Jack had already had time for his damning second thought
He was stunned by the consideration that the promulgation of the news in the letter meant his loss of Echo Allen
He dissembled though as yet he was not able to tell an outright falsehood Its a letter telling me that I may expect to receive enough money in a month or so to pay off the mortgage
Now your brothers debt neednt trouble you any longer Bud
Wheww
whistled Bud
Thats great
Where does it come from
Oh from an old friend that I lent the money to some time ago
But say Bud theres another matter I want to talk with you about
Youve got to shake Buck McKee
Ive got it straight that he is the worst man in Arizona Territory yes worse than an Apache
Why he has been with Geronimo torturing and massacring lone prospectors and robbing them of their gold
Thats a damned lie Jack Payson and you know it
cried the hotheaded young man
It was Buck McKee who stood by Dicks side and fought the Apaches
And Ill stand by Buck against all the world
Everybody is in a conspiracy against him Polly and Slim Hoover and you
Why are you so ready now to take a slanderers word against his
You were keen enough to accept his story when it let you out of going to Dicks rescue and gave you free swing to court his girl
Let me see the name of the damned snakeinthegrass thats at the bottom of all this
And he snatched for the letter in Paysons hand
The ranchman quickly thrust the missive into pocket
The injustice of Buds reflections on former actions gave to his uneasy conscience just the pretext he desired for justifying his present course
His cause being weak and unworthy he whipped up his indignation by adopting a high tone and overbearing manner even demeaning himself by using his position as Buds employer to crush the younger man
Indeed at the end of the scene which ensued he wellnigh convinced himself that he had been most ungratefully treated by Bud while sincerely attempting to save the boy from the companionship of a fiend in human guise
No matter who told me young man he exclaimed I got it straight and you can take it straight from me
You either give up Buck McKee or the Sweetwater Ranch
Snakeinthegrass
he was working himself up into false passion it is you ungrateful boy who are sinking the serpents tooth in the hand that would have helped you
I tell you that I intended to make you foreman though Sagebrush Charley is an older and better man
It was for Dicks sake I would have done it
No
Bud burst forth for your guilty consciences sake
It would have been to pay for stepping into Dicks place in the heart of a faithless girl
To hell with your job Im through with you
And leaping on his horse Bud rode furiously back to rejoin Buck McKee in Florence
Jack Paysons purpose was now cinched to suppress Dick Lanes letter until Echo Allen was irrevocably joined to him in marriage
He argued with himself that she loved him Jack Payson yet so loyal was she by nature that if Dick Lane returned before the wedding and claimed her she would sacrifice her love to her sense of duty
This would ruin her life he reasoned and he could not permit it
There was honesty in this argument but he vitiated it by deferring to act upon the suggestion that naturally arose with it Why then not take Jim Allen Echos father to whom her happiness was the chief purpose in life into confidence in regard to the matter
There will be time enough to tell the Colonel before the wedding he thought
In the meantime something might happen to Dick and he may never return
He is certain not to get back ahead of his money
After the time that the note secured by the mortgage fell due the young ranchman had already secured two extensions of it for three months each
He arranged a third and began negotiating for the sale of some of his cattle to take up the note at the time of payment
I cant take the money from Dick he thought even if he does owe it to me
And yet if I refuse it it will be like buying Echopaying for stepping into Dicks place as Bud expressed it
What to do I dont know
Well events will decide
And by this favorite reflection of the moral coward Jack Payson marked the lowest depths of his degradation
That afternoon Payson rode to Allen Hacienda to see Echo and to sound her upon her feelings to Dick Lane
He wished thoroughly to convince himself that he Jack Payson held complete sway over her heart
Perhaps he might dare to put her love to the test and fulfil the trust his friend had imposed on him by giving her Dicks letter
Payson overtook Polly riding slowly on her way home from Florence
She barely greeted him
Has she met Bud and has he been slurring me
he thought
He checked his pacing horse to the halftrot halfwalk of Pollys mount and ignoring her incivility began talking to her
Dyeh see Bud in Florence
Yep
Couldnt help it
Him an Buck McKee are about the whole of Florence these days
Too bad about Bud consorting with that rustler
Ive had to fire him for it
Fire him
Well you ARE a good friend
Talk about mens loyalty
If women threw men down that easy you all would go to the bowwows too fast for us to bake dogbiscuit
Now Ive settled Buck McKees hash by putting Slim Hoover wise to that tongueslittin
Oh Ill bring Bud around all right all right even if men that ought to be his friends go back on him
But Pollykins Dont you girlie me Jack Payson
Im a woman and Im goin to be a married one too in spite of all you do to Bud
Yes sirree bob
Ive set out to make a man of him and Ill marry him to do it if he aint a dollar to his name
But moneyd make it lots quicker an easier
He was savin up till he run in with Buck McKee
A sudden thought struck Payson
Here was a way to dispose of Dick Lanes money when it came
All right Mrs
Bud Lane to be
Promise not tell Bud and through you Ill soon make good to him many times over for the foremans wages hes lost
Its money thats coming from an enterprise that his brother and I were partners in and Bud shall Dicks share
Hes sore on me now and I cant tell him
Besides hed gamble it away before he got it to Buck McKee
Bud isnt strictly ethical in regard to money matters Polly and you must manage the exchequer
Gee what funny big words you use Jack
But I know what you mean hes too freehanded
Well hell be savin as a trade rat until we get our home paid for
And Ill manage the checker business when were married
No more poker and keno for Bud
Thank you Jack
I always knew you was square
Pollys sincere praise of his squareness was the sharpest thrust possible at Paysons guilty conscience
Well he resolved to come as near being square and level as he could
He had told halftruths to Bud and Polly he would present the situation to Echo as a possible though not actual one
If Polly were wrong and Echo loved him so much that she would break the word she had pledged to Dick Lane then he would confess all and they would do what could be done to make it right with the discarded lover
Echo observing from the window who was Pollys companion ran out to Jack with a cry of joy
He looked meaningly at Polly
She said Oh give me your bridle I know how manys a crowd
Jack leaped to the ground and took Echo in his arms while Polly rode off with the horses to the corral singing significantly Spoon spoon spoon While the dish ran away with the spoon
Jack and Echo embraced clingingly and kissed lingeringly
It takes a crazy old song like that to express how foolish we lovers are said Jack
Why I feel that I could outfiddle the cat outjump the cow outlaugh the dog and start an elopement that would knock the performance of the tableware as silly aswell as I am talking now
Im living in a dreama Midsummer Nights Dream such as you were reading to me
The lunatic the lover and the poet quoted Echo suggestively
Dusk was falling
From the bunkhouse rose the tinkling notes of a mandolin after a few preliminary chords the player a Mexican began a lovesong in Spanish
The distant chimes of Mission bells sounded softly on the evening air
Jack and Echo sat down upon the steps of the piazza
Jack continued the strain of his thought but in a more serious vein Echo Im so happy that I am frightened
Frightened
she asked wonderingly
Yes scareddownright scared he answered
I reckon Im like an Indian
An Indian doesnt believe its good medicine to let the gods know hes big happy
For theres the Thunder Bird The Thunder Bird
The evil spirit of the storm continued Jack
When the Thunder Bird hears a fellow saying hes big happy he sends him bad luck Echo laid her hand softly on the mouth of her sweetheart
We wont spoil our happiness then by talking about it
We will just feel itjust be it
She laid her head upon jacks knee
He placed his arm lightly but protectingly over her shoulder
They sat in silence listening to the Mexicans song
Finally Jack bent over and whispered gently in her ear Softly so the Thunder Bird wont hear Echo tell me you love me that you love only me that you will always love me no matter what shall happen that you never loved until you loved me
Echo sat upright with a start
What do you mean
she exclaimed
Of course I love you and you only but the future and the past are beyond our control
Unless you know of something that is going to happen which may mar our love your question is silly not at all like your Mother Goose nonsense that was dear
And as for the past you mean Dick Lane
Yes I mean Dick Lane confessed Payson in a subdued tone
I am jealous of himthat iseven of his memory
That is not like Jack Payson
What has come over you
It is the shadow of your Thunder Bird
You know what my feeling was for Dick Lane and what it is for it remains the same the only difference being that now I know it never was love
Even if it were he is dead and I love you Jack you alone
Oh how you shame me by forcing me to speak of such things
I have tried to put poor Dick out of my mind for every time I think of him it is with a wicked joy that he is dead that he cannot come home to claim me as his wife
Oh Jack Jack I didnt think it of you
And the girl laid her face within her hands on her lovers knee and burst into a fit of sobbing
Jack Payson shut his teeth
Well since I have lowered myself so far in your esteem and since your mind is already sinning against Dick Lane we might as well go on and settle this matter
I promise I will not mention it again
I too have troubles of the mind
I am as I am and you ought to know it
I said I was jealous of Dick Lanes memory
It is more
I am jealous of Dick Lane himself
If he should return would you leave me and go with himas his wife
Again she sat upright
By a strong effort she controlled her sobbing
The man I admired does not deserve an answer but the child he has proved himself to be and whom I cannot help loving shall have it
Yes if Dick Lane returns true to his promise I shall be true to mine
She arose and went into the house
Payson rode homeward through the starlight resolved of tormenting doubt only to be consumed by torturing jealousy
He now had no thought of confiding in Jim Allen
He regretted that he had touched so dangerously near the subject of Dick Lanes return in talking to Bud and Polly
His burning desire was to be safely married to Echo Allen before the inevitable return of her former lover
Fool that I was not to ask her one more question Would she forgive her husband where she would not forgive her lover
What will she think of me when all is discovered as it surely will be
Well I must take my chances
Events will decide
On his return to Sweetwater Ranch he put the place in charge of his new foreman Sagebrush Charlie and went out to a huntingcabin he had built in the Tortilla Mountains
Here he fought the problem over with his conscienceand his selfishness won
He returned fixed in his decision to suppress Dick Lanes letter and to go ahead with the marriage
CHAPTER IV The Holdup Riding hard into Florence from Sweetwater Ranch Bud Lane hunted up Buck McKee at his favorite gamblingjoint and in a white heat of indignation informed him in detail of everything that had passed between Payson and himself
At once McKee inferred that the writer of the letter was none other than Dick Lane
Realizing that Payson was already informed of his villainy and that in a very short time Dick Lane himself would make his appearance on the Sweetwater the halfbreed concluded to make a bold move while he yet retained the confidence of Bud
Bud he said I know the man who is sendin the money to Payson
Its Dick your brother
But stammered Bud his brain whirling if thats so you lied about the Apaches killing him youwhy youmust have been the renegade the devil who tortured prospectors
Why Bud Dick never wrote all that dimenovel nonsense about the man who stood by him towell not the very last for Dick has managed somehow to pull throughprobably he was saved by the Rurales that were chasin the band that rounded us up
No its Payson Jack Payson that made up that pack of lies just to keep you away from me the man that was last with Dick and so may get on to Jacks game and block it
Game
what game
asked Bud bewildered
Why you told me it yourselfto marry Dicks girl and live on Dicks hardearned money
But Dick borrowed the three thousand of Jack objected Bud
Well the dollars he borrowed have all gone aint they
And the money hes sendin back Dick dug out of the ground by hard work didnt he
Leastways Payson hadnt ort o use the money to rope in Dicks girl
It ort o be kep from him anyhow till Dick comes on the ground his own self
That ud hold up the weddin all right if I know Josephine
It ud be easy to steer her into refusin to let Echo go into a mortgiged home
Simpleminded Bud readily accepted the wily halfbreeds explanations and surmises and fell into the trap he was preparing
This was to hold up the expressagent and rob him of the money Payson was expecting on securing which it was McKees intention to flee the country before Dick Lane returned to denounce him
To ascertain just when the money came into the agents hands and to act as a cover in the robbery itself an accomplice was needed
For this purpose no man in all the Sweetwater region was better adapted than Bud Lane
Frank and friendly with every one he would be trusted by the most suspicious and cautious official in Pinal County
The fact that he had chosen Buck McKee as an associate had already gone far to rehabilitate this former bad man in the good graces of the community
Under cover of this friendship McKee hoped to escape suspicion of any part in the homicide he contemplated
For it was murder foul unprovoked murder that was in the black soul of the halfbreed
He intended to incriminate Bud so deeply as to put it beyond all thought that he would confess
Young Lane passionately loyal to his brother was ready for anything that would delay Paysons marriage to Echo Allen
Together with the wild joy that sprang up in his heart at the thought that his brother was alive was entwined a violent hatred against his former employer
In the fierce turbulence within his soul generated by the meeting of these great emotions he was impelled to enter upon a mad debauch in which McKee abetted and joined him
Filling up on bad whisky they rode through the streets of Florence yelling and shooting their guns like crazy men
It was while they were engaged in this spectacular exhibition of horsemanship gunplay and vocalization that Buds sweetheart rode into town to execute some commissions in preparation for Echo Allens wedding
Already blue over the thought that her own wedding was far in the dim future poor Polly was cast into the depths of despair and disgust by the drunken riot in which her prospective husband was indulging with her particular aversion the cruel calftorturing halfbreed McKee
Thoroughly mortified she slipped out of town by a side street and moodily rode back to Allen Hacienda meeting on the way as we have seen Jack Payson
After the debauch was over and the merry mad devil of nervous excitement was succeeded by the brooding demon of nervous depression McKee broached to Bud the idea of robbing the expressagent of the money coming to Payson
This fell in readily with the young mans revengeful mood
He unreservedly placed himself under the halfbreeds orders
In accordance with these Bud hung about the roadstation a great deal cultivating the friends of Terrill the agent
Ole Man Terrill as he was called although he was a vigorous specimen of manhood on the under side of sixty was ticket and freight agent expressmessenger and telegraphoperatorin fact the entire Bureau of Transportation and communication at Florence station
Bud frankly told him he was out of a job and had indeed decided in view of his coming marriage to give up horsewrangling for some vocation of a more elevating character
So Terrill let him help about the station chiefly in the clerical work
While so engaged Bud learned that a package valued at three thousand dollars was expected upon a certain train
Although consignee was mentioned the fact that the amount tallied exactly with the sum Payson was expecting caused him to conclude it was Dicks repayment of his loan
Accordingly he informed McKee that the time they were awaiting had arrived
Florence had grown up as a settlement about a spring of water some time before the advent of the railroad
Builders of the line got into trouble with the inhabitants and in revenge located the station half a mile away from the spring thinking new settlers would come to them
In this they were disappointed
The point was an isolated one and the station a deserted spot between trains
Eastward and westward the single track of railroad drifted to shimmering points on the horizon
To the south dreary wastes of sand glistening white under the burnished sun and crowned with clumps of grayish green sagebrush stretched to an encircling rim of hills
Cacti and yucca palms broke the monotony of the roll of the plains to the uplands
Sahuaroes towered over the low station which was built in the style of the old Spanish missions
Its red roof flared above the purple shadows cast by its walls
In the fathomless blue above a buzzard sailed majestically down an air current and hovered motionless over the lonely outpost of civilization
Within the station a telegraphsounder chattered and chirruped
Ole Man Terrill was at the instrument
His duties were over for the forenoon the eastbound express which with the westbound composed the only trains that traversed that section of the road each day having arrived and departed a halfhour before and he had cut in on the line to regale himself with the news of the world
But there was a dearth of thrilling events such as his rude soul delighted in
The Apache uprising that was feared had not taken place
Colonel Hardie of Fort Grant had the situation well in hand
The Nihilists were giving their latest czar a breathingspell
No new prizefighter had arisen to wrest the championship of the world from John Sullivan who had put all his old rivals to sleep
Ole Man Terrill proceeded to follow their example
He had been up late the night before at a poker game
His head fell forward with a jerk
Aroused by the shock he glanced drowsily about him
Heatwaves danced before the open window
Deep silence hung over his little world
Again his eyelids closed his head dropped and slowly he slipped into sleep
Tragedy was approaching him now but not along the wire
Down an arroyo or draw the dry bed of a watercourse that wound in a detour around the town of Florence and debauched into the open plain near the station crept two men in single file each leading a horse
They were Buck McKee and Bud Lane who had ridden north from the town that morning with the declared purpose of going to Bucks old ranch the Lazy K They had circled about the town timing their arrival at the station a little after the departure of the train which was expected to bring Dick Lanes money
McKee emerged first from the mouth of the draw
He wore a coarse flannel shirt loosened at the throat
About his neck was a handkerchief
His ridingoveralls were tucked into high boots with Spanish heels and long spurs
A Mexican hat with a bead band topped a head covered with coarse black hair which he inherited from his Cherokee mother
Save for the vulture floating high in air not a living thing was in sight
With the caution of a coyote McKee crept to the station door and peered blinkingly through the open door into the room
The change from the dazzling light without to the shaded interior blinded him for a moment
He heard the heavy breathing of the sleeper before he saw him
Returning to the mouth of the arroyo McKee motioned to his companion to bring out the horses
When this was done the two men cinched the saddles and made every preparation for sudden flight
Lane and the horses remained outside the station behind a freightcar on a siding while McKee stole softly through the open door to Ole Man Terrills side
Now the agent used as a safedeposit vault his inside waistcoat pocket the lock upon which was a huge safetypin
For further defense he carried a revolver loosely hung at his hip and easily reached
His quickness on the draw in the hour of need and his accuracy of aim made him a formidable antagonist
Some men are born into the world to become its watchdogs others to become its wolves
The presence of a human wolf is as it were scented by the human watchdog even when the dog is asleep
McKee was known instinctively as a manwolf to the born guardians of society Slim Hoover himself a high type of the manmastiff used to say of the halfbreed I can smell that bargrease he slicks his hair with agin the wind
He may be out o sight an out of mind when somethin tells me McKees around then I smell bargrease and the next thing Bucky shows up
with his ingrasheatin grin
Its alluz grease before meet as the Sky Pilot would say
Ole Man Terrill was of the watchdog breed
Whether warned by the instinct of his kind or wakened by the scent of McKees beargrease he suddenly opened his eyes
Like all men accustomed to emergencies he was instantly in full possession of his wits yet he pretended to be slightly confused in order to get a grasp upon the situation before greeting his visitor
Howdy Buck he said adjusting his revolver as he swung halfround in his chair that he might reach his weapon more readily in an emergency
Bustin or busted
Well Im about even with the game replied McKee pulling from his pocket a bag of tobacco and papers and deftly rolling a butterfly cigarette
Goin to shake it before I lose my pile
Its me for the Lazy K Dropped in to say goodby
Terrill who had recently had an expensive seance with McKee at poker remonstrated Yuh ought o give me another chanct at yuh Buck
Yore goin away with too much of my money
Well Ole Man Im likely to rob yuh of a lot more ef you aint keerful answered McKee
Yuh cant jet yeta while said Terrill
Dead broke
Aw come off
everybody knows yere a walkin bank
Bet yuh got three thousan in that inside pocket o yourn this minute
Terrill started at McKees naming the exact amount he was carrying
He forgot his customary caution in his surprise
Well you did just hit it shore enough
I believe yere half gipsy instid o halfInjun
Jus like yer knowin I stood pat on four uv a kind when you had aces full and throwin down yer cyards fore I cud git even with yuh
How do yuh do it Buck
McKee gave a smile of cunning inscrutable superiority
Oh its jes a power I has
Keen sabby as the Greasers sayIm keen on the knowhow
Why I kin tell yuh more about the money
Its fer Jack Payson Now theres whur yere way off as a cleervoyant Buck said Terrill triumphantly
Yuh guessed oncet too often as yer old pard on the Lazy K said to the druggist
Peruna
ast the druggist
Yep said yer pard
Beginnin mild on a new jag
ast the druggist a second time
Hell no
said yer pard they calls Peruna now from the insihdent ending up strong on an old one
Nope the three thousan is county money consigned to Sheriff Hoover
Jack Payson has jes lef with a package from K C but it wasnt money
It was a purty gilt chaira weddinpresent fer the gal hes gon to marry
At that moment the sounder of the telegraph began clicking the call of the station
Terrill whirled about in his swivelchair and faced the table
McKee stood close behind him
His lips twitched nervously
His eyes narrowed as he watched every movement of the agents big shoulders as he operated the key
At the same time the halfbreed drew his revolver and covered the back of Terrills head
The agent completed his message and turned to continue his interrupted conversation
He found himself gazing into the muzzle of a 44 big it seemed as a thirteeninch gun
Why what
he stammered
Im actin jes now as Slims deppity said McKee
Unbutton an han that money over
Once having his victim in his power all the innate cruelty of the Indian blood of his maternal ancestors flashed to the surface
Terrill was at his mercy
For one desperate moment he would play with him even torture him as his forefathers had once made miserable the last moments of a captive
He knew that unless he silenced Terrill his life must pay the forfeit
Death was the penalty of detection
The arm of the express company was long
Ultimate capture was certain
Pursued out of Arizona by the sheriff he would be trailed through every camp and town in the far West
With an oath Terrill tried to rise and face his antagonist reaching for his revolver as he did so
The butt of his weapon had caught in the arm of the chair hampering his movements
McKee threw him roughly back into the chair
Throw up your hans he cried
Dont try that
Up went Terrills hands high over his head
He faced the open window
Not a sign of help was in sight
Quickly the agent turned over in his mind various schemes to foil McKee who now stood behind him with the muzzle of his revolver pressing into the middle of his back
Each was rejected before halfconceived
McKee laughed sneeringly saying You oughtnt to be so keerless to show where you cache your roll
Worse than a senorita with a stocking
She never keeps a whole pair when Manuel is playing faro
Terrill made no reply
His hope of escape was slowly fading
McKee had reached his left hand over his prisoners shoulder to disarm Terrill who moved slightly away from him drawing in his feet as he did so
One chance had come to him
He knew that if he failed death was certain yet he determined to take the risk in order to retrieve the slip he had made in admitting that he had money in his possession to a gambling crony and so to keep clean his record for trustiness of which he was so proud
This last desperate resource was an old wrestlers trick one with which he had conquered others in the rough games of the corral
Again Terrill moved to the right and farther under McKee who had to extend his arm and body far beyond an upright position
Holding his revolver against Terrill handicapped the halfbreed in his movements
With a quick turn Terrill grasped McKees left arm jerking it down sharply on his shoulder
With his right hand he grasped the back of his antagonists neck pulling his head downward and inward
Using his shoulder for a fulcrum with a mighty heave of his legs and back he sought to toss McKee over his head
So surprised for an instant was the cowboy by suddenness of the attack that he made no effort escape the clutches of the desperate expressagent
His feet had left the floor and he was swinging in the air before his finger pressed the trigger
There was a muffled report
The two men fell in a heap on the floor McKee on top
Dazed and shaken McKee scrambled to his feet
The air was pungent with odor of powder smoke
Terrill rolled over on his side trembled convulsively and died
He had paid the penalty for a moments indiscretion with his life
McKee quickly unfastened the pin and seized the roll of bills
Skimming through the package he smiled with satisfaction to see that the most of it was in small bills and none of them stained
Carefully avoiding the fastforming pool of blood which was oozing from the hole in the dead mans head he hurried to the door
A glance showed him the coast was clear
Running across the tracks he joined Lane who was waiting for him behind the freightcar with impatience
In silence they mounted their horses
For a short distance McKee led the way upon the railroadtrack in order to leave no hoofprints and then struck across the desert toward the hills in the south
Why did you shoot
gasped Lane
He drew on me snarled McKee
It wasnt Dicks money but youll get half
Shut up
The burning sun rose higher and higher
The buzzard dropped lower in the sky
The silence of death brooded over the railroadstation
CHAPTER V Hoover Bows to Hymen Unknown to Bud Lane and Buck McKee who were rioting in Florence Jack Payson had hurried up the wedding
Colonel Jim had wheedled Josephine into consenting that it should take place two months ahead of the time that had been fixed
April is the month fer showers Josie an well let you weep all you please
Two weeks notice however gave scant time for preparation for the important ceremony that Mrs Allen deemed necessary
During this period the busiest spot in Arizona was the kitchen of Allen hacienda
An immense cake big as a cheese was the crowning effort of Josephine who wept copiously at the thought of losing her daughter as she measured and mixed the ingredients
A layer of frosting an inch in thickness encrusted this masterpiece of the art of pastrymaking
Topping the creation were manikins of a bride and bridegroom
This climax of the bridal cake had been brought up by wagon from Tucson with more caution than if it were a months cleanup of a paying mine
Mrs Allen allowed no one to go near the artistic achievement
Others might look at it from afar but at the slightest movement to get close to it she would push the observer back with the warning Keep yer dirty fingers offn it
Taint common icin thats confectionary
Enough chickens to feed a darky campmeeting were killed for the feast
Fried roasted cold or minced as tamales the dishes filled ovens and tables and overflowed into the springhouse
Favorite recipes carried across the plains by the wives of the Argonauts met in rivalry with the dishes of the cooks of old Mexico
Colonel Allen wandered aimlessly about the ranch while the preparations for the feast were in progress
The women folk drove him from one favorite loafingplace to another
His advice was scorned and his wishes made a subject for jests
Defiantly he had taken full charge of the liquid refreshments
A friendly barkeeper in Tucson acting under his orders had shipped him cases of champagne a barrel of beer and a siphon of seltzer
Why the seltzer he never could explain
Later the unlucky bottle marred the supper and nearly caused a tragedy
A guest picked it up and peered into the metal tube to see how the durned thing worked
As he gazed and pondered shaking the bottle in effort to solve the mystery he pressed the handle
The stream struck him fairly between the eyes
Shocked surprised and halfblinded he pulled his gun and declared immediate war on the sheepherder who had put up the job on him
Allens other supplies were of the kind taken straight in the Southwest and were downed with a hasty gulp
Driven from the house on the day of the wedding he took refuge on the piazza
From behind the hacienda floated dreamily on the sundrenched air the music of guitars and mandolins played by Mexicans practising for the dance which would follow the ceremony
The Colonel dozed and dreamed
Suddenly the peace of the afternoon was shattered by the wild yipyips of a band of cowboys riding up the trail
Revolvershots punctuated their shrill cries
Allen bounded from his chair shaking himself like a terrier
This riotous sound was the music he longed to hear
When the staccato beats of the ponies hoofs ceased he shouted Come on boys make this your home
Everything goes and the Sweetwater outfit is always welcome
The foreman was the first to pull up in front of the house
Hullo Uncle Jim
he cried
Hello Sagebrush answered the Colonel a broad smile illuminating his face
Holding his pipe in one hand he licked his lips at the thought of lickering up without the invention of an excuse for his wife
Then he joined in a hearty laugh with the men about the corral as he heard the grunts and stamping of a plunging mustang
A cowpony had entered into the spirit of the occasion and was trying to toss his rider over his head
Fresno was the victim of the horses deviltry
His predicament aroused wild shouts of mirth and sallies of the wit of the corral
Hunt leather Fresno or hell buck you clean over the wall shouted Sagebrush
Grab his tail yelled Show Low with a whoop
All over was the chorus as Fresno with a vicious jab of his spurs and a jerk of the head brought the animal into subjection
Come right in boys
called Allen
Let the Greasers take the hosses
With shrill shouts whoops and much laughter the guests crowded about the ranchman
Each wore his holiday clothes new handkerchiefs were knotted about their necks
Fresno had stuck little American flags in the band of his hat the crown of which he had removed
I want headroom for the morning after he had said
Show Lows chaps were conspicuously new and his movements were heralded by the creaking of unsoftened leather
Last of the band was Parenthesis short bowlegged with a face tanned and seamed by exposure
The cowboys ran stiffly toeing slightly inward
Long hours in the saddle made them apparently awkward and really ungraceful when on the ground
They greeted Allen with hearty enthusiasm slapping him on the back poking him in the ribs and swinging him from one to the other with cries of Howdy Uncle Jim
Howdy Sagebrush
Hello Fresno
Waltz right in Show Low
Glad to see you all
cried Allen as he in turn brought his hand down with ringing slaps upon shoulder and back
Meantime Parenthesis hopped about the outer edge of the ring seeking an entrance
Failing to reach his host he crowed How de doddle do to attract his attention
Allen broke from the ring
Grasping Parenthesis by the hand he said Im tolerable thankee Parenthesis
Wheres Jack didnt he come over with you
What
the boss
Aint he got here yet
asked the foreman
Tall and lean with hardened muscles Sagebrush Charley was as lithe as a panther on horseback
His first toy had been a rope with which as a toddler he had practised on the dogs and chickens about the ranchyard
He could not remember when he could not ride
Days on the roundup hours of watching the sleeping herd in the nightwatch had made him quiet and selfcontained in his dealings with men
His eyes looked out fearlessly on the world
All of his life he had handled cattle
Daily facing dangers on the long drives or in the corral he schooled himself to face emergencies
Acquiring selfcontrol he was trusted and admired
When Lyman the old foreman of the Sweetwater resigned Jack Payson promoted Sagebrush although next to Bud Lane he was at the time the youngest man in the outfit
He made his employers interests his own
At the mention of Paysons name he always became attentive
With a shade of anxiety he awaited Allens answer
No replied the ranchman looking from one of his guests to the other
Why he started three hours ahead of us
explained Parenthesis
With a challenging note in his tones as if his word was disputed the host answered Well he aint showed up
The little group had become silent
Arizona was in a period of unrest
Rumors of another Apache uprising were growing stronger each day
Then Payson was successful and therefore despised by less fortunate men ever eager for a quarrel
After a moments thought Sagebrush brushed aside his fears and brightened up his comrades with the remark Mebbe he rid over to Florence station to get a present for Miss Echo
He said somethin about gettin an artickle from Kansas City
Mebbe so agreed Allen eager to cast out any forebodings
Its time he continued he wuz turnin up if this weddins to be pulled off by the clock
Has the Sky Pilot got here yet
asked Sagebrush
No replied Allen
Hes started though
Theres one thing sartin we cant tighten up the cinches till the bridegroom gits here
The absence of Jack Payson and the failure of the minister to arrive aroused the suspicions of Sagebrush
Coming closer to Allen he smiled knowingly and speaking in a confidential tone asked Say Jim they aint figgerin on gittin away on the slylike are they
Show Low interrupted with the explanation You see were goin to decorate the wagon some
The suggestion that any one connected with Allen Hacienda would ride in anything on wheels except the driver of the chuckwagon out on roundup aroused the indignation of the old cattleman
For him the only use to which a wheeled vehicle drawn by a horse should be put was to haul materials that could not be packed on a horse
They aint using any wagon
he fairly shouted theyre goin away in the leather
The idea of carrying out the traditions of the horse in Pinal County even to a weddingjourney tickled the boys immensely
Slapping one another on the back and nodding their heads in approbation they shouted Thats the ticket
Hooray
This aint no New York idea where the bride and groom hits the lifetrail in a hired hack cried Fresno
Allens feelings apparently were not yet fully soothed
Turning to Sagebrush he said Wheels dont go in my family
Why her ma and me were married on hossback
The preacher had to make a hurry job of it but it took
Hush now was Parenthesis awed comment
For her pop was achasin us and kept it up for twenty miles after the parson said Amen
Did he ketch you
asked Fresno with great seriousness
He sure did answered Allen with a twinkle in his eye an thanked me for takin Josephine off his hands
The boys laughed
The joke was upon themselves as they had expected to hear a romantic story of earlier days
When the laughter had subsided Show Low suggested If we cant decorate the wagon lets put some fixins on the ponies
The proposal was received with more whoops shouting and yipping
They waltzed about the smiling rancher
Thats what
cried Sagebrush enthusiastically
Allen grew sarcastic remarking I reckon youall must have stopped some time at the watertank
Renewed laughter greeted this sally
This is my first wedding explained Sagebrush rather apologetically
I want to know
exclaimed Allen in surprise
Im tellin you
I never seed a weddin in all my life replied Sagebrush as seriously as if he was denying a false accusation of a serious crime
Mother used to tell me about hern an I often wisht I had been there
Fresno shouted with amusement
He had Sagebrush rattled
The coolest man on the ranch was flustered by the mere thought of attending a weddingceremony
Hes plum locoed over this one
Aint you Sagebrush
he drawled tauntingly
Sagebrush took his jibing in the best of humor
It was a holiday and they were with people of their own kind
Had a stranger been present the remarks would have been resented bitterly
On this point cowboys are particularly sensitive
In the presence of outsiders they are silent answering only in monosyllables never leading in any conversation and if any comment is necessary they make it indirectly
Well I aint no societybud like you are laughed Sagebrush
The others joined with him in his merriment over Fresnos discomfiture
Weddins aint so frequent where I come from as they is in Californy
Its the climate answered Fresno with a broad grin
So you aint never been at a weddin
asked Allen who was looking for another opening to have more fun with Sagebrush
Again the cowboy became serious and confessed Nope Ive officiated at several plain killins an been chief usher at a lynchin but this yeres my first weddin an Im goin to turn loose some and enjoy it
Sagebrush grinned in anticipation of the good times that he knew lay in store for him at the dance
Youre fixed up as if you was the main attraction at this event said Allen looking Sagebrush over carefully and spinning him around on his heel
Aint I mussed up fine
answered Sagebrush
Youre the sure big turkey interrupted Parenthesis
Served up fine with all the trimmins laughed Fresno taking another jab at his friend
Their sport was broken up for the time being by the appearance of Polly at the door of the ranchhouse
Hello boys she shouted with the fascinating cordiality of the Western girl wherein the breath of the plains the purity of the air and the wholesomeness of life is embraced in a simple greeting and the clasp of a hand
The cowboys took off their hats and made elaborate bows to the young woman
Howdy Miss Polly
they cried
You sure do look pert added Sagebrush with what he considered his most winning smile
Fresno snickered and hastily brushed back the hair from his forehead
Wheres Jack
she asked the two men who at once ranged themselves one on each side of her
He did not start with the boys explained Allen
Hell be along soon Polly
Well now when it comes to lookers whats the matter with Polly Hope
exclaimed Sagebrush slyly
Glances of admiration were cast at the girl who was dressed simply and plainly in a little white gown which Mrs Allen had made for her for the wedding
Pollys youth good nature and ability to take care of herself made her a favorite on the ranch
She had no need of defenders but if an occasion should arise that Polly required a knight there were a score of guns at her service at an hours notice
Looks like a picture from a book said Fresno hoping to win back the ground he had lost by Sagebrushs openly expressed admiration
Polly was flattered by the comments and the glances of the boys which expressed their approval of her appearance more loudly than spoken words
She pretended however to be annoyed
Go long she said
Wheres Bud Lane
Didnt you give him his invite
The boys turned from one to the other with feigned glances of disgust at being slighted by Polly for an absent one
The onesided courtship of Bud and Polly was known up and down the valley and indefinite postponement of their weddingday was one of the jests of the two ranches
Oh we sent it on to him at Florence
Hell git it in time if he aint gone to the Lazy K with Buck McKee said Sagebrush then turning to the other cowboys he added in an aggrieved tone Polly aint got no eyes for no one excep Bud
Polly stepped to Allens side and laying her head on his shoulder said Aint I
Allen patted the girls head
He was very fond of her looking upon her as another daughter
Polly smiled back into his face and then with a glance at the cowboys said Say Uncle Jim theres some bottles to be opened
The invitation was an indirect one but all knew what it meant and started for the house
Rootbeer added Polly mischievously the corks pull awful hard
Allen glanced at her in feigned alarm
What do you want to dostampede the bunch
Before she could answer the approach of a horse attracted the attention of the group
Theres Jack now
cried Sagebrush in tones which plainly showed his relief no it aint he added reflectively he rode his pacin mare and thats a trottin horse
The cry of the rider was heard quieting his mount
Allen recognized the voice
Its Slim Hoover he cried
Polly clapped her hands and said mischievously to Sagebrush Now youll see me makin googoo eyes to somebody besides Bud Lane
I aint agoing to be the only girl in Pinal County Slim Hoover aint set up to
An shied off from added Sagebrush a little nettled by Pollys overlooking him as a subject for flirtation
But whats Slim doin over this way
Come to Jacks weddin of course replied Polly adding complacently And probably projectin a hitchup of his own
Slim ran around the corner of the house directly into the crowd who seized him before he could recover from his surprise and proceeded to haze him to their intense delight and the Sheriffs embarrassment for he knew that Polly was somewhere near enjoying his discomfiture
Polly waited until her victim was fully ready for her particular form of torture
The reception of the cowboys was crude to her refined form of making the fat Sheriff uncomfortable
With the velvety cruelty of a flirt she held out her hand saying Hello Slim
The Sheriff flushed under his tan
The red crept up the back of his neck to his ears
He awkwardly took off his hat
With a bow and a scrape he greeted her Howdy Miss Polly howdy
Meantime he shook her hand until she winced from the heartiness of the grip
Whats the news
she asked as she slowly straightened out her fingers one by one
Theres been a killin over Florence way announced the Sheriff putting on his hat and becoming an officer of the law with duty to perform
Who is the misfortunate
asked Sagebrush as they gathered about Hoover and listened intently
Murder in Arizona was a serious matter and punishment was meted out to the slayer or he was freed by his fellow citizens
Far from courts of justice and surrounded by men to whom death was often merely an incident in a career of crime the settlers were forced to depend upon themselves to keep peace on the border
They acted quickly but never hastily
Judgment followed quickly on conviction
Their views were broad and rarely were their decisions wrong
Ole Man Terrill replied the Sheriff
Happened about ten this mornin
Some man caught him alone in the railroadstation and blowed his head halfoff
Do tell
was Allens exclamation
Yep continued the Sheriff
He must have pulled a gun on the fellow
He put up some sort of a fight as the room is some mussed up
Robbery
queried Polly with wideopen eyes
Thats what
answered Slim turning to her
He had three thousan dollars pinned in his vestcounty money for salaries
You know how he toted his wad around with him defyin man or the devil to get it way from him
Well some one who was both man an devil was too much for him
Who found him
I did myself
Went over around noon after the money
Didnt stop to go back to town fer a posse
Trail was already too cold
Could tell it was a man that rode a pacin horse
His auditors looked at each other striving to remember who of their acquaintance rode a pacing horse
Sagebrush Charley shook his head
Nobody down this way ceptin of course the boss rides a pacer
Must be one of the Lazy K outfit I reckon
Most likely said the Sheriff he struck out south probably to throw me off scent
Then he fell in with two other men and this balled me up
I lost one of the tracks but follered the other two round Sweetwater Mesa till I came where they rode into the river
Of course I couldnt follow the trail any farther at that pint so bein as I was near Uncle Jims I rode over fer help to look along both banks an pick up the trail wherever it comes out of the river
Sorry I must break up yer fun boys but some o yuh must come along with me
Dutys duty
I want Sagebrush anyhow as I spose I cant ask fer Jack Payson
Sagebrush pulled a long face
At any other time he would have jumped at the chance of running to earth the dastardly murderers of his old friend Terrill
But in the matter of this his first experience a wedding he had tickled his palate so long with the sweets of anticipation that he could not bear to forgo the culminating swallow of realization
I dont see why I shouldnt be let off as well as Jack he grumbled our cases are similar
You see its my first weddin explained the foreman to the sheriff
The other cowboys howled with delight
The humor of the situation caught their fancy and they yelled a chorus of protestation in Hoovers ears
In this Colonel Allen joined
Dont spile the weddin he pleaded
This event has already rounded up the Sweetwater outfit fer yuh an saved yuh more time than youll lose by waitin till its over
Then well all jine yuh
Hoover commanded silence and rolling a cigarette gravely considered the proposition
He realized that the murderers should be followed up at once but that if he forced the cowboys by the legal power exercised to forego the pleasure they had been anticipating so greatly they would not be so keen in pursuit as if they had first given the boss his sendoff
The considerations being equal or as he put it hoss an hoss it seemed to him wise to submit to Allens proposition backed as it was by the justice of his plan that the occasion of the wedding had already saved valuable time in assembling the posse
He assented therefore but to maintain the dignity of his office and control of the situation with apparent reluctance
Well hurry up the sacreements an ceremonies then an the minute the preacher ties the knot every man uv yuh but Jack an the parson an Uncle Jim gits on his boss an folluhs me
Ill wait out in the corral
At this there was another storm of expostulation led this time by Allen
Of course Hoover was to come to the wedding and be its guest of honor
You shall be the first to wish Jack and Echo lucky said Allen
That means youll be the next one to marry
The ruddyfaced Sheriff blushed to the roots of his auburn hair
Much obliged but I aint fixed up fer a weddin and he looked down at his travelstained breeches tucked in ridingboots white with alkalidust and felt of his buttonless waistcoat and gingham shirt open at the throat with the bandanna handkerchief his neck in lieu of both collar and tie
Polly assured him that he would do very well as he was that for her part she wouldnt want no betterdressed man than he to be present at her wedding not even the feller she was goin to be hitched up to whereat Slim Hoover was greatly set at ease
Polly was bounding up the piazza steps to tell Echo of the accession to her party when Hoover held up his hand
A terrifying suggestion had flashed through his mind
Hold on a minute
he exclaimed and turning to Allen he asked anxiously Does this yere guest of honor haf to kiss the bride
The question was so foreign to the serious topic which had just been under discussion that everyone laughed in relief of the nervous tension
Allens funloving nature at once bubbled to the surface
With an air of assumed anger he said to the Sheriff Of course every guest has to do it
Then turning to the cowboys he asked Is there any one as holds out strong objection to kissin my daughter
Not me laughed Sagebrush Im here to go the limit
Im an experienced kisser I am said Parenthesis I dont lose no chance at practise
Ill take two please simpered Fresno
Show Low interrupted the general sally which followed this remark saying I strings my chips along with Fresno
Slims afraid of females
drawled Polly provokingly
Oh thunder
exclaimed Slim to Polly
No I aint nothin of the sort
Im a peaceful man I am
I never likes to start no trouble
Get out whats one kiss
laughed Allen
Ive seen a big jackpot of trouble opened by chippin in just one kiss wisely remarked the Sheriff
Sagebrush at this point announced decisively The bride has got to be kissed
Slim tried to break through the group and enter the house thinking that by making such a move he would divert their attention and that in the excitement of the wedding he could avoid kissing the bride an ordeal which to him was more terrible than facing the worst gunfighter in Arizona
I deputize you to do the kissin for me he said to Parenthesis who had laid his hand shoulder to detain him
No siree the cowboy replied
Every man does his own kissin in this game
Slim halfturned as if undecided
Suddenly he turned on his heel started for the corral
Ill wait outside he shouted
No you dont
cried his companions
He turned to face a semicircle of drawn revolvers
He looked from one man to another as if puzzled what move to make next
Allen was annoyed by the sheriffs actions taking it as an insult that he would not kiss his daughter although he had started to twit the Sheriff in the beginning
You aint goin to insult me and mine that way
No man sidesteps kissin one of my kids he said angrily
Slim was plaintively apologetic I aint kissed a female since I was a yearlin
Time you started snapped Polly
You kiss the bride or I take it pussenel said Allen thoroughly aroused
Well if you put it that way Ill do it gasped Slim in desperation
The agreement restored the boys to their good nature
You will have to put blinders on me though and back me up cautioned Hoover
Well hogtie you and sit on your head laughed Sagebrush as the guests entered the house
CHAPTER VI A Tangled Web After fording Sweetwater River several times to throw pursuit off the track Buck McKee and Bud Lane entered an arroyo to rest their mounts and hold council as to their future movements
During the flight both had been silent McKee was busy revolving plans for escape in his mind and Bud was brooding over the tragic ending of the lawless adventure into which he had been led by his companion
When McKee callously informed him that the agent had been killed in the encounter Bud was too horrified to speak
A dry sob arose in his throat at the thought of his old friend lying dead all alone in the station
His first impulse was to turn back to Florence and surrender himself to the Sheriff
Had this entailed punishment of himself alone he would have done it but he still retained a blind loyalty in his associate and principal in the crime
Murder it seemed was to be expected when one took the law in his own hands to right an injustice
He didnt clearly understand it
It was his first experience with a killing
The heartlessness of McKee both awed and horrified him
Evidently the halfbreed was used to such actions
It appeared to be entirely justified in his code
So Bud followed in dull silence the masterful man who had involved him in the fearful deed
When they dismounted however his pentup emotion burst forth
You said there would be no killing he gasped passing his hand wearily across his forehead as if to wipe out the memory of the crime
Well what did the old fool pull his gun for
grumbled McKee petulantly as if Terrill was the aggressor in the encounter
Bud threw himself wearily on the ground
Id give the rest of my life to undo todays work he groaned speaking more to himself than to his companion
McKee heard him
His anger began to arise
If Bud weakened detection was certain
Flight back to Texas must be started without delay
If he could strengthen the will of the boy either by promise of reward or fear of punishment the chances of detection would lessen as the days passed
And that would be about twentyfour hours if you dont keep quiet
Why didnt he put up his hands when I hollered
He starts to wrastle and pull gun and I had to nail him
McKee shuddered spite of his bravado
Pulling himself together with an apparent effort he continued Well hold the money for a spellnot spend a cent of it till this thing blows overtheyll never get us
Here well divide it
Keep it all
I never want to touch a penny of it said Bud earnestly moving along the ground to place a greater distance between him and the murderer
Thanks
But you dont git out of your part of the holdup that easy
Take your share or Ill blow it into you said McKee pulling his revolver
Bud with an effort arose and walked over to Buck
With clenched fists in agonized tones he cried Shoot if you want to
I wish Id never seen youyou dragged me into thisyou made me your accomplice in a murder
McKee looked at him in amazement
This phase of human character was new to him trained as he been on the border where men rarely suffered remorse and still more rarely displayed it
Shucks
I killed himyou didnt have no hand in it answered Buck
This aint my first killin
I guess Buck McKees pretty well known in some sections
I took all the chances
I did the killin
You git half
Now brace up and take yer medicine straight
But I didnt want to take the money for myself replied Bud as if to soothe his conscience
Oh
Buck why didnt you let me alone
he continued as the thought of his position again overwhelmed him
Buck gasped at the shifting of the full blame upon his shoulders
Well Ill be darned
he muttered
You make me sick Kid
His voice rose in anger and disgust
Why to hear you talk one would think you was the only one had right feelins
Im goin to take my share and start a decent life
Im goin back to Texas an open a saloon
You take your half marry your gal and settle down right here
Ole Man Terrills dead nothin will bring him back an you might as well get the good o the money
Its Slim Hoovers anyhow
If Jack Payson can marry your brother Dicks gal on Dicks moneyfer theres no hope o stoppin that nowyou can cut Slim out with Polly on Slims salary
Aw take the money
and McKee pressed half of the bills into Buds lax fingers
The young mans hand closed upon them mechanically
A vague thought that he might some day make restitution conspired with McKees insidious appeal to his hatred and jealousy to induce him to retain the bloodmoney and he thrust it within an inside pocket of his loose waistcoat
Now said McKee thoroughly satisfied that he had involved Bud in the crime too deeply for him to confess his share in it well shake hands and say adios
Slim Hoovers probably on our track by this time but I reckon hell be some mixed in the trail around the mesa and give the job up as a bad one when he reaches the river
Ill show up on the Lazy K where the whole outfit will swear Ive been fer two days if Hoover picks on me as one of the men hes been follerin
Youre safe
Nobodyd put killin anybody on to you let alone your ole frien Terrill
Why yuh aint a man yet Bud though I dont it to discurrudge yuh
Youve made a start an some day yuh wont think no moren me of killin a feller what stans in yer way
I shouldnt be so turribly surprised if Jack Payson got whats comin to him someday
But what have you got there Bud
he inquired as he saw the young man holding a letter he had withdrawn from the pocket into which he had put the bills
Letter I got in Florence yesterday when I was too full to read it said Bud
He opened it
Why its from Polly
he exclaimed its an inviteby God
its an invite to Jack an Echos wedding
Its today
That damned scoundrel has hurried the thing up for fear Dick will get back in time to stop it
Buck McKee I believe youre right
I could kill Jack Payson with no more pity than I would a rattler or Gila monster
At this exhibition of hatred by his companion a new thought flashed suddenly through the satanic mind of the halfbreed
It involved an entire change of his plans but the devilish daring of the conception was irresistible
Say he broke in with seeming irrelevance dont Payson ride a pacin mare
Yes answered Bud what of it
Oh nothin said McKee it jus struck me as sorter funny
PAYSON and PACIN dont you see
Bud was mystified
Had his companion gone daft
McKee saw instantly that it would be very easy to fix the charge of murdering the stationagent upon Payson
The ranchman had evidently left the station a short time before the murder and had gone straight south to the Sweetwater
Unless it had become confused with their own tracks the trail would be a plain one owing to the fact that it was made by a pacing horse and the pursuit would undoubtedly follow this
Payson rode the only pacing horse in the Sweetwater and Bar One outfits and it was certain to come to light from Terrills receipts that he had been with the agent about the time of the killing
The motive for the robbery would be evident
Payson was in need of three thousand dollars to pay off the mortgage on his ranch
McKee said to Bud Ive changed my mind
I think Ill see a little fun before I break for Texas
Ill go with you to the weddin
But you aint got no invite objected Bud
Oh I reckon theyll take me along on yours
I know too much fer Payson to objeck to me too strenuous
They rode up to Allen Hacienda shortly after Slim Hoover had arrived
They could hear the merriment of the weddingguests in the kitchen
Loud laughter was punctuated by the popping of corks and McKee who rode in advance of Bud distinguished the voice of the Sheriff in expostulation against the general raillery concentrated upon him
The halfbreed grinned wolfishly
It was evident that the bloodhound of the law had tracked the supposed murderer just as the real criminal had conjectured and desired
Polly ran out on the piazza
She saw the man whom she regarded as her lovers evil genius
As he greeted her ingratiatingly Howdy Miss Polly she replied sharply You aint got no invite to this weddin
I come with my friend Bud he explained with an elaborate bow
I didnt see you Bud answered Polly slightly mollified as she crossed the dooryard to shake hands with her sweetheart
Buck offered her his hand but she ignored him
McKee shrugged his shoulders and started for the house
Bud hes some cast down because its not his weddin was McKees parting shot at the young couple
I low Ill go in and join the boys
Excuse me
With pleasure coldly replied the girl
The halfbreed ignored the sarcasm and answering innocently Much obliged he entered the house
Polly turned on Bud displaying her resentment
You an him always kick up the devil when youre together
What did you bring him along fer
she demanded
Its his last chance to see any fun around here hes leavin for Texas explained Bud
Fer how long
Fer good
Fer our good you mean
Theres too many of his kind comin into this country
Did you hear about Ole Man Terrill
Bud did not wait for her to explain but nervously answered They told us about it in Florence when we were coming through Weve been at the Lazy K Wasnt it dreadful
rattled on Polly
Slims herethe boys are goin to turn out with him after the weddin to see if they can ketch the feller who did the killin
Bud paled as he heard the news
To conceal his distress he moved toward the door
Anywhere to get away from the girl to whom he feared he would betray himself
Ill join em he huskily answered
Polly however could see no reason for his evident haste to leave her
She felt hurt but thought his actions were due to her scolding him for being with McKee
You aint ever ast me how I look she inquired seeking to detain him
You look fine complimented Bud perfunctorily
Wen a feller aint seen a feller in a week seems like a feller ought to brace up and start something replied Polly in an injured tone
Bud smiled in spite of his fears
Catching the girl in his arms he kissed her and said I was awaitin for the chance
Polly disengaged herself from his embrace and sighed contentedly
Thats something like it
Whats the use of bein engaged to a feller if you cant have all the trimmins that goes with it
You look as if you wasnt too happy
Bud pulled himself together with an effort
He realized that if he did not show more interest in the girl and the wedding he might be suspected of connection with the murder
He trumped up an explanation of his moodiness
Well what call have I to be happy
Aint I lost my job
Yes but thats because you were hotheaded gave your boss too much lip
But everything will come out all right
Jack says Has that lowdown liar an thief been comin it over you Polly
Did he tell you how he gave the place he promised me to Sagebrush
That wasnt until you gave him slack Bud
Im sure he aint a thief why Thief of course he is an a blackerhearted one than the man that killed Terrill
Aint he going to steal my brother Dicks girl this very night
But Dick is dead expostulated Polly
Dick aint dead I know itthat is he stammered I feel it in my bones he aint dead
An Jack feels it too thats why hes hurried up this weddin
But your own friend Buck McKee saw Dick just before the Paches killed him
But not after it
An Buck now thinks the Rurales may have come up in time to save him
Seems to me if thats so he has had time enough since then to write objected Polly
who was nevertheless impressed by Buds vehemence
How do you know that he has not written
Polly could only gasp
These accusations were coming too fast for her to answer
You cant tell what a man might do in a case like that
Perhaps Dicks way in the mountains away from the railroad prospectin down in the Ghost Range where he has been tryin to locate the lost lode
Theres lots of reasons for his not writing to Echo
But Echo doesnt seem to mind
A year an a half is enough to mend any womans heart
Now you began Polly who was growing angry under the charges which were being heaped on her two best friends by the overwrought boy
Bud would not let her finish but cried Echo never loved him
If she did she would not be acting like she is goin to tonight
Rushing to Echos defense Polly answered She may or may not have loved Dick Lane but I know that she loves Jack Payson now with all her heart and even if the Paches did not get your brother hes as dead to her as if they had
Polly was startled and confused by Buds accusations
Accordingly it was a relief to her when Payson appeared on the scene
They had been so interested in their conversation that they did not hear him ride up to the house
Hello Polly
Hello Bud
were his cordial greetings for he was determined to ignore his former employees hostility
Bud did not answer but looked moodily on the ground
To Eastern eyes Paysons weddingattire would appear most incongruous
About his waist was strapped a revolver
His ridingtrousers closefitting and corded were buttoned over the calves of his legs
Soft highly polished leather boots reached to his knees
His shirt was of silk deeply embroidered down the front and at the collar
His jacket gave him ample breathingroom about the chest but tapered at the waist and clung closely over the hips
He wore a sombrero and a knotted silk handkerchief
His face was deeply sunburned except a spot shaped like crescent just below the hairline on the forehead which was protected from the sun by the hat and the shade of the brim
A similar line of fairer skin ran around the edge of the scalp beginning over the ears
His hair shaded the upper part of his neck from the suns rays
When his hair was trimmed the untanned part showed as plainly as if painted
It is the mark of the plainsman in a city or on a holiday
Well its about time that you got here said Polly with a sigh of relief
Where have you been
I stopped over to Sam Terrills to see about something that I ordered from Kansas City
Then I had to go back to my ranch Bud started guiltily
Forgetting his determination to ignore Payson he asked anxiously
You didnt see Terrill did you
Oh yes
Why do you ask
Polly laid her hand on Paysons arm and told him briefly of the shooting of Terrill
Who shot him
he asked when she had finished
They dont knowhe was robbed of a pile of moneySlim Hoovers just rode over to get a posse she replied looking toward the door
At this bit of information Payson became anxious about the plans for his wedding
The ceremony was uppermost in his mind at the time
Well he can get one after the wedding
Then he asked Is the minister here yet
Polly laughingly replied Youre feelin pretty spry now but youll be as meek as a baby calf in a little while
In this section a bridegroom is treated worse than a tenderfoot
Payson smiled
He knew he was in for a thorough hazing by the boys
Thats all right
Ill get back at you some daywhen you and Bud Polly interrupted him with a remark about minding his own business
Bud avoided entering into the conversation
He had walked toward the door and was standing on the steps when he answered for Polly
Looks as if youre chances of gettin even with us is a long way off he said
Turning he entered the house to join the other guests who by the noise were enjoying Allens importations from Tucson to the bottom of every glass
Polly looked after Bud smiling quizzically
Buds mighty hopeful aint he
Aint you happy
You bet
Dont I look it
cried Jack rubbing his hands
Never thought I could be so happy
A fellow doesnt get married every day in the week
Not unless he lives in Chicago I hear its the habit there answered Polly
The sweetest girl in the Territory began Jack
You bet she is Polly broke in
If you just want to keep her lovin and lovin youall youve got to do is to treat her white and play square with her
Play square with her thought Payson
Was he playing square with her
He knew that he was not but the chance of losing her was too great for him to risk
For if you aint on the level with Echo Allen wellyou might as well crawl out of camp thats the kind of girl she is Polly exclaimed loyally
CHAPTER VII Josephine Opens the Sluices Entering the livingroom Bud found Echo surrounded by several girls from Florence and the neighboring ranches who were driving her almost distracted with their admiring attentions for she was greatly disturbed about her lovers inexplicable absence
Had she been free from the duties of hospitality she would have leaped on her horse and gone in search of him
Echos weddingattire would seem as incongruous as Jacks to the eyes of an Easterner yet it was entirely suited to the circumstances for the couple intended as soon as they were married to ride to a little huntingcabin of Jacks in the Tortilla Mountains where they would spend their honeymoon
She was dressed in an olivegreen ridinghabit which she had brought from the East
The skirt was divided and reached just below the knee her blouse of lighter material and brown in color was loose allowing free play for her arms and shoulders
High ridingboots were laced to the knee
A sombrero and ridinggloves lay on the table ready to complete her costume
Bud coldly acknowledged Echos affectionate and happy greeting and curtly informed her that Jack had arrived
She rushed out of doors with a cry of joy
Running across the courtyard toward her lover who awaited her with outstretched arms she began Well this is a nice time you outrageous when Polly stopped her with a mockserious look
Wait a minutewait a minute the girl drawled as if reining in a too eager horse dont commence calling lovenames before you get the hitchtime enough after
He has been actin up something scandalous with me
Jack threw up his hands in protest hastily denying any probable charge that the tease might make
Why I havent been saying a word
he cried
Polly laughed as she ran to the door
No you havent she answered mockingly as one agrees with a child whose feelings have been hurt
Hes only been tellin me he loved Pausing an instant she pointed at Echo ending her sentence with a shouted you
With her hand on Jacks shoulder Echo said Polly you are a flirt
Youve too many strings to your bow
You mean Ive too many beaux to my string
laughingly answered the girl
Youll have Slim Hoover and Bud Lane shooting each other up all on your account chided Echo
Nothing of the kind pouted Polly
Cant a girl have friends
But I know what you two are waiting for
What
asked Jack
You want me to vamose
Im hep
Ill vam
And Polly ran into the kitchen to tell the men that the bridegroom had arrived but couldnt be seen until the bride was through with an important interview with him
So she hustled them all into the livingroom where the girls were
This room was a long and low apartment roughly plastered
The heavy ceilingbeams hewn with axes were uncovered giving an old English effect although this was not striven for but made under the stress of necessity
The broad windows were trellised with vines through which filtered the sunshine
A cooling evening breeze stirred the leaves lazily
The chairs were broad and comfortablethe workmanship of the monks of the neighboring mission
In the corners stood squat earthen waterjars of Mexican molding
On the adobe walls were hung trophies of the hunt warbonnets and the crudely made adornments of the Apaches
Navajo blankets covered the windowseats and were used as screens for sets of shelves built into the spaces between the windows
Polly carried in on a tray a large bowl of punch surrounded by glasses and gourds
This was received with riotous demonstrations
She placed it in the center of a table made of planks laid on trestles and assisted by the other girls served the men liberally from the bowl
The guests showed the effects of outdoor life and training
Their gestures were full and free
The tones of their voices were highpitched but they spoke more slowly than their Eastern cousins as if feeling the necessity even when confined of making every word carry
No one lolled in his seat but sat upright as if still having the feel of the saddle under him
Toward women in all social gatherings the cowboys act with exaggerated chivalry but as Sagebrush would describe it they herd by their lonesome
There is none of the commingling of sexes seen in the East
At a dance the girls sit at one end of the room the men group themselves about the doorway until the music strikes up
Then each will seize his partner after the boldest has made the first move
When the dancemeasure ends the cowboy will rarely escort partner to her seat but will leave her to find her way back to her chum while he moves sheepishly back to the doorway to be received by his fellows with slaps on the back and loud jests
At table cowboys carry on little conversation with the girls
They talk amongst themselves but at the women
The presence of the girls leads them to play many pranks on one another
The ice is long in breaking for their habitual reserve is not easily worn off
Later in the evening this shyness is less marked
As Jack and Echo entered the doorway Parenthesis had arisen from his seat at the head of table and was beginning Fellow citizens Confused cries of Sit down Let him talk
greeted him
Sagebrush held up his hand for silence Go ahead Parenthesis he cried encouragingly
Parenthesis climbed on a chair and put a foot on the table
This was too much for the orderly soul of Mrs Allen
Take your dirty feet off my tablecloth
she commanded making a threatening move toward the offender
Allen restrained her and Fresno caused Parenthesis to subside by yelling Get down offen that table you idiot
Theres the bride an groom comin in behind you
We CAN see em through yer legs but we dont like that kin of a frame
Jack had slipped his arm about Echos waist
She was holding his hand smiling at the exuberance of their guests
Buck McKee who had been drinking freely staggered to his feet and hiccoughed Here now thisyere dont gothis spoonin businessthere aint goin to be no mush and milk served out before the weddin Will you shut up
admonished Slim Hoover
No siree cried the belligerent McKee
There aint no man here can shut me up
Im Buck McKee I am and when I starts in on a weddinfestivitiesI deal This is one game you are not in on answered Jack quietly feeling that he would have to take the lead in the settlement of the unfortunate interruption of the fun
Thats all right Jack McKee began holding out his handlet bygones Jack was in no mood to parley with the offender
McKee had not been invited to the wedding
The young bridegroom knew that if the first offense were overlooked it would only encourage him and he would make trouble all evening
Moreover he disliked Buck because of his evil habits and ugly record
You came to this weddin without an invite claimed Jack
Im here he growled
Youre not wanted
What
shouted McKee paling with anger
Turning to his friends speaking calmly and paying no attention to the aroused desperado Jack said Boys you all know my objection to this man
Dick Lane caught him spring before last slitting the tongue of one of Uncle Jims calves
Its a lie
shouted McKee pulling his revolver and attempting to level it at his accuser
Hoover was too quick for him
Catching him by the wrist he deftly forced him to drop the muzzle toward the floor
With frightened cries the girls huddled in a corner
The other cowboys upset chairs springing to their feet drawing revolvers halfway from holsters as they did so
Hoover had pressed his thumb into the back of McKees hand forcing him to open his fingers and drop his gun on the table
Picking it up Hoover snapped the weapon open emptied the cylinders of the cartridges
Jack made no move to defend himself
He was aware his friends could protect him
Thatll do he said to the raging disarmed puncher
You can go Buck
When I want you in any festivities Ill send a special invite to you
Im sure much obliged sneered McKee making his way toward the door
Heres your gun cried Slim tossing the weapon toward him
McKee caught the weapon muttering Thanks
It needs cleaning sneered the Sheriff
Turning at the doorway McKee said I aint much stuck on weddins anyway
Looking at Jack he continued threateningly Next time we meet itll be at a little swaree of my own
Get was Jacks laconic and ominous command
With assumed carelessness McKee answered Im agettin
Well gents I hopes you allll enjoy this yere pink tea
Say Bud put a piece of weddincake in your pocket for me
I wants to dream on it
Who brought him here
asked Jack facing his guests
I did answered Bud defiantly
You might have known better was Jacks only comment
Im not asayin whos to come and go
This aint none of my weddin
Polly stopped further comment by laying her hand over his mouth and slipping into the seat beside him
Well let it go at that said Jack closing the incident
He rejoined Echo as he spoke
The guests reseated themselves
Mrs Allen laid her hand on Jacks shoulder and said Just the same it aint right and proper for you to be together before the ceremony without a chaperonie
Nothin thats right nice is ever right proper laughed Slim
Well it aint the way folks does back East replied Mrs Allen tartly glaring at the Sheriff
Blast the East growled Allen
We does things in our own way out here
With a mischievous smile Slim glanced at his comrades and then solemnly observed Still I hear they does make the two contractinparties sit off alone by themselves What for
asked Jack
Why to give them the last bit of quiet enjoyment theyre goin to have for the rest of their lives chuckled Slim
The cowboys laughed hilariously at the sally but Mrs Allen throwing her arms about Echos neck burst into tears crying My little girl
Whats the use of opening up the sluices now Josephine
Let her alone Jim drawled Slim her feelins is harrowed some an irrigation is what they needs most
The outburst of tears was incomprehensible to the bridegroom
Already irritated by the McKee incident he took affront at the display of sentiment
I dont want any crying at MY wedding
Its half my wedding pouted Echo tearfully
Aint I losin my daughter sobbed Mrs Allen
Aint you getting my mothers son
snapped Jack
The men howled with glee at the rude badinage which only called forth a fresh burst of weeping on the part of Mrs Allen in which the girls began show symptoms of joining
Polly sought to soothe the trouble by pushing Jack playfully to one side and saying Oh stop it all
Look here Echo Allen you know your hair aint fixed yet
An the minister due here at any minute added Mrs Allen
Come along we will take charge of you now ordered Polly
The girls gathered in a group about the bride bustling and chattering telling her all men were brutes at time and looking at the fat Sheriff who blushed to the roots of his hair at the charge that Slim Hoover was the worst of the lot
Mrs Allen pushed them away and again fell weeping on Echos shoulder
Hold on now They aint a soul goin to do nothin for her except her mother she whimpered
There she goes again said Jack in disgust
Hes goin to take my child away from me wailed the mother
Tears were streaming down Echos cheek
Dont cry mother she wept
No no dont cry echoed the girls
Its all for the best began Polly
Its all for the best its all for the best chorused the group
Well Ill be gasped Jack
Jack Payson you just ought to be ashamed of yourself said Polly stamping her foot
You nasty mean old thing she threw in for good measure
Mrs Allen led Echo from the room
The girls followed crying You nasty mean old thing to the unfortunate bridegroom
The cowboys enjoyed the scene immensely
It was a bit of human comedy totally unexpected
First they imitated the weeping women and then laughed uproariously at Jack
Did you ever see such darned carryings on said the bridegroom in disgust
What have I done
Shucks
All mothers is like that remarked Allen sympathetically
They fuss if their girls marry and they fuss if they dont
Why my ma carried on something scandalous when Josephine roped me
All of the men chuckled except Jack
Im appointed a committees continued the old rancher to sit up with you till the fatal moment
Im game responded Jack grimly
I know whats coming but I wont squeal
Youll git all thats acomin to you grinned Allen
Slim had maneuvered until he reached the door blocking Jacks way
As the bridegroom started to leave the room he took his hand and with an assumption of deep dejection and sorrow bade him Goodbye
Oh dry up
laughed Jack pushing the Sheriff aside
Halting he requested One thing I want to understand right now if youre goin to fling any old boots after me remove the spurs
This yeres a sure enough event an Im goin to tap the barrelan throw away the bung
Wow
shouted Sagebrush
CHAPTER VIII The Sky Pilot With the waves of immigration which have rolled Westward from the more populous East the minister of the gospel has always been in the van
Often he combined the functions of the schoolteacher with the duties of the medical missionary
Wherever a dozen families had settled within a radius of a hundred miles the representative of a church was soon to follow
He preached no creed
His doctrines were as wide as the horizon
Living in the open air preaching to congregations gathered from the ends of the country dealing with men more unconventional than immoral his sermons were concerned with the square deal rather than with dogma
His influences were incalculable
He made ready the field for the reapers who gathered the glory with the advance of refinement
On the frontier he married the children buried the dead consoled the mourners and rejoiced with those upon whom fortune smiled
His hardships were many and his rewards nothing
Of all the fields of human endeavor which built up the West the ministry is the only one in which the material returns have not been commensurate with the labor expended
The Reverend Samuel Price was the representatives of the Christian army in Pinal County Arizona at the time of our story
He was long and lank narrow in the chest with sloping shoulders
Even life on the plains could not eradicate the scholarly droop
His trousers were black and they bagged at the knees
When riding his trousers would work up about his calves showing a wide expanse of white socks
For comfort he wore an alpaca coat which hung loosely about him and for the dignity of his profession the only boiled shirt in the county with a frayed collar and white stringtie
The Reverend Mr Price was liked by the settlers
He never interfered with what they considered their relaxations and he had the saving grace of humor
The guests were performing a scalpdance about the table when he entered the room
For a tomtom Parenthesis was beating a bucket with a gourd and emitting strange cries with each thump
The noise and shouts confused the minister
As he was blundering among the dancers they fell upon him with warwhoops slapping him on the back and crushing his straw hat over his ears
Slim was the first to recognize the minister
He dashed into the group and swinging several aside cried to the others to desist
Pardon me but do I intrude upon a scalpdance
smilingly asked the parson
You sure have Mr Price laughed Slim
We haint got to the scalpinpart yet but were fixin to dance off Paysons scalp tonight
Peering at him with nearsighted eyes Mr Price extended his hand saying Ah Mr Hoover our sheriff is it not
Slim wrung the parsons hand until the preacher winced
Hiding his discomfort he slowly straightened out his fingers with a painful grin
Slim had not noticed that he had hurt the parson by the heartiness of his greeting
With a gesture he lined up the cowboys for introduction
Yes sir the boys call me Slim because I aint
Pointing to the first one in the group he exclaimed This is Parenthesis
Mr Price looked at the awkwardly bowing cowboy in amazement
The name was a puzzle to him
He could not grasp the application
The editor of the Kicker explained Slim called him that because of his legs bein built that way
Mr Price was forced to smile in spite of his efforts to be polite
The editor had grasped the most striking feature of the punchers physical characteristics for a label
Parenthesis beamed on the minister
I was born on horseback he replied
That fellow there with a front tooth is Show Low began Slim speaking like a lecturer in a freakshow
The one without a front tooth is Fresno a California product
This yere chap with the waterdob hair is Sagebrush Charley
It makes him sore when you call him plain Charley
Charley bein a Chink name supplemented its owner
Silence fell over the group for they did not know what was the proper thing to do next
A minister was to be respected and not to be made one of them
He must take the lead in the conversation
Mr Price was at a loss how to begin
He had not recovered fully from the roughness of his welcome so Slim took the lead again
I heard you preach once up to Florence he announced to the profound astonishment of his hearers
Indeed politely responded Mr Price feeling the futility of making any further observations
He feared to fall into some trap
The answers made by the boys did not seem to fit particularly well with what he expected and was accustomed to
The parson could not make out whether the boys were joking with him or whether their replies were unconscious humor on their part
Yep I lost an election bet and had to go to church answered Slim in all seriousness
The cowboys laughed and Mr Price lamely replied Oh yes I see
It was a good show continued Slim doing his best to appear at ease
The frantic corrections of his companions only made him flounder about the more
Excuse me he apologized I mean that I enjoyed it
Do you recall the subject of my discourse inquired Mr Price coming to his assistance
Your what course
asked Slim
My sermon
answered the parson
Well I should say yes replied the Sheriff greatly relieved to think that he was once more out of deep water
It was about some shorthorn that jumped the home corral to maverick around loose in the alfalfa with a bunch of wild ones
The explanation was too much for Mr Price
Great student of the Bible as he had been here was one lesson which he had not studied
As told by Slim he could not recall any text or series of text from which he might have drawn similes fitted for his cowboy congregation when he had one
Really I he began
Slim however was not to be interrupted
If he stopped he never could begin again he felt
Waving to the preacher to be silent he continued his description When his wad was gone the bunch threw him down and he had to hike for the sagebrush an feed with the hogs on husks an sech like winter fodder
The minister caught the word husks
Slim was repeating his own version of the parable of the Prodigal Son
Husks
Oh the Prodigal Son smiled Price
Thats him Slim sighed with relief
This yere feed not being up to grade Prod he lows hed pull his freight back home square himself with the old man and start a new deal Sagebrush was deeply interested in the story
Its charm had attracted him as it had scholars and outcasts alike since first told two thousand years ago on the plains of Old Judea
Did he stand for it
he interrupted
He sure did eloquently replied Slim who was surprised and delighted with the great impression he was making with his experience at church
Oh he was a game old buck he was
Why the minute he sighted that there prodigious son alimpin across the mesa he ran right out an fell on his neck An broke it cried Fresno slapping Sagebrush with his hat in his delight at getting at the climax of the story before Slim reached it
The narrator cast a glance of supreme disgust at the laughing puncher
No what the hell
he shouted
He hugged him
Then he called in the neighbors barbecued a yearlin calf an give a barndance with fireworks in the evenin
Thats all right in books observed Sagebrush but if Id made a break like that when I was a kid my old man would a fell on my neck for fair
That was a good story Parsonits straight aint it
asked Slim as a wave of doubt swept over him
Its gospel truth answered the minister
Do you know the moral of the story
Sure replied Slim
With a confidence born of deep selfassurance Slim launched the answer Dont be a fatted calf
At first his hearers did not grasp the full force of the misapplication of the parable
Mr Price could not refrain from laughing
The others joined with him when the humor of the reply dawned upon them
Pointing scornfully at the fat Sheriff they shouted gleefully while Slim blushed through his tan
Now if youll kindly show me where began Mr Price
Sure
All the liquors in the kitchen said Sagebrush expanding with hospitality
Slim pushed Sagebrush back into his chair and Parenthesis tapped the minister on the shoulder to distract his attention
Thanks
I meant to ask for a place to change clothes
Sure you mustnt mind Sagebrush there apologized Parenthesis hes allus makin breaks
Let me tote your warbag
Walk this way
Good day gentlemen smiled Mr Price
When you are up my way I trust you will honor my church with your presence adding after a pausewithout waiting to lose an election bet
The entrance of a Greaser to refill glasses diverted the attention of the guests until the most important function for them was performed
With hows and heres to the bride they drank the toast
Slim as majordomo of the feast felt it incumbent upon himself to keep the others in order
Turning angrily upon Sagebrush he said
Why did you tell the Sky Pilot where the liquor was
I was just tryin to do the right thing answered Sagebrush defiantly
Embarrassin us all like that
You ought to know that parsons dont hit up the gasolinein public scolded Slim
Sage muttered sulkily I never herded with parsons none
Parenthesis diplomatically avoided any further controversy by calling Theyre gettin ready
Jims got Jack in the back room tryin to cheer him up
Boys is everything ready for the getaway
Sagebrush did you get that rice
demanded Slim
Thats soI forgot
I couldnt get no rice though
Dawson didnt have none
Without telling what he did get Sagebrush ran from the room to the corral
I told you not to let him have anything to do with it said Fresno glaring at his fellow workers
Each was silent as the accusation was general and none had been taken into the confidence of Sagebrush and Fresno when arrangements were being made for the feast
Fresno had to blame some one however
By this time Sagebrush had returned carrying a bag
What did you get
asked Slim
Corn replied Sagebrush laconically
Aint he the darndest
Show Low expressed the disgust which the others showed
Why darn it shouted Slim shaking his fist at the unfortunate Sagebrush you cant let the bride and groom hop the home ranch without chuckin rice at emits bad medicine
Aint he disgustin
interrupted Fresno
What does rice mean anyhow
asked the bewildered Sagebrush
It means something about wishin em good luck health wealth an prosperity an all that sort of thingits a sign an symbol of joy rattled off Slim
Well now aint there more joy in corn than in rice
triumphantly asked Sagebrush
Slim jerked open the top of the bag while Sagebrush stood by helplessly
Well the darned idiot
he muttered as he peered into it
If he aint gone and got it on the ear he continued as he pulled a big ear out
All the better chuckled Sagebrush
Well chuck em joy in bunches
Dont you know that if you hit the bride with a club like this youll put her plumb out
cried Slim
Sagebrush was not cast down however
Always resourceful he suggested Well shell some for the bride but well hand Jack his in bunches
The idea appealing to the punchers each grabbed an ear of corn
Some brandished the ears like clubs others aimed them like revolvers
Ill keep this one said Slim picking out an unusually large ear
Its a 44
Ill get one of the Greasers to shell some for the bride
The bride was arrayed in her weddinggown
Mrs Allen was ready for a fresh burst of weeping
The girls had assembled in the large room in which the ceremony was to be performed
Polly acted as her herald for the cowboys
Appearing in the doorway she commanded Say you folks come on and get seated
Slim stood beside Polly as the boys marched past him
His general admonition was The first one you shorthorns that makes a break Im goin to bend a gun over your head
The guests grinned cheerfully as they marched past the couple
Theres a heap of wickedness in that bunch remarked Slim piously to the girl
Tossing a flower to him as she darted away she cried You aint none too good yourself Slim
Aint she a likely filly mused the lovesick Sheriff
If theres anybody that could make me good its her
Im all in
If ever I get the nerve all at oncedarn me if I dont ask her right out
But Slims courage oozed as quickly as it had arisen and with a sigh he followed his companions to the wedding
CHAPTER IX What God Hath Joined Together Dick Lane on leaving the hospital at Chihuahua went straight to the fortified ledge where he had made his heroic defense
As he conjectured the renegade McKee had got there first and found and made off with the buried treasure
So Dick manfully set to work to replace his lost fortune
It seemed too slow work to go to his mine and dig the gold he immediately required out of the ground so he struck out for civilization to sell some of his smaller claims
In the course of a month at the end of which his wanderings brought him to Tucson he had sold enough of his holdings to give him three thousand dollars in ready cash
As he was near the Sweetwater he resolved not to express the money to Payson but to take it himself
He entered the courtyard of Allen Hacienda while the wedding was taking place within
None of his friends would have recognized him
His frame was emaciated from sickness his head was drawn back by the torture which he had suffered he limped upon feet that had been distorted by the firebrands in McKees hands and his face was overgrown by an unkempt beard
Sounds of laughter fell upon his ears as he mounted the steps
He heard Fresno shout to Slim to hurry up as he was telling the story about a fellow that was so tanked up he could not say sasaparilla
Dick halted
There must be some sort of a party going on here he thought to himself
It wont do to take Echo too much by surprise
If Jack got my letter and told her its all right but if it miscarriedthe shock might kill her
Ill see Jack first
Dick had ridden first to Sweetwater Ranch but found the place deserted
The party he mused accounted for this
While he was planning a way to attract the attention of some one in the house and to get Payson to the garden without letting Echo know of his presence Sagebrush Charley who had espied the stranger through the window sauntered out on the porch to investigate
Every visitor to the Territory needed looking over especially after the trouble with Buck McKee
Sagebrush was bound that there should be no hitch at the wedding of his boss
Howdy greeted Lane pleasantly
Im looking for Jack Payson
That so
answered Sagebrush
Who may you be
Im a friend of his
The foreman could see no danger to come from this weak sickly man
Then walk right in he invited hes inside
Sagebrush was about to reenter the house when Dick halted him with the request I want to see him out hereprivately
Whats the name asked Sagebrush his suspicions returning
Tell him an old friend from Mexico
Sagebrush did not like the actions of the stranger and his secrecy
He was there to fight his bosss battles if he had any
This was not in the contract but it was a part read into the paper by Sagebrush
Say my names Sagebrush Charley he cried with a show of importance
Im ranchboss for Payson
If you want to settle any old claim agin Jack Im actin as his substitoot for him this evenin
On the contrary said Lane with a smile at Sagebrushs outbreak he has a claim against me
It was such a pleasant kindly look he gave Sagebrush that the foreman was disarmed completely
Ill tell him he said over his shoulder
Dick mused over the changes that had occurred since he had left the region
Two years absence from a growing country means new faces new ranches and the wiping out of old landmarks with the advance of population and the invasion of the railroad
He wondered if Jack would know him with his beard
He knewhis mirror told him that his appearance had changed greatly and he looked twenty years older than on the day he left the old home ranch
His trend of thought was interrupted by the entrance of Jack on the porch from the house
My names Payson Jack began hurriedly casting a hasty glance backward into the hallway for the ceremony was about to begin
You want to see me
Jack
cried Dick holding out his hand eagerly
Jack old man dont you know me
he continued falteringly seeing no sign of recognition in his friends eyes
Payson gasped shocked and startled
The man before him was a stranger in looks but the voicethe voice was that of Dick Lane the last man in the world he wanted to see at that moment
Frightened almost betraying himself he glanced at the halfopen door
If Dick entered he knew Echo would be lost to him
She might love him truly and her love for Dick might have passed away but he knew that Echo would never forgive him for the deception that he had practised upon her
Grasping his friends hand weakly he faltered Dick
Dick Lane
Jack realized he must act quickly
Some way or somehow Dick must be kept out of the house until after the marriage
Then he Jack must take the consequences
Dick saw his hesitation
It was not what he had expected
But something dreadful might have happened while he was away there had been so many changes
Why whats the matter
he asked anxiously
You got my letter
You knew I was coming
Yes yes I know lamely answered Jack
But I expected notice you know you said I couldnt wait
Jack Im a rich man thanks to you Yes yes thats all right said Payson disclaiming the praise of the man he had so grievously wronged with a hurried acknowledgment of his gratitude
And I hurried back for fear Echo Oh yes
Ill tell her about it when shes ready to hear it
What is the matter Jack
Are you keeping something from me
Where is she
In there said Payson feebly pointing to the door
Dick eagerly started toward the house but Jack halted him saying Noyou mustnt go in now
Theres a partyyou see she hasnt been well doesnt expect you tonight
The shock might be too much for her
Jack grasped at the lame excuse
It was the first to come to his mind
He must think quickly
This experience was tearing the heart out of him
He could not save himself from betrayal much longer
Youre right acquiesced Dick
You tell her when you get a chance
Jack as I was saying Ive made quite a bit of money out of my Bisbee holdings
I can pay back my stake to you now
Not now said Jack nervously
Would this torture never end
Here was his friend whom he had betrayed come back in the very hour of his marriage to the woman who had promised first to marry him
Now he was offering him money which Jack needed badly for his prospective motherinlaw was complaining about his taking her daughter to a mortgaged home
Sure now continued Dick pulling a roll of bills from his pocket
Its three thousand dollarshere it is all in one bundle
Not now let that wait said Jack pushing the money aside
Its waited long enough cried Dick doggedly
You put the mortgage on your ranch to let me have the money and it must be about due now
Yes it will be due but let it wait
Whats the use
Im all right now
I brought the cash with me on purpose
I wanted to square it with you on sight
Dick pressed the money into Jacks hand closing his fingers over the roll of bills
With a sigh of relief as if a disagreeable task was completed he questioned Hows Bud
Jack replied shortly All right hes inside
I didnt write to him cheerfully resumed Dick
I didnt want the kid to know
He is so excitable he would have blabbed it right out
Ill sure be glad to see the boy again
Hes impulsive but his hearts all right
I know youve kept a lookout over him
This trust in him was getting too much for Jack to bear so the voice of Polly crying to him to hurry up was music to his ears
Im coming he shouted
Ill see you in a few minutes he told Dick
Ive something to tell you
I cant tell you now
Go in then answered Dick
Ill wait yonder in the garden
Dont keep me waiting any longer than you can help
Dick turned and walked slowly toward the gate which lead to the kitchengarden a part of every ranch home in Arizona
It was cut off from the house by a straggling hedge on which Echo had spent many hours trying to keep it in shape
Jack hesitated about going into the house
Even if Echo married him he knew that she would never forgive him when she learned of his dastardly conduct from Dick Lanes own mouth
It was better to sacrifice the life of one to save three lives from being ruined
Jack followed Lane up partly drawing his gun
It would be so easy to shoot him
No one would recognize Dick Lane in that crippled figure
Jacks friends would believe him if he told them the stranger had drawn on him and he had to shoot him in selfdefense
Then the thought of how dastardly was the act of shooting a man in the back and he his trusting friend smote him suddenly and he replaced the pistol in its holster
It is worse than the murder of Ole Man Terrill he muttered
Dick walked on entirely unconscious of how close he had been to death with his friend as his murderer
So interested had the two men been in their conversation that neither had noticed Buck McKee hiding behind the hedge listening to their talk and covering Jack Payson when he was following Dick with his hand on his revolver
McKee heard Paysons ejaculation and smiled grimly
Jacks absence had aroused Jim Allen who hurried out on the porch storming
Say Jack what do you mean by putting the brakes on this yere weddin
Jimsay Jim
I want you to do something for me cried Jack as he rushed toward his future fatherinlaw greatly excited
Sure answered Allen heartily
Stand here at this door during the ceremony and no matter what happens dont let any one in
But interrupted Allen
Dont ask me to explain blurted Jack
Echos happiness is at stake
That settles itIve not let any one spile her happiness yet an I wont in the few minutes that are left while Im still her main protector
Nobody gets in
Rememberno oneno matter who it is emphasized Jack as he darted into the house
Jim Allen lighted his pipe
Now whats eatin him
he muttered to himself
Then Theyre off
he cried looking through the window
The Reverend Samuel Price began to drone the marriageservice
It is the little things in life that count after all
Men will work themselves into hysteria over the buzzing of a fly and yet plan a battleship in a boilershop
A city full of people will at one time become panicstricken over the burning of a rubbishheap and at another camp out in the ruins of fireswept homes treating their miseries as a huge joke
Philosophers write learnedly of cause and effect
In chemistry certain combinations give certain results
But no man can say I will do thus and so this and that will follow
All things are possible but few things are probable
Dick Lane had planned to shield Echo by writing to Jack Payson letting him break the news of his return
Fate would have it that she would not know until too late of his escape
A letter sent directly to her might have prevented much unhappiness and many heartaches
Not till months later when happiness had returned did Jack realize that his one great mistake was made by not telling Echo of Dicks rescue
Both Dick and Echo might have had a change of heart when they met again
Echo was young
Dick had wandered far
Both had lost touch with common interests
Jack Payson had entered her life as a factor
He was eager and impetuous Dick was settled and worldworn by hardship and much physical suffering
Now Jack was at the altar racked with mental torture while Dick waited in the garden for his traitorous friend
The innocent cause of the tragedy was sweetly and calmly replying to the questions of the marriageritual while Jack was looking as Allen said to himself darned squeamish
According to these words it is the will of God that nothing shall sever the marriagebond were the words that fell upon Allens ears as he stooped to look in the window at the weddingparty
The Sky Pilots taking a long time to make the hitch
Darned if I couldnt hitch up a twentymule team in the time that hes takin to get them two to the pole said Allen speaking to himself
Dick had grown impatient at Jacks absence and wandered back from the garden to the front of the house
Spying Allen he greeted him with Hello Uncle Jim
Thats my name answered Allen suspiciously
But I aint uncle to every stranger that comes along
Im no stranger laughed Dick
You know me
Do I
replied Allen unconvinced
Who are you
The poor orphan you took from an asylum and made a man ofDick Lane
Dick Lane
repeated the astonished ranchman
Come back from the dead
No I aint dead yet answered Dick holding out his hand which Allen gingerly grasped as if he expected to find it thin air
I wasnt killed
I have been in the hospital for a long time
I wrote Jackhe knows
My God
Allen cried
Jack knowsyou wrote to himhe knows
Over and over he repeated the astonishing news which had been broken to him so suddenly
Here was a man as if back from the dead standing in his own dooryard telling him that Jack knew he was alive
No word had been told him
What could Echo say
This then explained Jacks strange request and his distress
And Echo
Dick questioned glancing toward the house
Echo
The name aroused Allen
He saw at once that he must act definitely and quickly
Echo must not see Dick now
It was too late
The secret of his return on the weddingday must be known only to the three men
Look here Dick he commanded
You mustnt let her see youshe mustnt know you are alive
Dick was growing confused over the mystery which was being thrown about Echo Allen
First Jack had told him he must wait to see her and now her father tells him he must never see her again or let her know that he is alive
His strength was being overtaxed by all this evasion and delay
Dick said Allen with deep sympathy laying his hand upon the mans shoulder
Shes my daughter an I want her life to be happy
Cant you see
Do you understand
She thinks youre dead
What are you saying
cried Dick trying to fathom the riddle
Youve come back too late Dick sadly explained Allen
Too late echoed Dick
Theres something back of all this
Ill see her now
He started to enter the door but Allen restrained him
You cant go in he shouted to the excited man and pushed him down the steps
It was an easy task for him for Dick was too weak to offer much resistance
No you wont he gently told him
His heart bled for the poor fellow whom he loved almost as a son but Echos happiness was at stake and explanations could come later
More to emphasize his earnestness than to indicate intention to shoot he laid his hand on the butt of his revolver saying Not if I have to kill you
Dick began to realize that whatever was wrong was of the greatest consequence
It was a shock to him to have his oldest his best friend in the West treat him in this fashion
Jim
he cried in his anguish
Youve got to go back where you came from Dick sternly answered the ranchman
If ever you loved my daughter nows your chance to prove itshe must never know youre livin But Its a whole lot Im askin of you Dick continued Allen
But if you love her as I think you do it may be a drop of comfort in your heart to know that by doin this great thing for her youll be makin her life better and happier
I do love her cried Dick passionately but there must be some reasontell me
Allen held up his hand to warn Dick to be silent
He beckoned him to follow him
Slowly he led him to the door and partly opening it motioned him to listen
Forasmuch as John Payson and Echo Allen have consented together in holy wedlock were the words that fell upon his ears
As the doomed man stands motionless before his judges and hears his deathsentence read without a tremor ofttimes thinking of some trifle so Dick stood for a moment
At first he did not fully realize what it all meant
Then the full depth of his betrayal flooded him
What
he cried
Payson
Allen held him back
Again the ministers voice fell upon their ears repeating the solemn words
And have declared the same before God and in the presence of these witnesses I pronounce them husband and wife
What God hath joined together let no man put asunder
Dick shaken and hurt slowly sank to his knees covering his face with his hands
A dry sob shook his frame
Here was the end of all his hopes
Here was the sad reward for years of toil and waiting
Now you know why you cant stay here said Allen his tones full of pity
Now I know
Dick staggered to his feet and started blindly from the house
Dick
cried Allen in a broken voice forgive me
Shes my child she loves him now
The betrayed friend took his hand without looking at him
In vain he tried to hide his deep emotion
I know he faltered Ill never trouble her
Ill go away never to return
Wherell you go
asked Allen
Back where I came from back into the desertinto the land of dead things
Goodby
As he wrung the ranchmans hand and turned to walk out of the life of his old comrades and the woman he loved he heard the minister repeat The blessing of the Almighty Father rest upon and abide with you now and forevermore
Amen
Evermore
Amen
faltered Dick bidding a last mute farewell to Allen
The old ranchman watched him quietly as he mounted his horse and rode down the trail
His reverie was interrupted by the bursts of laughter of the weddingguests and the cries of Fresno Kiss the bride Slim
Kiss the bride
CHAPTER X The Piano Five weeks had passed since the marriage of Echo and Jack
On her return from the honeymoon in the little hunting cabin in the Tortilla Range the young wife set to work and already great changes had been made in the ranchhouse on the Sweetwater
Rooms were repapered and painted
The big center room was altered into a cozy livingroom
On the long low window giving an outlook on fields of alfalfa corn and the silver ribbons of the irrigation ditches dainty muslin curtains now hung
Potted geraniums filled the sill and in the unused fireplace Echo had placed a jar of ferns
A clock ticking on the mantelpiece added to the cheerfulness and hominess of the house
On the walls horns of mountainsheep and antlers of antelope and deer alternated with the mounted heads of puma and buffalo
Through the open window one caught a glimpse of the arms of a windmill and the outbuildings of the home ranch
Navajo blankets were scattered over the floors and seats
Echo had taken the souvenirs of the hunt and trail which Jack had collected and with a womans touch of refinement had used them for decorative effects
She had in truth made the room her very own
The grace and charm of her personality were stamped upon the environment
The men of the ranch fairly worshiped Echo
Sending to Kansas City they purchased a piano for her as a birthdaygift
On the morning when the wagon brought it over from Florence station little work was done about the place
The instrument had been unpacked and placed in the livingroom in Echos absence
Mrs Allen Polly and Jim rode over to be present at the presentation
The donors gathered in the livingroom to admire the gift which shone bravely under the energetic polishing of Mrs Allen
Thats an elegant instrument was her observation as she flicked an imaginary speck of dust from the case
Polly opened the lid saying Just what Echo wanted
Jim cocked his head as if he were examining a new pinto pony
Sent all the way up to Kansas City for it eh
Thats right Uncle Jim chorused the punchers
Now the rooms complete announced Polly
Echos made a big change around here
The group gravely followed Pollys approving glances
That she has assented Mrs Allen
Looked a barn when Jack was a bachelor
This certainly is the finest kind of a birthdaypresent you all could have thought of
Josephinell cry in a minute boys chuckled Allen
You hesh up snapped his wife glaring at the grinning ranchman
Sagebrush poured oil on the roughening waters by changing the conversation
Speaking as if making a dare he challenged What I want to know is is there anybody here present as can rassle a tune out of that there box
No one came forward
Aint there none of you boys that can play on a pianny
he demanded
Ive played on the big square one down at the Lone Star gravely piped up Show Low
What did you play asked the inquisitive Polly
Poker answered Show Low seriously his face showing no trace of humor
Poker
Polly repeated in disgust
Thats all they ever plays on it explained Show Low indignantly
Polly grew impatient
This presentation was a serious affair and not to be turned into an audience for the exploitation of Show Lows adventures
Moreover she did not like to be used even indirectly as a target for funmaking although she delighted in making some one else a feeder for her ideas of fun
Fresno modestly announced he was something of a musical artist
I low I can shake a tune out of that he declared
Lets hear you cried Polly rather doubtful of Fresnos ability
Step up perfesser cried Allen heartily slapping him on the back
Fresno grinned and solemnly rolled up his sleeves
His comrades eyed his every move closely
He spat on his hands approached the piano and glared fiercely at the keyboard
My ma had one of them there things when I was a yearlin he observed
Fresno spun the seat of the pianostool until it almost twirled off the screw
His actions created greatest interest especially to Parenthesis who peered under the seat to see the wheels go round
Fresno threw his leg over the seat as if mounting a horse
Well boys whatll you have
he asked glancing from one to the other in imitation of the manner of his friend the pianist in the Tucson honkytonk on a lively evening
The usual poison absently answered Show Low
Sagebrush struck him in the breast with the with the back of his hand
Shut up he growled
Turning to Fresno he said Give us theerThe Maidens Prayer
Fresno whisked about so quickly that he almost lost his balance
Gazing at the petitioner in blank amazement he shouted The what
Sagebrush blushed under his tan
In a most apologetic voice he said Well thats the first tune my sister learned to play an she played it continuouswhich is why I left home
Id sure like to oblige you but Maidens Prayers aint in my repetory explained the mollified musician
Fresno raised his finger uncertainly over the keyboard searching for a key from which to make a start
The group watched him expectantly
As he struck a note each member of his audience jumped back in surprise at the sound
Fresno scratched his head and gingerly fingered another key
After several false starts backing and filling over the keyboard he began to pick out with one finger the air The Suwanee River
Thats it
Now were started he cried exultantly
His overconfidence led him to strike a false note
Excuse me he apologized
Got the copper on the wrong chip
Once more he essayed playing the old melody but became hopelessly confused
Darn the tune
he mumbled
Sagebrush ever ready to cheer up the failing courage of a performer chirruped Shuffle em up agin and begin a new deal
Fresno spat on his hands and ruffled his hair like a musical genius
Again he sought the rhythm among the keys
He tried to whistle the air
That device failed him
Will you all whistle that tune
Im forgettin it was his plaintive request
Sure let her go boys cried Sagebrush
Falteringly with many stops and sudden they tried to accompany Fresnos halting pursuit over the keyboard after the tune that was dodging about in his mind
All at once the player struck his gait and introduced a variation on the bass notes
That aint in it shouted Show Low indignantly
Shut up
bellowed Sagebrush
With both hands hammering the keys indiscriminately Fresno made a noisy if not artistic finish and whirled about on the stool to be greeted by hearty applause
Well I reckon thats goin some
he boasted when the handclapping subsided bowing low to Polly and Mrs Allen
Goin
laughed Polly
Limpin is what I call it
If you dont learn to switch off youll get a callous on that one finger of yourn
Fresno looked at that member dubiously
Aint music civilizin
suggested Show Low to Jim Allen
You bet
the ranchman agreed
Take a pianny an enough Winchesters an you can civilize the hull of China
Fresno could kill more with his piannyplay than his gunplay suggested Show Low
Mrs Allen bethought herself that there was a lot of work to be done in preparation for the party
Even if everything was ready the dear old soul would find something to do or worry about
Come now clear out of here the hull kit an bilin of you she ordered
The men hastily crowded out on the piazza
Take that packincase out of sight if you mean this pianny to be a surprise to Echo
Shell be trottin back here in no time she added
Fresno had lingered to assure Jim This yere birthdays goin to be a success
Would you like another selection
he eagerly asked
Not unless you wash your finger snapped Mrs Allen busy polishing the keys Fresno had struck
You left a greasespot on every key youve touched she explained
Fresno held up his finger for Allens inspection
Ive been greasin the wagon was his explanation
Git out with the rest of them she commanded
Ive got enough to do to look after that cake
Mrs Allen darted into the kitchen
Jim slowly filled his pipe and hunted up the most comfortable chair
After two or three trials he found one to suit him and sank back with a sigh of content
Jack aint back yet
Polly put the question
Polly rearranged the chairs in the room picking up and replacing the articles on the table to suit her own artistic conceptions
She straightened out a warbonnet on the wall
She was flicking off a spot of dust in the gilt chair that Jack had got as a wedding present for Echo on the day of the stationagents murder and being reminded of the tragedy she asked That posse didnt catch the parties that killed Terrill did they
Not that I hear on
Slim Hoover he took the boys that night an tried to pick up the trail after it entered the river but they couldnt find where it come out
One of them fellers the man that left the station alone and probably done the job rode a pacin horse answered Jim between puffs of his pipe
Then hes a stranger to these parts
Jacks pinto pacesits his regular gait
Its the only pacing hoss around here
Thats so he assented but made no further comment
The full force of the observation did not strike him at the time
Polly began to pump Colonel Jim
There were several recent happenings which she did not fully comprehend
At the inquisitive age and a girl she wanted to know all that was going on
Jacks been acting mighty queer of late she ventured
Like hes got something on his mind
Jim smiled at her simplicity and jokingly replied Well hes married
The retort exasperated Polly
She was not meeting with the success she desired
Do hush
she cried in her annoyance
Thats enough on any mans mind Jim laughed as he sauntered out of the door
Something queer about Jack observed Polly seating herself at the table
He aint been the same man since the weddin
Hes all right when Echos around but when he thinks no one is watchin him he sits around and sighs
Jack entered the room at this moment
Absentmindedly he hung his hat and spurs on a rack and leaned his rifle against the wall sighing deeply as he did so
So engrossed was he in his thoughts that he did not notice Polly until he reached the table
He started in surprise when he saw her
Hello Polly
was his greeting
Where is Echo
Polly rose hastily at the sound of his voice
Didnt you meet her
she asked
We got her to ride over toward Tucson this morning to get her out of the way sos to snake the pianny in without her seein it
Polly glided over to the instrument and touched the keys softly
With admiration Jack gazed at the instrument
I came around by Florence answered Jack with a smile
Eagerly Polly turned toward him
See anything of Bud Lane
she queried
No
Again Jack smiledthis time at the girls impetuosity
Hell lose his job with me if he dont call more regular she said
Say Jack you aint fergettin what you promisedto help Bud with the money that you said was comin in soon as Dicks share of a speculation you and him was pardners in
Im powerful anxious to get him away from McKee
Jack had not forgotten the promise but alas under the goading of Mrs Allen that he should clear off the mortgage on his home he had used Dick Lanes money for this purpose
In what a mesh of lies and broken promises he was entangling himself
Now he was forced further to deceive trusting little Polly in the matter that was dearest to her heart
No Polly but the fact isthat speculation isnt turning out so well after all
The disappointed girl turned sadly away and went out to Mrs Allen in the kitchen
Jack removed his belt and gun and hung them on the rack by the door
Spying his father at the corral he called to him to come into the house
Hello Jack
was Allens greeting as he entered shaking the younger mans hand
When did you come over
This morning Allen told him
Echos birthday you know and the old lady allowed wed have to be here
Aint seen you since the weddingot things lookin fine here
Allen slowly surveyed the room
Jack agreed with him with a gesture of assent
A more important topic to him than the furnishing of a room was what had become of Dick Lane
After the wedding ceremony no chance had come to him to speak privately to Allen
The festivities of the wedding had been shortened
Slim had gathered a posse and taken up the trail of the slayers
Jim Allen had joined them
The hazing of Jack and the hasty departure of the bridal pair on horseback in a shower of corn shelled and on cob prevented the two men from meeting
The older man had volunteered no explanation
Jack knew that in his heart Allen did not approve of his actions but was keeping silent because of his daughter
Jack could restrain himself no longer
Jimwhat happened that night
he asked brokenly
Allen showed his embarrassment
Meanin Then he hesitated
Dick was all Jack could say
I seed him
If I hadnt hed busted up the weddin some was his laconic answer
Where is he
Allen relighted his pipe
When he got the smoke drawing freely he gazed at Jack thoughtfully and answered Hes gone
Back where he came frominto the desert
Jim puffed slowly and then added Looks like you didnt give Dick a square deal
Allen liked his soninlaw and was going to stand by him but in Arizona the saying Alls fair in love and war is not accepted at its face value
I didnt acknowledged Jack
I was desperate at the thought of losing her
She loved me and had forgotten himshes happy with me now
I reckon thats right was Jims consoling reply
To clinch his argument and soothe his troublesome conscience Jack continued She never would have been happy with him
Thats what I told him declared Allen
He knew it an thats why he went awayan Echono matter what comes she must never know
Shed never forgive youan fer that matter me neither
Jack looked long out of the window toward the distant mountains the barrier behind which Dick was wandering in the great desert cut off from the woman he loved by a false friend
How I have suffered for that lie
uttered Jack in tones full of anguish
Thats what hurts me mostthe thought that I lied to her
I might have killed him that night pondered Jack
He shuddered at the thought that he had been on the point of adding murder to the lie
He had faced the same temptation which Dick had yet to overcome
Mebbe you did
Theres moren one way of killin a man suggested Allen
Jack swung round and faced him
The observation had struck home
He realized how poignantly Dick must have endured the loss of Echo and thought of his betrayal by Jack
As he had suffered mentally so Dick must be suffering in the desert
In selfjustification he returned to his old argument
I waited until I was sure he was dead
Six months I waited after we heard the news
After I had told Echo I loved her and found that I was loved in returnthen came this letter
God
What a fight I had with myself when I found that he livedwas thinking of returning home to claim her for his own
I rode out into the hills and fought it out all alone like an Indianthen I resolved to hurry the weddingto lie to herand I have been living that lie every minute every hour
Jack leaned heavily on the table
His head sank
His voice dropped almost to a whisper
Allen slapped him on the back to cheer him up
Philosophically he announced Well its got to be as it is
Youll mebbe never hear from him again
You mustnt never tell her
I aint agoin to say nothin about ither happiness means everything to me
Jack grasped his hand in silent thankfulness
The two men walked slowly out of the room to the corral
As Echo galloped across the prairie in the glorious morning air the sunshine the lowing of the cattle on the hills and the songs of the birds in the trees along the Sweetwater had banished all depressing thoughts and her mind dwelt on her love for Jack and the pleasantness of the lines in which her life had fallen
Only one small cloud had appeared on the horizon
Jack had not shared with her his confidences in the business of the ranch
He told her he did not want to worry her with such cares
True there were times when he was deeply abstracted but in her presence his moroseness vanished quickly
Carefully as he had tried to hide his secret she had with a womans intuition seen beneath the surface of things and realized that something was lacking to complete her happiness
As Echo turned toward home a song sprang to her lips
Polly spied her far down the trail
Boys shes coming she shouted to the men who were at the bunkhouse awaiting Mrs Paysons return
As they passed the corral they called to Jack and Allen to join them in the livingroom to prepare for the surprise for Echo
The party quickly reassembled
Good land
shouted Allen get something to cover the pianny with
The punchers rushed in confusion about the room in a vain search
Aint there a plagued thing we can cover the pianny with
cried the demoralized Allen renewing his appeal
Polly came to the rescue of the helpless men by plucking a Navajo blanket from the couch
Tossing one end of it to Show Low she motioned to him to help hold it up before the instrument like a curtain
Stand in front of it everybody ordered Mrs Allen who had left her cakebaking and hurried in from the kitchen
Polly spread your skirtsyou too Jim
Allen ran in front of the piano holding out an imaginary dress in imitation of Polly
Which I aint got none he cried
Parenthesis jumped in front of the pianostool trying vainly to hide it with his legs
Parenthesis put your legs together Mrs Allen cried
I cant maam wailed the unfortunate puncher
He fell on his knees before the stool spreading out his waistcoat for a screen
Mrs Allen helped him out with her skirts
Steady everybody
shouted Jack
Here she is
yelled Sagebrush as the door opened and the astonished Echo faced those she loved and liked
Echo made a pretty picture framed in the doorway
She wore her ridinghabit of olivegreenfrom the hem of which peeped her soft boots
Her hat broad picturesque typical of the Southwest had slipped backward forming a background for her pretty face
An amused smile played about the corners of her mouth
Well what is it
she smiled inquiringly
The group looked at her sheepishly
No one wanted to answer her question
Whats the matter
she resumed
Youre herded up like a bunch of cows in a norther
Sagebrush began gravely to explain
He got only as far as This yere bein a birthday when Echo interrupted him Oh
then its a birthdayparty
Once stopped Sagebrush could not get started again
He cleared his throat with more emphasis than politeness striking the attitude of an orator with one hand upraised and the other on his hip he hemmed and hawed until beads of perspiration trickled down his temples
Again he nerved himself for the ordeal
Mebbe he gasped
Then he opened and dosed his mouth froglike several times taking long gulping breaths
At last looking helplessly about him he shouted Oh shucks
you tell her Jack
He pushed him toward Echo
Jack rested his hand on the table and began Weve a surprise for youthat is the boys have What is it
asked Echo eagerly
Youve got to call it blind broke in Sagebrush
Guess it cried Fresno
A ponycart hazarded Echo
Shucks
no said Show Low at the idea of presenting Echo with anything on wheels
Echo then guessed Sewingmachine
Sagebrush encouraged her Thats something like itgo ongo on
Well then its a Sagebrush grew more excited
He raised and lowered himself on his toes backing toward the piano
Go it youre gettin there he shouted
Its a Again she hesitated to be helped on by Sagebrush with the assurance Shell do itfire awayits a A Go on
Sagebrush in his enthusiasm backed too far into the blanket screen
His spurs became entangled
To save himself from a fall he threw out his hand behind him
They struck the polished cover of the instrument slid off and Sagebrush sat down on the keys with an unmistakable crash
A piano
cried Echo exultantly
Who done that
demanded Show Low angrily
Parenthesis from his place on the floor looked at the mischiefmaker in disgust
Sagebrush
he shouted
Givin the hull thing away snarled Fresno
Show Low could contain himself no longer
Going up to Sagebrush he shook his fist in his face saying Youre the limit
You ought to be herdin sheep
The victim of the accident humbly replied I couldnt help it
Mrs Allen smoothed out the differences by declaring Whats the difference she wouldnt have guessed not in a million yearsstand away and let her see it
Fresno swept them all aside with the blanket
Oh isnt it beautiful beautiful
cried Echo
Whowhatwhere she stammered glancing from one to the other her eyes finally resting on Jack
Not guilty he cried
Youll have to thank the boys for this
With happy tears welling up in her eyes Echo said I do thank them I doI doI cant tell how delighted I am
I cant say how much this means to meI thank youI say it once but I feel it a thousand times
She seized each of the boys by the hand and shook it heartily
Would you like to have another selection
asked Fresno relieving the tension of the situation
No
shouted the punchers unanimously
Fresno looked very much crestfallen since he considered that he had made a deep impression by his first effort
Mrs Paysons goin to hit us out a tune announced Sagebrush
Echo seated herself at the piano
Jack leaned against the instrument gazing fondly into her eyes as she raised her face radiant with happiness
Allen had taken possession of the best rockingchair
Mrs Allen sat at the table and the boys ranged themselves about the room
Their faces reflected gratification
They watched Echo expectantly
Echo played the opening bars of The Old Folks at Home
Before she sang Fresno holding up his right indexfinger remarked to no one in particular I washed that finger
The singing deeply affected her little audience
Echo had a sweet natural voice
She threw her whole soul into the old ballad
She was so happy she felt like singing not lively airs but songs about home
Her new home had become so dear to her at that moment
Mrs Allen as usual began to cry
Polly soon followed her example
There were tears even in the of some of the punchers although they blinked vigorously to keep them back
When she repeated the chorus Sagebrush said to Fresno Aint that great
That worthy however with the jealousy of an artist and to hide his own deeply moved sensibilities replied That aint so much
Jack had become completely absorbed in the music
He and Echo were oblivious to surroundings
His arm had slipped about his wifes waist and she gazed fondly into his face
Sagebrush was the first to notice their attitude
On his calling the attention of the boys to their happiness these quietly tiptoed from the room
Polly signaled to Mrs Allen and followed the boys
Josephine awoke Jim as if from a dream and lead him slowly out leaving the young couple in an earthly paradise of married love
When Echo finished she turned in surprise to find themselves alone
Was it as bad as that
she naively asked Jack
What
Why theyve all left us
Jack laughed softly
So they haveI forgot they were here he said looking fondly down at his wife
Echo began to play quietly another ballad
Ive always wanted a piano she said
Youd found one here waiting if Id only known it he chided
Youve given me so much already she murmured
Ive been a big expense to you
Jack again slipped his arm about her waist and kissed her
There aint any limit on my love he declared
I want you to be happy Dont you think I am laughed Echo
Im the happiest woman on earth Jack and its all you
I want to be more than a wife to you I want to be a helpmatebut you wont let me
A wistful expression crept over Echos countenance
Who says so
he demanded playfully as if he would punish any man who dared make such an accusation
Echo turned on the stool and took his hand
I know it she said with emphasis
Youve been worried about something for days and daysdont tell me you havent
Jack opened his lips as if to contradict her
We women learn to look beneath the surface what is it Jack
she continued
Jack loosened his wifes handclasp and walked over to the table
Nothingwhat should I have to worry about
He spoke carelessly
The mortgage
suggested Echo
I paid that off last week explained Jack
Echo felt deeply hurt that this news should have been kept from her by her husband
You did and never told me
she chided
Where did you get the money
she inquired
Why I Jack halted
He could not frame an excuse at once nor invent a new lie to cover his old sin
Deeper and deeper he was getting into the mire of deception
Echo had arisen from the seat
It was over three thousand dollars wasnt it
she insisted
Something like that answered Jack noncommittally
Well where did you get it
demanded his wife
An old debta friend of mineI loaned him the money a long time ago and he paid it backthats all
Jack took a drink of water from the olla to hide his confusion
Who was it
persisted Echo
You wouldnt know if I told you
Now just stop talking business
It isnt fair declared Echo
You share all the good things of life with me and I want to share some of your business worries
I want to stand my share of the bad
Jack saw he must humor her
When the bad comes Ill tell you he assured her patting her hand
You stand between me and the world
Youre like a great big mountain standing guard over a little tree in the valley keeping the cold north wind from treating it too roughly
She sighed contentedly
But the mountain does it all
Jack looked down tenderly at his little wife
Her love for him moved him deeply
Not at all he said to her
The little tree grows green and beautiful
It casts a welcome shade about it and the heart of the mountain is made glad to its rocky core to know that the safety of that little tree is in its keeping
Taking her in his arms he kissed her again and again
Kissing again shouted Polly from the doorway
Say will you two never settle down to business
Theres Bud Lane and a bunch of others just into the corralmaybe they want you Jack
Jack excused himself
As he stepped out on the piazza he asked Polly Shall I send Bud in
Let him come in if he wants to
Im not sending for him
Polly spitefully turned up her nose at him
Jack laughed as he closed the door
Echo reseated herself at the piano fingering the keys
How are you getting on with Bud
she asked the younger girl
We dont get on a little bit she snapped
Bud never seems to collect much revenue an we just keep trottin slow likewish I was married and had a home of my own
Arent you happy with father and mother
Polly glanced at Echo with a smile
Lord yes she replied in a way but Im only a poor relationyour ma was my mas cousin or something like that
Echo laughed
Nonsense she retorted
Nonsenseyoure my dear sister and the only daughter thats at the old home now
But I want a home of my own like this said Polly
Then youd better shake Bud and give Slim a chance
Polly was too disgusted to answer at once
Slim Hoover shucks
Slim doesnt care for girlshes afraid of em she said at length
I like Bud with all his orneriness she declared
Why doesnt he come to see you more often
I dont know maybe its because hes never forgiven you for marryin Jack
Why should he mind that
she asked startled
Well you know she answered between stitches drawing the needle through the doth with angry little jerks Bud he never quite believed Dick was dead
Echo rose hastily
The vague haunting halfthoughts of weeks were crystallized on the instant
She felt as if Dick was trying to speak to her from out of the great beyond
With a shudder she into a chair at the table opposite Polly
Dont she said her voice scarcely above a whisper I cant bear to hear him spoken of
I dreamed of him the other nighta dreadful dream
Polly was delighted with this new mystery
It was all so romantic
Did you
lets hear it
With unseeing eyes Echo gazed straight ahead rebuilding from her dream fabric a tragedy of the desert in which the two men who had played so great a part in her life were the actors
It seems she told that I was in the desert such a vast terrible desert where the little dust devils eddied and swirled and the merciless sun beat down until it shriveled up every growing thing
Polly nodded her head sagely
Thats the way the desert looksand no water
Echo paid no heed to the interruption
Her face became wan and haggard as in her minds eye she saw the weary waste of waterless land quiver and swim under the merciless sun
Not a tree not a blade of grass not a sign of life broke the monotony of crumbling cliffs and pinnacled rocks
Onward and ever onward stretched yellow ridges and alkaliwhitened ravines blinding the eye and parching the throat
Then I saw a man staggering toward me she continued his face was white and drawn his lips cracked and parchednow and then he would stumble and fall and lie there on his face in the hot sand digging into it with his bony fingers seeking for water
Echo shut her eyes as if to blot out the picture
Its reality almost overpowered her
Suddenly he raised his eyes to mine she resumed after a pause
It was Dick
In her excitement she had arisen stretching out her arms as if to ward off an apparition
He tried to call me
I saw his lips move framing my name
Dragging himself to his feet he came toward me with his arms outstretched
Then another form appeared between us fighting to keep him back
They fought there under the burning sun in the hot dust of the desert until at last one was crushed to earth
The victor raised his face to mine andit was Jack
Echo buried her face in her hands
Dry sobs shook her bosom
Awestricken Polly gazed at the overwrought wife
PFEW
she laughed to shake off her fright
That was a sure enough nightmare
If Id a dream like that Id wake up the whole house yapping like a coyote
As the commonplace ever intrudes upon the unusual so a knock on the door relieved the tension of the situation
It was Slim
He did not wait for an invitation to enter but opening the door asked Can I come in
Sure come in cried Polly glad to find any excuse to shake off the depression of Echos dream
Howdy Mrs Payson just come over to see Jack was the jolly Sheriffs greeting
Hes down at the corral she informed him
Mrs Allen hurried in from the kitchen at this moment calling Echo come here and look at this yere cake
It looks as if it had been sot upon
Echo closed the lid of the piano and called her mothers attention to the presence of Slim Hoover
How dye do Slim Hooveryou might have left some of that dust outside
The Sheriff was greatly embarrassed by her chiding
In his ride from Florence to the Sweetwater the alkali and sand stirred up by the hoofs of the horses had settled on his hat and waistcoat so freely that his clothing had assumed a neutral gray tone above which his suntanned face and red hair loomed like the moon in a fog
Josephines scolding drove him to brush his shoulders with his hat raising a cloud of dust about his head
Stop it
Mrs Allen shouted shrilly
Slim Hoover if your brains was dynamite you couldnt blow the top of your head off
Polly was greatly amused by Slims encounter with the cleanly Mrs Allen
Slim stood with open mouth watching Mrs Allen flounce out of the room after Polly who was trying in vain to suppress her laughter
Turning to the girl he said Aint seen you in some time
Slim was thankful that the girl was seated at the table with her back to him
Somehow or other he found he could speak to her more freely when she was not looking at him
That so
she challenged
Come to the birthday
Not regular he answered
Polly glanced at him over her shoulder
It was too much for Slim
He turned away to hide his embarrassment
Partly recovering from his bashfulness he coughed preparatory to speaking
But Polly had vanished
As one looks sheepishly for the magicians disappearing coin so Slim gazed at floor and ceiling as if the girl might pop up anywhere
Spying an empty chair behind him he sank into it gingerly and awkwardly
Meantime Polly returned with a broom and began sweeping out the evidences of Slims visit
She spoke again Get them holdups yet that killed Ole Man Terrill
she asked
Not yet
But we had a new shootin overn our town yesterday
Slim was doing his best to make conversation
Polly did not help him out very freely
That so
was her reply
Spotted Taylor shot two Chinamen
Pollys curiosity was aroused
What for
she asked stopping her sweeping for a moment
Just to give the new graveyard a start Slim chuckled
Polly joined in his merriment
Spotted Taylor was always a publicspirited citizen was her comment
He sure was assented Slim
Get up there
I want to sweep under that chair
Polly brushed Slims feet with the broom vigorously
With an elaborate Excuse me Slim arose but reseated himself in another chair directly in the pathway of Pollys broom
Get out of there too she cried
Shucks there aint any room for me nowhere he muttered disgustedly
You shouldnt take up so much of it
Slim attempted to take a seat on the small gilt chair which was Jacks weddingpresent to Echo
Polly caught sight of him in time
Look out she shouted
That chair wasnt built for a fullgrown man like you
Slim nervously replaced the chair before a writingdesk
Polly wielded her broom about the feet of the Sheriff who danced clumsily about trying to avoid her
Youre just trying to sweep me out of here he complained
Well if you will bring dust in with you you must expect to be swept out Polly replied with a show of spirit
Polly was shaking the mat vigorously at the door when Slim said I see they buried Poker Bill this mornin
Is HE dead
It was the first Polly had heard of the passing away of one of the characters of the Territory
She had expressed her surprise in the of an interrogation emphasizing the he a colloquialism of the Southwest
Slim however had chosen to ignore the manner of speech and with a grin answered Yees thats why they buried him
Polly laughed in spite of herself
What did he die of
she asked
As Slim was about to take a drink at the olla he failed to hear her
Eh
he grunted
What did he die of
she repeated
Five aces was the sober reply of the Sheriff before he drained the gourd
Polly put the broom back of the door and was rearranging the articles on the table before Slim could muster up enough courage to speak on the topic which was always uppermost in his mind when in her presence
Say Miss Polly he began
If youve anything to say to me Slim Hoover just say itI cant be bothered todayall the fixins and things saucily advised the girl
Well what I want to say is began the Sheriff
At this moment Bud Lane laboring under heavy excitement burst open the door
Say Slim youre wanted down at the corral he cried paying no heed to Polly
Shucks
exclaimed the disappointed Sheriff
Whats the row
I dont knowBuck McKeehes there with some of the Lazy K outfit
They want to see you
Slim threw himself out the door with the mild expletive Darn the luck
Bud turned quickly to Polly
Did Jack pay off the mortgage last week
he almost shouted at the girl
Polly stamped her foot in anger at what seemed to her to be a totally irrelevant question to the lovemaking she expected How do I know
she angrily replied
If that is all you came to see me for you can go and ask him
It makes me so doggone mad
Polly with flushed face and knitted brow left the bewildered Bud standing in the center of the room asking himself what it was all about
The sound of the voices of disputing men floated in from the corral
Bud heard them and comprehended its significance
Its all up with me he cried in mortal terror
Buck McKee has stirred up the suspicion against Jack Payson
Jack paid off his mortgage and they wanted to know where he raised the money
Well Jack can tell
If he cant Ill confess the whole business
I wont let him suffer for me
Buck shant let an innocent man hang for what weve done
The sound of footsteps on the piazza and the opening of the door drove Bud to take refuge in an adjoining room where he could overhear all that was happening
He closed the door as the cowpunchers entered with Slim at their head
CHAPTER XI Accusation and Confession Buck McKee had not been idle in the days following the slaying of Ole Man Terrill
Having learned that Slim and his posse had discovered only the fact that the murderer had ridden a pacing horse to the ford McKee took full advantage of this fact
In the cowcamps the barrooms and at the railroadstation he hinted at first that a certain person every one knew could tell a lot more about the death of the old man than he cared to have known
After a few days he began to bring the name of Payson into the conversation
His gossip became rumor and then common report
When it became known that Jack had paid off the mortgage on his ranch Buck came out with the accusation that Payson was the murderer
Finding that he was listened to Buck made the direct charge that Payson had killed the stationagent and with the proceeds of the robbery was paying off his old debts
Gathering his own men about him and being joined by the idle hangerson which are to be found about every town Buck lead his party to the ranch on the Sweetwater to accuse Jack and so throw off in advance any suspicions which might attach to himself
Fortunately Slim happened to be at Jacks ranch at the time
When he entered the corral he found Jacks accusers and defenders rapidly nearing a battle
Jack was taking the charges coolly enough as he did not know what support McKee had manufactured to uphold the charges he made
Slim informed McKee he would listen to what he had to say and if afterward he thought Jack guilty he would place him under arrest
For all concerned it would be better to go into the house
The Sweetwater boys surrounded Jack as they followed Slim into the livingroom
Lining up in opposing groups Slim stood in the center to serve as judge and jury with Buck and Jack at his right and left hand
Inside the door Jack said Keep as quiet as you can boys
I dont want to alarm my wife
Now what is it
The punchers hushed their discussion of the charge and listened attentively to what the men most interested had to say
Well darn it all apologized the Sheriff to Jack its all darn fool business anyway
Buck here he started it
Jack smiled sarcastically and glancing at McKee remarked Buck McKees started a good many things in his day Buck began to bluster
He could not face Jack fairly
Already placed on the defense when he had considered he would be the accuser McKee took refuge in the plea of being wronged by false suspicion
I aint goin he whined to have folks suspicion me of any such doins as the killin of Ole Man Terrill
I got a witness to prove I wasnt in twenty miles of the place
Whos your witness
asked Slim in his most judicial tones
Bud Laneme an him rode over to the weddin togetherfrom the Lazy K an I was put out as not fittin to be there an by that very man there that did the killin
The punchers had to grin in spite of the seriousness of the occasion
Buck appeared to be deeply hurt at the unceremonious way he had been left out at the feast
What makes you point to me as the man
asked Jack quietly
You was late gettin to your own weddin
Fresno could not repress his feelings any longer
He started angrily toward McKee but Jack and Sagebrush held him back
The others were about to follow his lead when Slim motioned them back with the caution Keep out of this boys
I was late explained Jack but I told you I rode around to the station to get a weddingpresent I ordered for my wife Jim interrupted him to substantiate the statement
Pointing to a chair he said Thats so
There it is toothat there chair
The Sweetwater outfit nodded in acquiescence but the others looked incredulous
Buck sneered at the defense which Jack made
Nobody saw you over that way did they
I saw Terrill
It must have been just before he was killed
I didnt meet anybody else
Jack showed no trace of temper under the inquisition
Of course you saw him before he was killedabout a minute
Mebbe you didnt plug him the next minute with a 44
The charge roused Sagebrushs fighting blood
Drawing his gun he attempted to get a fair shot at the accuser
Fresno and Show Low grabbed him by the arms holding him back
The foreman shouted Therell be some one plugged right now if youall make another break like that
Slim waved his hands over his head driving the men backward as if he were shooing away a flock of chickens
Easy noweasy he drawled
There aint agoin to be nothin doin here cept law an justice
Buck laughed sneeringly at the wavering of his men
He would have to do something to put more heart into them and regain the ground he had lost by his singlehanded conduct of the case
There aint eh
he asked contemptuously
Well its lucky I brought some of my own outfit with me
Mebbe youll need them if you get too careless with your talk answered the unruffled Sheriff
Turning to Jack Slim said This fool thing can be settled with one word from you
The young ranchman listened to the Sheriff earnestly
He wished to clear himself forever of all suspicion
He did not want Echo ever to hear that there was a false impression abroad that she was the wife of a slayer
What is it
he asked simply
Why you paid off a mortgage of an even three thousan dollars last week didnt you
Yes what has that to do with it
he asked
Buck broke in at this point
Here was the strongest card that he had in his hand and the Sheriff had played it to McKees advantage
Plenty Buck shouted
Old Terrill was shot and killed and robbed an the man who did it got just three thousan dollars
An you mean to say that the boss here began Sagebrush in his anger making a rush at McKee
He was held back but the disturbance attracted Echo and Mrs Allen from the kitchen
Echo hurried to her husbands side
He slipped his arm about her waist and together they faced his accuser
All you got to say is where did you get that money cried Buck who had seen Dick Lane pay it to Payson and conjectured that Payson did not dare to reveal the fact of this payment with all the disclosure it implied
Why it was paid to me by Then Jack stopped
He could not tell who gave him the money without revealing to Echo the return of Dick
The whole miserable lie would then come out
Echo noticed jacks hesitancy
What is itwhats the matter
she asked in frightened tones
Nothing nothing he answered lightly to lessen her terror
Hats off everybody commanded Slim in deference to the presence of Echo
Who are these menwhats wrong
pleaded Echo
Buck bowed to the trembling woman who had thrown her arms about her husbands neck
Nothin he exclaimed
Only we want to know where your husband got the money to pay off the mortgage on this ranch
The request seemed a very simple one to Echo
All the talk of harming Jack the high words the threats could be silenced easily by her hero
Smiling into his eyes Echo said Tell them Jack
I cant he faltered
It was paid to him by a friend bravely began Echo
A friend to whom he lent it some time ago
Buck interrupted her explanation
Then let him tell his friends name and where we can find him
Turning to Jack he bullied Come onwhats his name
Jack closed his eyes to shut out the sight of his wife
In his agony he clenched his fists until his nails sank into the flesh
I cant tell you that he cried in misery
Of course he cant sneered Buck smiling evilly in his triumph
He cant account for himself on the night of the weddin he rides a pacin horserode on that night he gets three thousan dollars paid him and he cant tell who paid it whats the verdict
Buck did not wait for an answer
Raising his voice he shouted Guilty
Damn you bellowed Sagebrush lunging toward him only to be held in restraint by his associates
Jack
Jack
what have you to say
begged Echo
Nothing was his only answer
Tell him he lies
cried Sagebrush
Jack we all know you youre as white a man as ever lived an they aint one of this outfit that aint ready to die for you right now You bet
chorused his men
He aint goin to get off like that declared Buck
Looking confidently at his own followers he said The Lazy K can take care of him
Bucks men moved closer to him preparing to draw their guns if need be and open fire on Jacks defenders
Look out boss
warned Sagebrush at the hostile movement of Buck and his punchers
Hold on
drawled the Sheriff who as the danger grew more real became more deliberate in his movements
They aint goin to be nothin done here unless its done in the lawyou all know me boysIm the sheriffthis mans my prisoner
Pointing to Jack he added There aint nobody goin to take him from me an live
Buck saw Jack slipping from his clutches
Youre not goin to be bluffed by one man are you boys
No his punchers answered in unison crowding toward Jack who held up his hand and cried Stop
I want a fair deal and Ill get it
Ill settle this thing all right
All I ask is a few words alone with my wife
Jack clasped Echo to his breast as he begged this boon from the men who sought his life
No
blustered Buck
Yes ordered Slim quietly but emphatically
Paysonyoull give me your word you wont try to escape
Yes agreed Jack
His word dont go with us shouted Buck
Slim laid his hand on the butt of his revolver ready to draw if necessary to enforce his command
Buck saw the movement and shouted to him Keep your hand away from that gun Sheriff
You know I am quick on the draw
He significantly fingered his holster as he spoke
So Ive heard tell agreed Slim hastily withdrawing his hand from his revolver
Slim appeared to agree to the surrender of Jack to Buck and his punchers permitting them to deal with him as they saw fit
He fumbled in his lefthand waistcoat pocket pulling out a bag of tobacco and a package of rice paper
Ostentatiously he began to roll a cigarette
Then with the quickness of a cat his left hand was plunged in the inside righthand pocket of his waistcoat
Grasping a revolver by the muzzle he deftly jerked it upward and seized the handle in its flight
He covered Buck McKee before that worthy realized what had happened
With his right hand Slim pulled the weapon which swung at his hip and aimed it at the other boys of the Lazy K The guns moved up and down the line backed by the Sheriffs usually mild blue eyes coldly steady now at the call to battle
Ill give you a lesson in pullin guns though he declared his voice as steady as his hands
Dont move Buck he warned as McKee wavered
Nor any others of you
Im playin this hand alone
Buck McKee youve been flirtin with a tombstone for some time
Hands up gents he ordered raising the pistols significantly
I said GENTS he repeated when Buck McKee did not obey him with alacrity
The balked leader of the Lazy K outfit reluctantly held his hands aloft
Sagebrush
called Slim
Here answered the foreman covering a man with his revolver
Parenthesis
summoned the Sheriff
Here the man of the bowlegs replied as he drew his gun
Me too cried Fresno while Show Low came to the front with An likewise here
When the Lazy K outfit was thoroughly under subjection Slim stepped forward and said Now gentlemen if you please
You see this yeres my party an I regalate it my way
Jack here gave his word to stay and face this thing out
Hes agoin to do it
Im responsible for himSagebrush you will collect at the door sech articles of hardware as these gentlemen has in their beltsI deputize you
Gents as you walk out the do you will deposit yo weapons with Mr Sagebrush Charleythe same to be returned to you when the court sees fit and proper
You aint goin to let him Buck did not finish the sentence for Slim thoroughly aroused shouted Buck McKee if you say another word Im goin to kill you
Gents theres the door your hosses are in the corralget
Preceded by some of the Sweetwater boys the Lazy K outfit filed out Sagebrush taking their guns as they passed him
Fresno and Parenthesis brought up the rear
He neednt think hell escape
Were bound to have him declared Buck
Are you goin
demanded Slim his voice full of menace
Cant you see me
sneered Buck
Sagebrush relieved him of his gun as he passed handing it to Fresno
Buck paused in the doorway long enough to lament Talk of hospitality
I never get in but what I am put out
Slim watched McKee from the window until he disappeared through the gate of the corral
Then walking down to Jack he took him by the hand
Itll be all right in an hourthank you boys Payson assured them
We all know you are the whitest man on the Sweetwater assured Sagebrush speaking for the punchers as they left Jack a prisoner with Slim
Speaking in a low tone Jim asked Jack Where did you get that money
Dont you know
he asked in surprise
From Jack nodded his head
Ill wait for you in the other room said Slim
Maw Polly we all better leave em alone
As the woman and the girl left the room the old ranchman paused at the doorway leading to the kitchen to advise his soninlaw earnestly I low you better tell her its best
The two young people were left alone in the room in which they had passed so many happy hours to face a crisis in their lives
The day which had begun sunnily was to end in darkest clouds
The awful accusation was incredible to Echo
Her faith in her husband was not shaken
Jack she felt could explain
But no matter what the outcome might be she would be loyal to the man she loved
On this point she was wholly confident
Had she not pledged her faith at the marriage altar
Jack
a volume of questions was in the word
Taking her hands in his and looking searchingly in her eyes he said Before I tell you whats been on my mind these many weeksI want to hold you in my arms and hear you say Jack I believe in you
Echo put her arms about his neck and nestling close to his breast declared I do believe in youno matter what circumstances may be against you
No matter if all the world calls you guiltyI believe in you and love you
Jack seated himself at the table and drew his wife down beside him
Putting his arms about her as she knelt before him he murmured Youre a wifea wife of the West as fair as its skies and as steadfast as its hillsand IIm not worthy Not worthyyou haventit isnt gasped Echo starting back from him thinking that Jack was about to confess that under some strange stress of circumstances he had slain the expressagent
No it isnt that hastily answered Jack with a shudder at the idea
Ive lied to you he simply confessed
Lied to meyou
cried Echo in dismay
Ive been a living lie for months relentlessly continued Jack nerving himself for the ordeal through which he would have to pass
Jack wailed Echo shrinking from him on her knees covering her face with her hands
Its about Dick
Echo started
Again Dick Lane had arisen as from out the grave
What of him
she asked rising to her feet and moving away from him
He is alive
Jack did not dare look at his wife
He sat with his face white and pinched with anguish
The young wife groaned in her agony
The blow had fallen
Dick alive and she now the wife of other man
What of her promise
What must he think of her
I didnt know it until after we were engaged pursued Jack six months
It was the day I questioned you about whether you would keep your promise to Dick if he returned
I wanted to tell you then but the telling meant that I should lose you
He wrote to me from Mexico where he had been in the hospital
He was coming homehe enclosed this letter to you
Jack drew from his pocket the letter which Dick enclosed in the one which he had sent Jack telling of his proposed return
She took the missive mechanically and opened it slowly
I wanted to be square with himbut I loved you pleaded Jack
I loved you better than life than honorI couldnt lose you and so His words fell on unheeding ears
She was not listening to his pleadings
Her thoughts dwelt on Dick Lane and what he must think of her
She had taken refuge at the piano on which she bowed her head within her arms
Slowly she arose crushing the letter in her hand
In a low stunned voice she cried You lied to me
Jack buried his face in his hands
Yes he confessed
He came the night we were married
I met him in the garden
He paid that money he had borrowed from me when he went away
Horrorstruck Echo turned to him
He was there that night
she gasped
Oh Jack
You knew and you never told me
I had given my word to marry himyou knowing that have done this thing to me
Her deep emotion showed itself in her voice
The more Jack told her the worse became her plight
I loved you
Jack was defending himself now fighting for his love
Did Dick believe I knew he was living
continued the girl mercilessly
He must have done so
Jack
Jack
sobbed Echo tears streaming down her face
What could I do
I was almost mad with fear of losing you
I was tempted to kill him then and there
I left your father to guard the doorto keep him out until after the ceremony
Jack could scarcely control his voice
The sight of Echos suffering unmanned him
My father too wailed Echo
He thought only of your happiness Jack claimed
What of my promisemy promise to marry Dick
Where is he
moaned the girl
Hes gone back to the desert
Over her swept the memory of the terrible dream
Dick dying of thirst in the desert calling for her crushed to the earth by Jack after battling the awful silence
She moved to the middle of the room as if following the summons
The desert my dream she whispered in awe
He is gone out of our lives forever cried Jack facing her with arms outstretched
And you let him go away in the belief that I knew him to be living
accused the wife
What will not a man do to keep the woman he loves
Dick Lane has gone from our lives he never return argued Jack
He must screamed Echo
There is a crime charged against youhe must return to prove your story as to the moneyHe must know through your own lips the lie that separated us
You love himyou love him
Jack kept repeating the words aghast at the knowledge that Echo seemed to be forcing upon him
Bring him back to me
Firmly she spoke
Jack gazed at her in fear
Chokingly he cried again You love him
I dont know
All I know is that he has suffered is suffering now through your treachery bring him back to me that I may stand face to face with him and say I have not lied to you I have not betrayed your trust
You love him he repeated
Find himbring him back
Jack was helpless speechless
Echos attitude overpowered him
The wife staggered again to the piano slowly sinking to the seat
She had turned her back on him
This action hurt him more than any word she had spoken
Her face was buried in her hands
Deep sobs shook her shoulders
Jack followed her to take her again in his arms but she made no sign of forgiveness
Turning he strode to the rack and took down his hat and cartridgebelt
Picking up his rifle he firmly declared I will go
Ill search the plains the mountains and the deserts to find this man
I will offer my life if it will serve to place the life you love beside you
Goodbye
The sound of the closing of the door roused Echo to a full realization of what she had done
She had driven the one man she really loved out of her life sent him forth to wander over the face of the earth in search of Dick Lane for whom she no longer cared
She must bring her husband back
She must know that he alone had her heart in his keeping
No no Jackcome back
she called
I love you and you alonecome back
come back
Before she could throw open the door and summon him back to happiness and trust Bud who had heard the full confession from the room in which he had taken refuge when he thought Buck would throw the blame on Jack caught her by the arm
Stop
he commanded
Bud Lane
exclaimed Echo you have heard Ive heardmy brotherhe is alive
Bud spoke rapidly
His belief was confirmed
He would have full revenge for what his brother had suffered at Paysons hands
To Echos plea of Dont stop me I he shouted No
and caught the young wife and pulled her back from the doorway
Echo struggled to free herself but the young man was too strong
He had ruined Dicks life stolen from him the woman he loved he hissed in her ear
Jack
Jack
was her only answer
No he shant come backlet him go as he let my brother go out of your life forever
I cantI cant
I love him
Throwing Bud off she ran to the door
Bud pulled his revolver and cried If he enters that door Ill kill him
Outside Echo heard Jack inquiring Echo
Echo
you called me
Echo laid her hand on the knob to open the door when she heard the click of the pistols hammer as Bud raised it
With a prayer in her eyes she looked at the young man
He was obdurate
Nothing could move him
Turning she shrieked No I did not call
Go
in Gods name go
Goodbye
was Jacks farewell
The rapid beat of horses hoofs told of his mounting and riding away
Gone
Oh Bud Bud what have you done
I should have killed him was Buds answer a gazed after the retreating form galloping down trail
Mrs Allen hearing Echos calls hastened in from the kitchen
She found her daughter sobbing at the table
What is the matter child
Then turning to Bud she fiercely demanded of him What have you been saying to her
Nothin he replied as he left the house
Oh mother mother
wailed Echo
JackI have sent him away
Sent him away repeated the startled Mrs Allen
Yes assured Echo
You dont mean to say he is guiltyyou dont mean No no
interrupted Echo
Oh I never thought of thathe must come backcall Dad call Slim
Echo had forgotten Jacks promise to Slim
He too in his period of stress had overlooked the fact that he was a suspected murderer
Now he had fled
He must be brought back to clear his good name
Mrs Allen called her husband and the Sheriff into the room
Whats the row
shouted the Sheriff
Jacks gone cried Mrs Allen
In amazement the two men could only repeat the news Gone
Gone where
crisply demanded the Sheriff
Dont stand there starin do something scolded Mrs Allen
He gave me his word to stay and face this thing out shouted the bewildered Slim
Its all my fault
I sent him away
Echo seized Slims hand as she spoke
You sent him away
She fell on her knees before him
Lifting her hands as in prayer she implored I never thought of his promise to you
He never thought of it
Go find himbring him back to me
Bring him back
howled the excited Sheriff his eyes bulging his cheeks swelling his red hair bristling and his voice ringing in its highest key
Bring him back
You just bet I will
Thats why Im sheriff of Pinal County
Slim whirled out of the door as if propelled by a gigantic blast
Echo fell fainting at her mothers feet
CHAPTER XII The Land of Dead Things Forth to the land of dead things through the cities that are forgotten fared Dick Lane
Tricked by his friend with the woman he loved lost to him he wandered onward
Automatically he took up again his quest for buried treasure
That which in the flush of youthful enthusiasm and roseate prospects of life and love had seized him as a passion was now a settled habit
And fortunately so for it kept him from going mad
He had no thought of gainonly the achievement of a purpose a monomania
With this impulse was conjoined a more volitional motivehe wished to revenge himself upon the Apaches and chiefly upon the renegade McKee whom he supposed still to be with them
Somehow he blamed him rather than Jack Payson as being the chief cause of his miseries
If he had not stolen the buried gold I would have returned in time he muttered He is at the bottom of all this
As I walked away from Jack in the garden I felt as if it was McKee that was following me with his black snaky eyes
Accordingly Dick directed his way to a region reputed to be both rich in buried treasure and infested by hostile Indians
The fable of the Quivira the golden city marked now by the ruins of the Piro pueblo of Tabiri south of the saltdeposits of the Manzano is still potent in Arizona and New Mexico to lure the treasureseeker
Three hundred and fifty years ago it inspired a march across the plains that dwarfs the famous march of the Greeks to the sea
It led to the exploration of the Southwest and California before the AngloSaxon settlers had penetrated half a hundred miles from the Atlantic coast
The cities are forgotten today
The tribe which gave it a name proved to be utter barbarians eaters of raw meat clad only in skins without gold knowing nothing of the arts Teton nomads wandering through Kansas
Yet each decade since witnesses a revival of a wonderful story of the buried treasures of the Grand Quivira
The myth originated in New Mexico in 1540
Antonio de Mendoza was the viceroy of New Spain
Having practically conquered the New World the adventurers who formed his court having no fighting to do with common enemies began to hack each other
Opportunely for the viceroy Fra Marcos discovered New Mexico and Arizona
Gathering the doughty swordsmen together Mendoza turned them over to the brilliant soldier and explorer Francisco Vasquez de Coronado with strict orders to get them as far from the viceroy as he could and then lose them
Coronado and his band were the first to see the Grand Canon of the Colorado
In the latter weeks of 1540 they were in the town of Tiguex
As they were less welcome than the modern tourists who are now preyed upon where these preyed the natives sent them on to the pueblo of the Pecos
Mendoza had sent Coronado into New Mexico on the strength of the trimmings of the myth of the Seven Cities of Cibola
The fabled cities of gold proved to be peaceful settlements
Coronado attempted to lose his cutthroats by having them settle in the country
A plains Indian captive among the Pecos changed his plans and led him to undertake his wonderful march
The Pecos wished to get rid of the guests so they concocted a marvelous story of buried treasures and made the poor captive father it
To the goldchasers the captive was known as The Turk his head being shaven and adorned only with a scalplock a custom noticeable because of its variance from that of the longhaired Pueblos
The Turk told of a tribe of plainsmen who had a great store of the yellow substance
They were called the Quivira
He would lead them to the ancient Rockefellers
Coronado put him at the head of his band and followed him eastward over the plains
For months they plodded after him the Indian trying to lose Coronado and that valiant warrior endeavoring to obey orders to shake his band
About the middle of what is now the Indian Territory Coronado began to suspect that The Turk was selling him a gold brick instead of a bonanza
Landmarks began to look strangely alike
The Turk as he afterward confessed was leading them in a circle
Coronado sent the most of his band back to the Mexican border retaining about thirty followers
With the help of heated bayonets and sundry proddings he then impressed upon The Turk that it was about time for him to find the Quiviras or prepare to go to the happy huntinggrounds of his ancestors
After many hardships The Turk located the tribe they were seeking near the present site of Kansas City
All that Coronado found in the way of metal was a bit of copper worn by a warchief
Not only was the bubble burst but the bursting was so feeble that Coronado was disgusted
He beheaded the guide with his own hands as a small measure of vengeance
With his followers he retraced his weary road to Tiguex
The lesson lasted for half a century when the myth brighter more alluring than ever arose and led others on to thirsty deaths in the bad lands and deserts of the Southwest
It was to the modern version that Lane had succumbed
From the Sweetwater he roved to the south of Albuquerque where the narrow valley of the Rio Grande is rimmed on the east by an arid plateau twenty miles wide and this is in turn walled in by a long cordillera
Through the passes over the summit Lane climbed descending through the pineries parklike in their grandeur and immensity to the bare brown plains which stretch eastward to the rising sun
In the midst of the desert lies a chain of salines accursed lakes of Tigua folklore
Beyond them the plain melts and rebuilds itself in the shimmering sun
To the south and southeast spectral peaks tower to the clouds
Northward the blue shadows of the Sante Fe fall upon the pineclad foothills
Along the lower slopes of the Manzano are the ruins of the ancient pueblos
Abo and Cuarac are mounds of fallen buildings and desertblown sand
Solemn in their grandeur they dominate the lonely landscape in a land of adobe shacks
Thirty miles from Cuarac to the southeast lies Tabiri the Grand Quivira
Huddled on the projecting slopes of the rounded ridges access to it is a weary dreary march
The nearest water is forty miles away
Toiling through sand ankledeep the traveler plods across the edge of the plains through troughlike valleys and up the wooded slope of the Mesa de los Jumanos
A mile to the south a whaleback ridge springs from the valley nosing northward
No sound breaks the stillness of the day
From the higher ridges the eye falls upon the pallid ghost of the city
Blotches of juniper relieve the monotony of the brown lifeless grass
Grays fade into leaden hues to be absorbed in the ashy indeterminate colors of the sunsoaked plains
No fitter setting for a superstition could be found
Once a town of fifteen hundred inhabitants the topography of ridge gave it an unusual shape
Ruins of three fourstory terrace houses face one another across narrow alleys
Six circular cisterns yawn amid mounds of fallen walls
At the center of the southerly blocks towers a gray quadrangular wall the last of a large building
At the western terminus of the village where the slope falls away to the valley is a gigantic ruin
Its walls are thirty feet high and six feet thick
The roof has fallen and the topmost layers of the bluishgray limestone are ragged and timeworn
The building had a frontage of two hundred and two feet and its greatest depth was one hundred thirtyone feet
Flatfaced prisms firmly laid in adobe mortar are placed at irregular intervals in the walls
The northern part of the ruin is one great crossshaped room thirtyeight feet wide and one hundred and thirtyone feet long
A gate fifteen feet wide and eleven feet high opens to the eastward
A mighty timber forms an arch supporting fifteen feet of solid masonry
South of this is a great chamber cut up into smaller rooms with long halls with walls twenty feet in height
In one of the rooms is a fireplace and over the doorways are carved wood lintels
An entrance from the south is given through a spacious antechamber
The rafters hauled fifteen miles must have weighed a ton
Here lies the Colchis of the modern Argonaut
At first the Mexican pried through the debrischoked rooms or feebly tunneled under the walls
With the coming of the white races and the drill holes have been sunk into the original bedrock
To the simple stories of the natives fablebearers have added maps dying confessions and discovered ciphers
This ruin which has caused so many heartbreaks and disappointments are but the fragments of an old mission founded by Francisco de Atevedo in 1628
Tabiri was to be the central mission of Abo and Cuarac
The absence of water leads the modern explorer to believe that when the town was deserted the spring was killed
The gentle fathers who built the church supervised the construction of a waterworks
On a higher ride are three crudely made reservoirs with ditches leading to the village
The Piros had no animals save a few sheep and the water supply was needed only for domestic uses as the precipitation furnished moisture for small crops of beans and corn
All these towns were wiped out by the Apaches the red plague of the desert
First they attacked the outlying forts of the Salines once supposed to be wellwatered teeming with game and fruitful
Tradition again takes the place of unrecorded history and tells that the sweet waters were turned to salt in punishment of the wife of one of the dwellers in the city who proved faithless
In 1675 the last vestige of aboriginal life was wiped out
For a century the Apaches held undisputed control of the country then the Mexican pioneer crept in
His children are now scattered over the border
The American ranchman and goldseeker followed twisting the stories of a Christian conquest into strange tales of the seekers of buried treasures
Through this land Dick had wandered finding his search but a rainbow quest
But he kept on by dull inertia wandering westward to Tularosa then down to Fort Grant and toward the Lava Beds of southwestern Arizona
In all that arid land there was nothing so withered as his soul
Jack well mounted with a packmule carrying supplies had picked up Dicks trail after it left Tularosa from a scout out of Fort Grant
Slim Hoover headed for Fort Grant in his search for Jack
Although the ranchman had only a brief start of him Slim lost the track at the river ford
Knowing Dick had gone into the desert Jack headed eastward while Slim supposing that Jack was breaking for the border to escape into a foreign country turned southward
From the scout who had met Jack and Dick the Sheriff learned that the two men were headed for the Lava Beds which were occupied by hostile Apaches
Detachments of the 3d Cavalry were stationed at the fort with Colonel Hardie in command of the famous F troop a band of Indian fighters never equaled
In turn they chased Cochise Victoria and Geronimo with their Apache warriors up and down and across the Rio Grande
Hard pressed each chieftain in turn would flee with his band first to the Lava Beds and then across the border into Mexico where the United States soldiers could not follow
Hardie fooled Victoria however
Texas rangers had met the Apache chief in an engagement on the banks of the Rio Grande
Only eight Americans returned from the encounter
Hardie took up his pursuit and followed Victoria across the river
The Indians had relaxed their vigilance not expecting pursuit and despising the Mexican Rurales
Troop F caught them off guard in the mountains
The fight was one to extermination
Victoria and his entire band were slain
This was the troop which was awaiting orders to go after the Apaches
Colonel Hardie told Slim that the Indians were bound to head for the Lava Beds
If the men for whom he was looking were in the desert the troops would find them more quickly than Slim and his posse
Slim waited at Fort Grant for orders writing back to Sagebrush telling him of his plans
Fort Grant followed the usual plan of all frontier posts
A row of officers houses faced the paradegrounds
Directly opposite were the cavalry barracks fort
On one side of the quadrangle were the stables and the fourth line consisted of the quartermasters buildings and the posttraders store
Small ranchmen had gathered near the fort for protection and because of the desire of the white man for company
In days of peace garrison life was monotonous
But the Apaches needed constant watching
As a soldier the Apache was cruel and cowardly
He always fought dismounted never making an attack unless at his own advantage
As infantryman he was unequalled
Veteran army officers adopted the Apache tactics and installed in the army the plan of mounted infantry soldiers who move on horseback but fight on foot detailing one man of every four to guard the horses
Methods similar to those used by the Apaches were put into use by the Boers in the South African War
Indeed the scouting of these Dutch farmers possessed many of the characteristics of the Apaches
So too the Japanese soldiers hid from the Russians with the aid of artificial foliage in the same way that an Indian would creep up on his victim by tying a bush to the upper part of his body and crawling toward him on his knees and elbows
Mounted on wiry ponies inured to hardships to picking up a living on the scanty herbage of the plains riding without saddles and carrying no equipment the Indians had little trouble in avoiding the soldiers
Leaving the reservation the Apaches would commit some outrage and then swinging on the arc of a great circle would be back to camp and settled long before the soldiers could overtake them
Hampered by orders from the War Department which in turn was molested by the sentimental friends of the Indians soldiers never succeeded in taming the Apache Crook cut off communications and thrashed them thoroughly in these same Lava Beds that they never recovered
In Slims absence Buck McKee and his gang had taken possession of Pinal County
Rustlers and bad men were coming in from Texas and the Strip
Slims election for another term was by no means certain
He did not know this but if he had it would not have made any difference to him
He was after Jack and at any cost would bring him back to face trial
The rogues of Pinal County seized upon the flight of Jack as a good excuse to down Slim
The Sheriff was more eager to find Jack and learn from him that Bucks charge was false than to take him prisoner
He knew the accusation would not stand full investigation
Slowly the hours passed until the order for boots and saddles was sounded and the troops trotted out of the fort gate
Scouts soon picked up their trail but that was different from finding the Indians
Ofttimes the troopers would ride into a hastily abandoned camp with the ashes still warm but never a sight of a warrior could be had
Over broad mesas down narrow mountain trails and up canons so deep that the sun never fully penetrated them the soldiers followed the renegades
For a day the trail was lost
Then it was picked up by the print of a ponys hoof beside a waterhole
But always the line of flight led toward an Apache spring in the Lava Beds
Slim and his posse took their commands from the officers of the pursuers
The cowpunchers gave them much assistance as scouts knowing the country through which the Indians fled
Keeping in touch with the main command they rode ahead to protect it from any surprise
The chief Indian scout got so far ahead at one time in the chase that he was not seen for two days
Once by lying flat on his belly shading his eyes with his hands and gazing intently at a mountainside so far ahead that the soldiers could scarcely discern it he declared he had seen the fugitives climb the trail
The feat seemed impossible until the second morning after when the scout pointed out to the colonel the ponytracks up the Mountainside
The Apache scouts kept track of the soldiers movements communicating with the main body with blanketsignals and smoke columns
The signlanguage of the Indians of the South is an interesting field of study
On the occasion of a raid like the one described the warriors who were to participate would gather at one point and construct a mound with as many stones in it as there were warriors
Then they would scatter into small bands
When any band returned to the mound after losing a fight and the others were not there the leader would take from the mound as many stones as he had lost warriors
Thus the other bands on returning could tell just how many men had fallen
In the arid regions of the West watersigns are quite frequent
They usually consist of a grouping of stones with a longer triangular stone in the center its apex pointing in the direction where the water is to be found
In some cases the water is so far from the trail that four or five of these signs must be followed up before the water is found
Only the Indian and the mule can smell water
This accomplishment enabled the fleeing Apaches to take every advantage of the pursuing troopers who must travel from spring to spring along known trails
In the long weary chase men and horses began to fail rapidly
Short rations quickly became slow starvation fare
Hardie fed his men and horses on mesquit bean a plant heretofore considered poisonous
For water he was forced to depend upon the cactus draining the fluid secreted at the heart of the plant
With faces blistered by the sun and caked with alkali blue shirts faded to a purple tinge and trousers and accouterments covered with a gray powdery dust the soldiers rode on silently and determinedly
Hour after hour the troop flung itself across the plains and into the heart of the Lava Beds each day cutting down the Apache lead
CHAPTER XIII The Atonement False dawn in the Lava Beds of Arizona
The faint tinge on the eastern horizon fades and the stars shine the more brilliantly in the brief darkest hour before the true daybreak
An icy wind sweeps down canons and over mesas stinging the marrow of the wayfarers bones
In the heavens the innumerable stars burn steadily in crystal coldness
Shadows lie in Stygian blackness at foot of rock and valley
Soft and clear the lights of night swathe the uplands
An awesome silence hangs over the desert
Hushed and humbled by the immensity of space one expects to hear the rush of worlds through the universe
At times the bosom swells with a wild desire to sing and shout in the glory of pure living
The day comes quickly the sun leaping edge of the world floods mesa and canon withering sparing no living thing lavishing reds and purples blues and violets upon canon walls and windsculptured rocks
But a remorseful glare blinding sightdestroying is thrown back from the sand and alkali of the desert
Shriveled sagebrush and shrunken cactus bravely fight for life
A narrow pathway leads from the mesa down the canons wall twisting and doubling on itself to Apache Spring
The trail then moves southward between towering cliffs a lane through which is caught a fardistant glimpse of the mountains
Little whirlwinds of dust spring up ever and anon twirling wildly across the sandy wastes
The air suffocates like the breath of a furnace
Ever the pitiless sun searches and scorches as conscience sears and stings a stricken soul
Down the narrow trail past the spring ride in single file the Apaches slowly on tired horses for the pursuing soldiers have given them no halting space
Naked save for a breechclout with a narrow red band of dyed buckskin about his forehead in which sticks a feather each rides silent grim cruel a hideous human reptile as native to the desert as is the Gila monster
The horse is saddleless
For a bridle the warrior uses a piece of grass rope twisted about the ponys lower jaw
His legs droop laxly by the horses sides
In his right hand he grasps his rifle resting the butt on the knee
The only sound to break the stillness of the day is the rattle of stones slipping and sliding down the pathway when loosened by hoofs of the ponies
Creeping down the canon wall they cross the bottom pass the spring and disappear at a turn in the canon walls
Nature and Indian meet and merge in a world of torture and despair
Dick had fared badly in the Lava Beds
One spring after the other he found dry
His horse fell from exhaustion and thirst he ended the sufferings of his packmule with a revolverbullet
Dick staggered on afoot across the desert hoping to find water at Apache Spring
His blue shirt was torn and faded to a dingy purple
Hat and shoulders were gray with alkali dust
Contact with the rocks and cactus had rent trousers and leggings
His shoes cut by sharply pointed stones and with thread rotted by the dust of the deserts were worn to shreds
Unshaven and unshorn with sunken cheeks and eyes bright with the delirium of thirst he dragged his weary way across the desert
He reached Apache Spring shortly after the passage of the Indians but craving for water was so great that he did not observe their trail
Reeling toward the spring he cast aside his hat and flung down his rifle in his eagerness to drink
Throwing himself on his face before the hollow in the rock from which the water trickled he first saw that the waters had dried up
With his bony fingers he dug into the dry sand crying aloud in despair
Stiffly he arose and blundered blindly to a rock upon which he sank in his weakness
Another day like this and Ill give up the fight he moaned
Apache Spring drythe first time in years Little Squaw Spring nothing but dust and alkali it is twenty miles to Clearwater Springtwentymilesif I can make it
Dick trembled with weakness
His swollen tongue clove to the roof of his mouth
His lips were cracked and blackened
Bits of foam flickered about the corners of his mouth
The glare blinded his eyes which were halfclosed
At times feverwaves swept over him again he shuddered with cold
Sounds of falling waters filled his ears
The sighing of the wind through the canon walls suggested the trickling of fountains
Rivers flowed before his eyes through green meadows only to fade into the desert as he gazed
What a land
what a land
It is the abode of the god of thirst
He tempts men into his valley with the lure of gold and saps the lifeblood from their bodiesdrop by drop
Drop by drop I hear it falling
No it is water I hear
There it is
How cool it looks
Dick rose and staggered toward the cliff
In his delirium of thirst he saw streams of water gush down the mountainside
Holding out his arms he cried Saved saved
His hands fell limply by his sides as the illusion faded
He then doubled them into fists and shook them at the cliff in a last defiance of despair
You shant drive me mad
He seized his empty canteen pressing it to his lips
No I drained that two days agoor was it three
he whispered in panic as he threw it aside
Picking up his gun he falteringly attempted the ascent
I wont give upI wont he shouted huskily
Ive fought the desert before and conquered
Ill conquer againIll His willpower ebbed with his failing strength
Blindness fell upon him
Oblivion swept over him
He sank dying of thirst in the sands of the desert
As the buzzard finds the dead so an Apache crept upon Dick as he lay prostrate
But as the Indian aimed he heard footsteps from a draw
He saw a man approaching the spring
Silently he fled behind the rocks
It was Jack
He had entered the Lava Beds from the east closely following the man for whom he had searched for so many weary months
Others of the Apaches had marked him already
Knowing he would go to the spring they waited warily to learn if he were alone
The band had scattered to surround him at the waterhole
Jacks horse and burro which he had left at the head of the canon were already in the Indians possession
With him he carried his rifle and a Colt revolver
A canteen of water was slung over his shoulder
The desert had placed its stamp upon him turning his clothes to gray
The tan of his face was deepened
Lines about the eyes and mouth showed how much he had suffered physically and mentally in his search for the man he believed was his successful rival in love
Reaching the spring he looked about cautiously before he laid down his Winchester
He tugged at the butt of his revolver to make certain that it could be pulled quickly from the holster
Taking off his hat he knelt to drink
He smiled and confidently tapped his canteen when he found the spring dry
He was raising his canteen to his lips when he spied Dicks body
Jumping behind a rock he pulled his revolver covering the insensible man
It might be a trap
He scanned the trail the cliff the canon
Hearing and seeing nothing he slipped his revolver into his holster and hurried to Dicks side
At first he did not recognize him
The desert and thirst had wrought many changes in his friends face
When recognition came he threw his arms about the prostrate form crying Dick at last at last
His voice was broken with emotion
The search had been so long so weary and the ending so sudden
He had found Dick but it looked as if he came too late
Gathering Dick up in his arms he raised him until his head rested on his knees
Forcing open his mouth he poured a little water down his throat
Then with a moistened handkerchief he wetted temples and wrists
Slowly Dick struggled back to life
Waterwaterits water
he gasped struggling for more of the precious fluid
Easy cautioned Jack
Only a little nowmore when youre stronger
Who is it
cried Dick
Not waiting for Jack to enlighten him he continued No matteryou came in time
I couldnt have held out any longer
All the springs are dryI figured on reaching Clearwater
Jack helped Dick to his feet
Taking his stricken friends right arm he drew it across his shoulders
With his left arm about his waist Jack led him to a seat upon a convenient rock
I came by Clearwater yesterday explained Jack
It is nothing but mud and alkali
My horse dropped three days ago
I had to shoot the packmule
I Dick opened his eyes under the ministrations of Jack
Gazing upward into his face he shouted joyfully Whyits JackJack Payson
Didnt you know me Dick
asked Jack sympathetically
Not at firstmy eyes went to the bad out yonder in the glare
The effort had been too much for Dick
He sat weakly over Jacks knees
Jack turned him partly on his back and let more water trickle down his throat
Dick clutched madly at the canteen but Jack drew it back out of his reach
With his handkerchief he moistened lips and neck
When Dicks strength returned Jack helped him to sit up
Ive been hunting you for months he told him
Hunting for me
echoed Dick
Yes answered Jack
I traced you through the Lost Cities then to Cooney then up in the Tularosas
At Fort Grant they put me on the right trail
As the clouds break revealing the blue of the heavens so Dicks memory came back to him
He shrank from the man at his side
Well
he asked as he stared at his betrayer
Jack gazed fixedly ahead
He dared not look in the face of him he had wronged so bitterly
She wants you he said in a voice void of all emotion
Who wants me
asked Dick after a pause
Echo
Your wife
gritted Dick
He fingered his gun as he spoke
Huskily Jack replied Yes
Bitter thoughts filled the mind of one the other had schooled himself to make atonement
For the wrong he had done Jack was ready to offer his life
He had endured the full measure of his sufferings
The hour of his delivery was at hand
Hard as it was to die in the midglory of manhood it was easier to end it all here and now than to live unloved by Echo hated by Dick despised by himself
She sent me to find you
Bring him back to me
Thats what she said Jack cried in his agony
Your wifeshe said that
faltered Dick
Fiercely in his torture Jack answered Yesmy wifemy wife said it
Bring him back to me
Back
Dick paused
Back to what
he asked himself
Shes your wife isnt she
he demanded
Thats what the law says answered Jack
With the thought of the evening in the garden when he heard Jack and Echo pronounced man and wife surging over him Dick murmured What God hath joined together let no man put asunder
Thats what the Book says answered Jack
But when hands alone are joined and hearts are asunder it cant go on record as the work of God
Dick bowed his head in his hands
I dont understand
Stubbornly Jack pursued his message to Dick
She doesnt love me
I thought I had won her but she married me with your image in her heart
She married me yet all the while you were the man she lovedyouyouand in the end I found it out
Jacks voice sank almost into a whisper as he finished his revelation to Dick who raised his head and cried And yet she broke her faith with me Jack arose in his misery
His task was harder than he expected
Dick was forcing him to tell all without concealing even the smallest trifle of his shame
She thoughtyou were dead
I never told her otherwise
I lied to herI lied to her
She never knew
asked Dick joyfully
The letter
I never gave it to her answered Jack simply
Dick leaped to his feet pulling his revolver from his holster
And I thought her false to her trust
He aimed his gun at Paysons heart
I ought to kill you for this
Jack spread out his arms and calmly replied Im ready
Dick dropped his gun and slipped it into the holster with a gesture of despair
But its too late now too late
In his eagerness to tell Dick the way he had solved the problem Jack spoke nervously and quickly
No it isnt too late
Theres one way out of thisone way in which I can atone for the wrong Ive done you both and I stand ready to make that atonement
It is your right to kill me but it is better that you go back to her without my blood on your hands Gobackto her
questioned Dick as the meaning of the phrase slowly dawned upon him
Yes said Jack holding out his hands
Go back with clean bands to Echo Allen
It is you she loves
Theres my horse up yonder
Beyond therere the packmule loaded with water and grub
Plenty of water
Well just change places thats all
You take them and go back to her and Ill stay here
Dick walked toward the spring but a spell of weakness came over him and he almost sank to the ground
Jack caught him and held him up
It would be justice muttered Dick as if apologizing for his acceptance of Jacks renunciation
Leaning over his shoulder Jack said Sure thats it justice
Just tell her I tried to work it out according to my lightsask her toforgive to forgive thats all
Jack took off his canteen and threw the strap around Dicks neck
As Lane weakly staggered toward the mouth of the canon where the horse had been staked out Jack halted him with a request Theres another thing I left home under a cloud
Buck McKee charged me with holding up and killing Ole Man Terrill for three thousand dollars
Tell Slim Hoover how you paid me just that sum of money
I will and Ill fix the murder where it belongs and then fix the real murderer
Jack stepped to Lanes side and holding out his hand said Thank you
I dont allow you can forgive me
I dont know that I could coldly answered Dick
Youd better be going
Again Dick started for the horse but a new thought came to him
Pausing he said
She cant marry again until Well
asked Jack his voice was full of sinister meaning and he fingered his gun as he spoke
Dick realized at once that Jacks plan was to end his life in the desert with a revolvershot
You mean to he shuddered
Jack drew his gun
Do you want me to do it here and now
he cried
Staggering over to him the weakened man grappled with his old friend trying to disarm him
No no you shant
he shouted as Jack shook him free
Why not
demanded Jack
Go
Theres my horsehes yours go
When you get to the head of the canon youll hear and knowknow that she is free and I have made atonement
Why should I hesitate
argued Dick with himself
I wanted to die
I came here in the desert to make an end of it all but when I met death face to face the old spirit of battle came over me and fought it back step by step
Nownow you come and offer me more than lifeyou offer to restore to me all that made life dear all that you have stolen from me by treachery and fraud
Why should I hesitate
She is mine mine in heart mine by all the ties of lovemine by all its vowsI will go back I will take your place and leave you herehere in this land of dead things to make your peace with God
Beads of sweat broke out on Jacks forehead as he listened
He bit his lips until they bled
Clenching his fingers until the nails sank into the palms of his hands he cried warningly in his agony I wouldnt say no more if I was you
Gofor Gods sake go
Dick slowly moved toward the mouth of the canon still hesitating
From the hillside a rifleshot rang out
The ball struck Dick in the leg
He fell and lay motionless
Pulling his revolver Jack stooped and ran under the overhanging ledge peering about to see where the shot had come from
He raised his gun to fire when a volley of rifleshots rang through the canon the bullets kicking up little spurts of dust about him and chipping edges off the rocks
Jack dropped on his knees and crept to his rifle clipping his revolver back into his holster
Crouching behind a rock with his rifle to his shoulder he waited for the attackers to show themselves
Experience on the plains taught them that the fight would be a slow one unless the Apaches sought only to divert attention for the time being to cover their flight southward
After the one shot which struck Dick and the volley directed at Jack not a rifle had been fired
Peering over the boulder Jack could see nothing
The Lava Beds danced before his eyes in the swelter of the glaring sunshine
Far off the snowcapped mountains mockingly reared their peaks into the intense blue of the heavens
Since the attackers were covered with alkalidust from the long ride a color which would merge into the desert floor when a man lay prone detection of any movement was doubly difficult
Behind any rock and in any clump of sagebrush might lie an assailant
Dick had fallen near the spring
He struggled back to consciousness to find his left leg numb and useless
When the ball struck him he felt only a sharp pinch
His fainting was caused by a shock to his weakened body but not from fear or pain
With the return to his senses came a horrible burning thirst and a horrible sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach
He lay breathing heavily until he got a grip on himself
Then he tore the bandanna handkerchief from his neck and bound up the wound winding the bandage as tightly as his strength permitted to check the bloodflow
What is it
asked Jack over his shoulder
Indiansthe Paches are out
Im hit gasped Dick
He crawled painfully and slowly to Jacks side dragging his leg after him
He pulled with him his rifle which he picked up as he passed from the spot where it had fallen in his first wild rush for water
The soldiers told me at Fort Grant about the Paches being out Jack whispered hoarsely
I thought theyd crossed the border into Mexico
Seeing a spasm of pain sweep over Dicks face he asked Are you hurt bad
I dont know
My left leg is numb
Both men spoke scarcely above a whisper fearing to betray their positions by the sound of their voices
Dick lay on his back gathering strength to ward off with rifle and revolver the rush which would come sooner or later
Jack caught the sound of a falling stone
Peering cautiously over the rock he saw an Indian creep up a draw toward them
Throwing his rifle to his shoulder he took quick aim and fired
The Apache jumped to his feet ran a few steps forward and fell sprawling
A convulsive shudder shook him and he lay still
I got him
cried Jack exultantly as he saw the result of the shot
But the exposure of his head and shoulders above their barricade had drawn forth more shots from other members of the band
The bullets struck near the two men showing that the Apaches had the range
Dicks wound was bleeding freely but the shock of the blow had passed away and his strength returned
Drawing his revolver he crept closer to Jack crying I can shoot some
I reckon you havent more than a fleshwound encouraged Jack
Can you crawl to the horse
I think I can answered Dick
Then go
Take the trail home
Ill keep these fellows busy while you get away
The Apaches were showing themselves more as they darted from rock to rock drawing closer to the entrapped men down the boulderstrewn draws or ravines leading into the canon
An Apache had crawled to the head of a draw and crossed the butte into a second ravine which led to the trail down the cliffside
On his belly he had wormed his way up the pathway until he overlooked the rear of the defensive position the two men occupied
Screened by a hedge he awaited a favorable shot
Jack again cautiously raised his head and peered over the barricade
Still not an enemy was in sight
As the Apaches had ceased to fire he knew they were gathering for another simultaneous rush
The purpose of these dashes was twofold While one or two men might be killed in the advance the whole party was nearer the object of attack at the finish and the defenders were demoralized by the hopelessness of all resistance
For the silent rising of naked paintdaubed Indians from out of the ground the quick closing in of the cordon similar to the turn of a lariat around a snubbingpost when a pony weakens for a moment is calculated to shake the nerves of the strongest of Indianfighters
In the breathingspace which the Apaches had given them Jack who had resigned himself to die took a new grip on life
His dream of atonement had worked out better than he had planned
Selling his life bravely fighting in a good cause was far far better than ending it by his own hand
It was a mans death
Fate had befriended him in the end
Reaching his hand out to Dick he touched his shoulder rousing him from a stupor into which he was sinking
Quick Dick theyre coming closer
Go he ordered
Dont be a fool only one of us can escape
One of us alone
Let it be you Dick go back to her back to home and happiness
Dick struggled to a sitting posture offering a fair target for the Indian hidden behind the ledge on the cliff trail
The Apache took full advantage and fired but missed
Dick returned the shot with his revolver before the warrior could sink back behind the rock
The Apache lurched forward in his deathblindness with the last convulsive obedience of the muscles ere the will flees
Then his legs crumpled up beneath him and he toppled forward off the ledge
His breechclout caught in a rocky projection causing the body to hang headlong against the side of the cliff
His rifle fell from his nerveless hands clattering and breaking on the rocks below
The sight served as a tonic to Dick
His success braced his strength and will
The old battlespirit surged over him
Only with an effort did he suppress the desire to laugh and shout
He would have left Jack to fight it out alone but a minute before but the one shot drove all such ideas from his mind
No
Ill be damned if Ill go
he shouted
Ill stay and fight with you and seizing his rifle joined Jack in stopping a rush of the Apaches
We stopped them that time Jack cried with satisfaction
In the lull he again urged his comrade to escape to the horse and return to Echo
Take the horse he insisted
Go while theres a chance
No shouted Dick determinedly
It was as much his fight as Jacks now
Jack thought more for Echo in that moment than he did for himself
Here was the man she loved
He must go back to her
The womans happiness depended upon it
But Jack realized that while he was alive Dick would stay
One supreme sacrifice was necessary
Go he cried or Ill stand up and let em get me No we can hold them off begged Dick firing as he spoke
Jacks hour had struck
It was all so supremely simple
There were no waving flags no cheering comrades
He was only one of two men in the desert dirty grimy and sweaty his mouth dry and parched his eyes stinging from powderfumes his hands numb from the effects of rapid firing
His mind worked automatically he seemed to be only an onlooker
The man who first fought off the Apaches and who was now to offer himself as a sacrifice was only one of two Jack Paysons a replica of his conscious self
Swiftly Jack Payson arose and faced the Indians
Goodbye
he cried to his comrade
Dick struggled to his feet and threw himself on Jack to force him down behind the barricade
For a moment both men were in full view of the Apaches
A volley crashed up and across the canon
Both men fell locked in each others arms then lay still
The Indians awaited the result of the shots
The strange actions of the men might be only a ruse
Silence would mean they were victorious
Both Jack and Dick had been struck
Jack was the first to recover
Reviving he struggled out of the clasp of his unconscious comrade
Hes hit bad he said to himself and so am I Ill fight it out to the last and if they charge they wont get us alive
Dick groaned and opened his eyes
Im hit hard he whispered youd better go
Jack was on his hands and knees crawling toward his rifle when his comrade spoke
Listen he replied
Were both fixed to stay now so lie close
Ill hold em off as long as I can but if they rush save one shot for yourselfyou understand
Yes not alive
answered Dick weakly his voice thin and his face ashen white with pain
Jack reached the boulder and with an effort raised himself and peered over the edge
Theyre getting ready
Will you take my hand now
he asked as he held it out to Dick
I sure will his wounded comrade cried grasping it with all the strength he possessed
Jack smiled in his happiness
He felt he had made his peace with all men and at last was ready to meet death with a clear conscience
It looks like the end
But well fight for it
The shrill warwhoops of the Indians the first sound they had made in the fight showed they felt confident of overcoming the men in the next rush
Jack and Dick had abandoned the rifles and were now fighting the Indians off with their revolvers as they closed in on them
Hardie had halted the night before at Clearwater Spring
Finding it but mud and alkali he had merely rested his men and horses for a few hours and then pushed on for Apache Spring where he hoped to strike water
The troop rode through the early morning hours full of grit and keen to overtake the Apaches traces of whose flight were becoming more evident every mile
All weariness had vanished
Even the horses felt there was something in the air and answered the buglecall with fresh vigor and go
A scout first heard the firing at the spring
He did not wait to investigate knowing he could do nothing alone
The volleys the difference in the reports of the rifles proved to him that one party was firing Springfields and the other Winchesters
He knew that the Apaches were being held off
Galloping back to the troop he reported the fight to its commander
The bugles sounded
The horses were forced into a gallop
With clashing accouterments and jingling spurs and bits they dashed across the mesa to the head of the trail
Here they met Slim Hoover and his posse coming from an opposite direction
The firing in the canon was more intermittent now
Dick and Jack were saving their revolvershots
The Indians were closing in for the last rush
Hardie dismounted his men and threw his troops as groups of skirmishers down the draws leading into one side of the canon
Slim and his posse were on the left flank armed with revolvers
Hardie with a section dashed down the trail
They came upon the Apaches with the rush of a mountain torrent striking them in the front and on the flank
The cavalrymen fired at will each plunging from one cover to another as he picked out his man
The Indians for a few moments replied shot for shot
Their stand was a short one however and they began to fall back
Slim entered the canon at the head of the scouts driving the Apaches before him
Both Jack and Dick had fallen
Across the bodies a wave of the battle flowed
Once the Indians rallied but so sudden was the attack so irresistible the forward dash of the cavalrymen that they became discouraged and broke and fled toward their horses with the soldiers in pursuit
Slim hurried to Dicks side seeing he was the worst hurt
As he knelt beside him the dying man opened his eyes and smiled
Leaning over him Slim heard him gently whisper Tell her I know she was true and not to mind
With a deep sigh his eyelids fluttered and all was still
The scouts had taken charge of Jack who was unconscious and bleeding freely
From the spring the fighting had drifted southward
Few of the Indians reached the horses and fewer still got away
Scattering shots showed the hunt for those who fled on foot was still on
Then soft and mellow over canon and mesa and butte floated the buglecall recalling the cavalrymen to the guidon
Back they came cheering and tumultuous only to be silenced by the presence of their dead
They buried Dicks body near the spring and carved his name with a cavalry saber on a boulder nearby
At dawn the next day they began the long march back to Fort Grant
Slim took charge of Jack nursing him back to life
CHAPTER XIV The Roundup Much has been written of the passing of the cowboy
With the fenced range winter feedingand short drives his occupation once appeared to be gone
But the war of the sheep and cattlemen in the Western States has recently caused the government to compel the cattlemen to remove the fences and permit the herds of sheep and cattle to range over public lands and this means a return of the regime of the cowboy with its old institutions
Chief among these is the roundup
A sheepman can shear wherever he happens to be
He can entrain at the nearest shippingpoint to his grazingbed
But a herd of cattle will range four hundred miles in a season so the cattlemen will be forced to revive the roundup and make the long drives either back to the home ranch or to the railroad
More cowboys will have to be employed
All the free life of the open will return
At work the cowpuncher is not of the drinking carousing fighthunting type nor again is he of the daring romantic school
He is a Western man of the plains
True after loading up his cattle and getting paid off he may spend his vacation with less dignity and quiet than a bank clerk
But after a year of hard work with coarse fare he must have some relaxation
He takes what he finds
The cattletowns cater to his worst passions
He is as noisy in his spending as a college boy and on the average just as good natured and eager to have a good time
Only a man of tried and proved courage can hold his job
Skill and daring are needed to handle the halfwild beasts of the herds
The steer respects no one on foot but has a wholesome fear for a mounted man
Taken separately neither man nor horse has the smallest chance with range cattle but the combination inspires the fear noticeable among the Apaches for cavalryman as compared with their contempt for footsoldiers
The longhorned steer will fight with the ferociousness of a tiger
A maddened cow will attack even a man on horseback
The most desperate battles of the range are with cows who have lost their calves
The cowpuncher first comes in contact with his cattle at the roundup
The outfit consists of a foreman with eight men to each thousand head as drivers
Each man has from six to ten mounts
The broncos are only halfbroken
But they follow a steer like a terrier does a ball
They delight in the game as much as a polopony
A chuckwagon accompanies each outfit
This is usually of the United States Army type solidly built and hauled by four mules
The cook of the outfit is the driver
He has a helper a tenderfoot or a boy learning the trade
In the field only the bravest dares defy the cook
His word on the camp is law
All the men are subject to his call
In the wagon are carried a tent the mens bedding sleepingbags and stores consisting of pork navy beans flour potatoes canned tomatoes and canned peaches
At the rear end of the wagon bed is a builtup cupboard the door of which can be lowered with straps to make a table
Dishes the lighter food supplies and a small medicinechest are stored there
A waterbarrel is strapped to the side of the wagon
Enough firewood for emergency use is packed under the drivers seat
No wagon is complete without a bucket hanging from the axle
The spare horses are driven with the herd the men taking turns at the task
At daybreak each morning the cowboys scatter from the messwagon riding up and down the draws and over the hills driving in the cattle for branding and the cutting out or separating from the herd of marketable beeves
These are known as dogies sealions and longhorns
The size as well as the nickname depends upon the location of the range
The cattle of the Sweetwater valley were smaller than the northern stock
From four to six thousand were driven at a time
The calves are lassoed and thrown and the owners brand is burned into the hide leaving a scar which if the work is well done will last until the beef is sold
Branding is hard work
The dust the odor of burning flesh the heat of the corral fire for heating the irons the bellowing of frightened mother cows and the bleating of the calves the struggles with the victims these try mens strength and tempers severely
Once branded the calf is turned loose and not touched again until it is four years old and ready for the market
Stray unbranded cattle over a year old are known as mavericks and become the property of any person branding them
Having cut out the stock for the drive a road mark a supplementary brand for identification burned into the hides
The long march then begins
A start is made usually in the late spring to reach the railroad in the fall
The drive is as orderly as the march of an army
By natural selection the leaders of the cattle take the head of the herd
They are especially fitted for the place
The same ones are found in the front every day and the others fall into position so that throughout the drive the cattle occupy the same relative position each day
A herd of a thousand beef will stretch out for two miles
The leaders are flanked by cowboys riding upon Mexican saddles with high backs and pommels
The stirrups are worn long the riders standing in them in emergency
The Mexican is the only saddle fitted for rough work
The cowboys seat his ease in the saddle would make a poor showing in a riding academy or in a cavalry school
Yet the park rider and the soldier would be helpless on the range
The cowpuncher of the plains and the Cossack of the steppes are said to be the best riders in the world yet each has a different saddle and seat
An exchange of equipment makes poor riders of both of them
The cowpuncher of Texas and Arizona wears chaps of leather or sheepskin to protect his legs from the mesquitbushes or the thorns of the cactus
These plants not being found in the northern plains chaps are not worn there
The cowboy wears a handkerchief about the neck not for protection from the sun but to cover the mouth while riding through sand and windstorms
Flankers ride on each side of the herd at regular intervals
The chuckwagon and the spare horses follow far enough in the rear to avoid the dust
For the first few days the drives are long and hard averaging from twentyfive to thirty miles a day until the cattle are well tired
Then the pace is set at twelve to fifteen miles
From dawn until noon the herd is allowed to water and graze along the trail toward their destination
About noon they become restive
The cowboys then drive them steadily forward for eight or ten miles until early evening when they are halted for another graze
As night falls they are turned into the bedding grounds
The men ride slowly around the herd crowding them into a compact mass
As the circle lessens the beasts lie down to rest and chew their cuds
About midnight the cattle usually get up stand a while and then lie down again having changed sides
The nightguard slowly circles the herd the men relieving each other at stated intervals
On rainy stormy nights the guard has to double as the cattle are restless and easily stampeded
Under a clear sky breathing the bracing air of the plains with the herd well in hand the days work is a pleasant one
But in a steady downpour with the thunder rolling and the animals full of fear the task is one to tax the stoutest heart
The cause of a stampede is always some trifle
A heavy clap of thunder a flash of lightning the breaking of a stick the howl of a wolf will start the herd off in a blind rush in any direction heedless of cliffs over which they may tumble or of rivers whose current will sweep hundreds of the frightened beasts to death
Once the cattle are off on a stampede the cowboys ride recklessly madly to the head of the herd getting to one side of the leaders
With shouts and pistolshots they turn the leaders to one side gradually at first and then into the arc of a great circle
Blindly racing after the leaders the other cattle follow and round they plunge until head and tail of the herd meet and milling begins
Any that fall are ground to death by the hoofs of the others
This mighty grind continues until the animals are exhausted or they have recovered from the fight
To soothe the hysterical beasts the men begin to sing
Any song will do but the drawling old hymn tunes of the Methodist campmeetings have the best effect
Ofttimes the more hysterical members of the herd are shot as a stampede means a great loss
Animals that stampede once are prone to do it again
The mingling of herds increases the danger
In old days the approach of a herd of buffalo was sure to start a stampede among cattle
Men were detailed to turn the shaggy monsters aside whenever they came within hearing
Rivers are crossed by one of the cowpunchers swimming his horse in the lead and the other men driving the animals after him
Once near the shippingpoint the herd is allowed to rest up and fatten while the owner makes his deal with the cattlebuyers of Omaha or Chicago
The animals are driven or decoyed into the cars and the last journey to the packinghouse begins
Punchers accompany them to feed and water the beasts on the trip
They help turn them into the pens
One night in Chicago one meal a dinner ending with a Lillian Russell peaches or apple pie covered with icecream as dessert and the punchers start West again to begin anew the work of the fall roundup which is on a smaller scale than the spring one
It is dawn in the valley of the Sweetwater
The spring rains have freshened the verdure of the plain
Clumps of coarse grass fringe the rivers brink
Cacti and Spanish bayonets nod in the morning breeze which sweeps down from the mountains
Yucca palms and sahuaroes glisten with the dew
In the distance rise the foothills crowned with stunted liveoaks
On the horizon tower the mountains pineclad to the timberline bare and desolate above
The outfit of Sweetwater Ranch has gathered for the roundup and the drive to the railroad
In the absence of her husband Echo Payson had assumed complete charge of the ranch and with the help of Sagebrush had carried on the work just as she thought Jack would do hoping against hope for his return in safety and hiding her sorrow from those about her
Under a clump of cottonwood a chuckwagon has halted
Many of the boys on the roundup are still asleep the night herders returning to camp
The cook has started his preparations for breakfast
His wagon has a covered top like a prairieschooner
The tailboard has been lowered to form a table supported by rawhide straps
About him are scattered tin cups and kitchen utensils
A thin spiral of smoke arises from the fire which has been made in a shallow pit to prevent a spread of flames
The flickering flashes illumine the cooks face as he bends over a steaming pot of coffee and reveal the features of Parenthesis
Parenthesis is mixing dough in a dishpan set on the tailboard
Sagebrush kneels near him putting on his spurs preparatory to saddling up as he goes on the first relief
Wake up Texas and the other boys Fresno ordered Sagebrush
The Californian threw away the butt of his cigarette and shook each man by the shoulder
With much yawning and rubbing of eyes the men crawled from their sleepingbags
Dashing cold water into their faces from a basin beside the waterbarrel they drank copiously of the coffee which Parenthesis poured out for them
Mostly all the boys are in now aint they
asked Parenthesis looking about the group
Yep answered Sagebrush well finish brandin the calves today
I reckon Fresno will have to take charge of the drive
I cant leave the ranch until Jack gets back
Show Low was the only sleeper who had not responded to Parenthesis call
That worthy walked over and gave him a kick which brought forth a grunt but no other sign of an awakening
Returning to the fire Parenthesis took a tin cup and poured himself out a cup of coffee
Heard any word from him yet
he asked as he gulped the beverage
Nothin replied Sagebrush grimly
Slim wrote from Fort Grant he was on the trail but the Paches were out an they wouldnt let him leave the fort till the soldiers went with him
Slim hadnt oughter gone and left things the way he did
Buck McKee is gettin a lot of bad men together and lows he is goin to run for sheriff himself growled Fresno
Hes sure got a tough outfit with him Slim being away aint doin us any good
All the rustlers from Texas an New Mexico came trailin into the country just as soon as they heard he was gone
Wont surprise me if we have a run in with the bunch afore we git through with this roundup
I got my eye on that Peruna interjected Fresno
Peruna
whos he
asked Texas
One of Bucks outfit answered Fresno
He is mighty slick with the runniniron and brandin other folks calves
We cant be too careful warned Sagebrush
Things is strained to the bustinpoint and any promise of gunplay is goin to set off a whole lot of fireworks
Show Low was on the verge of waking up
This he did by gradually increasing the volume of each snore and breaking it off with a whistle
At the very moment Sagebrush suggested gunplay Show Low snorted his loudest
Whats that
asked Sagebrush grabbing his revolver
Show Low
Hes a regular brass band when he gets startedfrom the big trombone down to the tin whistle laughed Fresno
Its a wonder he can sleep alongside of that noise
He cant Fresno volunteered
Hell wake himself up in a minute
Hes off now
The snores of Show Low grew more frequent until he climaxed his accompaniment to sleep with one awful snort which awakened him
Eh whats that
he yelled as he bounded to a sitting posture
Didnt I tell you
queried Fresno
Sagebrush grinned and slowly arose gathering up his saddle and rope
Swinging one over each arm he started toward the corral saying Come on boys we got a lot to do today
Git your hosses
The night riders were coming into camp greeting their comrades with grunts or in a few words telling them what to guard against in some particular part of the grazing herd
The sun had risen
The cattle were on their feet browsing the short sweet grass moving slowly toward the river
Work growled Show Low darn me if I aint commenced to hate it
Fresno picked up his saddle to follow his foreman but paused long enough to fire this parting shot at the cook Say Parenthesis if them biscuits youre makin is as hard as the last bunch save four of em for me
I want to shoe that pony of mine
Parenthesis threw a tin cup at Fresno who dodged it
Punching the dough viciously he said Darn his housekeepin
Gets a fellers hands all roughits enough to spile the disposition of a saint
His soliloquy was interrupted by Buck McKee riding up to the wagon from Lazy K outfit which was camping a mile below them
Hello Cookie
How goes it
was his greeting
You wind it up and it goes eight days
Parenthesis bellowed his temper fast reaching the breakingpoint
Jack Payson aint back yet
Buck asked paying no attention to the bad humor of Parenthesis
Not that I knows on
The cook rolled the dough with elaborate care
Nor Hoover
Aint seen him he replied curtly
Well they aint comin back either
They pulled it off pretty slick on us fellers
Hoover he lets Payson go and makes a bluff at chasin after him
Then they gets off somewhere splits up the money and gives us the laugh
Parenthesis turned on him in anger and shouted Ill bet my outfit against a pair of green socks either one of em or both will be back here before this roundup is over
You will eh
snarled Buck
Well were just waitin for em
Well swing Payson so high hell look like a buzzard and as for Hooverwell hes served his last term as sheriff in this yere county you hear me shouting
McKee cut his pony with his quirt and dashed away in time to escape an unwelcome encounter with several members of the Sweetwater outfit who were riding back to camp
Stay with him Bud stay with him shouted Parenthesis as the first of the cowboys pitched on a bucking horse past the chuckwagon the rider using quirt and spurs until he got the bronco into a lope
The other boys followed each cayuse apparently inventing some new sort of deviltry
For two weeks before the roundup the outfit had been busting broncos at the home ranch
Each morning at dawn they started working until the heat of the day forced them to rest
When the temperature crawls to 104 in the shade and the alkalidust is so thick in the corral that the hoofs raise a cloud in which horses can hide themselves twenty feet away when eyes smart and the tongue aches in the parched mouth it becomes almost impossible to handle yourself let alone a kicking struggling bronco
As one day is like another and one horse differs from another only in the order of his tricks to avoid the rope and the saddle a glimpse of the horsemanship of Bud Lane and his fellows will serve as a general picture of life on any Western ranch
The breaking of the ponies was the work of Bud Lane who through the influence of Polly had broken with McKee and returned to work on Sweetwater Ranch in order to assist Echo with whom he had become reconciled on discovering that she had been loyal to his brother even to the extent of sending her husband into the desert to bring Dick back
Bud was the youngest of the hands but a lad born to the saddle and rope
Weak head and strong back for a horsefighter is a proverb on the plains and Bud had certainly acted the part
Fresno and Show Low with four flankers had driven into the corral a halfdozen horses untouched by man hands since the days of colthood
A shout a swing of a gate and the beasts were huddled in the round corral trembling and snorting
This corral has a circular fence slightly higher than a mans head with a snubbingpost in the center
While this is going on Bud has laid out his cowsaddle singlerigged his quirt and pieces of grass rope for crosshobbling
Ready Bud
asks Sagebrush
Yep he replies as he drops into the corral
Bud adjusts the hondo and loop of his lariat keeping his eye on the circling horses and picking out his first victim
The rope snakes through the air and falls over the head of a pony
Leaping bucking striking with his hoofs at the rope about his neck the horse fights and snorts
As the rope tightens shutting off his wind he plunges less viciously
Bud with the help of Fresno and Show Low takes a turn about the snubbingpost easing up the rope to prevent the horse from breaking his neck when he falls
The pony with braced feet hauls on the lariat until choking it throws itself
Bud in a twinkling has his knee on the broncos neck
Grasping the under jaw he throws the head up in the air until the nose points skyward
The turn is slipped from the post and the noose is slackened and pulled like a bridle over the animals head to be fastened curbwise to his under jaw
Stunned and choked the horse fights for breath giving Bud time to hobble his front feet and bridle it
Bud jumps aside as the bronco struggles to his feet
But every move of the beast to free itself results in a fall
Meantime the hind foot has been noosed and fastened to the one in front
Bud has crosshobbled the horse preparing it for the saddle and the second lesson
Holding the pony by the reins and rope Bud after many failures throws a saddleblanket across its back
With one hand he must also toss a fortypound saddle into place
Every move Bud makes is fought by the bronco every touch of blanket resented
With his free hand Bud must now slip the latigo strap through the cinchring
Dodging twisting struggling covered with sweat the horse foils Buds quick movements
Finally he succeeds and with one tight jerk the saddle is in place
No time to think is given the beast
Fresno and Show Low remove the hobbles but Bud is twisting an ear to distract its attention
This new torture must be met with a new defense and the horse is so dazed that it stands still to puzzle out the problem
This is what Bud has been waiting for
With the agility of a cat he swings himself into the saddle
The pony arches its back like a bowstring every muscle taut
Bud jerks the reins
The horse moves forward to find that its legs are free
Up it goes in a long curve alighting with his four feet stiffly planted together
The head is down
Maddened and frightened the bronco bawls like a man in a nightmare
Up in air the animal goes again drawing up its hind feet toward the belly as if it would scrape off the cinchstrap
The fore feet are extended stiffly forward
Every time the bronco hits the ground the jar is like the fall of a piledrivers weight
Bud watches every move
When the feet hit the earth he rises in stirrups to escape the jolt
But always he is in the saddle for any unexpected move
The horse rises on its hind legs to throw the rider
Should it fall backward the wind will be knocked of the animal but Bud will be out of the saddle before he strikes the ground and into it again before horse can struggle erect
If it tries the trick again Bud uses the quirt lashing it about the ears the flanks and under the belly
There is not a part of the body into which the biting leather does not cut
Lashing the flanks drives the horse forward
The struggle has been going on for twenty minutes
Bud is covered with sweat and dust
The horse has begun to sulk
It will not respond to rein or quirt
Now is the time for the steel
Bud drives the spurs deep into its flanks
The horse plunges forward with a bounding leap
Again the spurs rasp and again it plunges
The bronco finds that going ahead is the only way in which to avoid punishment
Round and round the corral it gallops until exhausted
The sweat is pouring off the brute in rivulets
It has taken Bud forty minutes to give the first lesson
Easing up the bronco Bud swings out of the saddle and then remounts
This is done a halfdozen times as the horse stands panting and blowing
Then with a quick movement the saddle and bridle are flung against the post
Bud pats the bronco on the neck and the flank and turns it loose for a second lesson in a couple of days
A third will follow before the end of the week
Then he will saddle the horses unaided ride them once or twice about the corral and finally let one of the hands give each the first lesson on the open plains
This means a wild dash anywhere away from the ranch
The rider must avoid holes in the ground and keep up the pace until the horse slows up on its own account
Four or five of these lessons with a postgraduate course in dodging a waving slicker and Sagebrush will declare all of the broncos are plumb gentle
The men were riding out their new string today
As each passed Parenthesis flung a jibe at him
He had resumed his breadmaking when Polly rode to the wagon
Hello Parenthesis
was her greeting
Whats the matter with you
Nothin
This yere housekeepin is gettin on my nervous system some fearful
Parenthesis struck the dough a savage whack and added I aint cut out for housekeepin
Youve been cut out all right retorted Polly glancing at his legs whatever its for
Parenthesis was not abashed
Yep fer straddlin a hoss he proudly replied as if that were the chief end of man
Polly thus balked in her teasing tried a new form of badinage
Say the boys are all braggin on your breadmakin
Wont you give me your receipt
Good cooks said Parenthesis never give away their receipts
Brings bad luck to em next time
Aw come now Parenthy tell me an Ill let you make my weddincake
Will you
an let me put in whatever I want fer jokes on the boys
Yep everything goes
Oh Ill give em somethin to dream on you can bet yer sweet life
Soap fer Fresnos finger clothespin fer Show Lows nose bottle o antyfat fer Slim
Its a swop Miss Polly
Well out with yer great secret o breadmakin
Well Miss Polly I take flour an water an sourins an a pinch o salt Flour an water an sourins an a pinch o salt repeated Polly totting the list off on her fingers
Why so do I an so does every one
It must lie in the workin
How long do you work the dough Parenthesis
It must lie in the workin repeated Parenthesis solemnly
Why I work it an work it he continued with exasperating slowness
How long do you work it
asked Polly impatiently
Till my hans look purty clean like
said Parenthesis holding up his floury paws
Then youve got a days work still before you
snapped Polly huffed at seeing herself the victim of a chaffing that she herself had begun
I wont bother you any longer
So long
Parenthesis however desired to continue the conversation
When is this yere hitch between you and Bud comin off
he asked
Polly drew herself up proudly and speaking assumed haughtiness replied Were figurin on sendin out the cards next month
The cowboys eyes twinkled
Well Im agoin to give up cigarootsmokin
What for
asked Polly in surprise
Goin in trainin to kiss the bride
Thats nice
said Polly beaming
Yep have to take up chawin like Bud Lane
Polly was saved from having to answer by Sagebrush galloping up to the wagon
Put on your gun
he shouted to Parenthesis
Asking no questions the cowpuncher obeyed his foreman
Trouble was brewing that he could plainly see
All he had to do was to obey orders and shoot when any one tried to point a gun at him
Turning to Polly he cried Wheres Mrs
Payson
She came over with me but stopped to look over the tally for those cows that are goin with the drive
More to himself than to Parenthesis or Polly Sagebrush said I wish shed stayed at the ranch
This range is no place for women now
Buck McKee and his outfit has tanked up with Gila whisky an theyre just pawin for trouble
Whats come over people lately
asked Polly
Its all along of Hoover goin away like he did and leavin us without a sheriff or nobody that is anybody makin a bluff at law and order cried Sagebrush
Its sot this section back twenty years observed Parenthesis
Thats what it has agreed the foreman
Fresno reports that he found that Peruna slappin the Lazy K brand on one of our calves
There aint nobody can maverick no calves belongin to this outfit
Not so long as Im ranch boss an captain of the roundup
Weve got to take the law in our own hans an make an example of this bunch right now
Sagebrush meant what he said
He was gathering reenforcements from his own men
He knew that the boys of the Allen ranch would side with him and he felt that there were enough lovers of law and order in the county to declare themselves against the highhanded methods of Buck McKee and his followers
Come on you fellows
shouted Show Low as he rode past the wagon up the range
What is it now
asked Sagebrush
Over his shoulder Show Low shouted We all had a run in with that Buck McKees bunch
Fresnos laid out with a hole in his shoulder
Billie Nickers cashed in
Ive got some of the Triangle boys and were goin to make a cleanup
You aint goin to do nothin unless I say so
We dont want no rangewarwell git the man that did the killin
Come on commanded Sagebrush
Polly galloped after the men saying Gee Ill miss something if I dont hurry up
CHAPTER XV Peruna Pulls His Freight When Jack closed the door behind him to follow and find Dick Lane and bring him back to the woman who the restorer believed loved him Echo Payson realized the supremacy over her soulher pure ideals her lofty sense of justiceof its tenement the womans bodythat fair but fragile fabric which trembled responsive to the wild wind of emotional desire and the seismic shock of the passion of sex
Ever since Jack had revealed to her his jealousy of Dick Lane she knew that he was living on a lower moral and spiritual plane than herself and that no longer could she look up to him as the strong protector the nobler being than herself that had been her girlish ideal of a husband
Instead of this another love sprang instantly into her heart that of the stronger soul for the weaker like to the feeling of the mother toward the child
The moral side of her desire toward Jack now became fixed in the purpose to lift him up to her own level
Now that he had gone from her on a mission that was fulfilling this very purpose of regeneration although she had not sent him upon it for his own sake but her ownEcho knew that after all she was a woman
She loved Jack Payson with the unreasoning and unrestrained passion that sways even the highest of her sex
By the balance of natural law she was lowering herself to meet him as he was coming up in the moral scale and thus preparing for herself and her husband a happy union of a mutual understanding of weaknesses held in common
Were Echo to remain always on the heights and Jack in the valley sooner or later a cloud would have separated them a ghostly miasma rising from the grave of Dick Lane whom Echo would have idealized as the nobler man
She very sensibly took refuge from these perplexing problems by jumping into the active life of the ranch
Faithfully she tried to perform all that she thought Jack would have done
Her father and mother wanted her to come back to her old home until he returned
There she would have more company and fewer memories of Jack surrounding her
Each offer each suggestion was kindly but firmly put aside
When Jack returned she must be the first to welcome him the first to greet him at his threshold whether it was broad daylight or in the silent watches of the night
From her lips he must learn he had been forgiven she alone must tell him how much she loved him and that together they must go through life until the last roundup
Echo and her father who was looking after his own cattle on the roundup rode up to the chuckwagon after Parenthesis and Sagebrush crossed the valley to mete out justice to Peruna and fight out any attempts at a rescue
Dismounting Echo walked wearily to the fire and sat down on a box
Bravely though she tried to conceal it the strain was beginning to tell upon her
The tears would come at times despite her efforts to fight them off
The burden was so heavy for her young shoulders to bear
A note from Slim written at Fort Grant with a leadpencil on a sheet of manila paper told her briefly that he was going into the Lava Beds with the troopsas the Apaches were out
Dick and Jack he wrote were somewhere in the Lava Beds and he would bring them back with him
She dared not let herself think of the Apaches and the horrors of their cruelties
Better let me get you somethin to eat said her father returning from picketing the horses
Echo smiled wanly at her fathers solicitude
I am not hungry Dad
Jim seated himself by the fire
He recognized his helplessness in this trouble
There was nothing he could do
If one of the boys was what Allen would have called it down on his luck he would have asked him to have a drink but with Josephine and the girls he was at his wits end
The sufferings of his loved daughter cut deeply into his big heart
You been in the saddle since sunup he said
You haint had nuthin to eat since breakfastI dont see what keeps you alive
Hope Dad hope
It is what we women live upon
Some cherish it all their lives and never reap a harvest
I watch the sun leap over the edge of the world at dawn and hope that before it sinks behind the western hills the man I love will come home to my heart
Oh Dad Im not myself
I havent been myself since the day I sent him awaymy heart isnt here
Its out in the desert behind yon mountainswith Jack
Thar thar dont take on so honey
Kneeling beside her father she laid her head on his lap as she did in childhood when overwhelmed with the little troubles of the hour
Looking into his eyes she sighed Oh Dad its all so tangled
I havent known a peaceful moment since he went away
Ive sent him away into God knows what unfriendly lands perhaps never to returnnever to know how much I loved him
Patting her head as if she were a tired child he said Itll all come out right in the end
You cant never tell from the sodycard whats in hock at the bottom of the deck
Further confidences between father and daughter were interrupted by the boys of the roundup dashing up to the wagon with Peruna in the midst of the group
Peruna had been disarmed
Dragging the prisoner from his bronco they led him before Allen who had risen from his seat
Whats all this boys
asked the ranchman
Sagebrush as foreman explained This yeres Peruna of the Lazy K outfit
Allen looked at the prisoner who maintained a sullen silence
Whats he been doin
Mostly everything but Fresno caught redhanded brandin one of our yearlins cried Sagebrush
Its a lie
broke in Peruna glancing doggedly from one to another of his guards
He knew death was the penalty of the crime of which he stood accused
He felt that a stout denial would gain him time and that Buck and his outfit might come up and save him
Polite your conversation in the presence of a lady cried Parenthesis nodding toward Echo
That calf was follerin my cow answered Peruna sullenly
It was follerin one of our longhorned Texas cows with the Sweetwater brand spread all over her shouted Show Low moving menacingly toward the cowering Peruna
Fresno he calls him continued Sagebrush taking up the story an this yere Perunadrinking bad turns loose his battery and wings Fresno some badthen little Billie Nicker comes along and Peruna plugs him solid
Poor Billie had been Show Lows bunkie on many a long drive
That veteran now paid this last tribute to his friend
Billie who aint never done no harm to no one He reached for his gun began Peruna
Sagebrush would not let him finish his lame defense
You shet up
he cried
We dont want your kind on this range an the quicker thats published the quicker well get shet of ye
Were goin to take the law in our own hands nowcome on boys
Two of the boys seized Peruna dragging him toward his horse
Echo halted them however with the query What are you going to do with this man
Take him down to the creek and hang him to that big cottonwood cried Show Low savagely
Before Echo could answer Peruna demanded a hearing
Hol on a minute I got something to say about that
Out with it growled Sagebrush
Las time there was an affair at that cottonwood the rope broke an the hossthief dropped into the creek swum acrost and got away
Sagebrush glared grimly at Peruna
Well well see that the rope dont break with you
In all seriousness Peruna replied I hope so
I cant swim
Polly glancing down the valley saw Buck McKee with a halfdozen of his outfit riding furiously to the rescue of Peruna
Look out boys here comes Buck McKee now
she shouted
Unconsciously the men laid their hands on their guns and assumed offensive attitudes
Allen cried sharply Keep your hands off your guns boys
One bad break means the starting of a lot of trouble
Buck and his band threw themselves off their horses ranging themselves opposite Sagebrush the Sweetwater boys
Swaggering up to Sagebrush the halfbreed insolently demanded Whos the boss of this yere Payson outfit
I reckon you are talkin to him now coolly replied the foreman
Youve got one of my boys over here bellowed Buck adding with the implied threat an weve come for him
Sagebrush was not bluffed by Bucks insolence or his swaggering manners
I reckon you cant have him just yet
Whats he been doing
demanded Buck
He killed Billie Nickerthats one thing
Selfdefense loftily replied Buck
He was tendin to his own business when your two men come up and begin pickin on him
Bursting with anger Parenthesis strode up to Buck and shouted He was brandin one of our yearlins thats what his business was
Sagebrush suggested in addition Perhaps you mean that brandin other folks cattle is the reglar business of the Lazy K outfit
Anythin with hide and no mark is Lazy K to you all growled Show Low
Your goin strong on reglar proceedins I see said Buck to Sagebrush
You aint sheriff of this yere county air you
Thats jest it
Somebodys got to act sooner or later an if there aint no reglar law well go back to the old times an make our own
The Sweetwater outfit assented unanimously to Sagebrushs declaration of freedom from outlaw rule in the county
Youre a fine lot to set up as lawabidin citizens sneered Buck
Workin for a man that had to hop the country to keep clear of the rope interjected Peruna who heartened up by the advent of McKee began pouring oil on a smoldering fire
Sagebrush turned savagely upon him Thatll do for you
Echo walked hastily to Sagebrushs side
She felt her presence might help to avoid the outbreak which she saw could not long be avoided
Peruna had lost control of tongue and discretion by this time
Youll never see him back in this section again
You all know where he isacross the line in Mexicowhy shes fixin to make a cleanup now an sell out and join him
Sagebrush reached for his gun but Echo restrained him
You he cried
Buck turned angrily on Peruna
You keep your mouth shet he shouted
Peruna subsided at his boss command mumbling There aint no female can pull the forelock over my eyes
Take care warningly called Buck
Peruna fired up again regardless of consequences
Why I see through her game
Shes glad to get rid of him sos she can play up to her ranch boss Handsome Charley there
Buck had to act instantly to preserve his supremacy over his men
Before any of the Sweetwater outfit could reach Perunas side or pull a gun to resent the insult Buck was on top of him
With a blow full in the mouth he knocked him sprawling
Echo had seized Sagebrushs hand preventing him from firing
The other men moved as if to kick Peruna as he lay prostrate
Let him alone
Hes goin to ask the ladys pardon snarled Buck covering him with his gun
Peruna raised himself on one arm
No Ill be he began
Buck bent over him speaking in a low tone tensely and quickly
Quick
I dont want to have to kill you
You damn fool dont you see what Im playin fer
He aint fit to live
shouted Show Low
Buck turned on the cowboy
It was his fight and he was going to handle it in his own fashion
Lem me handle this case he interrupted
Ther aint no man can travel in my outfit and insult a womanyou ask her pardonright smart
Peruna struggled to his feet
Buck commanded On your knees
A glance at Buck showed Peruna how deadly in earnest he was
Reluctantly he sank to his knees
I didnt mean what I said
I hope you will excuse me he whined
Thats enough
Now git up
Pull your freight Buck ordered
By God no
interposed Sagebrush
The cowboys seized Peruna
Buck saw that his bluff at bossing the situation was called
He turned appealingly to Echo and rapidly fabricated a moving tale about Perunas heroic rescue of himself from drowning in the Gila River
An I swore I would do as much fer him some day
Now I perpose that we all give him a kick an let him go let him have two hours start after which the gamelaws will be out on him
Sagebrush cried out against the plan but Echo was moved by McKees appeal for his comrade and speaking low and beseechingly to Sagebrush said It will save a rangewar that we cant afford to have till Jack and Slim get back
Sagebrush finally assented
Two hours start
Well hell have to go some if he gets away
Kick him and let him go he commanded
Echo turned away
The cowboys who held Peruna threw him to the ground and every man of the Allen and Payson ranches gave him a vicious kick Show Low putting in an extra one for his murdered bunkie
Last of all McKee approached the prostrate man and made the mistake which was to cost him his life by booting Peruna cruelly
The man was a stupid fellow by nature and what wits he had were addled by the habit he had acquired of consuming patentmedicines containing alcohol morphin and other stimulating and stupefying drugs
He was as revengeful as stupid and could have forgiven McKees putting the rope around his neck more easily than Bucks joining in the humiliation which saved his life
Rising from the ground and trembling with anger Peruna turned on the halfbreed saying Ill square this deal Buck McKee
Losin vallyble time Peruna
Git
was all that his former boss deigned to answer
Peruna limped over to his horse which Parenthesis had been holding in custody mounted it and rode off at a lope for the river ford
He crossed it in sight of the Sweetwater outfit and disappeared behind the riverbank
Here he dismounted and picking a small branch of cactus put it under his horses tail
The poor beast clapped the tail against it and with a scream set off on a wild gallop across the mesa
Peruna hobbled up the river a mile or so halfwaded halfswam to the other side and entered an arroyo whose course led back near the camp of the Sweetwater outfit
He had been disarmed by the cowboys of his revolver but not of his knife
After Peruna had been visited with his punishment Echo retraced her steps
Bowing to her hat in hand Buck made his apologies
Maam Im plumb sorry
My mother was a Cherokee squaw but Im white in some spots
If youll let your ranch boss come along with us well settle this brandinbusiness right now
Sagebrush did not care to accept the offer but Echo ordered him to go with the Lazy K outfit
Seeing it was useless to argue with her he said Come on boys
Ere they had ridden out of sight Echo sank exhausted on the seat by the fire
She buried her face in her hands and sobbed
Polly played the role of comforter
Dont mind em she said
Better come to the ranch with me
Youre all tuckered out
Youve been runnin this ranch fer a month like a man
Ill take your advice Polly and ride home
Tell Dad I want him will you
CHAPTER XVI Death of McKee Disappointed Desperado Buds conscience was not troubling him so much now
In fact he was rather proud of his conduct of late
He had shaken Buck McKee and he had forgiven Echo for all the hard thoughts he had against herwithout considering that she would be more than woman if she failed to harbor resentment against the man who had prevented her from calling her husband back from the desert
In the absence of Slim both Bud and McKee attained a feeling of security in the matter of Terrill murder
McKee had already ventured to use some of his share of the robbery in gambling
Bud had not yet convinced himself either of the right or the advisability of spending his share
Both conscience and fear advised him to keep the bloodmoney intact
He carried it with him wherever he went and became in time quite pleased with himself because of his compunctions in doing so
He was even pharisaical about McKees gambling
No when his mind had come clear about keeping it he would make an honest use of it such as investing it in a saloon in Florence
When however he suggested to Polly that dispensing liquors over a bar and running a farogame on the side would be a congenial occupation suited to their talents she sat down forcibly upon his aspiration and they finally compromised on Pollys proposition to conduct a liverystable in Tucson where Polly felt though she did not say so to Bud that Sheriff Hoover with whom she had been flirting too dangerously would not be in evidence as in Florence
Polly however was greatly puzzled over Buds confidence in his ability to raise the wind that would launch this delectable but to her mind illusory enterprise
In a moment of weakness he intimated that he already had the money in hand
How had he got it
she demanded
Saved it he said
When she asked him how he could have saved the thousand dollars demanded for the stable out of his salary of forty dollars a month he replied By economizin
Ive cut off my chawintobacco
That cost you two bits a week an youve taken up cigarettes at a dime a day said observant Polly
I know what youve been doin youve been gamblin
Cross my heart Polly I havent said Bud and Polly who had no great objection to using money won at cards so long as she did not positively know the fact discontinued her objections and resumed the delightful occupation of castlebuilding
The home she had in view consisted of three rooms over the liverystable
I want a red carpet in the front room and wallpaper like that at Bowens store with hosses jumpin gates on it Dont you think there will be a leetle too much hoss there Polly with the stable under us an the smell acomin up Sho Bud you cant have too much hoss
Why it was the hoss smell about your clothes that made me fall in love with you exclaimed the enthusiastic horsewoman
She continued An I want a yellow plush furniture set an a photographalbum to match an a centertable an a RockofAges picture an a boudoir A boudoir was beyond the ken of Bud
He knew nothing of housekeeping
This must be one of those strange articles the mystery of which he would have to solve before he could feel that he was really a married man
What the devil is a boudoir
he asked
I dont know what it is but all rich women have them
Bud took both of Pollys hands in his
Looking her fondly in the eyes he said Then by thunder Ill get you two of em
Well raise the limit when we furnish that shack
Im the happiest man in the country
Well you ought to be laughed Polly
Just see what you are gettin
Ive got to chase myself back to the house
Youre ridin night herd tonight aint you
she added
Yes
Im on the cocktail tonight
I am goin to bunk down here
Ill be up to the house at sunup and we can go over to Florence together
Ill have breakfast ready for you
Rope my pony for me will you
Bud was smiling and happy again
All of his troubles were forgotten
All right
he cried as he started to mount
Say youre awful forgetful arent you
asked Polly demurely
Bud looked about him slightly bewildered
Then he realized his oversight
He ran to Pollys and tried to kiss her but she motioned him aside saying Too lateyou lose
But I didnt know stammered Bud
Next time youll know
On your way airily commanded the girl
Buds face darkened
Oh well goodby
Polly looked after him perplexed and angry
His surrender to her whims without a fight nettled her
Goodby yourself she snapped
Hes the most forgetful man I ever loved
If I thought he was a gamblinman Id get a divorce from him before I married him
I would sure murmured Polly as Bud disappeared toward the corral
Pollys musing was interrupted by the return of Buck McKee
Is Bud Lane over yere
he asked
You must have passed him just now
Hes just got in from nightherdin
I thought I seed him comin this way
Whens the weddinbells goin to ring
Polly flushed
Next month
Then youll lose Buds company fer good she answered defiantly
Well I aint been doin him much good Buck assented
Im goin back home though
Polly gazed at Buck in surprise
Here was a new view of the man one she had never considered
It was strange to hear this outlaw and bad man talk of a home
The repetition of the word home by Polly led him to continue Yep
Up to the Strip where I was borned at
This yere climates a leetle too dry to suit me
Im goin to get a leetle ranch and a leetle gal an settle down for sure
I wish you may said Polly heartily
You sure acted mighty fine about that Peruna insultin Mrs
Payson
Harshly as Polly had felt toward Buck his actions in the recent incidents had softened her feelings toward him
I admire to hear you say it said Buck bowing
Ive played square with women all my life
I aint never slipped a card nor rung in a cold deck on any one of em yet
Buck sat down on the step of the wagon
He hesitated for a moment and then asked Say did you ever have a premonition
Nope
The worst I ever had was the hookincough
Buck smiled but did not explain to Polly the meaning of the word
Well this premonition he continued hits me hard an thats what makes me start for home
Thought Id like to say goodby to you an Bud
I go north with the big drive in the mornin an wont see you agin
Well good luck and goodby to you
Polly held out her hand in her most friendly fashion
Buck arose and took off his hat
As he stepped toward her he cried Same to you
Goodby
Grasping her by the hand he added warmly Anhappiness
Ill tell Bud youre here cried Polly over her shoulder
Buck looked after the girl as she swung across the prairie to find Bud
Shes a darned fine leetle gal she is mused Buck
Seein Bud so happy kinder makes me homesick
Things is gettin too warm for me here anyway
If Payson gets back hell be able to clear himself about that Terrill business an things is likely to pint pretty straight at me an Bud
Im sorry I dragged Bud into that
I could have done it alone just as wellan kep all the money
McKee sat down to wait for Bud
His mind was filled with pleasant thoughts
Having assumed a chivalrous role in the Peruna incident he was tasting something of the sweet sensations and experiences that follow a sincerely generous action
Smiles and pleasant greetings from Polly who had heretofore met him with venomous looks and stinging words were balm to his soul
He felt wellsatisfied with himself and kindly toward the whole world
The fiendish torturer of helpless men and harmless beasts the coldblooded murderer the devilish intriguer to incriminate an innocent man thought that he was a very good fellow after all much better than say such a man as Jack Payson
He had at least always treated women white and had never gone back on a friend
When he thought how Payson had drawn his pistol on trusting unsuspecting Dick Lane in the garden he was filled with the same pharisaic selfrighteousness that inflated Bud when comparing himself with McKee
His enjoyment in contemplating his own virtues was overclouded however by a vague presentiment of impending danger the premonition he had of to Pollya word he had picked up from fortunetellers whom he often consulted being very superstitious as are most gamblers
And Nemesis in the person of Peruna was indeed approaching
The outlaw crept up out of the draw behind the contemplative halfbreed and leaping upon his back plunged his knife in McKees neck with a fierce thrust into which he concentrated all his hatred for the humiliation he had endured
With a stifled cry Buck struggled to his feet to face his assailant drawing his gun instinctively
The knife had bitten too deeply however
With a groan he fell weakly he tried to level his gun his finger twitching convulsively at the trigger
Peruna waited to see if he had strength enough to fire
A sneering smile added to the evil appearance of his face
Seeing Buck helpless he snatched the gun from his hand
Then he turned his victim over so he could reach the pocket of his waistcoat
With the bloodstained knife he ripped open the cloth and extracted a roll of paper and money
Peruna was kneeling beside the body of his former friend when a voice drawled Drop that knife
Peruna jumped up with a grunt of dismay to see Slim Hoover sitting on horseback with his revolver held upright ready for use
Peruna hesitated Drop it
ordered Slim sharply slightly lowering the gun
Peruna tossed away the knife with a snarl
Ill take care of your friends bundle and the papers and money you took from his pocket
Drop them
I didnt figure on gettin back to business as soon as I got home but you never can tell
Can you
The last remark was addressed to his deputy Timber Wiggins who had joined him
This yeres Timber Wiggins deputy sheriff from Pinal County explained Slim for Perunas enlightenment
Mr Wiggins will you take care of this friend of mine
continued the Sheriff glancing from Peruna who looked at him stolidly to Wiggins
I reckon hes been doin something naughty
The two men dismounted keeping the outlaw covered and watching his every glance
Anything to oblige replied Wiggins who had solemnly entered with Slim into his assumed formality
Wiggins stepped behind Peruna and reaching forward removed Bucks gun from the outlaws holster which had been empty since Buck earlier in the day had taken his revolver after he had insulted Echo
Anything to oblige said Wiggins to Slim
Then to Peruna he commanded Lets take a walk
You first
Im noted for my politeness
You might tie him up some suggested Slim
I sure will answered the deputy as he marched his prisoner toward the corral
Slim hastened to the side of the fallen man and turned him over on his back to get a glimpse of Perunas victim
He saw that Buck was still breathing although mortally wounded the blood gushing from his mouth
McKee recognized the Sheriff
Hullo
when did you git back
he asked
Jes now
Is this your money
said Slim holding the roll in front of McKees eyes
No its yourn
Part o what I took from Ole Man Terrill
The idee o not recognizin your own property
McKee grinned at his joke on the Sheriff
I held the old man up and thats all there is to it
Who was with you
asked Slim
There was two
McKee was silent
Bud Lane was the other man hazarded Slim
No began Buck but Slim interrupted him
He was with you that night
He came to the weddin with you
It aint no use in denyin it
Ive been thinkin it all out
I was fooled by Jacks pacing hoss
You and Bud Here McKee interrupted with a solemn denial
Whether from a desire to foil the Sheriff whom he knew was Buds rival in love and so thought him the young mans enemy or from the benevolent spirit induced by the recent contemplation of his virtues McKee was impelled to give an account of the murder which very convincingly indicated Bud as a protesting catspaw rather than a consenting accomplice
At the end of the story he smiled grimly So while you were out o the county on a wilgoose chase after an inercent man Peruna he goes loco on patenmedicine an gits the guilty party
Jokes on you Slim
I nomernate Peruna fer nex sheriff
Exhausted with the effort and pain of talking McKee dropped his head upon Hoovers broad breast in a faint
Hoover bore him down to the spring and bathed his wound and mouth
McKee revived and in broken phrases which were accompanied with blood from his pierced lungs frothing out of his mouth continued his observations on the ridiculous and unfortunate mistake Peruna made in killing him
Damn fools bes frenI would herdth lowdown intellecksnev preciatedno chanceto be firsclassbad man
And so Buck McKee desperado died like many another ambitious soul with expressions of disappointment on his lips
CHAPTER XVII A New Deal Bud Lane returning to camp saw the returned Sheriff supporting the dying murderer of Terrill and listening to what was undoubtedly his confession
He stole away before he was observed
Its all up with me he thought
Buck has told him
Slim hates me along o Polly
Ill get away from here tonight
He met Polly by the messwagon
At once she saw that something had happened
Bud was deathly pale
He trembled when she spoke to him
Why what on earth is the matter
she asked
Nothing
I answered Bud glancing about him as if seeking some way to escape
Youre looking mighty paleare you sick
persisted the girl
Slim Hooverhes back Bud could scarcely speak
His throat was parched
Beads of perspiration stood on his forehead
What
cried Polly joyfully
Is Jack with him
Listen here exclaimed the young wooer
Slims heard about our goin to get married and hes sworn to shoot me at sight It was a lame halting explanation but the best Bud could invent on the spur of the moment
He wanted to get away to have time to think
I dont believe it
replied Polly indignantly
Why Slim In his excitement Bud would not let her continue her defense of the Sheriff
Its so
Hes plum locoed
The sun mus have tetched his brains out in the desert he explained with rapid invention
I dont want no runin with a crazy man
I might have to shoot an Slims been a good fren of mine
So Im going to keep out of his way for a while
Ill ride over to the railroad
Polly could not comprehend this strange behavior of Bud
Thinking to make him tell her his trouble by taunting him with cowardice she asked Say look here are you scared of Slim Hoover
Just let me handle him
No no expostulated Bud
Cant you understand
Weve been such good friends andandI cant pull a gun on him Polly was speechless with surprise
Here he comes now shouted Bud
Ill hide in the wagon here Dont hide
counseled Polly
Why
Bud gave her no answer for he had already disappeared under the cover of the messwagon
I dont like that a little bit
Slim never acted locoed before
Ill have to be mighty careful I spose for I think a heap of both Slim and Bud
Slim came up to the wagon with his face wreathed in smiles
If it aint Miss Polly he yelled
Polly having heard that crazy people had to be humored ran to meet him and threw her arms about his neck
You dear sweet old redheaded thing
she cried when did you get back
Where have you been
Wheres Jack
Have you seen Echo
One question was piled upon the other by the enthusiastic girlSlim had tried to stop her talking that he might answer her but he might as well have tried to check a sandstorm
Out of breath and puffing he finally gasped Whoa
whoa
Yesm
Ive heard of them Kansas cyclones but I aint never got hit with one afore
Polly started all over again
And Jack did you find himtell me all about it
See yeah answered Slim I aint goin to say nuthin to nobody till I see Mrs
Payson
Oh pshaw
pouted Polly not even me
Not evenwhat Ive got to say she must heah first
Im kinder stiffif you dont mind Ill set down a spell
Slims face was drawn and worn
Although he had lost none of his weight he showed the effects of the siege of hard riding and fighting through which he had passed
The mental strain under which he had labored had also worn him down
Polly was more than solicitous for his comfort
Not only did she like the Sheriff but she was now fencing with him to protect her sweetheart from his wrath
She had concluded that Buds charge that the Sheriff was locoed and jealous was a cover to conceal some genuine apprehension
You look tuckered out she said
Well I low as maybe I am
Been in the saddle for two weeks
Kin I have a cup of coffee
Polly began to mother him
This appeal for bodily comforts aroused all her womanly instincts
She made him sit down and poured the coffee for him saying You sure can
With or without
Ill play it straight grinned Slim
I reckon youll have to anyway
Here you are
Slim took the cup with a thankee
He drank long and deeply
Then he paused made a wry face and danced his feet up and down as a child does in anger or excitement
Whats the matter
asked the girl with a laugh
If this yeahs coffee give me tea an if its tea give me coffee
The Sheriff put down his cup with a shrug of the shoulders
Its the best weve got replied Polly
Sagebrush got it
Oh thats it
I thought it tasted like sagebrush
Hows Bud
he suddenly demanded
Polly glanced nervously at the speaker
All right I spose
She tried to be noncommittal
Her nervousness almost betrayed her
Aint you seen him lately
Slim insisted
Polly peeped into the wagon before she answered the question
YesI see him every once in a while
In an effort to change the subject of conversation and get him away from all thoughts of Bud she asked Say Slim whats a boudoir
A what whar
stuttered Slim
A boudoir Polly repeated
Slim was puzzled and looked it
Then a new thought lighted up his face
You dont mean a Budweiser do you
Polly deeply serious replied Nothat aint itboudoir
Slim ransacked his memory for the word
Boudoir he continued reflectively
One of them fo de wah things we ust to have down in Kentucky
An explanation was demanded of him and he proceeded to invent one
Well first you get aget a Polly had fooled him so many times that he became suspicious in the midst of his creation and asked Look a hereyoure sure you dont know what boudoir is
Why of course not answered Polly simply
Slim was relieved by her reply
All right he resumed crossing his legs as if the position would help him better to think
A boudoir is a seegar
A seegar
echoed Polly distinctly disappointed
Buds offer to duplicate the boudoir was now reduced to the proportions of two fer a nickel
Yep assured the Sheriff
They are named after a Roosianone of them diplomat fellers
Whats a diplomat
Polly was finding Slim a mine of information but all of the sort that needed plenty of expansion
Slim chuckled and with a twinkle in his eye drawled A diplomat is a man that steals your hat and coat and then explains it so well that you give him your watch and chain
Sabe
Polly did not understand
She felt that Slim was laughing at her but she could not see any fun in his remark
To end the discussion however she said I sabe
Polly sauntered away from the wagon
As she passed Slim he tried to put his arm about her waist
She skilfully evaded him
The Sheriff joined her in the shade of cottonwood
You know Ive been thinking a lot of you lately Miss Polly
Only lately
she asked mischievously
Well yesthat is This conversation was becoming too personal for Bud who in an effort to hear all Slim had to say moved incautiously in the wagon
Slim heard him
Whos in that wagon
he cried moving toward it
Show Low asleep
No
Buddy said Polly thinking she might as well confess the deception first as last and using the childish nickname of her lover in order to soften Slims anger against him
Nobody repeated Slim not fully convinced that he was mistaken but stopping in deference to Pollys apparent denial
Who do you spose asked Polly pertly taking courage when she found that Slim did not continue his investigation
You aint after any Buddy are you
No but Ill just take a look in here cause I got somethin particular to say to you Miss Polly an I dont want no listeners
And he moved forward again
At this juncture Polly began to ply her arts as a coquette
Looking shyly at Slim she murmured Are you sure you are not after ANYbody
The emphasis on the last word was so plain that a shrewder lovemaker than Slim would have been deceived
Eh
Whats that
Polly turned her back to him with assumed bashfulness
Slims courage arose at the sight
Well I reckon this is a pat hand for me and thats the way Im agoin to play it if Ive got the nerve
Slim smoothed down his tangled hair and brushed off some of the dust which whitened his shoulders
Look yeah Miss Polly Then his courage failed him and he stopped
Polly glanced at him to help him over the hard places
Slim was greatly embarrassed
My heart is right up in any throat
Well I might as well spit it out he thought aloud
Again Slim started toward the girl to tell her of his love and again his courage failed him although Polly was doing her best to help him
Look yeah Miss Polly Ive been after somebody for a long time now Horsethief
asked Polly coquettishly
No heartthief blurted Slim
Stealing hearts aint no harm
Well just the same Im goin to issue a writ of replevin an try for to git mine back laughed Slim
He was about to slip his arm about her waist when she turned and faced him
The action so disconcerted him that he jumped backward as if the girl was about to attack him
Where is it
asked Polly
Slim deeply in earnest replied You know its hid
You know just as well as I kin tell you
Polly became remorseful
She realized how much Slim was suffering and she was sorry that her answer to him would be a disappointment
Please dont say any more Slimas she stepped away from him
Slim followed her up and speaking over her shoulder said I cant help it
Youve got my feelins stampeded now an they sure has to run
Ive had an itchin in my heart for you ever since I first knowed you
You come from Kentuckywell I was kinder borned up that way myselfin Boone County an that sorter makeswell if it did what I want to know is Slim hesitated and nervously hauled at his chaps
Will you be my Frightened at his boldness he clapped his hand over his mouth
Can I be your he began again
Angry at himself he said under his breath Ill never get this damn thing out of my system
In his earnestness he doubled up his fist and shook it behind the girls back
Suddenly she turned and found his clenched hand directly under her nose
She started back in dismay
Excuse me humbly apologized Slim
I didnt mean for to do that maamdeedy I didntI was onlythatswell I reckon Im a little bit Slim looked directly at the girl for the first time
She was trying to restrain her hearty laughter
Slims face broadened in a grin
Youre a mighty fine piece of work you are an Ive got an awful yearnin to butt into your family
Polly was greatly moved by Slims sincerity
Dont please dont
she pleaded
Why Ive known all along that you love me but But what
he asked when she hesitated
Ive always liked you real well and Ive been glad that you liked me
I dont want to lose your friendship thoughand oh please forgive me please do
Polly was very repentant showing it by the tones of her voice and in her eyes
Slim was puzzled at first
Then it came to him that the girl had refused to marry him
Oh
I low youall aint agoin to say you love me then
I dont believe I am
Polly smiled through her tears
Slim paused as if steadying himself to meet the full force of the blow
Mebbe its along of my red hair
It is red isnt it
Polly smiled kindly
Slim ran his fingers through his locks and looked at his fingers as if expecting the color would come off on his hands
Taint blue he said
Another thought came to him
Freckles he asked laconically
Polly only shook her head
Theres only one cure for frecklessandpaper grinned Slim
But it isnt freckles replied the girl
Slim looked at his hands and feet
Maybe its fat
he hazarded
Oh I know Im too fat
It beats all how I do keep fat
Slim looked into his hat and sighed
Well I suppose we dont get married this year do we
No Slim said Polly gently
Nor any other year to come
Slim was still hopeful
Thats the way it looks now
Slim put on his hat and tried to walk jauntily to the fire whistling a bit of a tune
The effort was a sad failure
Heres where I getoff
Im in sure bad luck
Somebody must have put a copper on me when I was born
I low I gotter be movin
You wont hate me will you Slim
The Sheriff took the girls hands in his and kissed them
Hate you
he almost shouted
Why I couldnt learn to do that no siree
Not in a thousand years
Polly slapped Slim on the back
Im glad of that she cried
Brace up
Youll get a good wife some day
Theres lots of good fish in the sea
Slim glanced at her ruefully
I dont feel much like goin fishin jest now
Would you mind tellin me if I lose out on this deal along of somebody else aholdin all the cards
Slim waited for Pollys answer
Why dont you know
No he said simply
But he told me Who is it
he insisted
Noif you dont know his name I wont tell you decided Polly
Mebbe its jest as well too assented Slim
I dont think Id feel any too friendly toward him
Slim moved toward the wagon
The action was purely involuntary but it frightened Polly so that she cried aloud
Slim grasped at once the reason for her fear
Is the feller in that wagon
he shouted
You wouldnt do him any harm would you
cried Polly
Is he in that wagon
Slim repeated angrily
Polly caught hold of his arm
Whats he hiding for
he demanded
Slim pulled his gun and covered the opening
Come out you coward he shouted
Polly caught Slim by the right wrist so he could not fire
Bud leaped from the wagon drawing his gun as he did so
You shant call me a coward he shouted to Slim
Polly ran behind Bud and reaching her arms about his waist held down his hands depressing the muzzle of his revolver
Slim danced up and down in the excitement with his revolver in his hand
Polly kept calling on both of the men not to shoot
Let him alone shouted Slim excitedly
Let him alone Miss Polly
Hes only fourflushin and I aint gun shy
Now look a yeah sonny he cried to Bud if that squirtgun of yours goes off an hits me an I find it outwell I reckon Ill have to spank you
Bud tried to break away from Polly begging her to Let go
The girl laid her hands on his shoulder gazing pleadingly into his flushed face
Dont dont she cried its all right
Slim knows all about it
He knows I love you and he wouldnt hurt any one that I love would you Slim
Polly smiled at the Sheriff completely disarming him
Shoving his gun back into the holster Slim grinned and said I reckon I wouldnt
Weve been engaged forever so long now waitin for Bud to get rich and nowand now its come
Her face radiated her happiness
Bud showed his alarm motioning her to be silent but Polly rattled on Buds been saving and saving till hes got over a thousand dollars and Slim could not contain his indignation at the deception practised by the boy
You derned thief he shouted
Then he plainly showing his annoyance at his lack of repression
Buds hand dropped to his gun
You he began but Polly stopped him with a gesture looking from one to the other of the men dazed and frightened
A thief
Bud a thief 
What does it mean
Tell me she gasped
Turning to Bud she demanded Bud you heard what he said
Dropping his head fearing to look at either of them he muttered sullenly He lied
Slim checked his first betrayal of his anger a kept himself well in hand
Oh Slim pleaded Polly say you didnt mean it
Simply and sadly Slim answered I didnt
I reckon as how Im some jealous ananI lied
His voice dropped and he turned aside stepping away from the young couple
Polly was still in doubt
Slims actions were so strange
It was not like this bighearted brave Sheriff to accuse a man of stealing without being sure of his charges
Then Slims accusing himself of lying was entirely at variance with his character
Im sorry she said
Please forgive me
It was all my fault
I didnt know that you Slim held up his hand to silence her
Wouldnt you mind leavin us together a bit he requested
In answer to Pollys frightened glance he continued There haint goin to be no trouble only me an hims got a little business to talk over
Aint we Bud
Eh
Slim led Polly toward the corral glancing at Bud over his shoulder with a reassuring smile
Just you step out yonder a bit and wait he said to Polly
Now you wont Cant you trust me any more
he asked sincerely
Grasping him by the hand she looked him fairly and fearlessly in the eye saying I do trust you
I trust you both
As the girl strode out of earshot Slim absentmindedly kept shaking the hand she had held
Awakening suddenly to the fact that his hand was empty he looked at it curiously and sighed
Turning quickly he slapped his hat on his head hitched up his chaps and stepped up to Bud who stood with a sneer on his lips
So youre the man that Polly loves he said
Shes a good girl and she loves a thief
Bud turned on him fiercely drawing his gun
Take care
he warned
You wont shoot
If you meant to shoot youd a done it long ago when you pulled your gun exclaimed Slim coolly
I might do it now
Bud held his gun against Slims breast
Slim threw up his hands to show he was not afraid of the boy
Go ahead
Squeeze your hardware
I reckon Im big enough to kill he said
Then he took Buds hand and gently slid the revolver back into the holster
The action broke down Buds bravado
All barriers fell before the simple action
Its all up with me he said brokenly
Slim sympathized with the boy in his trouble
Buck he told me
Buck he lowed you had your share of that money he explained
The boy drew the money from his pocket and handed it to Slim remarking Here it isall of it I never touched itI was goin Bud was about to lie again but he realized the futility of more falsehoods
Take it he added
Slim counted the money and slipped it in his pocket
Bud he said to that young man
Me an you have been pretty good friends we have
I learned you how to rideto throw a rope an BudBudwhat did you take it for
I know you didnt murder Terrill for it but what did you keep the money for
He asked the question with anger and annoyance
Slim had seated himself by the fire
He spoke to the boy as he would to a comrade
Cant you see
the boy asked
Polly
I wanted to make a home for herand now shell know me for what I am a thiefa thief
Bud buried his face in his hands the tears trickling through his fingers although he fought strongly against showing his weakness
Slim rose and stepped to his side laying his hand on the boys shoulder
Mebbe she wont have to know
Buck hes dead and only you and I know
Bud looked at the speaker in amazement
A lovable smile crept over Slims face
Im goin he said to slip you a new deck an give you a fresh deal
That was part my money that was stole
I never came back at the county fer it
Buck hes paid half
Ill let em all think it was the whole
Ill put in a thousan I have at home that I was savin to buy in with the Triangle B in case I dont git elected nex time
So Bud Im going to lend a thousan o this to you just to give you a chance at that little home
Youre the whitest man I ever knew
cried Bud
I reckon I aint colored cept a little red mite on top laughed Slim
He disliked any show of feeling by the boy over the offer he had made
But I cant take your money Bud protested
Yes you can assured Slim
You pay it back when you get on your feet again
Im going to take your word
Slims generosity overwhelmed the boy
Take my word
he cried
Slim laid his hands on the boys shoulders
Yes he declared Youve made your first bad break but youve had your first lessor
An you aint going to forget it he added emphatically
And Polly
he faltered
There aint nobody going to tell her
Speaking sternly to Bud he added You make her a good husband
Bud seized the Sheriffs hand wringing it warmly
I will Slim I will he promised
The wait had been too long for Polly
She returned before Slim called her saying Im tired of waiting on youall
Havent you finished up that business yet
Yes maam its finished replied Slim
Did Bud tell you about it
inquired Polly
He told me
Seems like you two are going to get married
Uhhuh laughed Polly happily
And oh say will you stand up for Bud
I reckon Bud can stand up for himself now with you to help him answered Slim emphatically
Well run over and tell the boys youre back shouted Bud
Slim took the hands of the young people in his own big ones
Im right glad you two are going to hitch up he said
I am dead sure youll make a even runnin team
Polly glanced shyly at Slim
Bud wont mind if you kiss me she hinted
Slim grinned sheepishly
In his embarrassment he rubbed one foot on his other leg
WellI aintneverthat is he stammered Bud if youall dont mind he boldly asserted after his bashfulness had waned I reckon I will play one little bet on the red
The Sheriff never did anything in a small way
The kiss he gave her full on the lips was a resounding one
Bud took Polly by the hand and silently led her to the house
Slim sat down on a keg behind the fire
Taking some loose tobacco and a film of ricepaper from his pocket he deftly rolled a cigarette and lighted it with a brand from the blaze
With a sigh he removed his hat
He was the picture of dejection
For several moments he sat in deep thought
Then with a deep indrawing of his breath and a shrug of the shoulders he cried Hell
nobody loves a fat man
CHAPTER XVIII Jack
When Polly told the boys in the corral that Slim had returned and was waiting for them at the messwagon they dropped their work and made for him with wild whoops and yells
Slim smiled as he heard the coming
Show Low made a running jump throwing his arms about the Sheriffs neck
Parenthesis and Sagebrush each grabbed a hand pumping up and down emphatically
The others slapped him on the back
All talked at once asking him the news and whether Jack had returned
Did you nip it up with the Paches asked Parenthesis
Talk durn ye talk
shouted Show Low or well hang out your hide
Slim shook the hands of his comrades in turn affectionately
For each he had his own particular form of greeting
No boys he said when the group became more orderly I aint agoin to say a word till I see Mrs Payson first
Polly had ridden at once to the house to tell the joyful news of Slims return to Echo who hurried at once to the boys about the wagon
Parenthesis spied her riding down the trail
Shes comin now he cried
Boys requested Slim would you mind herdin off yonder a bit
The cowpunchers strolled over to the cottonwood leaving Echo to meet Slim alone
Where is he
was Echos tearful greeting
Well maam theres a man out yonder thats been through fire and brimstone for you
Echo stared over the prairies
Then Jack was still searching for Dick
Slim had failed to find him
Out yonder she moaned wringing her hands
Wait a minute says Slim
He says to me says he Break it to her Slim tell her gentlean if she wants mecall and Ill come
Maam Dick Lane is dead
Echo shuddered
Dead she repeated
By his No no interrupted Slim not that way
Indians
Jack found Dick an the Indians found em both
When I come up with the soldiers from Fort Grant they was havin the derndest mixup with Indians you ever did see
Both men were bad hurted an Dickwell maamI leaned over him jest in time to hear him say Tell her I know she was trueand not to mind
Then he gave a little ketch of his breath and dropped back into my arms
Echo sighed
The tragedy of the desert was very real to her
In the many months that the two men had been away she had lived through it with them in poignant imagination
Greathearted Dick she said
I was not worthy of his love
And Jack where is he
Wait a minutehe wants to know if you can forgive himif you will take him back
Slim
was the only word Echo uttered but the volume of love it contained told him everything
You neednt say nothin moreI see it shinin in your eyes cried Slim
Jack
Jack
he shouted you derned idiot come arunnin Payson hurried up from the arroyo within which he had been waiting
Echo I have not altogether failed in my mission
I have not brought Dick Lane back but I hope I come from him bearing something of his loyalty and simple faith
If you ever can learn to trust me againif you ever can learn to love me he said to Echo humbly
Dont be a derned fool Jack blurted Slim cant you see she aint never loved no one else
Echo is it so
asked Jack eagerly
Slim grinned
Going over to Echos side he gave her a slight push saying Go tell him
Jack
was her only cry as her husband enfolded her in his arms
       With the next election for sheriff in Pinal County William Henry Harrison Hoover had no opposition for Buck McKees nomination for that office of one Peruna formerly of the Lazy K outfit was not ratified for several reasons the chief of which was that W H H Hoover alias Slim had just previous to election officially declared that the said Peruna was deceased having come to his death in the jailyard of Pinal County by a sudden drop at the end of a new hempen rope which did not break as Slim before the ceremony had assured the apprehensive Peruna it would not
The sudden and successive removals of its two most honored and influential members Buck McKee and Peruna greatly demoralized the Lazy K outfit and the demoralization was completed by the pernicious activity of the reelected Sheriff in interfering with the main purpose of that industrial organization which was the merger of the Sweetwater cattlebusiness through a gradual amalgamation of all brands into the Lazy K One by one the captains or cavaliers of this industry sought more congenial regions where public inquisition into such purely private concerns as theirs was not so vigorously prosecuted
It must not be thought that the social graces and persuasive abilities of Sheriff Hoover were confined to the conduct of legalized necktieparties and the dispersion of outlaws
In its extended account of the LaneHope Nuptials the Florence Kicker devoted much of the space to the part taken by the best man in the ceremony our genial and expansive boniface of the new county apartment hotel
And soon after it recorded that the same Sheriff Hoover had induced the charming Miss Wiggins sister of our deputy sheriff to be his partner for life as she had been for the dance at the LaneHope nuptials described in our issue of June 15 and that the happy couple receive their friendswhich we are instructed our readers is an invite to the entire countyat their future home the new county jail on the Fourth of July
And in a local paragraph of the issue containing the latter notice the editor of the Kicker remarks Remember the Sheriffs Roundup on the Fourth
As   our friend from the Sweetwater with the all round understanding says  up Slim all the boys will be there to pointing finger you a few youll sure see
