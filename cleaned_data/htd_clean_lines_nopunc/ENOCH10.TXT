Enoch Soames A Memory of the Eighteennineties By MAX BEERBOHM WHEN a book about the literature of the eighteennineties was given by Mr Holbrook Jackson to the world I looked eagerly in the index for Soames Enoch
It was as I feared he was not there
But everybody else was
Many writers whom I had quite forgotten or remembered but faintly lived again for me they and their work in Mr Holbrook Jacksons pages
The book was as thorough as it was brilliantly written
And thus the omission found by me was an all the deadlier record of poor Soamess failure to impress himself on his decade
I dare say I am the only person who noticed the omission
Soames had failed so piteously as all that
Nor is there a counterpoise in the thought that if he had had some measure of success he might have passed like those others out of my mind to return only at the historians beck
It is true that had his gifts such as they were been acknowledged in his lifetime he would never have made the bargain I saw him makethat strange bargain whose results have kept him always in the foreground of my memory
But it is from those very results that the full piteousness of him glares out
Not my compassion however impels me to write of him
For his sake poor fellow I should be inclined to keep my pen out of the ink
It is ill to deride the dead
And how can I write about Enoch Soames without making him ridiculous
Or rather how am I to hush up the horrid fact that he WAS ridiculous
I shall not be able to do that
Yet sooner or later write about him I must
You will see in due course that I have no option
And I may as well get the thing done now
IN the summer term of 93 a bolt from the blue flashed down on Oxford
It drove deep it hurtlingly embedded itself in the soil
Dons and undergraduates stood around rather pale discussing nothing but it
Whence came it this meteorite
From Paris
Its name
Will Rothenstein
Its aim
To do a series of twentyfour portraits in lithograph
These were to be published from the Bodley Head London
The matter was urgent
Already the warden of A and the master of B and the Regius Professor of C had meekly sat
Dignified and doddering old men who had never consented to sit to any one could not withstand this dynamic Copyright 1916 by THE CENTURY CO All rights reserved
little stranger
He did not sue he invited he did not invite he commanded
He was twentyone years old
He wore spectacles that flashed more than any other pair ever seen
He was a wit
He was brimful of ideas
He knew Whistler
He knew Daudet and the Goncourts
He knew every one in Paris
He knew them all by heart
He was Paris in Oxford
It was whispered that so soon as he had polished off his selection of dons he was going to include a few undergraduates
It was a proud day for me when II was included
I liked Rothenstein not less than I feared him and there arose between us a friendship that has grown ever warmer and been more and more valued by me with every passing year
At the end of term he settled in or rather meteoritically into London
It was to him I owed my first knowledge of that foreverenchanting little worldinitself Chelsea and my first acquaintance with Walter Sickert and other August elders who dwelt there
It was Rothenstein that took me to see in Cambridge Street Pimlico a young man whose drawings were already famous among the fewAubrey Beardsley by name
With Rothenstein I paid my first visit to the Bodley Head
By him I was inducted into another haunt of intellect and daring the dominoroom of the Cafe Royal
There on that October eveningthere in that exuberant vista of gilding and crimson velvet set amidst all those opposing mirrors and upholding caryatids with fumes of tobacco ever rising to the painted and pagan ceiling and with the hum of presumably cynical conversation broken into so sharply now and again by the clatter of dominoes shuffled on marble tables I drew a deep breath and This indeed said I to myself is life
Forgive me that theory
Remember the waging of even the South African War was not yet
It was the hour before dinner
We drank vermuth
Those who knew Rothenstein were pointing him out to those who knew him only by name
Men were constantly coming in through the swingdoors and wandering slowly up and down in search of vacant tables or of tables occupied by friends
One of these rovers interested me because I was sure he wanted to catch Rothensteins eye
He had twice passed our table with a hesitating look but Rothenstein in the thick of a disquisition on Puvis de Chavannes had not seen him
He was a stooping shambling person rather tall very pale with longish and brownish hair
He had a thin vague beard or rather he had a chin on which a large number of hairs weakly curled and clustered to cover its retreat
He was an oddlooking person but in the nineties odd apparitions were more frequent I think than they are now
The young writers of that eraand I was sure this man was a writerstrove earnestly to be distinct in aspect
This man had striven unsuccessfully
He wore a soft black hat of clerical kind but of Bohemian intention and a gray waterproof cape which perhaps because it was waterproof failed to be romantic
I decided that dim was the mot juste for him
I had already essayed to write and was immensely keen on the mot juste  that Holy Grail of the period
The dim man was now again approaching our table and this time he made up his mind to pause in front of it
You dont remember me he said in a toneless voice
Rothenstein brightly focused him
Yes I do he replied after a moment with pride rather than effusionpride in a retentive memory
Edwin Soames
Enoch Soames said Enoch
Enoch Soames repeated Rothenstein in a tone implying that it was enough to have hit on the surname
We met in Paris a few times when you were living there
We met at the Cafe Groche
And I came to your studio once
Oh yes I was sorry I was out
But you were in
You showed me some of your paintings you know
I hear youre in Chelsea now
Yes
I almost wondered that Mr Soames did not after this monosyllable pass along
He stood patiently there rather like a dumb animal rather like a donkey looking over a gate
A sad figure his
It occurred to me that hungry was perhaps the mot juste for him buthungry for what
He looked as if he had little appetite for anything
I was sorry for him and Rothenstein though he had not invited him to Chelsea did ask him to sit down and have something to drink
Seated he was more selfassertive
He flung back the wings of his cape with a gesture which had not those wings been waterproof might have seemed to hurl defiance at things in general
And he ordered an absinthe
Je me tiens toujours fidele he told Rothenstein a la sorcieere glauque
It is bad for you said Rothenstein dryly
Nothing is bad for one answered Soames
Dans ce monde il ny a ni bien ni mal
Nothing good and nothing bad
How do you mean
I explained it all in the preface to Negations
Negations
Yes I gave you a copy of it
Oh yes of course
But did you explain for instance that there was no such thing as bad or good grammar
Nno said Soames
Of course in art there is the good and the evil
But in lifeno
He was rolling a cigarette
He had weak white hands not well washed and with fingertips much stained with nicotine
In life there are illusions of good and evil buthis voice trailed away to a murmur in which the words vieux jeu and rococo were faintly audible
I think he felt he was not doing himself justice and feared that Rothenstein was going to point out fallacies
Anyhow he cleared his throat and said Parlons dautre chose
It occurs to you that he was a fool
It didnt to me
I was young and had not the clarity of judgment that Rothenstein already had
Soames was quite five or six years older than either of us
Alsohe had written a book
It was wonderful to have written a book
If Rothenstein had not been there I should have revered Soames
Even as it was I respected him
And I was very near indeed to reverence when he said he had another book coming out soon
I asked if I might ask what kind of book it was to be
My poems he answered
Rothenstein asked if this was to be the title of the book
The poet meditated on this suggestion but said he rather thought of giving the book no title at all
If a book is good in itself he murmured and waved his cigarette
Rothenstein objected that absence of title might be bad for the sale of a book
If he urged I went into a booksellers and said simply Have you got
or Have you a copy of
how would they know what I wanted
Oh of course I should have my name on the cover Soames answered earnestly
And I rather want he added looking hard at Rothenstein to have a drawing of myself as frontispiece
Rothenstein admitted that this was a capital idea and mentioned that he was going into the country and would be there for some time
He then looked at his watch exclaimed at the hour paid the waiter and went away with me to dinner
Soames remained at his post of fidelity to the glaucous witch
Why were you so determined not to draw him
I asked
Draw him
Him
How can one draw a man who doesnt exist
He is dim I admitted
But my mot juste fell flat
Rothenstein repeated that Soames was nonexistent
Still Soames had written a book
I asked if Rothenstein had read Negations
He said he had looked into it but he added crisply I dont profess to know anything about writing
A reservation very characteristic of the period
Painters would not then allow that any one outside their own order had a right to any opinion about painting
This law graven on the tablets brought down by Whistler from the summit of Fujiyama imposed certain limitations
If other arts than painting were not utterly unintelligible to all but the men who practiced them the law totteredthe Monroe Doctrine as it were did not hold good
Therefore no painter would offer an opinion of a book without warning you at any rate that his opinion was worthless
No one is a better judge of literature than Rothenstein but it wouldnt have done to tell him so in those days and I knew that I must form an unaided judgment of Negations
Not to buy a book of which I had met the author face to face would have been for me in those days an impossible act of selfdenial
When I returned to Oxford for the Christmas term I had duly secured Negations
I used to keep it lying carelessly on the table in my room and whenever a friend took it up and asked what it was about I would say Oh its rather a remarkable book
Its by a man whom I know
Just what it was about I never was able to say
Head or tail was just what I hadnt made of that slim green volume
I found in the preface no clue to the labyrinth of contents and in that labyrinth nothing to explain the preface
Lean near to life
Lean very near nearer
Life is web and therein nor warp nor woof is but web only
It is for this I am Catholick in church and in thought yet do let swift Mood weave there what the shuttle of Mood wills
These were the opening phrases of the preface but those which followed were less easy to understand
Then came Stark A Conte about a midinette who so far as I could gather murdered or was about to murder a mannequin
It was rather like a story by Catulle Mendes in which the translator had either skipped or cut out every alternate sentence
Next a dialogue between Pan and St Ursula lacking I rather thought in snap
Next some aphorisms entitled Greek omitted
Throughout in fact there was a great variety of form and the forms had evidently been wrought with much care
It was rather the substance that eluded me
Was there I wondered any substance at all
It did not occur to me suppose Enoch Soames was a fool
Up cropped a rival hypothesis suppose I was
I inclined to give Soames the benefit of the doubt
I had read LApresmidi dun faune without extracting a glimmer of meaning yet Mallarme of course was a master
How was I to know that Soames wasnt another
There was a sort of music in his prose not indeed arresting but perhaps I thought haunting and laden perhaps with meanings as deep as Mallarmes own
I awaited his poems with an open mind
And I looked forward to them with positive impatience after I had had a second meeting with him
This was on an evening in January
Going into the aforesaid dominoroom I had passed a table at which sat a pale man with an open book before him
He had looked from his book to me and I looked back over my shoulder with a vague sense that I ought to have recognized him
I returned to pay my respects
After exchanging a few words I said with a glance to the open book I see I am interrupting you and was about to pass on but I prefer Soames replied in his toneless voice to be interrupted and I obeyed his gesture that I should sit down
I asked him if he often read here
Yes things of this kind I read here he answered indicating the title of his bookThe Poems of Shelley
Anything that you reallyand I was going to say admire
But I cautiously left my sentence unfinished and was glad that I had done so for he said with unwonted emphasis Anything secondrate
I had read little of Shelley but Of course I murmured hes very uneven
I should have thought evenness was just what was wrong with him
A deadly evenness
Thats why I read him here
The noise of this place breaks the rhythm
Hes tolerable here
Soames took up the book and glanced through the pages
He laughed
Soamess laugh was a short single and mirthless sound from the throat unaccompanied by any movement of the face or brightening of the eyes
What a period
he uttered laying the book down
And What a country
he added
I asked rather nervously if he didnt think Keats had more or less held his own against the drawbacks of time and place
He admitted that there were passages in Keats but did not specify them
Of the older men as he called them he seemed to like only Milton
Milton he said wasnt sentimental
Also Milton had a dark insight
And again I can always read Milton in the readingroom
The readingroom
Of the British Museum
I go there every day
You do
Ive only been there once
Im afraid I found it rather a depressing place
Itit seemed to sap ones vitality
It does
Thats why I go there
The lower ones vitality the more sensitive one is to great art
I live near the museum
I have rooms in Dyatt Street
And you go round to the readingroom to read Milton
Usually Milton
He looked at me
It was Milton he certificatively added who converted me to diabolism
Diabolism
Oh yes
Really
said I with that vague discomfort and that intense desire to be polite which one feels when a man speaks of his own religion
Youworship the devil
Soames shook his head
Its not exactly worship he qualified sipping his absinthe
Its more a matter of trusting and encouraging
I see yes
I had rather gathered from the preface to Negations that you were aa Catholic
Je letais a cette epoque
In fact I still am
I am a Catholic diabolist
But this profession he made in an almost cursory tone
I could see that what was upmost in his mind was the fact that I had read Negations
His pale eyes had for the first time gleamed
I felt as one who is about to be examined viva voce on the very subject in which he is shakiest
I hastily asked him how soon his poems were to be published
Next week he told me
And are they to be published without a title
No
I found a title at last
But I shant tell you what it is as though I had been so impertinent as to inquire
I am not sure that it wholly satisfies me
But it is the best I can find
It suggests something of the quality of the poemsstrange growths natural and wild yet exquisite he added and manyhued and full of poisons
I asked him what he thought of Baudelaire
He uttered the snort that was his laugh and Baudelaire he said was a bourgeois malgre lui
France had had only one poetVillon and two thirds of Villon were sheer journalism
Verlaine was an epicier malgre lui
Altogether rather to my surprise he rated French literature lower than English
There were passages in Villiers de lIsleAdam
But I he summed up owe nothing to France
He nodded at me
Youll see he predicted
I did not when the time came quite see that
I thought the author of Fungoids did unconsciously of course owe something to the young Parisian decadents or to the young English ones who owed something to THEM
I still think so
The little book bought by me in Oxford lies before me as I write
Its palegray buckram cover and silver lettering have not worn well
Nor have its contents
Through these with a melancholy interest I have again been looking
They are not much
But at the time of their publication I had a vague suspicion that they MIGHT be
I suppose it is my capacity for faith not poor Soamess work that is weaker than it once was
TO A YOUNG WOMAN THOU ART WHO HAST NOT BEEN
Pale tunes irresolute And traceries of old sounds Blown from a rotted flute Mingle with noise of cymbals rouged with rust Nor not strange forms and epicene Lie bleeding in the dust Being wounded with wounds
For this it is That in thy counterpart Of agelong mockeries THOU HAST NOT BEEN NOR ART
There seemed to me a certain inconsistency as between the first and last lines of this
I tried with bent brows to resolve the discord
But I did not take my failure as wholly incompatible with a meaning in Soamess mind
Might it not rather indicate the depth of his meaning
As for the craftsmanship rouged with rust seemed to me a fine stroke and nor not instead of and had a curious felicity
I wondered who the young woman was and what she had made of it all
I sadly suspect that Soames could not have made more of it than she
Yet even now if one doesnt try to make any sense at all of the poem and reads it just for the sound there is a certain grace of cadence
Soames was an artist in so far as he was anything poor fellow
It seemed to me when first I read Fungoids that oddly enough the diabolistic side of him was the best
Diabolism seemed to be a cheerful even a wholesome influence in his life
NOCTURNE Round and round the shutterd Square I strolled with the Devils arm in mine
No sound but the scrape of his hoofs was there And the ring of his laughter and mine
We had drunk black wine
I screamd I will race you Master
What matter he shriekd tonight Which of us runs the faster
There is nothing to fear tonight In the foul moons light
Then I lookd him in the eyes And I laughd full shrill at the lie he told And the gnawing fear he would fain disguise
It was true what Id time and again been told He was oldold
There was I felt quite a swing about that first stanzaa joyous and rollicking note of comradeship
The second was slightly hysterical perhaps
But I liked the third it was so bracingly unorthodox even according to the tenets of Soamess peculiar sect in the faith
Not much trusting and encouraging here
Soames triumphantly exposing the devil as a liar and laughing full shrill cut a quite heartening figure I thought then
Now in the light of what befell none of his other poems depresses me so much as Nocturne
I looked out for what the metropolitan reviewers would have to say
They seemed to fall into two classes those who had little to say and those who had nothing
The second class was the larger and the words of the first were cold insomuch that Strikes a note of modernity



These tripping numbersThe Preston Telegraph
was the only lure offered in advertisements by Soamess publisher
I had hoped that when next I met the poet I could congratulate him on having made a stir for I fancied he was not so sure of his intrinsic greatness as he seemed
I was but able to say rather coarsely when next I did see him that I hoped Fungoids was selling splendidly
He looked at me across his glass of absinthe and asked if I had bought a copy
His publisher had told him that three had been sold
I laughed as at a jest
You dont suppose I CARE do you
he said with something like a snarl
I disclaimed the notion
He added that he was not a tradesman
I said mildly that I wasnt either and murmured that an artist who gave truly new and great things to the world had always to wait long for recognition
He said he cared not a sou for recognition
I agreed that the act of creation was its own reward
His moroseness might have alienated me if I had regarded myself as a nobody
But ah
hadnt both John Lane and Aubrey Beardsley suggested that I should write an essay for the great new venture that was afootThe Yellow Book
And hadnt Henry Harland as editor accepted my essay
And wasnt it to be in the very first number
At Oxford I was still in statu pupillari
In London I regarded myself as very much indeed a graduate nowone whom no Soames could ruffle
Partly to show off partly in sheer goodwill I told Soames he ought to contribute to The Yellow Book
He uttered from the throat a sound of scorn for that publication
Nevertheless I did a day or two later tentatively ask Harland if he knew anything of the work of a man called Enoch Soames
Harland paused in the midst of his characteristic stride around the room threw up his hands toward the ceiling and groaned aloud he had often met that absurd creature in Paris and this very morning had received some poems in manuscript from him
Has he NO talent
I asked
He has an income
Hes all right
Harland was the most joyous of men and most generous of critics and he hated to talk of anything about which he couldnt be enthusiastic
So I dropped the subject of Soames
The news that Soames had an income did take the edge off solicitude
I learned afterward that he was the son of an unsuccessful and deceased bookseller in Preston but had inherited an annuity of three hundred pounds from a married aunt and had no surviving relatives of any kind
Materially then he was all right
But there was still a spiritual pathos about him sharpened for me now by the possibility that even the praises of The Preston Telegraph might not have been forthcoming had he not been the son of a Preston man He had a sort of weak doggedness which I could not but admire
Neither he nor his work received the slightest encouragement but he persisted in behaving as a personage always he kept his dingy little flag flying
Wherever congregated the jeunes feroces of the arts in whatever Soho restaurant they had just discovered in whatever musichall they were most frequently there was Soames in the midst of them or rather on the fringe of them a dim but inevitable figure
He never sought to propitiate his fellowwriters never bated a jot of his arrogance about his own work or of his contempt for theirs
To the painters he was respectful even humble but for the poets and prosaists of The Yellow Book and later of The Savoy he had never a word but of scorn
He wasnt resented
It didnt occur to anybody that he or his Catholic diabolism mattered
When in the autumn of 96 he brought out at his own expense this time a third book his last book nobody said a word for or against it
I meant but forgot to buy it
I never saw it and am ashamed to say I dont even remember what it was called
But I did at the time of its publication say to Rothenstein that I thought poor old Soames was really a rather tragic figure and that I believed he would literally die for want of recognition
Rothenstein scoffed
He said I was trying to get credit for a kind heart which I didnt possess and perhaps this was so
But at the private view of the New English Art Club a few weeks later I beheld a pastel portrait of Enoch Soames Esq
It was very like him and very like Rothenstein to have done it
Soames was standing near it in his soft hat and his waterproof cape all through the afternoon
Anybody who knew him would have recognized the portrait at a glance but nobody who didnt know him would have recognized the portrait from its bystander it existed so much more than he it was bound to
Also it had not that expression of faint happiness which on that day was discernible yes in Soamess countenance
Fame had breathed on him
Twice again in the course of the month I went to the New English and on both occasions Soames himself was on view there
Looking back I regard the close of that exhibition as having been virtually the close of his career
He had felt the breath of Fame against his cheekso late for such a little while and at its withdrawal he gave in gave up gave out
He who had never looked strong or well looked ghastly nowa shadow of the shade he had once been
He still frequented the dominoroom but having lost all wish to excite curiosity he no longer read books there
You read only at the museum now
I asked with attempted cheerfulness
He said he never went there now
No absinthe there he muttered
It was the sort of thing that in old days he would have said for effect but it carried conviction now
Absinthe erst but a point in the personality he had striven so hard to build up was solace and necessity now
He no longer called it la sorciere glauque
He had shed away all his French phrases
He had become a plain unvarnished Preston man
Failure if it be a plain unvarnished complete failure and even though it be a squalid failure has always a certain dignity
I avoided Soames because he made me feel rather vulgar
John Lane had published by this time two little books of mine and they had had a pleasant little success of esteem
I was aslight but definite personality
Frank Harris had engaged me to kick up my heels in The Saturday Review Alfred Harmsworth was letting me do likewise in The Daily Mail
I was just what Soames wasnt
And he shamed my gloss
Had I known that he really and firmly believed in the greatness of what he as an artist had achieved I might not have shunned him
No man who hasnt lost his vanity can be held to have altogether failed
Soamess dignity was an illusion of mine
One day in the first week of June 1897 that illusion went
But on the evening of that day Soames went too
I had been out most of the morning and as it was too late to reach home in time for luncheon I sought the Vingtieme
This little placeRestaurant du Vingtieme Siecle to give it its full titlehad been discovered in 96 by the poets and prosaists but had now been more or less abandoned in favor of some later find
I dont think it lived long enough to justify its name but at that time there it still was in Greek Street a few doors from Soho Square and almost opposite to that house where in the first years of the century a little girl and with her a boy named De Quincey made nightly encampment in darkness and hunger among dust and rats and old legal parchments
The Vingtieme was but a small whitewashed room leading out into the street at one end and into a kitchen at the other
The proprietor and cook was a Frenchman known to us as Monsieur Vingtieme the waiters were his two daughters Rose and Berthe and the food according to faith was good
The tables were so narrow and were set so close together that there was space for twelve of them six jutting from each wall
Only the two nearest to the door as I went in were occupied
On one side sat a tall flashy rather Mephistophelian man whom I had seen from time to time in the dominoroom and elsewhere
On the other side sat Soames
They made a queer contrast in that sunlit room Soames sitting haggard in that hat and cape which nowhere at any season had I seen him doff and this other this keenly vital man at sight of whom I more than ever wondered whether he were a diamond merchant a conjurer or the head of a private detective agency
I was sure Soames didnt want my company but I asked as it would have seemed brutal not to whether I might join him and took the chair opposite to his
He was smoking a cigarette with an untasted salmi of something on his plate and a halfempty bottle of Sauterne before him and he was quite silent
I said that the preparations for the Jubilee made London impossible
I rather liked them really
I professed a wish to go right away till the whole thing was over
In vain did I attune myself to his gloom
He seemed not to hear me or even to see me
I felt that his behavior made me ridiculous in the eyes of the other man
The gangway between the two rows of tables at the Vingtieme was hardly more than two feet wide Rose and Berthe in their ministrations had always to edge past each other quarreling in whispers as they did so and any one at the table abreast of yours was virtually at yours
I thought our neighbor was amused at my failure to interest Soames and so as I could not explain to him that my insistence was merely charitable I became silent
Without turning my head I had him well within my range of vision
I hoped I looked less vulgar than he in contrast with Soames
I was sure he was not an Englishman but what WAS his nationality
Though his jetblack hair was en brosse I did not think he was French
To Berthe who waited on him he spoke French fluently but with a hardly native idiom and accent
I gathered that this was his first visit to the Vingtieme but Berthe was offhand in her manner to him he had not made a good impression
His eyes were handsome but like the Vingtiemes tables too narrow and set too close together
His nose was predatory and the points of his mustache waxed up behind his nostrils gave a fixity to his smile
Decidedly he was sinister
And my sense of discomfort in his presence was intensified by the scarlet waistcoat which tightly and so unseasonably in June sheathed his ample chest
This waistcoat wasnt wrong merely because of the heat either
It was somehow all wrong in itself
It wouldnt have done on Christmas morning
It would have struck a jarring note at the first night of Hernani
I was trying to account for its wrongness when Soames suddenly and strangely broke silence
A hundred years hence
he murmured as in a trance
We shall not be here I briskly but fatuously added
We shall not be here
No he droned but the museum will still be just where it is
And the readingroom just where it is
And people will be able to go and read there
He inhaled sharply and a spasm as of actual pain contorted his features
I wondered what train of thought poor Soames had been following
He did not enlighten me when he said after a long pause You think I havent minded
Minded what Soames
Neglect
Failure
FAILURE
I said heartily
Failure
I repeated vaguely
Neglectyes perhaps but thats quite another matter
Of course you havent beenappreciated
But what then
Any artist whowho gives What I wanted to say was Any artist who gives truly new and great things to the world has always to wait long for recognition but the flattery would not out in the face of his miserya misery so genuine and so unmasked my lips would not say the words
And then he said them for me
I flushed
Thats what you were going to say isnt it
he asked
How did you know
Its what you said to me three years ago when Fungoids was published
I flushed the more
I need not have flushed at all
Its the only important thing I ever heard you say he continued
And Ive never forgotten it
Its a true thing
Its a horrible truth
Butdyou remember what I answered
I said I dont care a sou for recognition
And you believed me
Youve gone on believing Im above that sort of thing
Youre shallow
What should YOU know of the feelings of a man like me
You imagine that a great artists faith in himself and in the verdict of posterity is enough to keep him happy
Youve never guessed at the bitterness and loneliness thehis voice broke but presently he resumed speaking with a force that I had never known in him
Posterity
What use is it to ME
A dead man doesnt know that people are visiting his grave visiting his birthplace putting up tablets to him unveiling statues of him
A dead man cant read the books that are written about him
A hundred years hence
Think of it
If I could come back to life THENjust for a few hoursand go to the readingroom and READ
Or better still if I could be projected now at this moment into that future into that readingroom just for this one afternoon
Id sell myself body and soul to the devil for that
Think of the pages and pages in the catalogue Soames Enoch endlesslyendless editions commentaries prolegomena biographies But here he was interrupted by a sudden loud crack of the chair at the next table
Our neighbor had half risen from his place
He was leaning toward us apologetically intrusive
Excusepermit me he said softly
I have been unable not to hear
Might I take a liberty
In this little restaurantsansfaconmight I as the phrase is cut in
I could but signify our acquiescence
Berthe had appeared at the kitchen door thinking the stranger wanted his bill
He waved her away with his cigar and in another moment had seated himself beside me commanding a full view of Soames
Though not an Englishman he explained I know my London well Mr Soames
Your name and fameMr Beerbohms toovery known to me
Your point is who am I
He glanced quickly over his shoulder and in a lowered voice said I am the devil
I couldnt help it I laughed
I tried not to I knew there was nothing to laugh at my rudeness shamed me butI laughed with increasing volume
The devils quiet dignity the surprise and disgust of his raised eyebrows did but the more dissolve me
I rocked to and fro I lay back aching I behaved deplorably
I am a gentleman and he said with intense emphasis I thought I was in the company of GENTLEMEN
Dont
I gasped faintly
Oh dont
Curious nicht wahr
I heard him say to Soames
There is a type of person to whom the very mention of my name isoh so awfullyfunny
In your theaters the dullest comedien needs only to say The devil
and right away they give him the loud laugh what speaks the vacant mind
Is it not so
I had now just breath enough to offer my apologies
He accepted them but coldly and readdressed himself to Soames
I am a man of business he said and always I would put things through right now as they say in the States
You are a poet
Les affairesyou detest them
So be it
But with me you will deal eh
What you have said just now gives me furiously to hope
Soames had not moved except to light a fresh cigarette
He sat crouched forward with his elbows squared on the table and his head just above the level of his hands staring up at the devil
Go on he nodded
I had no remnant of laughter in me now
It will be the more pleasant our little deal the devil went on because you areI mistake nota diabolist
A Catholic diabolist said Soames
The devil accepted the reservation genially
You wish he resumed to visit nowthis afternoon aseveris the readingroom of the British Museum yes
But of a hundred years hence yes
Parfaitement
Timean illusion
Past and futurethey are as ever present as the present or at any rate only what you call just round the corner
I switch you on to any date
I project youpouf
You wish to be in the readingroom just as it will be on the afternoon of June 3 1997
You wish to find yourself standing in that room just past the swingdoors this very minute yes
And to stay there till closingtime
Am I right
Soames nodded
The devil looked at his watch
Ten past two he said
Closingtime in summer same then as nowseven oclock
That will give you almost five hours
At seven oclockpoufyou find yourself again here sitting at this table
I am dining tonight dans le mondedans le higlif
That concludes my present visit to your great city
I come and fetch you here Mr Soames on my way home
Home
I echoed
Be it never so humble
said the devil lightly
All right said Soames
Soames
I entreated
But my friend moved not a muscle
The devil had made as though to stretch forth his hand across the table but he paused in his gesture
A hundred years hence as now he smiled no smoking allowed in the readingroom
You would better therefore Soames removed the cigarette from his mouth and dropped it into his glass of Sauterne
Soames
again I cried
Cant youbut the devil had now stretched forth his hand across the table
He brought it slowly down on the tablecloth
Soamess chair was empty
His cigarette floated sodden in his wineglass
There was no other trace of him
For a few moments the devil let his hand rest where it lay gazing at me out of the corners of his eyes vulgarly triumphant
A shudder shook me
With an effort I controlled myself and rose from my chair
Very clever I said condescendingly
ButThe Time Machine is a delightful book dont you think
So entirely original
You are pleased to sneer said the devil who had also risen but it is one thing to write about an impossible machine it is a quite other thing to be a supernatural power
All the same I had scored
Berthe had come forth at the sound of our rising
I explained to her that Mr Soames had been called away and that both he and I would be dining here
It was not until I was out in the open air that I began to feel giddy
I have but the haziest recollection of what I did where I wandered in the glaring sunshine of that endless afternoon
I remember the sound of carpenters hammers all along Piccadilly and the bare chaotic look of the halferected stands
Was it in the Green Park or in Kensington Gardens or WHERE was it that I sat on a chair beneath a tree trying to read an evening paper
There was a phrase in the leading article that went on repeating itself in my fagged mind Little is hidden from this August Lady full of the garnered wisdom of sixty years of Sovereignty
I remember wildly conceiving a letter to reach Windsor by an express messenger told to await answer Madam Well knowing that your Majesty is full of the garnered wisdom of sixty years of Sovereignty I venture to ask your advice in the following delicate matter
Mr Enoch Soames whose poems you may or may not know Was there NO way of helping him saving him
A bargain was a bargain and I was the last man to aid or abet any one in wriggling out of a reasonable obligation
I wouldnt have lifted a little finger to save Faust
But poor Soames
Doomed to pay without respite an eternal price for nothing but a fruitless search and a bitter disillusioning
Odd and uncanny it seemed to me that he Soames in the flesh in the waterproof cape was at this moment living in the last decade of the next century poring over books not yet written and seeing and seen by men not yet born
Uncannier and odder still that tonight and evermore he would be in hell
Assuredly truth was stranger than fiction
Endless that afternoon was
Almost I wished I had gone with Soames not indeed to stay in the readingroom but to sally forth for a brisk sightseeing walk around a new London
I wandered restlessly out of the park I had sat in
Vainly I tried to imagine myself an ardent tourist from the eighteenth century
Intolerable was the strain of the slowpassing and empty minutes
Long before seven oclock I was back at the Vingtieme
I sat there just where I had sat for luncheon
Air came in listlessly through the open door behind me
Now and again Rose or Berthe appeared for a moment
I had told them I would not order any dinner till Mr Soames came
A hurdygurdy began to play abruptly drowning the noise of a quarrel between some Frenchmen farther up the street
Whenever the tune was changed I heard the quarrel still raging
I had bought another evening paper on my way
I unfolded it
My eyes gazed ever away from it to the clock over the kitchen door
Five minutes now to the hour
I remembered that clocks in restaurants are kept five minutes fast
I concentrated my eyes on the paper
I vowed I would not look away from it again
I held it upright at its full width close to my face so that I had no view of anything but it
Rather a tremulous sheet
Only because of the draft I told myself
My arms gradually became stiff they ached but I could not drop themnow
I had a suspicion I had a certainty
Well what then
What else had I come for
Yet I held tight that barrier of newspaper
Only the sound of Berthes brisk footstep from the kitchen enabled me forced me to drop it and to utter What shall we have to eat Soames
Il est souffrant ce pauvre Monsieur Soames
asked Berthe
Hes onlytired
I asked her to get some wineBurgundyand whatever food might be ready
Soames sat crouched forward against the table exactly as when last I had seen him
It was as though he had never movedhe who had moved so unimaginably far
Once or twice in the afternoon it had for an instant occurred to me that perhaps his journey was not to be fruitless that perhaps we had all been wrong in our estimate of the works of Enoch Soames
That we had been horribly right was horribly clear from the look of him
But Dont be discouraged I falteringly said
Perhaps its only that youdidnt leave enough time
Two three centuries hence perhaps Yes his voice came Ive thought of that
And nownow for the more immediate future
Where are you going to hide
How would it be if you caught the Paris express from Charing Cross
Almost an hour to spare
Dont go on to Paris
Stop at Calais
Live in Calais
Hed never think of looking for you in Calais
Its like my luck he said to spend my last hours on earth with an ass
But I was not offended
And a treacherous ass he strangely added tossing across to me a crumpled bit of paper which he had been holding in his hand
I glanced at the writing on itsome sort of gibberish apparently
I laid it impatiently aside
Come Soames pull yourself together
This isnt a mere matter of life or death
Its a question of eternal torment mind you
You dont mean to say youre going to wait limply here till the devil comes to fetch you
I cant do anything else
Ive no choice
Come
This is trusting and encouraging with a vengeance
This is diabolism run mad
I filled his glass with wine
Surely now that youve SEEN the brute Its no good abusing him
You must admit theres nothing Miltonic about him Soames
I dont say hes not rather different from what I expected
Hes a vulgarian hes a swell mobsman hes the sort of man who hangs about the corridors of trains going to the Riviera and steals ladies jewelcases
Imagine eternal torment presided over by HIM
You dont suppose I look forward to it do you
Then why not slip quietly out of the way
Again and again I filled his glass and always mechanically he emptied it but the wine kindled no spark of enterprise in him
He did not eat and I myself ate hardly at all
I did not in my heart believe that any dash for freedom could save him
The chase would be swift the capture certain
But better anything than this passive meek miserable waiting
I told Soames that for the honor of the human race he ought to make some show of resistance
He asked what the human race had ever done for him
Besides he said cant you understand that Im in his power
You saw him touch me didnt you
Theres an end of it
Ive no will
Im sealed
I made a gesture of despair
He went on repeating the word sealed
I began to realize that the wine had clouded his brain
No wonder
Foodless he had gone into futurity foodless he still was
I urged him to eat at any rate some bread
It was maddening to think that he who had so much to tell might tell nothing
How was it all I asked yonder
Come tell me your adventures
Theyd make firstrate copy wouldnt they
Im awfully sorry for you Soames and I make all possible allowances but what earthly right have you to insinuate that I should make copy as you call it out of you
The poor fellow pressed his hands to his forehead
I dont know he said
I had some reason I know
Ill try to remember
He sat plunged in thought
Thats right
Try to remember everything
Eat a little more bread
What did the readingroom look like
Much as usual he at length muttered
Many people there
Usual sort of number
What did they look like
Soames tried to visualize them
They all he presently remembered looked very like one another
My mind took a fearsome leap
All dressed in sanitary woolen
Yes I think so
Grayishyellowish stuff
A sort of uniform
He nodded
With a number on it perhapsa number on a large disk of metal strapped round the left arm
D K F 78910that sort of thing
It was even so
And all of them men and women alike looking very well cared for
Very Utopian and smelling rather strongly of carbolic and all of them quite hairless
I was right every time
Soames was only not sure whether the men and women were hairless or shorn
I hadnt time to look at them very closely he explained
No of course not
But They stared at ME I can tell you
I attracted a great deal of attention
At last he had done that
I think I rather scared them
They moved away whenever I came near
They followed me about at a distance wherever I went
The men at the round desk in the middle seemed to have a sort of panic whenever I went to make inquiries
What did you do when you arrived
Well he had gone straight to the catalogue of courseto the S volumesand had stood long before SNSOF unable to take this volume out of the shelf because his heart was beating so
At first he said he wasnt disappointed he only thought there was some new arrangement
He went to the middle desk and asked where the catalogue of twentiethcentury books was kept
He gathered that there was still only one catalogue
Again he looked up his name stared at the three little pasted slips he had known so well
Then he went and sat down for a long time
And then he droned I looked up the Dictionary of National Biography and some encyclopedias
I went back to the middle desk and asked what was the best modern book on late nineteenthcentury literature
They told me Mr T K Nuptons book was considered the best
I looked it up in the catalogue and filled in a form for it
It was brought to me
My name wasnt in the index butyes
he said with a sudden change of tone thats what Id forgotten
Wheres that bit of paper
Give it me back
I too had forgotten that cryptic screed
I found it fallen on the floor and handed it to him
He smoothed it out nodding and smiling at me disagreeably
I found myself glancing through Nuptons book he resumed
Not very easy reading
Some sort of phonetic spelling
All the modern books I saw were phonetic
Then I dont want to hear any more Soames please
The proper names seemed all to be spelt in the old way
But for that I mightnt have noticed my own name
Your own name
Really
Soames Im VERY glad
And yours
No
I thought I should find you waiting here tonight so I took the trouble to copy out the passage
Read it
I snatched the paper
Soamess handwriting was characteristically dim
It and the noisome spelling and my excitement made me all the slower to grasp what T K Nupton was driving at
The document lies before me at this moment
Strange that the words I here copy out for you were copied out for me by poor Soames just eightytwo years hence
From page 234 of Inglish Littracher 18901900 bi T K Nupton publishd bi th Stait 1992

Thank hevvn we hav no Enoch Soameses amung us todai
I found that by murmuring the words aloud a device which I commend to my reader I was able to master them little by little
The clearer they became the greater was my bewilderment my distress and horror
The whole thing was a nightmare
Afar the great grisly background of what was in store for the poor dear art of letters here at the table fixing on me a gaze that made me hot all over the poor fellow whomwhom evidentlybut no whatever downgrade my character might take in coming years I should never be such a brute as to Again I examined the screed
Immajnari
But here Soames was no more imaginary alas
than I
And labudwhat on earth was that
To this day I have never made out that word
Its all verybaffling I at length stammered
Soames said nothing but cruelly did not cease to look at me
Are you sure I temporized quite sure you copied the thing out correctly
Quite
Well then its this wretched Nupton who must have mademust be going to makesome idiotic mistake
Look here Soames you know me better than to suppose that I After all the name Max Beerbohm is not at all an uncommon one and there must be several Enoch Soameses running around or rather Enoch Soames is a name that might occur to any one writing a story
And I dont write stories Im an essayist an observer a recorder
I admit that its an extraordinary coincidence
But you must see I see the whole thing said Soames quietly
And he added with a touch of his old manner but with more dignity than I had ever known in him Parlons dautre chose
I accepted that suggestion very promptly
I returned straight to the more immediate future
I spent most of the long evening in renewed appeals to Soames to come away and seek refuge somewhere
I remember saying at last that if indeed I was destined to write about him the supposed stauri had better have at least a happy ending
Soames repeated those last three words in a tone of intense scorn
In life and in art he said all that matters is an INEVITABLE ending
But I urged more hopefully than I felt an ending that can be avoided ISNT inevitable
You arent an artist he rasped
And youre so hopelessly not an artist that so far from being able to imagine a thing and make it seem true youre going to make even a true thing seem as if youd made it up
Youre a miserable bungler
And its like my luck
I protested that the miserable bungler was not I was not going to be I but T K Nupton and we had a rather heated argument in the thick of which it suddenly seemed to me that Soames saw he was in the wrong he had quite physically cowered
But I wondered whyand now I guessed with a cold throb just whyhe stared so past me
The bringer of that inevitable ending filled the doorway
I managed to turn in my chair and to say not without a semblance of lightness Aha come in
Dread was indeed rather blunted in me by his looking so absurdly like a villain in a melodrama
The sheen of his tilted hat and of his shirtfront the repeated twists he was giving to his mustache and most of all the magnificence of his sneer gave token that he was there only to be foiled
He was at our table in a stride
I am sorry he sneered witheringly to break up your pleasant party but You dont you complete it I assured him
Mr Soames and I want to have a little talk with you
Wont you sit
Mr Soames got nothing frankly nothing by his journey this afternoon
We dont wish to say that the whole thing was a swindle a common swindle
On the contrary we believe you meant well
But of course the bargain such as it was is off
The devil gave no verbal answer
He merely looked at Soames and pointed with rigid forefinger to the door
Soames was wretchedly rising from his chair when with a desperate quick gesture I swept together two dinnerknives that were on the table and laid their blades across each other
The devil stepped sharp back against the table behind him averting his face and shuddering
You are not superstitious
he hissed
Not at all I smiled
Soames he said as to an underling but without turning his face put those knives straight
With an inhibitive gesture to my friend Mr Soames I said emphatically to the devil is a Catholic diabolist but my poor friend did the devils bidding not mine and now with his masters eyes again fixed on him he arose he shuffled past me
I tried to speak
It was he that spoke
Try was the prayer he threw back at me as the devil pushed him roughly out through the doorTRY to make them know that I did exist
In another instant I too was through that door
I stood staring all ways up the street across it down it
There was moonlight and lamplight but there was not Soames nor that other
Dazed I stood there
Dazed I turned back at length into the little room and I suppose I paid Berthe or Rose for my dinner and luncheon and for Soamess I hope so for I never went to the Vingtieme again
Ever since that night I have avoided Greek Street altogether
And for years I did not set foot even in Soho Square because on that same night it was there that I paced and loitered long and long with some such dull sense of hope as a man has in not straying far from the place where he has lost something
Round and round the shutterd Squarethat line came back to me on my lonely beat and with it the whole stanza ringing in my brain and bearing in on me how tragically different from the happy scene imagined by him was the poets actual experience of that prince in whom of all princes we should put not our trust
But strange how the mind of an essayist be it never so stricken roves and ranges
I remember pausing before a wide doorstep and wondering if perchance it was on this very one that the young De Quincey lay ill and faint while poor Ann flew as fast as her feet would carry her to Oxford Street the stonyhearted stepmother of them both and came back bearing that glass of port wine and spices but for which he might so he thought actually have died
Was this the very doorstep that the old De Quincey used to revisit in homage
I pondered Anns fate the cause of her sudden vanishing from the ken of her boy friend and presently I blamed myself for letting the past override the present
Poor vanished Soames
And for myself too I began to be troubled
What had I better do
Would there be a hue and cryMysterious Disappearance of an Author and all that
He had last been seen lunching and dining in my company
Hadnt I better get a hansom and drive straight to Scotland Yard
They would think I was a lunatic
After all I reassured myself London was a very large place and one very dim figure might easily drop out of it unobserved now especially in the blinding glare of the near Jubilee
Better say nothing at all I thought
AND I was right
Soamess disappearance made no stir at all
He was utterly forgotten before any one so far as I am aware noticed that he was no longer hanging around
Now and again some poet or prosaist may have said to another What has become of that man Soames
but I never heard any such question asked
As for his landlady in Dyatt Street no doubt he had paid her weekly and what possessions he may have had in his rooms were enough to save her from fretting
The solicitor through whom he was paid his annuity may be presumed to have made inquiries but no echo of these resounded
There was something rather ghastly to me in the general unconsciousness that Soames had existed and more than once I caught myself wondering whether Nupton that babe unborn were going to be right in thinking him a figment of my brain
In that extract f rom Nuptons repulsive book there is one point which perhaps puzzles you
How is it that the author though I have here mentioned him by name and have quoted the exact words he is going to write is not going to grasp the obvious corollary that I have invented nothing
The answer can be only this Nupton will not have read the later passages of this memoir
Such lack of thoroughness is a serious fault in any one who undertakes to do scholars work
And I hope these words will meet the eye of some contemporary rival to Nupton and be the undoing of Nupton
I like to think that some time between 1992 and 1997 somebody will have looked up this memoir and will have forced on the world his inevitable and startling conclusions
And I have reason for believing that this will be so
You realize that the readingroom into which Soames was projected by the devil was in all respects precisely as it will be on the afternoon of June 3 1997
You realize therefore that on that afternoon when it comes round there the selfsame crowd will be and there Soames will be punctually he and they doing precisely what they did before
Recall now Soamess account of the sensation he made
You may say that the mere difference of his costume was enough to make him sensational in that uniformed crowd
You wouldnt say so if you had ever seen him and I assure you that in no period would Soames be anything but dim
The fact that people are going to stare at him and follow him around and seem afraid of him can be explained only on the hypothesis that they will somehow have been prepared for his ghostly visitation
They will have been awfully waiting to see whether he really would come
And when he does come the effect will of course beawful
An authentic guaranteed proved ghost but only a ghost alas
Only that
In his first visit Soames was a creature of flesh and blood whereas the creatures among whom he was projected were but ghosts I take itsolid palpable vocal but unconscious and automatic ghosts in a building that was itself an illusion
Next time that building and those creatures will be real
It is of Soames that there will be but the semblance
I wish I could think him destined to revisit the world actually physically consciously
I wish he had this one brief escape this one small treat to look forward to
I never forget him for long
He is where he is and forever
The more rigid moralists among you may say he has only himself to blame
For my part I think he has been very hardly used
It is well that vanity should be chastened and Enoch Soamess vanity was I admit above the average and called for special treatment
But there was no need for vindictiveness
You say he contracted to pay the price he is paying
Yes but I maintain that he was induced to do so by fraud
Well informed in all things the devil must have known that my friend would gain nothing by his visit to futurity
The whole thing was a very shabby trick
The more I think of it the more detestable the devil seems to me
Of him I have caught sight several times here and there since that day at the Vingtieme
Only once however have I seen him at close quarters
This was a couple of years ago in Paris
I was walking one afternoon along the rue dAntin and I saw him advancing from the opposite direction overdressed as ever and swinging an ebony cane and altogether behaving as though the whole pavement belonged to him
At thought of Enoch Soames and the myriads of other sufferers eternally in this brutes dominion a great cold wrath filled me and I drew myself up to my full height
Butwell one is so used to nodding and smiling in the street to anybody whom one knows that the action becomes almost independent of oneself to prevent it requires a very sharp effort and great presence of mind
I was miserably aware as I passed the devil that I nodded and smiled to him
And my shame was the deeper and hotter because he if you please stared straight at me with the utmost haughtiness
To be cut deliberately cut by HIM
I was I still am furious at having had that happen to me
