Life in the IronMills by Rebecca Harding Davis Is this the end
O Life as futile then as frail
What hope of answer or redress
A cloudy day do you know what that is in a town of ironworks
The sky sank down before dawn muddy flat immovable
The air is thick clammy with the breath of crowded human beings
It stifles me
I open the window and looking out can scarcely see through the rain the grocers shop opposite where a crowd of drunken Irishmen are puffing Lynchburg tobacco in their pipes
I can detect the scent through all the foul smells ranging loose in the air
The idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke
It rolls sullenly in slow folds from the great chimneys of the ironfoundries and settles down in black slimy pools on the muddy streets
Smoke on the wharves smoke on the dingy boats on the yellow river clinging in a coating of greasy soot to the housefront the two faded poplars the faces of the passersby
The long train of mules dragging masses of pigiron through the narrow street have a foul vapor hanging to their reeking sides
Here inside is a little broken figure of an angel pointing upward from the mantelshelf but even its wings are covered with smoke clotted and black
Smoke everywhere
A dirty canary chirps desolately in a cage beside me
Its dream of green fields and sunshine is a very old dreamalmost worn out I think
From the backwindow I can see a narrow brickyard sloping down to the riverside strewed with rainbutts and tubs
The river dull and tawnycolored la belle riviere
drags itself sluggishly along tired of the heavy weight of boats and coal barges
What wonder
When I was a child I used to fancy a look of weary dumb appeal upon the face of the negrolike river slavishly bearing its burden day after day
Something of the same idle notion comes to me today when from the streetwindow I look on the slow stream of human life creeping past night and morning to the great mills
Masses of men with dull besotted faces bent to the ground sharpened here and there by pain or cunning skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes stooping all night over boiling caldrons of metal laired by day in dens of drunkenness and infamy breathing from infancy to death an air saturated with fog and grease and soot vileness for soul and body
What do you make of a case like that amateur psychologist
You call it an altogether serious thing to be alive to these men it is a drunken jest a joke horrible to angels perhaps to them commonplace enough
My fancy about the river was an idle one it is no type of such a life
What if it be stagnant and slimy here
It knows that beyond there waits for it odorous sunlight quaint old gardens dusky with soft green foliage of appletrees and flushing crimson with rosesair and fields and mountains
The future of the Welsh puddler passing just now is not so pleasant
To be stowed away after his grimy work is done in a hole in the muddy graveyard and after that not air nor green fields nor curious roses
Can you see how foggy the day is
As I stand here idly tapping the windowpane and looking out through the rain at the dirty backyard and the coalboats below fragments of an old story float up before mea story of this house into which I happened to come today
You may think it a tiresome story enough as foggy as the day sharpened by no sudden flashes of pain or pleasureI know only the outline of a dull life that long since with thousands of dull lives like its own was vainly lived and lost thousands of them massed vile slimy lives like those of the torpid lizards in yonder stagnant water buttLost
There is a curious point for you to settle my friend who study psychology in a lazy dilettante way
Stop a moment
I am going to be honest
This is what I want you to do
I want you to hide your disgust take no heed to your clean clothes and come right down with mehere into the thickest of the fog and mud and foul effluvia
I want you to hear this story
There is a secret down here in this nightmare fog that has lain dumb for centuries I want to make it a real thing to you
You Egoist or Pantheist or Arminian busy in making straight paths for your feet on the hills do not see it clearlythis terrible question which men here have gone mad and died trying to answer
I dare not put this secret into words
I told you it was dumb
These men going by with drunken faces and brains full of unawakened power do not ask it of Society or of God
Their lives ask it their deaths ask it
There is no reply
I will tell you plainly that I have a great hope and I bring it to you to be tested
It is this that this terrible dumb question is its own reply that it is not the sentence of death we think it but from the very extremity of its darkness the most solemn prophecy which the world has known of the Hope to come
I dare make my meaning no clearer but will only tell my story
It will perhaps seem to you as foul and dark as this thick vapor about us and as pregnant with death but if your eyes are free as mine are to look deeper no perfumetinted dawn will be so fair with promise of the day that shall surely come
My story is very simpleOnly what I remember of the life of one of these mena furnacetender in one of Kirby  Johns rollingmillsHugh Wolfe
You know the mills
They took the great order for the lower Virginia railroads there last winter run usually with about a thousand men
I cannot tell why I choose the halfforgotten story of this Wolfe more than that of myriads of these furnacehands
Perhaps because there is a secret underlying sympathy between that story and this day with its impure fog and thwarted sunshineor perhaps simply for the reason that this house is the one where the Wolfes lived
There were the father and sonboth hands as I said in one of Kirby  Johns mills for making railroadironand Deborah their cousin a picker in some of the cottonmills
The house was rented then to half a dozen families
The Wolfes had two of the cellarrooms
The old man like many of the puddlers and feeders of the mills was Welshhad spent half of his life in the Cornish tinmines
You may pick the Welsh emigrants Cornish miners out of the throng passing the windows any day
They are a trifle more filthy their muscles are not so brawny they stoop more
When they are drunk they neither yell nor shout nor stagger but skulk along like beaten hounds
A pure unmixed blood I fancy shows itself in the slight angular bodies and sharplycut facial lines
It is nearly thirty years since the Wolfes lived here
Their lives were like those of their class incessant labor sleeping in kennellike rooms eating rank pork and molasses drinkingGod and the distillers only know what with an occasional night in jail to atone for some drunken excess
Is that all of their livesof the portion given to them and these their duplicates swarming the streets todaynothing beneathall
So many a political reformer will tell youand many a private reformer too who has gone among them with a heart tender with Christs charity and come out outraged hardened
One rainy night about eleven oclock a crowd of halfclothed women stopped outside of the cellardoor
They were going home from the cottonmill
Goodnight Deb said one a mulatto steadying herself against the gaspost
She needed the post to steady her
So did more than one of them
Dahs a ball to Miss Potts tonight
Yed best come
Inteet Deb if hurll come hurll hef fun said a shrill Welsh voice in the crowd
Two or three dirty hands were thrust out to catch the gown of the woman who was groping for the latch of the door
No
No
Wheres Kit Small then
Begorra
on the spools
Alleys behint though we helped her we dud
An wid ye
Let Deb alone
Its ondacent frettin a quite body
Be the powers an well have a night of it
therell be lashins o drinkthe Vargent be blessed and praised fort
They went on the mulatto inclining for a moment to show fight and drag the woman Wolfe off with them but being pacified she staggered away
Deborah groped her way into the cellar and after considerable stumbling kindled a match and lighted a tallow dip that sent a yellow glimmer over the room
It was low dampthe earthen floor covered with a green slimy mossa fetid air smothering the breath
Old Wolfe lay asleep on a heap of straw wrapped in a torn horseblanket
He was a pale meek little man with a white face and red rabbiteyes
The woman Deborah was like him only her face was even more ghastly her lips bluer her eyes more watery
She wore a faded cotton gown and a slouching bonnet
When she walked one could see that she was deformed almost a hunchback
She trod softly so as not to waken him and went through into the room beyond
There she found by the halfextinguished fire an iron saucepan filled with cold boiled potatoes which she put upon a broken chair with a pintcup of ale
Placing the old candlestick beside this dainty repast she untied her bonnet which hung limp and wet over her face and prepared to eat her supper
It was the first food that had touched her lips since morning
There was enough of it however there is not always
She was hungryone could see that easily enoughand not drunk as most of her companions would have been found at this hour
She did not drink this womanher face told that toonothing stronger than ale
Perhaps the weak flaccid wretch had some stimulant in her pale life to keep her upsome love or hope it might be or urgent need
When that stimulant was gone she would take to whiskey
Man cannot live by work alone
While she was skinning the potatoes and munching them a noise behind her made her stop
Janey
she called lifting the candle and peering into the darkness
Janey are you there
A heap of ragged coats was heaved up and the face of a younggirl emerged staring sleepily at the woman
Deborah she said at last Im here the night
Yes child
Hurs welcome she said quietly eating on
The girls face was haggard and sickly her eyes were heavy with sleep and hunger real Milesian eyes they were dark delicate blue glooming out from black shadows with a pitiful fright
I was alone she said timidly
Wheres the father
asked Deborah holding out a potato which the girl greedily seized
Hes beyantwid Haleyin the stone house
Did you ever hear the word tail from an Irish mouth
I came here
Hugh told me never to stay melone
Hugh
Yes
A vexed frown crossed her face
The girl saw it and added quickly I have not seen Hugh the day Deb
The old man says his watch lasts till the mornin
The woman sprang up and hastily began to arrange some bread and flitch in a tin pail and to pour her own measure of ale into a bottle
Tying on her bonnet she blew out the candle
Lay ye down Janey dear she said gently covering her with the old rags
Hur can eat the potatoes if hurs hungry
Where are ye goin Deb
The rains sharp
To the mill with Hughs supper
Let him bide till th morn
Sit ye down
No nosharply pushing her off
The boyll starve
She hurried from the cellar while the child wearily coiled herself up for sleep
The rain was falling heavily as the woman pail in hand emerged from the mouth of the alley and turned down the narrow street that stretched out long and black miles before her
Here and there a flicker of gas lighted an uncertain space of muddy footwalk and gutter the long rows of houses except an occasional lagerbier shop were closed now and then she met a band of millhands skulking to or from their work
Not many even of the inhabitants of a manufacturing town know the vast machinery of system by which the bodies of workmen are governed that goes on unceasingly from year to year
The hands of each mill are divided into watches that relieve each other as regularly as the sentinels of an army
By night and day the work goes on the unsleeping engines groan and shriek the fiery pools of metal boil and surge
Only for a day in the week in halfcourtesy to public censure the fires are partially veiled but as soon as the clock strikes midnight the great furnaces break forth with renewed fury the clamor begins with fresh breathless vigor the engines sob and shriek like gods in pain
As Deborah hurried down through the heavy rain the noise of these thousand engines sounded through the sleep and shadow of the city like faroff thunder
The mill to which she was going lay on the river a mile below the citylimits
It was far and she was weak aching from standing twelve hours at the spools
Yet it was her almost nightly walk to take this man his supper though at every square she sat down to rest and she knew she should receive small word of thanks
Perhaps if she had possessed an artists eye the picturesque oddity of the scene might have made her step stagger less and the path seem shorter but to her the mills were only summat deilish to look at by night
The road leading to the mills had been quarried from the solid rock which rose abrupt and bare on one side of the cinder covered road while the river sluggish and black crept past on the other
The mills for rolling iron are simply immense tent like roofs covering acres of ground open on every side
Beneath these roofs Deborah looked in on a city of fires that burned hot and fiercely in the night
Fire in every horrible form pits of flame waving in the wind liquid metalflames writhing in tortuous streams through the sand wide caldrons filled with boiling fire over which bent ghastly wretches stirring the strange brewing and through all crowds of half clad men looking like revengeful ghosts in the red light hurried throwing masses of glittering fire
It was like a street in Hell
Even Deborah muttered as she crept through looks like t Devils place
It didin more ways than one
She found the man she was looking for at last heaping coal on a furnace
He had not time to eat his supper so she went behind the furnace and waited
Only a few men were with him and they noticed her only by a Hyur comes thunchback Wolfe
Deborah was stupid with sleep her back pained her sharply and her teeth chattered with cold with the rain that soaked her clothes and dripped from her at every step
She stood however patiently holding the pail and waiting
Hout woman
ye look like a drowned cat
Come near to the firesaid one of the men approaching to scrape away the ashes
She shook her head
Wolfe had forgotten her
He turned hearing the man and came closer
I did no think gi me my supper woman
She watched him eat with a painful eagerness
With a womans quick instinct she saw that he was not hungrywas eating to please her
Her pale watery eyes began to gather a strange light
Ist good Hugh
T ale was a bit sour I feared
No good enough
He hesitated a moment
Yere tired poor lass
Bide here till I go
Lay down there on that heap of ash and go to sleep
He threw her an old coat for a pillow and turned to his work
The heap was the refuse of the burnt iron and was not a hard bed the halfsmothered warmth too penetrated her limbs dulling their pain and cold shiver
Miserable enough she looked lying there on the ashes like a limp dirty ragyet not an unfitting figure to crown the scene of hopeless discomfort and veiled crime more fitting if one looked deeper into the heart of things at her thwarted womans form her colorless life her waking stupor that smothered pain and hungereven more fit to be a type of her class
Deeper yet if one could look was there nothing worth reading in this wet faded thing halfcovered with ashes
no story of a soul filled with groping passionate love heroic unselfishness fierce jealousy
of years of weary trying to please the one human being whom she loved to gain one look of real heart kindness from him
If anything like this were hidden beneath the pale bleared eyes and dull washedoutlooking face no one had ever taken the trouble to read its faint signs not the halfclothed furnacetender Wolfe certainly
Yet he was kind to her it was his nature to be kind even to the very rats that swarmed in the cellar kind to her in just the same way
She knew that
And it might be that very knowledge had given to her face its apathy and vacancy more than her low torpid life
One sees that dead vacant look steal sometimes over the rarest finest of womens facesin the very midst it may be of their warmest summers day and then one can guess at the secret of intolerable solitude that lies hid beneath the delicate laces and brilliant smile
There was no warmth no brilliancy no summer for this woman so the stupor and vacancy had time to gnaw into her face perpetually
She was young too though no one guessed it so the gnawing was the fiercer
She lay quiet in the dark corner listening through the monotonous din and uncertain glare of the works to the dull plash of the rain in the far distance shrinking back whenever the man Wolfe happened to look towards her
She knew in spite of all his kindness that there was that in her face and form which made him loathe the sight of her
She felt by instinct although she could not comprehend it the finer nature of the man which made him among his fellowworkmen something unique set apart
She knew that down under all the vileness and coarseness of his life there was a groping passion for whatever was beautiful and pure that his soul sickened with disgust at her deformity even when his words were kindest
Through this dull consciousness which never left her came like a sting the recollection of the dark blue eyes and lithe figure of the little Irish girl she had left in the cellar
The recollection struck through even her stupid intellect with a vivid glow of beauty and of grace
Little Janey timid helpless clinging to Hugh as her only friend that was the sharp thought the bitter thought that drove into the glazed eyes a fierce light of pain
You laugh at it
Are pain and jealousy less savage realities down here in this place I am taking you to than in your own house or your own heartyour heart which they clutch at sometimes
The note is the same I fancy be the octave high or low
If you could go into this mill where Deborah lay and drag out from the hearts of these men the terrible tragedy of their lives taking it as a symptom of the disease of their class no ghost Horror would terrify you more
A reality of soul starvation of living death that meets you every day under the besotted faces on the streetI can paint nothing of this only give you the outside outlines of a night a crisis in the life of one man whatever muddy depth of soulhistory lies beneath you can read according to the eyes God has given you
Wolfe while Deborah watched him as a spaniel its master bent over the furnace with his iron pole unconscious of her scrutiny only stopping to receive orders
Physically Nature had promised the man but little
He had already lost the strength and instinct vigor of a man his muscles were thin his nerves weak his face  a meek womans face haggard yellow with consumption
In the mill he was known as one of the girl men Molly Wolfe was his sobriquet
He was never seen in the cockpit did not own a terrier drank but seldom when he did desperately
He fought sometimes but was always thrashed pommelled to a jelly
The man was game enough when his blood was up but he was no favorite in the mill he had the taint of schoollearning on himnot to a dangerous extent only a quarter or so in the freeschool in fact but enough to ruin him as a good hand in a fight
For other reasons too he was not popular
Not one of themselves they felt that though outwardly as filthy and ash covered silent with foreign thoughts and longings breaking out through his quietness in innumerable curious ways this one for instance
In the neighboring furnacebuildings lay great heaps of the refuse from the ore after the pigmetal is run
Korl we call it here a light porous substance of a delicate waxen fleshcolored tinge
Out of the blocks of this korl Wolfe in his offhours from the furnace had a habit of chipping and moulding figureshideous fantastic enough but sometimes strangely beautiful even the millmen saw that while they jeered at him
It was a curious fancy in the man almost a passion
The few hours for rest he spent hewing and hacking with his blunt knife never speaking until his watch came againworking at one figure for months and when it was finished breaking it to pieces perhaps in a fit of disappointment
A morbid gloomy man untaught unled left to feed his soul in grossness and crime and hard grinding labor
I want you to come down and look at this Wolfe standing there among the lowest of his kind and see him just as he is that you may judge him justly when you hear the story of this night
I want you to look back as he does every day at his birth in vice his starved infancy to remember the heavy years he has groped through as boy and manthe slow heavy years of constant hot work
So long ago he began that he thinks sometimes he has worked there for ages
There is no hope that it will ever end
Think that God put into this mans soul a fierce thirst for beautyto know it to create it to besomething he knows not whatother than he is
There are moments when a passing cloud the sun glinting on the purple thistles a kindly smile a childs face will rouse him to a passion of painwhen his nature starts up with a mad cry of rage against God man whoever it is that has forced this vile slimy life upon him
With all this groping this mad desire a great blind intellect stumbling through wrong a loving poets heart the man was by habit only a coarse vulgar laborer familiar with sights and words you would blush to name
Be just when I tell you about this night see him as he is
Be justnot like mans law which seizes on one isolated fact but like Gods judging angel whose clear sad eye saw all the countless cankering days of this mans life all the countless nights when sick with starving his soul fainted in him before it judged him for this night the saddest of all
I called this night the crisis of his life
If it was it stole on him unawares
These great turningdays of life cast no shadow before slip by unconsciously
Only a trifle a little turn of the rudder and the ship goes to heaven or hell
Wolfe while Deborah watched him dug into the furnace of melting iron with his pole dully thinking only how many rails the lump would yield
It was latenearly Sunday morning another hour and the heavy work would be done only the furnaces to replenish and cover for the next day
The workmen were growing more noisy shouting as they had to do to be heard over the deep clamor of the mills
Suddenly they grew less boisterousat the far end entirely silent
Something unusual had happened
After a moment the silence came nearer the men stopped their jeers and drunken choruses
Deborah stupidly lifting up her head saw the cause of the quiet
A group of five or six men were slowly approaching stopping to examine each furnace as they came
Visitors often came to see the mills after night except by growing less noisy the men took no notice of them
The furnace where Wolfe worked was near the bounds of the works they halted there hot and tired a walk over one of these great foundries is no trifling task
The woman drawing out of sight turned over to sleep
Wolfe seeing them stop suddenly roused from his indifferent stupor and watched them keenly
He knew some of them the overseer Clarkea son of Kirby one of the millownersand a Doctor May one of the townphysicians
The other two were strangers
Wolfe came closer
He seized eagerly every chance that brought him into contact with this mysterious class that shone down on him perpetually with the glamour of another order of being
What made the difference between them
That was the mystery of his life
He had a vague notion that perhaps tonight he could find it out
One of the strangers sat down on a pile of bricks and beckoned young Kirby to his side
This is hot with a vengeance
A match please
lighting his cigar
But the walk is worth the trouble
If it were not that you must have heard it so often Kirby I would tell you that your works look like Dantes Inferno
Kirby laughed
Yes
Yonder is Farinata himself in the burning tomb pointing to some figure in the shimmering shadows
Judging from some of the faces of your men said the other they bid fair to try the reality of Dantes vision some day
Young Kirby looked curiously around as if seeing the faces of his hands for the first time
Theyre bad enough thats true
A desperate set I fancy
Eh Clarke
The overseer did not hear him
He was talking of net profits just thengiving in fact a schedule of the annual business of the firm to a sharp peering little Yankee who jotted down notes on a paper laid on the crown of his hat a reporter for one of the citypapers getting up a series of reviews of the leading manufactories
The other gentlemen had accompanied them merely for amusement
They were silent until the notes were finished drying their feet at the furnaces and sheltering their faces from the intolerable heat
At last the overseer concluded with I believe that is a pretty fair estimate Captain
Here some of you men
said Kirby bring up those boards
We may as well sit down gentlemen until the rain is over
It cannot last much longer at this rate
Pigmetalmumbled the reporterum

hands employed twelve hundredbitumenumall right I believe Mr Clarkesinkingfundwhat did you say was your sinkingfund
Twelve hundred hands
said the stranger the young man who had first spoken
Do you control their votes Kirby
Control
No
The young man smiled complacently
But my father brought seven hundred votes to the polls for his candidate last November
No forcework you understandonly a speech or two a hint to form themselves into a society and a bit of red and blue bunting to make them a flag
The Invincible RoughsI believe that is their name
I forget the motto Our countrys hope I think
There was a laugh
The young man talking to Kirby sat with an amused light in his cool gray eye surveying critically the halfclothed figures of the puddlers and the slow swing of their brawny muscles
He was a stranger in the cityspending a couple of months in the borders of a Slave State to study the institutions of the Southa brotherinlaw of Kirbys Mitchell
He was an amateur gymnasthence his anatomical eye a patron in a blase way of the prizering a man who sucked the essence out of a science or philosophy in an indifferent gentlemanly way who took Kant Novalis Humboldt for what they were worth in his own scales accepting all despising nothing in heaven earth or hell but oneidead men with a temper yielding and brilliant as summer water until his Self was touched when it was ice though brilliant still
Such men are not rare in the States
As he knocked the ashes from his cigar Wolfe caught with a quick pleasure the contour of the white hand the bloodglow of a red ring he wore
His voice too and that of Kirbys touched him like musiclow even with chording cadences
About this man Mitchell hung the impalpable atmosphere belonging to the thoroughbred gentleman Wolfe scraping away the ashes beside him was conscious of it did obeisance to it with his artist sense unconscious that he did so
The rain did not cease
Clarke and the reporter left the mills the others comfortably seated near the furnace lingered smoking and talking in a desultory way
Greek would not have been more unintelligible to the furnacetenders whose presence they soon forgot entirely
Kirby drew out a newspaper from his pocket and read aloud some article which they discussed eagerly
At every sentence Wolfe listened more and more like a dumb hopeless animal with a duller more stolid look creeping over his face glancing now and then at Mitchell marking acutely every smallest sign of refinement then back to himself seeing as in a mirror his filthy body his more stained soul
Never
He had no words for such a thought but he knew now in all the sharpness of the bitter certainty that between them there was a great gulf never to be passed
Never
The bell of the mills rang for midnight
Sunday morning had dawned
Whatever hidden message lay in the tolling bells floated past these men unknown
Yet it was there
Veiled in the solemn music ushering the risen Saviour was a keynote to solve the darkest secrets of a world gone wrongeven this social riddle which the brain of the grimy puddler grappled with madly tonight
The men began to withdraw the metal from the caldrons
The mills were deserted on Sundays except by the hands who fed the fires and those who had no lodgings and slept usually on the ashheaps
The three strangers sat still during the next hour watching the men cover the furnaces laughing now and then at some jest of Kirbys
Do you know said Mitchell I like this view of the works better than when the glare was fiercest
These heavy shadows and the amphitheatre of smothered fires are ghostly unreal
One could fancy these red smouldering lights to be the halfshut eyes of wild beasts and the spectral figures their victims in the den
Kirby laughed
You are fanciful
Come let us get out of the den
The spectral figures as you call them are a little too real for me to fancy a close proximity in the darkness unarmed too
The others rose buttoning their overcoats and lighting cigars
Raining still said Doctor May and hard
Where did we leave the coach Mitchell
At the other side of the worksKirby whats that
Mitchell started back halffrightened as suddenly turning a corner the white figure of a woman faced him in the darkness a woman white of giant proportions crouching on the ground her arms flung out in some wild gesture of warning
Stop
Make that fire burn there
cried Kirby stopping short
The flame burst out flashing the gaunt figure into bold relief
Mitchell drew a long breath
I thought it was alive he said going up curiously
The others followed
Not marble eh
asked Kirby touching it
One of the lower overseers stopped
Korl Sir
Who did it
Cant say
Some of the hands chipped it out in offhours
Chipped to some purpose I should say
What a fleshtint the stuff has
Do you see Mitchell
I see
He had stepped aside where the light fell boldest on the figure looking at it in silence
There was not one line of beauty or grace in it a nude womans form muscular grown coarse with labor the powerful limbs instinct with some one poignant longing
One idea there it was in the tense rigid muscles the clutching hands the wild eager face like that of a starving wolfs
Kirby and Doctor May walked around it critical curious
Mitchell stood aloof silent
The figure touched him strangely
Not badly done said Doctor May Where did the fellow learn that sweep of the muscles in the arm and hand
Look at them
They are gropingdo you seeclutching the peculiar action of a man dying of thirst
They have ample facilities for studying anatomy sneered Kirby glancing at the halfnaked figures
Look continued the Doctor at this bony wrist and the strained sinews of the instep
A workingwomanthe very type of her class
God forbid
muttered Mitchell
Why
demanded May What does the fellow intend by the figure
I cannot catch the meaning
Ask him said the other dryly There he standspointing to Wolfe who stood with a group of men leaning on his ash rake
The Doctor beckoned him with the affable smile which kind hearted men put on when talking to these people
Mr Mitchell has picked you out as the man who did thisIm sure I dont know why
But what did you mean by it
She be hungry
Wolfes eyes answered Mitchell not the Doctor
Ohh
But what a mistake you have made my fine fellow
You have given no sign of starvation to the body
It is strong terribly strong
It has the mad halfdespairing gesture of drowning
Wolfe stammered glanced appealingly at Mitchell who saw the soul of the thing he knew
But the cool probing eyes were turned on himself nowmocking cruel relentless
Not hungry for meat the furnacetender said at last
What then
Whiskey
jeered Kirby with a coarse laugh
Wolfe was silent a moment thinking
I dunno he said with a bewildered look
It mebbe
Summat to make her live I thinklike you
Whiskey ull do it in a way
The young man laughed again
Mitchell flashed a look of disgust somewherenot at Wolfe
May he broke out impatiently are you blind
Look at that womans face
It asks questions of God and says I have a right to know Good God how hungry it is
They looked a moment then May turned to the millowner Have you many such hands as this
What are you going to do with them
Keep them at puddling iron
Kirby shrugged his shoulders
Mitchells look had irritated him
Ce nest pas mon affaire
I have no fancy for nursing infant geniuses
I suppose there are some stray gleams of mind and soul among these wretches
The Lord will take care of his own or else they can work out their own salvation
I have heard you call our American system a ladder which any man can scale
Do you doubt it
Or perhaps you want to banish all social ladders and put us all on a flat tablelandeh May
The Doctor looked vexed puzzled
Some terrible problem lay hid in this womans face and troubled these men
Kirby waited for an answer and receiving none went on warming with his subject
I tell you theres something wrong that no talk of Liberte or Egalite will do away
If I had the making of men these men who do the lowest part of the worlds work should be machinesnothing morehands
It would be kindness
God help them
What are taste reason to creatures who must live such lives as that
He pointed to Deborah sleeping on the ashheap
So many nerves to sting them to pain
What if God had put your brain with all its agony of touch into your fingers and bid you work and strike with that
You think you could govern the world better
laughed the Doctor
I do not think at all
That is true philosophy
Drift with the stream because you cannot dive deep enough to find bottom eh
Exactly rejoined Kirby
I do not think
I wash my hands of all social problemsslavery caste white or black
My duty to my operatives has a narrow limitthe payhour on Saturday night
Outside of that if they cut korl or cut each others throats the more popular amusement of the two I am not responsible
The Doctor sigheda good honest sigh from the depths of his stomach
God help us
Who is responsible
Not I I tell you said Kirby testily
What has the man who pays them money to do with their souls concerns more than the grocer or butcher who takes it
And yet said Mitchells cynical voice look at her
How hungry she is
Kirby tapped his boot with his cane
No one spoke
Only the dumb face of the rough image looking into their faces with the awful question What shall we do to be saved
Only Wolfes face with its heavy weight of brain its weak uncertain mouth its desperate eyes out of which looked the soul of his class only Wolfes face turned towards Kirbys
Mitchell laugheda cool musical laugh
Money has spoken
he said seating himself lightly on a stone with the air of an amused spectator at a play
Are you answered
turning to Wolfe his clear magnetic face
Bright and deep and cold as Arctic air the soul of the man lay tranquil beneath
He looked at the furnacetender as he had looked at a rare mosaic in the morning only the man was the more amusing study of the two
Are you answered
Why May look at him
De profundis clamavi
Or to quote in English Hungry and thirsty his soul faints in him
And so Money sends back its answer into the depths through you Kirby
Very clear the answer tooI think I remember reading the same words somewhere washing your hands in Eau de Cologne and saying I am innocent of the blood of this man
See ye to it
Kirby flushed angrily
You quote Scripture freely
Do I not quote correctly
I think I remember another line which may amend my meaning
Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these ye did it unto me
Deist
Bless you man I was raised on the milk of the Word
Now Doctor the pocket of the world having uttered its voice what has the heart to say
You are a philanthropist in a small Waynest ce pas
Here boy this gentleman can show you how to cut korl better or your destiny
Go on May
I think a mocking devil possesses you tonight rejoined the Doctor seriously
He went to Wolfe and put his hand kindly on his arm
Something of a vague idea possessed the Doctors brain that much good was to be done here by a friendly word or two a latent genius to be warmed into life by a waitedfor sunbeam
Here it was he had brought it
So he went on complacently Do you know boy you have it in you to be a great sculptor a great mando you understand
talking down to the capacity of his hearer it is a way people have with children and men like Wolfeto live a better stronger life than I or Mr Kirby here
A man may make himself anything he chooses
God has given you stronger powers than many menme for instance
May stopped heated glowing with his own magnanimity
And it was magnanimous
The puddler had drunk in every word looking through the Doctors flurry and generous heat and self approval into his will with those slow absorbing eyes of his
Make yourself what you will
It is your right
I know quietly
Will you help me
Mitchell laughed again
The Doctor turned now in a passion You know Mitchell I have not the means
You know if I had it is in my heart to take this boy and educate him for The glory of God and the glory of John May
May did not speak for a moment then controlled he said Why should one be raised when myriads are leftI have not the money boy to Wolfe shortly
Money
He said it over slowly as one repeats the guessed answer to a riddle doubtfully
That is it
Money
Yes moneythat is it said Mitchell rising and drawing his furred coat about him
Youve found the cure for all the worlds diseasesCome May find your goodhumor and come home
This damp wind chills my very bones
Come and preach your SaintSimonian doctrines tomorrow to Kirbys hands
Let them have a clear idea of the rights of the soul and Ill venture next week theyll strike for higher wages
That will be the end of it
Will you send the coachdriver to this side of the mills
asked Kirby turning to Wolfe
He spoke kindly it was his habit to do so
Deborah seeing the puddler go crept after him
The three men waited outside
Doctor May walked up and down chafed
Suddenly he stopped
Go back Mitchell
You say the pocket and the heart of the world speak without meaning to these people
What has its head to say
Taste culture refinement
Go
Mitchell was leaning against a brick wall
He turned his head indolently and looked into the mills
There hung about the place a thick unclean odor
The slightest motion of his hand marked that he perceived it and his insufferable disgust
That was all
May said nothing only quickened his angry tramp
Besides added Mitchell giving a corollary to his answer it would be of no use
I am not one of them
You do not meansaid May facing him
Yes I mean just that
Reform is born of need not pity
No vital movement of the peoples has worked down for good or evil fermented instead carried up the heaving cloggy mass
Think back through history and you will know it
What will this lowest deepthieves Magdalens negroesdo with the light filtered through ponderous Church creeds Baconian theories Goethe schemes
Some day out of their bitter need will be thrown up their own lightbringertheir Jean Paul their Cromwell their Messiah
Bah
was the Doctors inward criticism
However in practice he adopted the theory for when night and morning afterwards he prayed that power might be given these degraded souls to rise he glowed at heart recognizing an accomplished duty
Wolfe and the woman had stood in the shadow of the works as the coach drove off
The Doctor had held out his hand in a frank generous way telling him to take care of himself and to remember it was his right to rise
Mitchell had simply touched his hat as to an equal with a quiet look of thorough recognition
Kirby had thrown Deborah some money which she found and clutched eagerly enough
They were gone now all of them
The man sat down on the cinderroad looking up into the murky sky
T be late Hugh
Wunnot hur come
He shook his head doggedly and the woman crouched out of his sight against the wall
Do you remember rare moments when a sudden light flashed over yourself your world God
when you stood on a mountainpeak seeing your life as it might have been as it is
one quick instant when custom lost its force and everyday usage
when your friend wife brother stood in a new light
your soul was bared and the gravea foretaste of the nakedness of the JudgmentDay
So it came before him his life that night
The slow tides of pain he had borne gathered themselves up and surged against his soul
His squalid daily life the brutal coarseness eating into his brain as the ashes into his skin before these things had been a dull aching into his consciousness tonight they were reality
He griped the filthy red shirt that clung stiff with soot about him and tore it savagely from his arm
The flesh beneath was muddy with grease and ashesand the heart beneath that
And the soul
God knows
Then flashed before his vivid poetic sense the man who had left himthe pure face the delicate sinewy limbs in harmony with all he knew of beauty or truth
In his cloudy fancy he had pictured a Something like this
He had found it in this Mitchell even when he idly scoffed at his pain a Man all knowing allseeing crowned by Nature reigningthe keen glance of his eye falling like a sceptre on other men
And yet his instinct taught him that he tooHe
He looked at himself with sudden loathing sick wrung his hands With a cry and then was silent
With all the phantoms of his heated ignorant fancy Wolfe had not been vague in his ambitions
They were practical slowly built up before him out of his knowledge of what he could do
Through years he had day by day made this hope a real thing to himselfa clear projected figure of himself as he might become
Able to speak to know what was best to raise these men and women working at his side up with him sometimes he forgot this defined hope in the frantic anguish to escape only to escape out of the wet the pain the ashes somewhere anywhereonly for one moment of free air on a hillside to lie down and let his sick soul throb itself out in the sunshine
But tonight he panted for life
The savage strength of his nature was roused his cry was fierce to God for justice
Look at me
he said to Deborah with a low bitter laugh striking his puny chest savagely
What am I worth Deb
Is it my fault that I am no better
My fault
My fault
He stopped stung with a sudden remorse seeing her hunchback shape writhing with sobs
For Deborah was crying thankless tears according to the fashion of women
God forgi me woman
Things go harder Wi you nor me
Its a worse share
He got up and helped her to rise and they went doggedly down the muddy street side by side
Its all wrong he muttered slowlyall wrong
I dunnot understan
But itll end some day
Come home Hugh
she said coaxingly for he had stopped looking around bewildered
Homeand back to the mill
He went on saying this over to himself as if he would mutter down every pain in this dull despair
She followed him through the fog her blue lips chattering with cold
They reached the cellar at last
Old Wolfe had been drinking since she went out and had crept nearer the door
The girl Janey slept heavily in the corner
He went up to her touching softly the worn white arm with his fingers
Some bitterer thought stung him as he stood there
He wiped the drops from his forehead and went into the room beyond livid trembling
A hope trifling perhaps but very dear had died just then out of the poor puddlers life as he looked at the sleeping innocent girlsome plan for the future in which she had borne a part
He gave it up that moment then and forever
Only a trifle perhaps to us his face grew a shade paler that was all
But somehow the mans soul as God and the angels looked down on it never was the same afterwards
Deborah followed him into the inner room
She carried a candle which she placed on the floor closing the door after her
She had seen the look on his face as he turned away her own grew deadly
Yet as she came up to him her eyes glowed
He was seated on an old chest quiet holding his face in his hands
Hugh
she said softly
He did not speak
Hugh did hur hear what the man saidhim with the clear voice
Did hur hear
Money moneythat it wud do all
He pushed her awaygently but he was worn out her rasping tone fretted him
Hugh
The candle flared a pale yellow light over the cobwebbed brick walls and the woman standing there
He looked at her
She was young in deadly earnest her faded eyes and wet ragged figure caught from their frantic eagerness a power akin to beauty
Hugh it is true
Money ull do it
Oh Hugh boy listen till me
He said it true
It is money
I know
Go back
I do not want you here
Hugh it is t last time
Ill never worrit hur again
There were tears in her voice now but she choked them back Hear till me only tonight
If one of t witch people wud come them we heard oft home and gif hur all hur wants what then
Say Hugh
What do you mean
I mean money
Her whisper shrilled through his brain
If one oft witch dwarfs wud come from t lane moors tonight and gif hur money to go outOUT I sayout lad where t sun shines and t heath grows and t ladies walk in silken gownds and God stays all t timewhere tman lives that talked to us tonight Hugh knowsHugh could walk there like a king
He thought the woman mad tried to check her but she went on fierce in her eager haste
If I were t witch dwarf if I had t money wud hur thank me
Wud hur take me out o this place wid hur and Janey
I wud not come into the gran house hur wud build to vex hur wid t hunchonly at night when t shadows were dark stand far off to see hur
Mad
Yes
Are many of us mad in this way
Poor Deb
poor Deb
he said soothingly
It is here she said suddenly jerking into his hand a small roll
I took it
I did it
Me menot hur
I shall be hanged I shall be burnt in hell if anybody knows I took it
Out of his pocket as he leaned against t bricks
Hur knows
She thrust it into his hand and then her errand done began to gather chips together to make a fire choking down hysteric sobs
Has it come to this
That was all he said
The Welsh Wolfe blood was honest
The roll was a small green pocketbook containing one or two gold pieces and a check for an incredible amount as it seemed to the poor puddler
He laid it down hiding his face again in his hands
Hugh dont be angry wud me
Its only poor Debhur knows
He took the long skinny fingers kindly in his
Angry
God help me no
Let me sleep
I am tired
He threw himself heavily down on the wooden bench stunned with pain and weariness
She brought some old rags to cover him
It was late on Sunday evening before he awoke
I tell Gods truth when I say he had then no thought of keeping this money
Deborah had hid it in his pocket
He found it there
She watched him eagerly as he took it out
I must gif it to him he said reading her face
Hur knows she said with a bitter sigh of disappointment
But it is hur right to keep it
His right
The word struck him
Doctor May had used the same
He washed himself and went out to find this man Mitchell
His right
Why did this chance word cling to him so obstinately
Do you hear the fierce devils whisper in his ear as he went slowly down the darkening street
The evening came on slow and calm
He seated himself at the end of an alley leading into one of the larger streets
His brain was clear tonight keen intent mastering
It would not start back cowardly from any hellish temptation but meet it face to face
Therefore the great temptation of his life came to him veiled by no sophistry but bold defiant owning its own vile name trusting to one bold blow for victory
He did not deceive himself
Theft
That was it
At first the word sickened him then he grappled with it
Sitting there on a broken cartwheel the fading day the noisy groups the churchbells tolling passed before him like a panorama while the sharp struggle went on within
This money
He took it out and looked at it
If he gave it back what then
He was going to be cool about it
People going by to church saw only a sickly millboy watching them quietly at the alleys mouth
They did not know that he was mad or they would not have gone by so quietly mad with hunger stretching out his hands to the world that had given so much to them for leave to live the life God meant him to live
His soul within him was smothering to death he wanted so much thought so much and knewnothing
There was nothing of which he was certain except the mill and things there
Of God and heaven he had heard so little that they were to him what fairy land is to a child something real but not here very far off
His brain greedy dwarfed full of thwarted energy and unused powers questioned these men and women going by coldly bitterly that night
Was it not his right to live as theya pure life a good truehearted life full of beauty and kind words
He only wanted to know how to use the strength within him
His heart warmed as he thought of it
He suffered himself to think of it longer
If he took the money
Then he saw himself as he might be strong helpful kindly
The night crept on as this one image slowly evolved itself from the crowd of other thoughts and stood triumphant
He looked at it
As he might be
What wonder if it blinded him to deliriumthe madness that underlies all revolution all progress and all fall
You laugh at the shallow temptation
You see the error underlying its argument so clearlythat to him a true life was one of full development rather than selfrestraint
that he was deaf to the higher tone in a cry of voluntary suffering for truths sake than in the fullest flow of spontaneous harmony
I do not plead his cause
I only want to show you the mote in my brothers eye then you can see clearly to take it out
The moneythere it lay on his knee a little blotted slip of paper nothing in itself used to raise him out of the pit something straight from Gods hand
A thief
Well what was it to be a thief
He met the question at last face to face wiping the clammy drops of sweat from his forehead
God made this moneythe fresh air toofor his childrens use
He never made the difference between poor and rich
The Something who looked down on him that moment through the cool gray sky had a kindly face he knewloved his children alike
Oh he knew that
There were times when the soft floods of color in the crimson and purple flames or the clear depth of amber in the water below the bridge had somehow given him a glimpse of another world than thisof an infinite depth of beauty and of quiet somewheresomewhere a depth of quiet and rest and love
Looking up now it became strangely real
The sun had sunk quite below the hills but his last rays struck upward touching the zenith
The fog had risen and the town and river were steeped in its thick gray damp but overhead the suntouched smokeclouds opened like a cleft oceanshifting rolling seas of crimson mist waves of billowy silver veined with blood scarlet inner depths unfathomable of glancing light
Wolfes artisteye grew drunk with color
The gates of that other world
Fading flashing before him now
What in that world of Beauty Content and Right were the petty laws the mine and thine of millowners and mill hands
A consciousness of power stirred within him
He stood up
A manhe thought stretching out his handsfree to work to live to love
Free
His right
He folded the scrap of paper in his hand
As his nervous fingers took it in limp and blotted so his soul took in the mean temptation lapped it in fancied rights in dreams of improved existences drifting and endless as the cloudseas of color
Clutching it as if the tightness of his hold would strengthen his sense of possession he went aimlessly down the street
It was his watch at the mill
He need not go need never go again thank Godshaking off the thought with unspeakable loathing
Shall I go over the history of the hours of that night
how the man wandered from one to another of his old haunts with a half consciousness of bidding them farewelllanes and alleys and backyards where the millhands lodgednoting with a new eagerness the filth and drunkenness the pigpens the ash heaps covered with potatoskins the bloated pimpled women at the doors with a new disgust a new sense of sudden triumph and under all a new vague dread unknown before smothered down kept under but still there
It left him but once during the night when for the second time in his life he entered a church
It was a sombre Gothic pile where the stained light lost itself in farretreating arches built to meet the requirements and sympathies of a far other class than Wolfes
Yet it touched moved him uncontrollably
The distances the shadows the still marble figures the mass of silent kneeling worshippers the mysterious music thrilled lifted his soul with a wonderful pain
Wolfe forgot himself forgot the new life he was going to live the mean terror gnawing underneath
The voice of the speaker strengthened the charm it was clear feeling full strong
An old man who had lived much suffered much whose brain was keenly alive dominant whose heart was summerwarm with charity
He taught it tonight
He held up Humanity in its grand total showed the great worldcancer to his people
Who could show it better
He was a Christian reformer he had studied the age thoroughly his outlook at man had been free worldwide over all time
His faith stood sublime upon the Rock of Ages his fiery zeal guided vast schemes by which the Gospel was to be preached to all nations
How did he preach it tonight
In burning lightladen words he painted Jesus the incarnate Life Love the universal Man words that became reality in the lives of these peoplethat lived again in beautiful words and actions trifling but heroic
Sin as he defined it was a real foe to them their trials temptations were his
His words passed far over the furnacetenders grasp toned to suit another class of culture they sounded in his ears a very pleasant song in an unknown tongue
He meant to cure this worldcancer with a steady eye that had never glared with hunger and a hand that neither poverty nor strychninewhiskey had taught to shake
In this morbid distorted heart of the Welsh puddler he had failed
Eighteen centuries ago the Master of this man tried reform in the streets of a city as crowded and vile as this and did not fail
His disciple showing Him tonight to cultured hearers showing the clearness of the Godpower acting through Him shrank back from one coarse fact that in birth and habit the man Christ was thrown up from the lowest of the people his flesh their flesh their blood his blood tempted like them to brutalize day by day to lie to steal the actual slime and want of their hourly life and the winepress he trod alone
Yet is there no meaning in this perpetually covered truth
If the son of the carpenter had stood in the church that night as he stood with the fishermen and harlots by the sea of Galilee before His Father and their Father despised and rejected of men without a place to lay His head wounded for their iniquities bruised for their transgressions would not that hungry millboy at least in the back seat have known the man
That Jesus did not stand there
Wolfe rose at last and turned from the church down the street
He looked up the night had come on foggy damp the golden mists had vanished and the sky lay dull and ashcolored
He wandered again aimlessly down the street idly wondering what had become of the cloudsea of crimson and scarlet
The trial day of this mans life was over and he had lost the victory
What followed was mere drifting circumstancea quicker walking over the paththat was all
Do you want to hear the end of it
You wish me to make a tragic story out of it
Why in the policereports of the morning paper you can find a dozen such tragedies hints of shipwrecks unlike any that ever befell on the high seas hints that here a power was lost to heaventhat there a soul went down where no tide can ebb or flow
Commonplace enough the hints arejocose sometimes done up in rhyme
Doctor May a month after the night I have told you of was reading to his wife at breakfast from this fourth column of the morningpaper an unusual thingthese policereports not being in general choice reading for ladies but it was only one item he read
Oh my dear
You remember that man I told you of that we saw at Kirbys millthat was arrested for robbing Mitchell
Here he is just listenCircuit Court
Judge Day
Hugh Wolfe operative in Kirby  Johns Loudon Mills
Charge grand larceny
Sentence nineteen years hard labor in penitentiary
Scoundrel
Serves him right
After all our kindness that night
Picking Mitchells pocket at the very time
His wife said something about the ingratitude of that kind of people and then they began to talk of something else
Nineteen years
How easy that was to read
What a simple word for Judge Day to utter
Nineteen years
Half a lifetime
Hugh Wolfe sat on the windowledge of his cell looking out
His ankles Were ironed
Not usual in such cases but he had made two desperate efforts to escape
Well as Haley the jailer said small blame to him
Nineteen years inprisonment was not a pleasant thing to look forward to
Haley was very goodnatured about it though Wolfe had fought him savagely
When he was first caught the jailer said afterwards in telling the story before the trial the fellow was cut down at oncelaid there on that pallet like a dead man with his hands over his eyes
Never saw a man so cut down in my life
Time of the trial too came the queerest dodge of any customer I ever had
Would choose no lawyer
Judge gave him one of course
Gibson it Was
He tried to prove the fellow crazy but it wouldnt go
Thing was plain as daylight money found on him
T was a hard sentenceall the law allows but it was for xamples sake
These millhands are gettin onbearable
When the sentence was read he just looked up and said the money was his by rights and that all the world had gone wrong
That night after the trial a gentleman came to see him here name of Mitchellhim as he stole from
Talked to him for an hour
Thought he came for curiosity like
After he was gone thought Wolfe was remarkable quiet and went into his cell
Found him very low bed all bloody
Doctor said he had been bleeding at the lungs
He was as weak as a cat yet if yell blieve me he tried to get apast me and get out
I just carried him like a baby and threw him on the pallet
Three days after he tried it again that time reached the wall
Lord help you
he fought like a tigergiv some terrible blows
Fightin for life you see for he cant live long shut up in the stone crib down yonder
Got a deathcough now
T took two of us to bring him down that day so I just put the irons on his feet
There he sits in there
Goin tomorrow with a batch more of em
That woman hunchback tried with himyou remembershes only got three years
Complice
But shes a woman you know
Hes been quiet ever since I put on irons giv up I suppose
Looks white sicklookin
It acts different on em bein sentenced
Most of em gets reckless devilishlike
Some prays awful and sings them vile songs of the mills all in a breath
That woman now shes despert
Been beggin to see Hugh as she calls him for three days
Im agoin to let her in
She dont go with him
Here she is in this next cell
Im agoin now to let her in
He let her in
Wolfe did not see her
She crept into a corner of the cell and stood watching him
He was scratching the iron bars of the window with a piece of tin which he had picked up with an idle uncertain vacant stare just as a child or idiot would do
Tryin to get out old boy
laughed Haley
Them irons will need a crowbar beside your tin before you can open em
Wolfe laughed too in a senseless way
I think Ill get out he said
I believe his brains touched said Haley when he came out
The puddler scraped away with the tin for half an hour
Still Deborah did not speak
At last she ventured nearer and touched his arm
Blood
she said looking at some spots on his coat with a shudder
He looked up at her Why Deb
he said smilingsuch a bright boyish smile that it Went to poor Deborahs heart directly and she sobbed and cried out loud
Oh Hugh lad
Hugh
dunnot look at me when it wur my fault
To think I brought hur to it
And I loved hur so
Oh lad I dud
The confession even In this wretch came with the womans blush through the sharp cry
He did not seem to hear herscraping away diligently at the bars with the bit of tin
Was he going mad
She peered closely into his face
Something she saw there made her draw suddenly backsomething which Haley had not seen that lay beneath the pinched vacant look it had caught since the trial or the curious gray shadow that rested on it
That gray shadowyes she knew what that meant
She had often seen it creeping over womens faces for months who died at last of slow hunger or consumption
That meant death distant lingering but thisWhatever it was the woman saw or thought she saw used as she was to crime and misery seemed to make her sick with a new horror
Forgetting her fear of him she caught his shoulders and looked keenly steadily into his eyes
Hugh
she cried in a desperate whisperoh boy not that
for Gods sake not that
The vacant laugh went off his face and he answered her in a muttered word or two that drove her away
Yet the words were kindly enough
Sitting there on his pallet she cried silently a hopeless sort of tears but did not speak again
The man looked up furtively at her now and then
Whatever his own trouble was her distress vexed him with a momentary sting
It was marketday
The narrow window of the jail looked down directly on the carts and wagons drawn up in a long line where they had unloaded
He could see too and hear distinctly the clink of money as it changed hands the busy crowd of whites and blacks shoving pushing one another and the chaffering and swearing at the stalls
Somehow the sound more than anything else had done wakened him upmade the whole real to him
He was done with the world and the business of it
He let the tin fall and looked out pressing his face close to the rusty bars
How they crowded and pushed
And hehe should never walk that pavement again
There came Neff Sanders one of the feeders at the mill with a basket on his arm
Sure enough Nyeff was married the other week
He whistled hoping he would look up but he did not
He wondered if Neff remembered he was there if any of the boys thought of him up there and thought that he never was to go down that old cinderroad again
Never again
He had not quite understood it before but now he did
Not for days or years but neverthat was it
How clear the light fell on that stall in front of the market
and how like a picture it was the darkgreen heaps of corn and the crimson beets and golden melons
There was another with game how the light flickered on that pheasants breast with the purplish blood dripping over the brown feathers
He could see the red shining of the drops it was so near
In one minute he could be down there
It was just a step
So easy as it seemed so natural to go
Yet it could never benot in all the thousands of years to comethat he should put his foot on that street again
He thought of himself with a sorrowful pity as of some one else
There was a dog down in the market walking after his master with such a stately grave lookonly a dog yet he could go backwards and forwards just as he pleased he had good luck
Why the very vilest cur yelping there in the gutter had not lived his life had been free to act out whatever thought God had put into his brain while heNo he would not think of that
He tried to put the thought away and to listen to a dispute between a countryman and a woman about some meat but it would come back
He what had he done to bear this
Then came the sudden picture of what might have been and now
He knew what it was to be in the penitentiary how it went with men there
He knew how in these long years he should slowly die but not until soul and body had become corrupt and rottenhow when he came out if he lived to come even the lowest of the millhands would jeer himhow his hands would be weak and his brain senseless and stupid
He believed he was almost that now
He put his hand to his head with a puzzled weary look
It ached his head with thinking
He tried to quiet himself
It was only right perhaps he had done wrong
But was there right or wrong for such as he
What was right
And who had ever taught him
He thrust the whole matter away
A dark cold quiet crept through his brain
It was all wrong but let it be
It was nothing to him more than the others
Let it be
The door grated as Haley opened it
Come my woman
Must lock up for t night
Come stir yerself
She went up and took Hughs hand
Goodnight Deb he said carelessly
She had not hoped he would say more but the tired pain on her mouth just then was bitterer than death
She took his passive hand and kissed it
Hurll never see Deb again
she ventured her lips growing colder and more bloodless
What did she say that for
Did he not know it
Yet he would not be impatient with poor old Deb
She had trouble of her own as well as he
No never again he said trying to be cheerful
She stood just a moment looking at him
Do you laugh at her standing there with her hunchback her rags her bleared withered face and the great despised love tugging at her heart
Come you
called Haley impatiently
She did not move
Hugh
she whispered
It was to be her last word
What was it
Hugh boy not THAT
He did not answer
She wrung her hands trying to be silent looking in his face in an agony of entreaty
He smiled again kindly
It is best Deb
I cannot bear to be hurted any more
Hur knows she said humbly
Tell my father goodbye andand kiss little Janey
She nodded saying nothing looked in his face again and went out of the door
As she went she staggered
Drinkin today
broke out Haley pushing her before him
Where the Devil did you get it
Here in with ye
and he shoved her into her cell next to Wolfes and shut the door
Along the wall of her cell there was a crack low down by the floor through which she could see the light from Wolfes
She had discovered it days before
She hurried in now and kneeling down by it listened hoping to hear some sound
Nothing but the rasping of the tin on the bars
He was at his old amusement again
Something in the noise jarred on her ear for she shivered as she heard it
Hugh rasped away at the bars
A dull old bit of tin not fit to cut korl with
He looked out of the window again
People were leaving the market now
A tall mulatto girl following her mistress her basket on her head crossed the street just below and looked up
She was laughing but when she caught sight of the haggard face peering out through the bars suddenly grew grave and hurried by
A free firm step a clearcut olive face with a scarlet turban tied on one side dark shining eyes and on the head the basket poised filled with fruit and flowers under which the scarlet turban and bright eyes looked out half shadowed
The picture caught his eye
It was good to see a face like that
He would try tomorrow and cut one like it
Tomorrow
He threw down the tin trembling and covered his face with his hands
When he looked up again the daylight was gone
Deborah crouching near by on the other side of the wall heard no noise
He sat on the side of the low pallet thinking
Whatever was the mystery which the woman had seen on his face it came out now slowly in the dark there and became fixeda something never seen on his face before
The evening was darkening fast
The market had been over for an hour the rumbling of the carts over the pavement grew more infrequent he listened to each as it passed because he thought it was to be for the last time
For the same reason it was I suppose that he strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of each passerby wondering who they were what kind of homes they were going to if they had childrenlistening eagerly to every chance word in the street as ifGod be merciful to the man
what strange fancy was this
as if he never should hear human voices again
It was quite dark at last
The street was a lonely one
The last passenger he thought was gone
Nothere was a quick step Joe Hill lighting the lamps
Joe was a good old chap never passed a fellow without some joke or other
He remembered once seeing the place where he lived with his wife
Granny Hill the boys called her
Bedridden she Was but so kind as Joe was to her
kept the room so cleanand the old woman when he was there was laughing at some of t lads foolishness
The step was far down the street but he could see him place the ladder run up and light the gas
A longing seized him to be spoken to once more
Joe
he called out of the grating
Goodbye Joe
The old man stopped a moment listening uncertainly then hurried on
The prisoner thrust his hand out of the window and called again louder but Joe was too far down the street
It was a little thing but it hurt himthis disappointment
Goodbye Joe
he called sorrowfully enough
Be quiet
said one of the jailers passing the door striking on it with his club
Oh that was the last was it
There was an inexpressible bitterness on his face as he lay down on the bed taking the bit of tin which he had rasped to a tolerable degree of sharpness in his handto play with it may be
He bared his arms looking intently at their corded veins and sinews
Deborah listening in the next cell heard a slight clicking sound often repeated
She shut her lips tightly that she might not scream the cold drops of sweat broke over her in her dumb agony
Hur knows best she muttered at last fiercely clutching the boards where she lay
If she could have seen Wolfe there was nothing about him to frighten her
He lay quite still his arms outstretched looking at the pearly stream of moonlight coming into the window
I think in that one hour that came then he lived back over all the years that had gone before
I think that all the low vile life all his wrongs all his starved hopes came then and stung him with a farewell poison that made him sick unto death
He made neither moan nor cry only turned his worn face now and then to the pure light that seemed so far off as one that said How long O Lord
how long
The hour was over at last
The moon passing over her nightly path slowly came nearer and threw the light across his bed on his feet
He watched it steadily as it crept up inch by inch slowly
It seemed to him to carry with it a great silence
He had been so hot and tired there always in the mills
The years had been so fierce and cruel
There was coming now quiet and coolness and sleep
His tense limbs relaxed and settled in a calm languor
The blood ran fainter and slow from his heart
He did not think now with a savage anger of what might be and was not he was conscious only of deep stillness creeping over him
At first he saw a sea of faces the millmenwomen he had known drunken and bloatedJaneys timid and pitifulpoor old Debs then they floated together like a mist and faded away leaving only the clear pearly moonlight
Whether as the pure light crept up the stretchedout figure it brought with It calm and peace who shall say
His dumb soul was alone with God in judgment
A Voice may have spoken for it from faroff Calvary Father forgive them for they know not what they do
Who dare say
Fainter and fainter the heart rose and fell slower and slower the moon floated from behind a cloud until when at last its full tide of white splendor swept over the cell it seemed to wrap and fold into a deeper stillness the dead figure that never should move again
Silence deeper than the Night
Nothing that moved save the black nauseous stream of blood dripping slowly from the pallet to the floor
There was outcry and crowd enough in the cell the next day
The coroner and his jury the local editors Kirby himself and boys with their hands thrust knowingly into their pockets and heads on one side jammed into the corners
Coming and going all day
Only one woman
She came late and outstayed them all
A Quaker or Friend as they call themselves
I think this woman Was known by that name in heaven
A homely body coarsely dressed in gray and white
Deborah for Haley had let her in took notice of her
She watched them allsitting on the end of the pallet holding his head in her arms with the ferocity of a watchdog if any of them touched the body
There was no meekness no sorrow in her face the stuff out of which murderers are made instead
All the time Haley and the woman were laying straight the limbs and cleaning the cell Deborah sat still keenly watching the Quakers face
Of all the crowd there that day this woman alone had not spoken to heronly once or twice had put some cordial to her lips
After they all were gone the woman in the same still gentle way brought a vase of woodleaves and berries and placed it by the pallet then opened the narrow window
The fresh air blew in and swept the woody fragrance over the dead face Deborah looked up with a quick wonder
Did hur know my boy wud like it
Did hur know Hugh
I know Hugh now
The white fingers passed in a slow pitiful way over the dead worn face
There was a heavy shadow in the quiet eyes
Did hur know where theyll bury Hugh
said Deborah in a shrill tone catching her arm
This had been the question hanging on her lips all day
In t townyard
Under t mud and ash
T ladll smother woman
He wur born in t lane moor where t air is frick and strong
Take hur out for Gods sake take hur out where t air blows
The Quaker hesitated but only for a moment
She put her strong arm around Deborah and led her to the window
Thee sees the hills friend over the river
Thee sees how the light lies warm there and the winds of God blow all the day
I live therewhere the blue smoke is by the trees
Look at me She turned Deborahs face to her own clear and earnest Thee will believe me
I will take Hugh and bury him there to morrow
Deborah did not doubt her
As the evening wore on she leaned against the iron bars looking at the hills that rose far off through the thick sodden clouds like a bright unattainable calm
As she looked a shadow of their solemn repose fell on her face its fierce discontent faded into a pitiful humble quiet
Slow solemn tears gathered in her eyes the poor weak eyes turned so hopelessly to the place where Hugh was to rest the grave heights looking higher and brighter and more solemn than ever before
The Quaker watched her keenly
She came to her at last and touched her arm
When thee comes back she said in a low sorrowful tone like one who speaks from a strong heart deeply moved with remorse or pity thee shall begin thy life againthere on the hills
I came too late but not for theeby Gods help it may be
Not too late
Three years after the Quaker began her work
I end my story here
At eveningtime it was light
There is no need to tire you with the long years of sunshine and fresh air and slow patient Christlove needed to make healthy and hopeful this impure body and soul
There is a homely pine house on one of these hills whose windows overlook broad wooded slopes and clovercrimsoned meadowsniched into the very place where the light is warmest the air freest
It is the Friends meetinghouse
Once a week they sit there in their grave earnest way waiting for the Spirit of Love to speak opening their simple hearts to receive His words
There is a woman old deformed who takes a humble place among them waiting like them in her gray dress her worn face pure and meek turned now and then to the sky
A woman much loved by these silent resfful people more silent than they more humble more loving
Waiting with her eyes turned to hills higher and purer than these on which she livesdim and far off now but to be reached some day
There may be in her heart some latent hope to meet there the love denied her herethat she shall find him whom she lost and that then she will not be all unworthy
Who blames her
Something is lost in the passage of every soul from one eternity to the othersomething pure and beautiful which might have been and was not a hope a talent a love over which the soul mourns like Esau deprived of his birthright
What blame to the meek Quaker if she took her lost hope to make the hills of heaven more fair
Nothing remains to tell that the poor Welsh puddler once lived but this figure of the millwoman cut in korl
I have it here in a corner of my library
I keep it hid behind a curtainit is such a rough ungainly thing
Yet there are about it touches grand sweeps of outline that show a masters hand
Sometimestonight for instancethe curtain is accidentally drawn back and I see a bare arm stretched out imploringly in the darkness and an eager wolfish face watching mine a wan woful face through which the spirit of the dead korlcutter looks out with its thwarted life its mighty hunger its unfinished work
Its pale vague lips seem to tremble with a terrible question
Is this the End
they saynothing beyond
no more
Why you tell me you have seen that look in the eyes of dumb bruteshorses dying under the lash
I know
The deep of the night is passing while I write
The gaslight wakens from the shadows here and there the objects which lie scattered through the room only faintly though for they belong to the open sunlight
As I glance at them they each recall some task or pleasure of the coming day
A halfmoulded childs head Aphrodite a bough of forestleaves music work homely fragments in which lie the secrets of all eternal truth and beauty
Prophetic all
Only this dumb woful face seems to belong to and end with the night
I turn to look at it
Has the power of its desperate need commanded the darkness away
While the room is yet steeped in heavy shadow a cool gray light suddenly touches its head like a blessing hand and its groping arm points through the broken cloud to the far East where in the flickering nebulous crimson God has set the promise of the Dawn
