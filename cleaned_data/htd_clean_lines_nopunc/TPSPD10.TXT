With the world with his acquaintances and neighbors with his wife and son and daughter he passed as a generous warmhearted goodnatured man ready at all times to do anything to help anybody incapable of envy or hatred or meanness
In fact not once in all his days had he ever thought or done a single thing except for his own comfort
Like all intensely selfish people who are wise he was cheerful and amiable because that was the way to be healthy and happy and to have those around one agreeable and in the mood to do what one wished them to do
He told people not the truth not the unpleasant thing that might help them but what they wished to hear
His family lived in luxurious comfort only because he himself was fond of luxurious comfort
His wife and his daughter dressed fashionably and went about and entertained in the fashionable expensive way only because that was the sort of life that gratified his vanity
He lived to get what he wanted he got it every day and every hour of a life into which no rain ever fell he died honored respected beloved and lamented
The clever trick he had played upon his fellow beings came very near to discovery a few days after his death
His widow and her son and daughterinlaw and daughter were in the livingroom of the charming house at Hanging Rock near New York alternating between sorrowings over the dead man and plannings for the future
Said the widow If Henry had only thought what would become of us if he were taken away
If he had saved even a small part of what he made every year from the time he was twentysixfor he always made a big income said his son Frank
But he was so generous so softhearted
exclaimed the widow
He could deny us nothing
He couldnt bear seeing us with the slightest wish ungratified said Frank
He was the best father that ever lived
cried the daughter Mildred
And Mrs Gower the elder and Mrs Gower the younger wept and Mildred turned away to hide the emotion distorting her face and Frank stared gloomily at the carpet and sighed
The hideous secret of the life of duplicity was safe safe forever
In fact Henry Gower had often thought of the fate of his family if he should die
In the first year of his married life at a time when passion for a beautiful bride was almost sweeping him into generous thought he had listened for upward of an hour to the eloquence of a life insurance agent
Then the agent misled by Gowers effusively generous and unselfish expressions had taken a false tack
He had descanted upon the supreme satisfaction that would be felt by a dying man as he reflected how his young widow would be left in affluence
He made a vivid picture Gower saw saw his bride happier after his death than she had been during his life and attracting a swarm of admirers by her beauty well set off in becoming black and by her independent income
The generous impulse then and there shriveled to its weak and shallow roots
With tears in his kind clear eyes he thanked the agent and said You have convinced me
You need say no more
Ill send for you in a few days
The agent never got into his presence again
Gower lived up to his income secure in the knowledge that his ability as a lawyer made him certain of plenty of money as long as he should live
But it would show an utter lack of comprehension of his peculiar species of character to imagine that he let himself into the secret of his own icyheartedness by ceasing to think of the problem of his wife and two children without him to take care of them
On the contrary he thought of it every day and planned what he would do about ittomorrow
And for his delay he had excellent convincing excuses
Did he not take care of his naturally robust health
Would he not certainly out live his wife who was always doctoring more or less
Frank would be able to take care of himself anyhow it was not well to bring a boy up to expectations because every man should be selfsupporting and self reliant
As for Mildred why with her beauty and her cleverness she could not but make a brilliant marriage
Really there was for him no problem of an orphaned familys future there was no reason why he should deny himself any comfort or luxury or his vanity any of the titillations that come from social display
That one of his calculations which was the most vital and seemed the surest proved to be worthless
It is not the weaklings who die after infancy and youth but the strong healthy men and women
The weaklings have to look out for themselves receive ample warning in the disastrous obvious effects of the slightest imprudence
The robust even the wariest of them even the Henry Gowers overestimate and overtax their strength
Gowers downfall was champagne
He could not resist a bottle of it for dinner every night
As so often happens the collapse of the kidneys came without any warning that a man of powerful constitution would deem worthy of notice
By the time the doctor began to suspect the gravity of his trouble he was too far gone
Frank candidly greedy and selfishSuch a contrast to his father
everyone saidwas married to the prettiest girl in Hanging Rock and had a satisfactory law practice in New York
His income was about fifteen thousand a year
But his wife had tastes as extravagant as his own and Hanging Rock is one of those suburbs of New York where gather welltodo middleclass people to live luxuriously and to delude each other and themselves with the notion that they are fashionable rich New Yorkers who prefer to live in the country like the English
Thus Henry Gowers widow and daughter could count on little help from Frankand they knew it
You and Milly will have to move to some less expensive place than Hanging Rock said Frankit was the livingroom conference a few days after the funeral
Mildred flushed and her eyes flashed
She opened her lips to speakclosed them again with the angry retort unuttered
After all Frank was her mothers and her sole dependence
They could hope for little from him but nothing must be said that would give him and his mean selfish wife a chance to break with them and refuse to do anything whatever
And Mildred must get married said Natalie
In Hanging Rock most of the girls and many of the boys had given names taken from Burkes Peerage the Almanac de Gotha and fashionable novels
Again Mildred flushed but her eyes did not flash neither did she open her lips to speak
The little remark of her sisterinlaw apparently so harmless and sensible was in fact a poisoned arrow
For Mildred was twentythree had been out five years and was not even in the way to become engaged
She and everyone had assumed from her lovely babyhood that she would marry splendidly would marry wealth and social position
How could it be otherwise
Had she not beauty
Had she not family and position
Had she not style and cleverness
Yetfive years out and not a serious proposal
An impudent poor fellow with no prospects had asked her
An impudent rich man from fashionable New York had hung after her and had presently abandoned whatever dark projects he may have been concealing and had married in his own set as they always do the miserable snobs raved Mrs Gower who had been building high upon those lavish outpourings of candy flowers and automobile rides
Mildred however had accepted the defection more philosophically
She had had enough vanity to like the attentions of the rich and fashionable New Yorker enough good sense to suspect perhaps not definitely what those attentions meant but certainly what they did not mean
Also in the back of her head had been an intention to refuse Stanley Baird if by chance he should ask her
Was there any substance to this intention sprung from her disliking the conceited selfassured snob as much as she liked his wealth and station
Perhaps not
Who can say
At any rate may we not claim credit for our good intentionsso long as even through lack of opportunity we have not stultified them
With every natural advantage apparently Mildreds failure to catch a husband seemed to be somehow her own fault
Other girls less endowed than she were marrying were marrying fairly well
Why then was Mildred lagging in the market
There may have been other reasons reasons of accidentfor in the higher class matrimonial market few are called and fewer chosen
There was one reason not accidental Hanging Rock was no place for a girl so superior as was Mildred Gower to find a fitting husband
As has been hinted Hanging Rock was one of those uppermiddleclass colonies where splurge and social ambition dominate the community life
In such colonies the young men are of two classesthose beneath such a girl as Mildred and those who had the looks the manners the intelligence and the prospects to justify them in looking higher sociallyin looking among the very rich and really fashionable
In the Hanging Rock sort of community having all the snobbishness of Fifth Avenue Back Bay and Rittenhouse Square with the added torment of the snobbishness being perpetually ungratifiedin such communities beneath a surface reeking culture and idealistic folderol there is a coarse and brutal materialism a passion for money for luxury for display that equals aristocratic societies at their worst
No one can live for a winter much less grow up in such a place without becoming saturated with sycophantry
Thus only by some impossible combination of chances could there have been at Hanging Rock a young man who would have appreciated Mildred and have had the courage of his appreciation
This combination did not happen
In Mildreds generation and set there were only the two classes of men noted above
The men of the one of them which could not have attracted her accepted their fate of mating with secondchoice females to whom they were themselves second choice
The men of the other class rarely appeared at Hanging Rock functions hung about the rich people in New York Newport and on Long Island and would as soon have thought of taking a Hanging Rock society girl to wife as of exchanging hundreddollar bills for twentyfivecent pieces
Having attractions acceptable in the best markets they took them there
Hanging Rock denounced them as snobs for Hanging Rock was virtuously eloquent on the subject of snobbishnesswe human creatures being never so effective as when assailing in others the vice or weakness we know from lifelong intimate internal association with it
But secretly the successfully ambitious spurners of that suburban society were approved were envied
And Hanging Rock was most gracious to them whenever it got the chance
In her five years of social life Mildred had gone only with the various classes of fashionable people had therefore known only the men who are full of the poison of snobbishness
She had been born and bred in an environment as impregnated with that poison as the air of a kitchengarden with onions
She knew nothing else
The secret intention to refuse Stanley Baird should he propose was therefore the more astonishingand the more significant
From time to time in any given environment you will find some isolated person some personality with a trait wholly foreign and out of place there
Now it is a soft voice and courteous manners in a slum again it is a longing for a life of freedom and equality in a member of a royal family that has known nothing but sordid slavery for centuries
Or in the petty conventionality of a prosperous middle or upperclass community you come upon one who dreamsperhaps vaguely but still longinglyof an existence where love and ideas shall elevate and glorify life
In spite of her training in spite of the teaching and example of all about her from the moment of her opening her eyes upon the world Mildred Gower at twentythree still retained something of these dream flowers sown in the soil of her naturally good mind by some book or play or perhaps by some casually read and soon forgotten article in magazine or newspaper
We have the habit of thinking only weeds produce seeds that penetrate and prosper everywhere and anywhere
The truth is that fine plants of all kinds vegetable fruit and flower of rarest color and perfume have this same hardiness and fecundity
Pull away at the weeds in your garden for a while and see if this is not so
Though you may plant nothing you will be amazed at the results if you but clear a little space of its weedswhich you have been planting and cultivating
Mildredwoman fashionregarded it as a reproach upon her that she had not yet succeeded in making the marriage everyone including herself predicted for her and expected of her
On the contrary it was the most savage indictment possible of the marriageable and marrying men who had met herof their stupidity of their shortsighted and meansouled calculation of their lack of couragethe courage to take what they as men of flesh and blood wanted instead of what their snobbishness ordered
And if Stanley Baird the nearest to a fleshandblood man of any who had known her had not been so profoundly afraid of his fashionable mother and of his sister the Countess of Waring But he was profoundly afraid of them so it is idle to speculate about him
What did men see when they looked at Mildred Gower
Usually when men look at a woman they have a hazy either pleasant or unpleasant sense of something feminine
That and nothing more
Afterward through some whim or some thrust from chance they may see in her or fancy they see in her the thing feminine that their soulsit is always soulmost yearns after
But just at first glance so colorless or conventionally colored is the usual human being the average womanindeed every woman but she who is exceptionalcreates upon man the mere impression of pleasant or unpleasant petticoats
In the exceptional woman something obtrudes
She has astonishing hair or extraordinary eyes or a mouth that seems to draw a man like a magnet or it is the allure of a peculiar smile or of a figure whose sinuosities as she moves seem to cause a corresponding wavedisturbance in masculine nerves
Further the possession of one of these signal charms usually causes all her charms to have more than ordinary potency
The sight of the man is so bewitched by the one potent charm that he sees the whole woman under a spell
Mildred Gower of the medium height and of a slender and wellformed figure had a face of the kind that is called lovely and her smile sweet dreamy revealing white and even teeth gave her loveliness delicate animation
She had an abundance of hair neither light nor dark she had a fine clear skin
Her eyes gray and rather serious and well set under long straight brows gave her a look of honesty and intelligence
But the charm that won men her charm of charms was her mouthmobile slightly pouted not too narrow of a wonderful vividly healthy and vital red
She had beauty she had intelligence
But it was impossible for a man to think of either once his glance had been caught by those expressive inviting lips of hers so young so fresh with their everchanging ever fascinating line expressing in a thousand ways the passion and poetry of the kiss
Of all the men who had admired her and had edged away because they feared she would bewitch them into forgetting what the world calls good common sense of all those men only one had suspected the real reason for her physical power over men
All but Stanley Baird had thought themselves attracted because she was so pretty or so stylish or so clever and amusing to talk with
Baird had lived intelligently enough to learn that feminine charm is never general is always specific
He knew it was Mildred Gowers lips that haunted that frightened ambitious men away that sent men who knew they hadnt a ghost of a chance with her discontentedly back to the secondchoice women who alone were available for them
Fortunately for Mildred Stanley Baird too wise to flatter a woman discriminatingly did not tell her the secret of her fascination
If he had told her she would no doubt have tried to train and to use itand so would inevitably have lost it
To go on with that important conference in the sittingroom in the handsome roomy house of the Gowers at Hanging Rock Frank Gower eagerly seized upon his wifes subtly nasty remark
I dont see why in thunder you havent married Milly said he
Youve had every chance these last four or five years
And itll be harder now moaned her mother
For it looks as though we were going to be wretchedly poor
And poverty is so repulsive
Do you think said Mildred that giving me the idea that I must marry right away will make it easier for me to marry
Everyone who knows us knows our circumstances
She looked significantly at Franks wife who had been wailing through Hanging Rock the woeful plight of her dead fatherinlaws family
The young Mrs Gower blushed and glanced away
And Mildred went on everyone is saying that I must marry at oncethat theres nothing else for me to do
She smiled bitterly
When I go into the street again I shall see nothing but flying men
And no man would come to call unless he brought a chaperon and a witness with him
How can you be so frivolous
reproached her mother
Mildred was used to being misunderstood by her mother who had long since been made hopelessly dull by the suffocating life she led and by pain from her feet which never left her at ease for a moment except when she had them soaking in cold water
Mrs Gower had been born with ordinary feet neither ugly nor pretty and entirely fit for the uses for which nature intended feet
She had spoiled them by wearing shoes to make them look smaller and slimmer than they were
In steady weather she was plaintive in changeable weather she varied between irritable and violent
Said Mildred to her brother How muchJUST how much is there
I cant say exactly replied her brother who had not yet solved to his satisfaction the moral problem of how much of the estate he ought to allow his mother and sister and how much he ought to claim for himself in such a way that the claim could not be disputed
Mildred looked fixedly at him
He showed his uneasiness not by glancing away but by the appearance of a certain hard defiance in his eyes
Said she What is the very most we can hope for
A silence
Her mother broke it
Mildred how CAN you talk of those thingsalready
I dont know replied Mildred
Perhaps because its got to be done
This seemed to them alland to herselfa lame excuse for such apparent hardness of heart
Her father had always been SENDERHEARTEDHAD NEVER SPOKEN OF MONEY OR ENCOURAGED HIS FAMILY IN SPEAKING OF IT
A LONG AND PAINFUL SILENCE
THEN THE WIDOW ABRUPTLY YOURE SURE Frank theres NO insurance
Father always said that you disliked the idea replied her son that you thought insurance looked like your calculating on his death
Under her husbands adroit prompting Mrs Gower had discovered such a view of insurance in her brain
She now recalled expressing itand regretted
But she was silenced
She tried to take her mind of the sub ject of money
But like Mildred she could not
The thought of imminent poverty was nagging at them like toothache
Therell be enough for a year or so
she said timidly interrogative
I hope so said Frank
Mildred was eying him fixedly again
Said she Have you found anything at all
He had about eight thousand dollars in bank said Frank
But most of it will go for the pressing debts
But how did HE expect to live
urged Mildred
Yes there must have been SOMETHING said her mother
Of course theres his share of the unsettled and unfinished business of the firm admitted Frank
How much will that be
persisted Mildred
I cant tell offhand said Frank with virtuous reproach
My minds been onother things
Henry Gowers widow was not without her share of instinctive shrewdness
Neither had she unobservant though she was been within sight of her sons character for twentyeight years without having unconfessed unformed misgivings concerning it
You mustnt bother about these things now Frank dear said she
Ill get my brother to look into it
That wont be necessary hastily said Frank
I dont want any rival lawyer peeping into our firms affairs
My brother Wharton is the soul of honor said Mrs Gower the elder with dignity
You are too young to take all the responsibility of settling the estate
Yes Ill send for Wharton tomorrow
Itll look as though you didnt trust me said Frank sourly
We mustnt do anything to start the gossips in this town said his wife assisting
Then send for him yourself Frank said Mildred and give him charge of the whole matter
Frank eyed her furiously
How ashamed father would be
exclaimed he
But this solemn invoking of the dead mans spirit was uneffectual
The specter of poverty was too insistent too terrible
Said the widow Im sure in the circumstances my dear dead husband would want me to get help from someone older and more experienced
And Frank guilty of conscience and an expert in the ways of conventional and highly moral rascality ceased to resist
His wife scenting danger to their getting the share that rightfully belongs to the son especially when he has been the brains of the firm for several years made angry and indiscreet battle for no outside interference
The longer she talked the firmer the widow and the daughter became not only because she clarified suspicions that had been too hazy to take form but also because they disliked her intensely
The following day Wharton Conover became unofficial administrator
He had no difficulty in baffling Frank Gowers halfhearted and clumsy efforts to hide two large fees due the dead mans estate
He discovered clear assets amounting in all to sixty three thousand dollars most of it available within a few months
As you have the goodwill of the firm and as your mother and sister have only what can be realized in cash said he to Frank no doubt you wont insist on your third
Ive got to consider my wife said Frank
I cant do as Id like
You are going to insist on your third
said Conover with an accent that made Frank quiver
I cant do otherwise said he in a dogged shamed way
Um said Conover
Then on behalf of my sister and her daughter Ill have to insist on a more detailed accounting than you have been willing to give and on the production of that small book bound in red leather which disappeared from my brotherinlaws desk the afternoon of his death
A wave of rage and fear surged up within Frank Gower and crashed against the seat of his life
For days thereafter he was from time to time seized with violent spasms of trembling years afterward he was attributing premature weaknesses of old age to the effects of that moment of horror
His uncles words came as a sudden high shot climax to weeks of exasperating peeping and prying and questioning of sneer and insinuation
Conover had been only moderately successful at the law had lost clients to Franks father had been beaten when they were on opposite sides
He hated the father with the secret hypocritical hatred of the highly moral and religious man
He de spised the son
It is not often that a Christian gentleman has such an opportunity to combine justice and revenge to feed to bursting an ancient grudge the while conscious that he is but doing his duty
Said Frank when he was able to speak You have been listening to the lies of some treacherous clerk here
Dont destroy that little book proceeded Conover tranquilly
We can prove that you took it
Young Gower rose
I must decline to have anything further to say to you sir said he
You will leave this office and you will not be admitted here again unless you come with proper papers as administrator
Conover smiled with cold satisfaction and departed
There followed a series of quarrelsbetween Frank and his sister between Frank and his mother between Franks wife and his mother between Mildred and her mother between the mother and Conover
Mrs Gower was suspicious of her son but she knew her brother for a pinchpenny exacting the last drop of what he regarded as his own
And she discovered that if she authorized him to act as administrator for her he could and beyond question wouldtake a large share of the estate
The upshot was that Frank paid over to his mother and sister fortyseven thousand dollars and his mother and her brother stopped speaking to each other
I see that you have turned over all your money to mother said Frank to Mildred a few days after the settlement
Of course said Mildred
She was in a mood of high scorn for sordidnessa mood induced by the spectacle of the shameful manners of Conover Frank and his wife
Do you think thats wise
suggested Frank
I think its decent said Mildred
Well I hope youll not live to regret it said her brother
Neither Mrs Gower nor her daughter had ever had any experience in the care of money
To both forty seven thousand dollars seemed a fortunefortyseven thousand dollars in cash in the bank ready to issue forth and do their bidding at the mere writing of a few figures and a signature on a piece of paper
In a sense they knew that for many years the familys annual expenses had ranged between forty and fifty thousand but in the sense of actuality they knew nothing about ita state of affairs common enough in families where the man is in absolute control and spends all he makes
Money always had been forthcomcomingsic therefore money always would be forthcoming
The mourning and the loss of the person who had filled and employed their lives caused the widow and the daughter to live very quietly during the succeeding year
They spent only half of their capital
For reasons of selfish and farsighted prudence which need no detailing Frank moved away to New York within six months of his fathers death and reduced communication between himself and wife and his mother and sister to a frigid and rapidly congealing minimum
He calculated that by the time their capital was con sumed they would have left no feeling of claim upon him or he feeling of duty toward them
It was not until eighteen months after her fathers death when the total capital was sunk to less than fifteen thousand dollars that Mildred awakened to the truth of their plight
A few months at most and they would have to give up that beautiful house which had been her home all her life
She tried to grasp the meaning of the facts as her intelligence presented them to her but she could not
She had no practical training whatever
She had been brought up as a rich mans child to be married to a rich man and never to know anything of the material details of life beyond what was necessary in managing servants after the indifferent fashion of the usual American woman of the comfortable classes
She had always had a maid she could not even dress herself properly without the maids assistance
Life without a maid was inconceivable life without servants was impossible
She wandered through the house through the grounds
She said to herself again and again We have got to give up all this and be miserably poor with not a servant with less than the tenement people have
But the words conveyed no meaning to her
She said to herself again and again I must rouse myself
I must do something
I mustmust must
But she did not rouse because there was nothing to rouse
So far as practical life was concerned she was as devoid of ideas as a newborn baby
There was but the one hopemarriage a rich marriage
It is the habit of men who can take care of themselves and of women who are securely well taken care of to scorn the woman or the helplessbred man who marries for money or even entertains that idea
How little imagination these scorners have
To marry for a mere living hardly better than one could make for oneself assuredly does show a pitiful lack of self reliance a melancholy lack of selfrespect
But for men or women all their lives used to luxury and with no ability whatever at earning moneyfor such persons to marry money in order to save themselves from the misery and shame that poverty means to them is the most natural the most human action conceivable
The man or the woman who says he or she would not do it either is a hypocrite or is talking without thinking
You may in honesty criticize and condemn a social system that suffers men and women to be so crudely and criminally miseducated by being given luxury they did not earn
But to condemn the victims of that system for acting as its logic compels is sheer folly or sheer phariseeism
Would Mildred Gower have married for money
As the weeks fled as the bank account dwindled she would have grasped eagerly at any rich man who might have offered himselfno matter how repellent he might have been
She did not want a bare living she did not want what passes with the mass of middleclass people for comfort
She wanted what she hadthe beautiful and spacious house the costly and fashionable clothing the servants the carriages and motors the thousand and one comforts luxuries and vanities to which she had always been used
In the brain of a young woman of poor or only comfortably off family the thoughts that seethed in Mildred Gowers brain would have been so many indications of depravity
In Mildred Gowers brain they were the natural the inevitable thoughts
They indicated everything as to her training nothing as to her character
So when she thinking only of a rich marriage with no matter whom and contrasting herself with the fine women portrayed in the novels and plays condemned herself as shameless and degraded she did herself grave injustice
But no rich man whether attractive or repulsive offered
Indeed no man of any kind offered
Instead it was her mother who married
A widower named James Presbury elderly with an income of five to six thousand a year from inherited wealth stumbled into Hanging Rock to live was impressed by the style the widow Gower maintained believed the rumor that her husband had left her better off than was generally thought proposed and was accepted
And two years and a month after Henry Gowers death his widow became Mrs James Presbury and ceased to veil from her new husband the truth as to her affairs
Mildred had thought that than the family quarrels incident to settling her fathers estate human nature could no lower descend
She was now to be disillusioned
When a young man or a young woman blunders into a poor marriage in trying to make a rich one he or she is usually withheld from immediate and frank expression by the timidity of youth
Not so the elderly man or woman
As we grow older no mat ter how timidly conventional we are by nature we become through selfishness or through indifference to the opinion of others or through impatience of petty restraint more and more outspoken
Old Presbury discovered how he had tricked himself four days after the wedding
He and his bride were at the Waldorf in New York ahoneymooning
The bride had never professed to be rich
She had simply continued in her lifelong way had simply acted rich
She well knew the gaudy delusions her admirer was entertaining and she saw to it that nothing was said or done to disturb him
She inquired into his affairs made sure of the substantiality of the comparatively small income he possessed decided to accept him as her best available chance to escape becoming a charge upon her anything but eager and generous relatives
She awaited the explosion with serenity
She cared not a flip for Presbury who was a soft and silly old fool full of antiquated compliments and so drearily the inferior of Henry Gower physically and mentally that even she could appreciate the difference the descent
She rather enjoyed the prospect of a combat with him of the end of dissimulating her contempt
She had thought out and had put in arsenal ready for use a variety of sneers jeers and insults that suggested themselves to her as she listened and simpered and responded while he was courting
Had the opportunity offered earlier than the fourth day she would have seized it but not until that fourth morning was she in just the right mood
She had eaten too much dinner the night before and had followed it after two hours in a stuffy theater with an indigestible supper
He liked the bedroom windows open at night she liked them closed
After she fell into a heavy sleep he slipped out of bed and opened the windows wideto teach her by the nights happy experience that she was entirely mistaken as to the harmfulness of fresh winter air
The result was that she awakened with a frightful cold and a splitting headache
And as the weather was about to change she had shooting pains like toothache through her toes the instant she thrust them into her shoes
The elderly groom believing he had a rich bride was all solicitude and infuriating attention
She waited until he had wrought her to the proper pitch of fury
Then she saidin reply to some remark of his Yes I shall rely upon you entirely
I want you to take absolute charge of my affairs
The tears sprang to his eyes
His weak old mouth rapidly falling to pieces twisted and twitched with emotion
Ill try to deserve your confidence darling said he
Ive had large business experience in the way of investing carefully I mean
I dont think your affairs will suffer in my hands
Oh Im sure theyll not trouble you said she in a sweet sure tone as the pains shot through her feet and her head
Youll hardly notice my little mite in your property
She pretended to reflect
Let me seetheres seven thousand left but of course half of that is Millies
It must be very well invested said he
Those seven thousand shares must be of the very best
Shares
said she with a gentle little laugh
I mean dollars
Presbury was about to lift a cup of cafe au lait to his lips
Instead he turned it over into the platter of eggs and bacon
WeMildred and I pursued his bride were left with only fortyodd thousand between us
Of course we had to live
So naturally theres very little left
Presbury was shaking so violently that his head and arms waggled like a jumpingjacks
He wrapped his elegant white fingers about the arms of his chair to steady himself
In a suffocated voice he said Do you mean to say that you have only seven thousand dollars in the world
Only half that corrected she
Oh dear how my head aches
Less than half that for there are some debts
She was impatient for the explosion the agony of her feet and head needed outlet and relief
But he disappointed her
That was one of the situations in which one appeals in vain to the resources of language
He shrank and sank back in his chair his jaw dropped and he vented a strange imbecile cackling laugh
It was not an expression of philosophic mirth of sense of the grotesqueness of an anticlimax
It was not an expression of any emotion whatever
It was simply a signal from a mind temporarily dethroned
What are you laughing at
she said sharply
His answer was a repetition of the idiotic sound
Whats the matter with you
demanded she
Please close your mouth
It was a timely piece of advice for his upper and false teeth had become partially dislodged and threatened to drop upon the shirtbosom gayly showing between the lapels of his darkblue silk housecoat
He slowly closed his mouth moving his teeth back into place with his tonguea gesture that made her face twitch with rage and disgust
Seven thousand dollars he mumbled dazedly
I said less than half that retorted she sharply
And Ithought you wererich
A peculiar rolling of the eyes and twisting of the lips gave her the idea that he was about to vent that repulsive sound again
Dont you laugh
she cried
I cant bear your laugheven at its best
Suddenly he galvanized into fury
This is an outrage
he cried waving his uselesslooking white fists
You have swindled meSWINDLED me
Her head stopped aching
The pains in her feet either ceased or she forgot them
In a suspiciously calm voice she said What do you mean
I mean that you are a swindler
he shouted banging one fist on the table and waving the other
She acted as though his meaning were just dawning upon her
Do you mean said she tranquilly that you married me for money
I mean that I thought you a substantial woman and that I find you are an adventuress
Did you think inquired she that any woman who had money would marry YOU
She laughed very quietly
You ARE a fool
He sat back to look at her
This mode of combat in such circumstances puzzled him
I knew that you were rich she went on or you would not have dared offer yourself to me
All my friends were amazed at my stooping to accept you
Your father was an Irish Tammany contractor wasnt hea sort of criminal
But I simply had to marry
So I gave you my family and position and name in exchange for your wealtha good bargain for you but a poor one for me
These references to HIS wealth were most disconcerting especially as they were accompanied by remarks about his origin of which he was so ashamed that he had changed the spelling of his name in the effort to clear himself of it
However some retort was imperative
He looked at her and said Swindler and adventuress
Dont repeat that lie said she
You are the adventurerdespite the fact that you are very rich
Dont say that again cried he
I never said or pretended I was rich
I have about five thousand a yearand youll not get a cent of it madam
She knew his income but no one would have suspected it from her expression of horror
What
she gasped
You dared to marry ME when you were a beggar
Methe widow of Henry Gower
You impudent old wreck
Why you havent enough to pay my servants
What are we to live on pray
I dont know what YOULL live on replied he
I shall live as I always have
A beggar
she exclaimed
Imarried to a beggar
She burst into tears
How men take advantage of a woman alone
If my son had been near me
But theres surely some law to protect me
Yes Im sure there is
Oh Ill punish you for having deceived me
Her eyes dried as she looked at him
How dare you sit there
How dare you face me you miserable fraud
Early in her acquaintance with him she had discovered that determining factors in his character were sensitiveness about his origin and sensitiveness about his social position
On this knowledge of his weaknesses was securely based her confidence that she could act as she pleased toward him
To ease her pains she proceeded to pour out her private opinion of himall the disagreeable things all the insults she had been storing up
She watched him as only a woman can watch a man
She saw that his rage was not dangerous that she was forcing him into a position where fear of her revenging herself by disgracing him would overcome anger at the collapse of his fatuous dreams of wealth
She did not despise him the more deeply for sitting there for not flying from the room or trying to kill her or somehow compelling her to check that flow of insult
She already despised him utterly also she attached small importance to selfrespect having no knowledge of what that quality really is
When she grew tired she became quiet
They sat there a long time in silence
At last he ran up the white flag of abject surrender by saying Whatll we live onthats what Id like to know
An eavesdropper upon the preceding violence of upward of an hour would have assumed that at its end this pair must separate never to see each other again voluntarily
But that idea even as a possibility had not entered the mind of either
They had lived a long time they were practical people
They knew from the outset that somehow they must arrange to go on together
The alternative meant a mere pittance of alimony for her meant for him social ostracism and the small income cut in half meant for both scandal and confusion
Said she fretfully Oh I suppose well get along somehow
I dont know anything about those things
Ive always been looked afterkept from contact with the sordid side of life
That house you live in he went on does it belong to you
She gave him a contemptuous glance
Of course said she
What low people you must have been used to
I thought perhaps you had rented it for your bunco game retorted he
The furniture the horses the motorall those thingsdo they belong to you
I shall leave the room if you insult me said she
Did you include them in the seven thousand dollars
The money is in the bank
It has nothing to do with our house and our property
He reflected presently said The horses and carriages must be sold at onceand all those servants dismissed except perhaps two
We can live in the house
She grew purple with rage
Sell MY carriages
Discharge MY servants
Id like to see you try
Whos to pay for keeping up that establishment
demanded he
She was silent
She saw what he had in mind
If you want to keep that house and live comfortably he went on youve got to cut expenses to the bone
You see that dont you
I cant live any way but the way Ive been used to all my life wailed she
He eyed her disgustedly
Was there anything equal to a woman for folly
Weve got to make the most of what little we have said he
I tell you I dont know anything about those things repeated she
Youll have to look after them
Mildred and I arent like the women youve been used to
We are ladies
Presburys rage boiled over again at the mention of Mildred
That daughter of yours
he cried
Whats to be done about her
Ive got no money to waste on her
You miserable Tammany THING
exclaimed she
Dont you dare SPEAK of my daughter except in the most respectful way
And once more she opened out upon him wreaking upon him all her wrath against fate all the pentup fury of two yearsfury which had been denied such furys usual and natural expression in denunciations of the dead breadwinner
The generous and everkind Henry Gower could not be to blame for her wretched plight and of course she herself could not be to blame for it
So until now there had been no scapegoat
Presbury therefore received the whole burden
He alarmed lest a creature apparently so irrational should in wild rage drive him away ruin him socially perhaps induce a sympathetic court to award her a large part of his income as alimony said not a word in reply
He bade his wrath wait
Later on when the peril was over when he had a firm grip upon the situationthen he would take his revenge
They gave up the expensive suite at the Waldorf that very day and returned to Hanging Rock
They alternated between silence and the coarsest crudest quarrelings for neither had the intelligence to quarrel wittily or the refinement to quarrel artistically
As soon as they arrived at the Gower house Mildred was dragged into the wrangle
I married this terrible man for your sake was the burden of her mothers wail
And he is a beggar wants to sell off everything and dismiss the servants
You are a pair of paupers cried the old man
You are shameless tricksters
Be careful how you goad me
Mildred had anticipated an unhappy ending to her mothers marriage but she had not knowledge enough of life or of human nature to anticipate any such horrors as now began
Every day all day long the vulgar fight raged
Her mother and her stepfather withdrew from each others presence only to think up fresh insults to fling at each other
As soon as they were armed they hastened to give battle again
She avoided Presbury
Her mother she could not avoid and when her mother was not in combat with him she was weeping or wailing or railing to Mildred
It was at Mildreds urging that her mother acquiesced in Presburys plans for reducing expenses within income
At first the girl even more ignorant than her mother of practical affairs did not appreciate the wisdom not to say the necessity of what he wished to do but soon she saw that he was right that the servants must go that the horses and carriages and the motors must be sold
When she was convinced and had convinced her mother she still did not realize what the thing really meant
Not until she no longer had a maid did she comprehend
To a woman who has never had a maid or who has taken on a maid as a luxury it will seem an exaggeration to say that Mildred felt as helpless as a baby lying alone in a crib before it has learned to crawl
Yet that is rather an understatement of her plight
The maid left in the afternoon
Mildred not without inconveniences that had in the novelty their amusing side contrived to dress that evening for dinner and to get to bed but when she awakened in the morning and was ready to dress the loss of Therese became a tragedy
It took the girl nearly four hours to get herself together presentablyand then never had she looked so unkempt
With her hair thick and soft she could do nothing
What a wonderful person Therese was
thought she
And I always regarded her as rather stupid
Her mother who had not had a maid until she was about thirty and had never become completely dependent fared somewhat better though hearing her moans you would have thought she was faring worse
Mildreds unhappiness increased from day to day as her wardrobe fell into confusion and disrepair
She felt that she must rise to the situation must teach herself must save herself from impending dowdiness and slovenliness
But her brain seemed to be paralyzed
She did not know how or where to begin to learn
She often in secret gave way to the futility of tears
There were now only a cook and one housemaid and a man of all workall three newcomers for Presbury insistedmost wiselythat none of the servants of the luxurious wasteful days would be useful in the new circumstances
He was one of those small orderly men who have a genius for just such situations as the one he now proceeded to grapple with and solve
In his pleasure at managing everything about that house in distributing the work among the three servants in marketing and in inspecting purchases and nosing into the garbagebarrel in looking for dust on picture frames and tabletops and for neglected weeds in the garden walksin this multitude of engrossing delights he forgot his anger over the trick that had been played upon him
He still fought with his wife and denounced her and met insult with insult
But that too was one of his pleasures
Also he felt that on the whole he had done well in marrying
He had been lonely as a bachelor had had no one to talk with or to quarrel with nothing to do
The marriage was not so expensive as his wife had brought him a houseand it such a one as he had always regarded as the apogee of elegance
Living was not dear in Hanging Rock if one understood managing and gave time to it
And socially he was at last established
Soon his wife was about as contented as she had ever been in her life
She hated and despised her husband but quarreling with him and railing against him gave her occupation and aimtwo valuable assets toward happiness that she had theretofore lacked
Her living shelter food clothing enoughwas now secure
But the most important factor of all in her content was the one apparently too trivial to be worthy of record
From girlhood she could not recall a single day in which she had not suffered from her feet
And she had been ashamed to say anything about ithad never let anyone even her maid see her feet which were about the only unsightly part of her
None had guessed the cause of her chronic illtemper until Presbury that genius for the little said within a week of their marriage You talk and act like a woman with chronic corns
He did not dream of the effect this chance thrust had upon his wife
For the first time he had really landed
She concealed her fright and her shame as best she could and went on quarreling more viciously than ever
But he presently returned to the attack
Said he Your feet hurt you
Im sure they do
Now that I think of it you walk that way
I suppose I deserve my fate said she
When a woman marries beneath her she must expect insult and low conversation
You must cure your feet said he
Ill not live in the house with a person who is made fiendish by corns
I think its only corns
I see no signs of bunions
You brute
cried his wife rushing from the room
But when they met again he at once resumed the subject telling her just how she could cure herselfand he kept on telling her she apparently ignoring but secretly acting on his advice
He knew what he was about and her feet grew better grew welland she was happier than she had been since girlhood when she began ruining her feet with tight shoes
Six months after the marriage Presbury and his wife were getting on about as comfortably as it is given to average humanity to get on in this world of incessant struggle between uncomfortable man and his uncomfortable environment
But Mildred had become more and more unhappy
Her mother sometimes angrily again reproachfullyand that was far harder to bear blamed her for my miserable marriage to this low quarrelsome brute
Presbury let no day pass without telling her openly that she was a beggar living off him that she would better marry soon or he would take drastic steps to release himself of the burden
When he attacked her before her mother there was a violent quarrel from which Mildred fled to hide in her room or in the remotest part of the garden
When he hunted her out to insult her alone she sat or stood with eyes down and face ghastly pale mute quivering
She did not inter rupt did not try to escape
She was like the chained and spiritless dog that crouches and takes the shower of blows from its cruel master
Where could she go
Nowhere
What could she do
Nothing
In the days of prosperity she had regarded herself as proud and high spirited
She now wondered at herself
What had become of the pride
What of the spirit
She avoided looking at her image in the glassthat thin pallid face those circled eyes the drawn sick expression about the mouth and nose
Im stunned she said to herself
Ive been stunned ever since fathers death
Ive never recoverednor has mother
And she gave way to tearsfor her father she fancied in fact from shame at her weakness and helplessness
She thoughthopedthat she would not be thus feeble and cowardly if she were not living at home in the house she loved the house where she had spent her whole life
And such a house
Comfort and luxury and taste every room every corner of the grounds full of the tenderest and most beautiful associations
Also there was her position in Hanging Rock
Everywhere else she would be a stranger and would have either no position at all or one worse than that of the utter outsider
There she was of the few looked up to by the whole community
No one knew or even suspected how she was degraded by her step father
Before the world he was courteous and considerate toward her as toward everybody
Indeed Presburys natural instincts were gentle and kindly
His hatred of Mildred and his passion for humiliating her were the result of his conviction that he had been tricked into the marriage and his inability to gratify his resentment upon his wife
He could not make the mother suffer but he could make the daughter sufferand he did
Besides she was of no use to him and would presently be an expense
Your money will soon be gone he said to her
If you paid your just share of the expenses it would be gone now
When it is gone what will you do
She was silent
Your mother has written to your brother about you
Mildred lifted her head a gleam of her former spirit in her eyes
Then she remembered and bent her gaze upon the ground
But he like the cur that he is answered through a secretary that he wished to have nothing to do with either of you
Mildred guessed that Frank had made the marriage an excuse
Surely some of your relatives will do something for you
I have my hands full supporting your mother
I dont propose to have two strapping worthless women hanging from my neck
She bent her head lower and remained silent
I warn you to bestir yourself he went on
I give you four months
After the first of the year you cant stay here unless you pay your shareyour third
No answer
You hear what I say miss
he demanded
Yes replied she
If you had any sense you wouldnt wait until your last cent was gone
Youd go to New York now and get something to do
What
she askedall she could trust herself to speak
How should I know
retorted he furiously
you are a stranger to me
Youve been educated I assume
Surely theres something you can do
Youve been out six years now and have had no success for youre neither married nor engaged
You cant call it success to be flattered and sought by people who wanted invitations to this house when it was a social center
He paused for response from her
None came
You admit you are a failure
he said sharply
Yes said she
You must have realized it several years ago he went on
Instead of allowing your mother to keep on wasting money in entertaining lavishly here to give you a chance to marry you should have been preparing yourself to earn a living
A pause
Isnt that true miss
He had a way of pronouncing the word miss that made it an epithet a sneer at her unmarried and un marriageable state
She colored paled murmured Yes
Then better late than never
Youll do well to follow my advice and go to New York and look about you
IllIll think of it stammered she
And she did think of it
But in all her life she had never considered the idea of moneymaking
That was something for men and for the middle and lower classes while Hanging Rock was regarded as most noisomely middle class by fashionable people it did not so regard itself
Moneymaking was not for ladies
Like all her class she was a constant and a severe critic of the women of the lower orders who worked for her as milliners dressmakers shopattendants cooks maids
But as she now realized it is one thing to pass upon the work of others it is another thing to do work oneself
She There was literally nothing that she could do
Any occupation even the most menial was either beyond her skill or beyond her strength or beyond both
Suddenly she recalled that she could sing
Her prostrate spirit suddenly leaped erect
Yes she could sing
Her voice had been praised by experts
Her singing had been in demand at charity entertainments where amateurs had to compete with professionals
Then down she dropped again
She sang well enough to know how badly she sangthe long and toilsome and expensive training that lay between her and operatic or concert or even musichall stage
Her voice was fine at times
Againmost of the timeit was unreliable
No she could not hope to get paying employment even as a church choirsinger
Miss Dresser who sang in the choir of the Good Shepherd for ten dollars a Sunday had not nearly so good a voice as she but it was reliable
There is nothing I can donothing
All at once with no apparent bridge across the vast chasm her heart went out not in pity but in human understanding and sisterly sympathy to the women of the pariah class at whom during her stops in New York she had sometimes gazed in wonder and horror
Why we and they are only a step apart she said to herself in amazement
We and they are much nearer than my maid or the cook and they
And then her heart skipped a beat and her skin grew cold and a fog swirled over her brain
If she should be cast outif she could find no work and no one to support herwould she O my God
she moaned
I must be crazy to think such thoughts
I never could
Id die firstDIE
But if anyone had pictured to her the kind of life she was now leadingthe humiliation and degradation she was meekly enduring with no thought of flight with an ever stronger desire to stay on regardless of pride and selfrespectif anyone had pictured this to her as what she would endure what would she have said
She could see herself flashing scornful denial saying that she would rather kill herself
Yet she was livingand was not even contemplating suicide as a way out
A few days after Presbury gave her warning her mother took advantage of his absence for his religiously observed daily constitutional to say to her I hope you didnt think I was behind him in what he said to you about going away
Mildred had not thought so but in her mothers guilty tone and guiltier eyes she now read that her mother wished her to go
Itd be awful for me to be left here alone with him wailed her mother insincerely
Of course weve got no money and beggars cant be choosers
But itd just about kill me to have you go
Mildred could not speak
I dont know a thing about money Mrs Presbury went on
Your father always looked after everything
She had fallen into the way of speaking of her first husband as part of some vague remote past which indeed he had become for her
This man meaning Presburyhas only about five thousand a year as you know
I suppose thats as small as he says it is
I remember our bills for one month used to be as much or more than that
She waved her useless pretty hands helplessly
I dont see HOW we are to get on Mildred
Her mother wished her to go
Her mother had fallen under the influence of Presburyher mother woman like or rather ladylike was of kin to the helpless flabby things that float in the sea and attach themselves to whatever they happen to lodge against
Her mother wished her to go
At the same time Mrs Presbury went on I cant live without somebody here to stand between me and him
Id kill him or kill myself
Mildred muttered some excuse and fled from the room to lock herself in
But when she came forth again to descend to dinner she had resolved nothing because there was nothing to resolve
When she was a child she leaned from the nursery window one day and saw a stableboy drowning a rat that was in a big oval wire cage with a wooden bottom
The boy pressed the cage slowly down in the vat of water
The rat in the very top of the cage watched the floor sink watched the water rise
And as it watched it uttered a strange shrill feeble sound which she could still remember distinctly and terribly
It seemed to her now that if she were to utter any sound at all it would be that one
II ON the Monday before Thanksgiving Presbury went up to New York to look after one of the little speculations in Wall Street at which he was so clever
Throughout the civilized world nowadays and especially in and near the great capitals of finance there is a class of men and women of small capital and of a character in which are combined iron selfrestraint rabbitlike timidity and great shrewdness who make often a not inconsiderable income by gambling in stocks
They buy only when the market is advancing strongly they sell as soon as they have gained the scantest margin of profit
They never permit themselves to be tempted by the most absolute certainty of larger gains
They will let weeks months even go by without once risking a dollar
They wait until they simply cannot lose
Tens of thousands every year try to join this class
All but the few soon succumb to the hourly dazzling temptations the big gamblers dangle before the eyes of the little gamblers to lure them within reach of the merciless shears
Presbury had for many years added from one to ten thousand a year to his income by this form of gambling success at which is in itself sufficient to stamp a man as infinitely little of soul
On that Monday he venturing for the first time in six months returned to Hanging Rock on the threethirty train the richer by two hundred and fifty dollarsas large a killing as he had ever made in any single day one large enough to elevate him to the rank of prince among the surething snides
He said nothing about his luck to his family but let them attribute his unprecedented good humor to the news he brought and announced at dinner
I met an old friend in the street this afternoon said he
He has invited us to take Thanksgiving dinner with him
And I think it will be a dinner worth whilethe food I mean and the wine
Not the guests for there wont be any guests but us
General Siddall is a stranger in New York
There are Siddalls in New York said his wife very nice refined peoplegoing in the best society
Presbury showed his false teeth in a genial smile for the oldfashioned or plate kind of false teeth they were extraordinarily goodwhen exactly in place
But not my old friend Bill Siddall said he
Hes next door to an outlaw
Id not have accepted his invitation if he had been asking us to dine in public
But this is to be at his own househis new houseand a very grand house it is judging by the photos he showed me
A regular palace
Hell not be an outlaw long I guess
But we must wait and see how he comes out socially before we commit ourselves
Did you accept for me too
asked Mrs Presbury
Certainly said Presbury
And for your daughter too
I cant go said Mildred
Im dining with the Fassetts
The family no longer had a servant in constant attendance in the diningroom
The maid of many functions also acted as butler and as fetchandcarry between kitchen and butlers pantry
Before speaking Presbury waited until this maid had withdrawn to bring the roast and the vegetables
Then he said You are going too miss
This with the full infusion of insult into the miss
Mildred was silent
Bill Siddall is looking for a wife proceeded Presbury
And he has Heaven knows how many millions
Do you think theres a chance for Milly
cried Mrs Presbury who was full of alternating hopes and fears both wholly irrational
She can have himif she wants him replied Presbury
But its only fair to warn her that hes a stiff dose
Is the moneyCERTAIN
inquired Mildreds mother with that shrewdness whose rare occasional displays laid her open to the unjust suspicion of feigning her habitual stupidity
Yes said Presbury amiably
Its nothing like yours was
Hes so rich he doesnt know what to do with his income
He owns mines scattered all over the world
And if they all failed hes got bundles of railway stocks and bonds and giltedged trust stocks too
And hes a comparatively young manhardly fifty I should say
He pretends to be forty
Its strange I never heard of him said Mrs Presbury
If you went to South America or South Africa or Alaska youd hear of him said Presbury
He laughed
And I guess youd hear some pretty dreadful things
When I knew him twentyfive years ago he had just been arrested for forging my fathers name to a check
But he got out of thatand its all past and gone
Probably he hasnt committed any worse crimes than have most of our big rich men
Bills handicap has been that he hadnt much education or any swell relatives
But hes a genius at moneymaking
Presbury looked at Mildred with a grin
And hes just the husband for Mildred
She cant afford to be too particular
Somebodys got to support her
I cant and wont and she cant support herself
Youll gowont you Mildred
said her mother
He may not be so bad
Yes Ill go said Mildred
Her gaze was upon the untouched food on her plate
Of course shell go said Presbury
And shell marry him if she can
Wont you miss
He spoke in his amiably insulting wayas distinguished from the way of savagely sneering insult he usually took with her
He expected no reply
She surprised him
She lifted her tragic eyes and looked fixedly at him
She said Yes Ill go
And Ill marry him if I can
I told him he could have you said Presbury
I explained to him that you were a rare specimen of the perfect ladyjust what he wantedand that you and all your family would be grateful to anybody who would undertake your support
Mrs Presbury flushed angrily
Youve made it perfectly useless for her to go
she cried
Calm yourself my love said her husband
I know Bill Siddall thoroughly
I said what would help
I want to get rid of her as much as you doand thats saying a great deal
Mrs Presbury flamed with the wrath of those who are justly accused
If Mildred left I should go too cried she
Go where
inquired her husband
To the poorhouse
By persistent rubbing in Presbury had succeeded in making the truth about her poverty and dependence clear to his wife
She continued to frown and to look unutterable contempt but he had silenced her
He noted this with a sort of satisfaction and went on If Bill Siddall takes her you certainly wont go there
He wouldnt have you
He feels strongly on the subject of mothersinlaw
Has he been married before
asked Mrs Presbury
Twice replied her husband
His first wife died
He divorced the second for unfaithfulness
Mildred saw in this painstaking recital of all the disagreeable and repellent facts about Siddall an effort further to humiliate her by making it apparent how desperately off she was how she could not refuse any offer revolting though it might be to her pride and to her womanly instincts
Doubtless this was in part the explanation of Presburys malicious candor
But an element in that candor was a prudent preparing of the girls mind for worse than the reality
That he was in earnest in his profession of a desire to bring about the match showed when he proposed that they should take rooms at a hotel in New York to give her a chance to dress properly for the dinner
True he hastened to say that the expense must be met altogether out of the remnant of Mildreds share of her fathers estate but the idea would not have occurred to him had he not been really planning a marriage
Never had Mildred looked more beautiful or more attractive than when the three were ready to sally forth from the Manhattan Hotel on that Thanksgiving evening
At twentyfive a soundly healthy and vigorous twentyfive it is impossible for mind and nerves however wrought upon to make serious inroads upon surface charms
The hope of emancipation from her hideous slavery had been acting upon the girl like a powerful tonic
She had gained several pounds in the three intervening days her face had filled out color had come back in all its former beauty to her lips
Perhaps there was some slight aid from art in the extraordinary brilliancy of her eyes
Presbury inventoried her with a succession of grunts of satisfaction
Yes hell want you he said
Youll strike him as just the show piece he needs
And hes too shrewd not to be aware that his choice is limited
You cant frighten me said Mildred with a radiant coquettish smilefor practice
Nothing could frighten me
Im not trying replied Presbury
Nor will Siddall frighten you
A woman whos after a billpayer can stomach anything
Or a man said Mildred
Oh your mother wasnt as bad as all that said Presbury who never lost an opportunity
Mrs Presbury seated beside her daughter in the cab gave an exclamation of rage
My own daughter insulting me
she said
Such a thought did not enter my head protested Mildred
I wasnt thinking of anyone in particular
Lets not quarrel now said Presbury with unprecedented amiability
We must give Bill a spectacle of the happy family
The cab entered the portecochere of a huge palace of white stone just off Fifth Avenue
The house was even grander than they had anticipated
The wrought iron fence around it had cost a small fortune the house itself without reference to its contents a large fortune
The massive outer doors were opened by two lackeys in cherrycolored silk and velvet livery a butler looking like an English gentleman was waiting to receive them at the top of a short flight of marble steps between the outer and the inner entrance doors
As Mildred ascended she happened to note the sculpturing over the inner entrancea reclining nude figure of a woman Cupids with garlands and hymeneal torches hovering about her
Mildred had been in many pretentious houses in and near New York but this far surpassed the grandest of them
Everything was brand new seemed to have been only that moment placed and was of the costliest statuary carpets armor carved seats of stone and wood marble staircase rising majestically tapestries pictures drawingroom furniture
The hall was vast but the drawingroom was vaster
Empty one would have said that it could not possibly be furnished
Yet it was not only full but crowdedchairs and sofas hassocks and teteatetes cabinets tables pictures statues busts palms flowers a mighty fireplace in which behind enormous and costly andirons crackled enormous and costly logs
There was danger in moving about one could not be sure of not upsetting something and one felt that the least damage that could be done there would be an appallingly expensive matter
Before that cavernous fireplace posed General Siddall
He was a tiny mite of a man with a thin wiry body supporting the head of a professional barber
His black hair was glossy and most romantically arranged
His black mustache and imperial were waxed and brilliantined
There was no mistaking the liberal use of dye also
From the rather thin very sharp face looked a pair of small muddy browngreen eyes dull crafty cold cruel
But the little man was so insignificant and so bebarbered and betailored that one could not take him seriously
Never had there been so new so carefully pressed so perfectly fitting evening clothes never a shirt so expensively got together or jeweled studs waistcoat buttons and links so high priced
From every part of the room from every part of the little mans perfumed and groomed person every individual article seemed to be shrieking The best is not too good for Bill Siddall
Mildred was agreeably surprisedshe was looking with fierce determination for agreeable surprises when the costly little man spoke in a quiet pleasant voice with an elusive attractive foreign accent
My but this is grandgrand General Siddall
said Presbury in the voice of the noisy flatterer
Princely
Royal
Mildred glanced nervously at Siddall
She feared that Presbury had taken the wrong tone
She saw in the unpleasant eyes a glance of gratified vanity
Said he Not so bad not so bad
I saw the house in Paris when I was taking a walk one day
I went to the American ambassador and asked for the best architect in Paris
I went to him told him about the house and here it is
Decorations furniture and all
exclaimed Presbury
No just the house
I picked up the interiors in different parts of Europehad everything reproduced where I couldnt buy outright
I want to enjoy my money while Im still young
I didnt care what it cost to get the proper surroundings
As I said to my architect and to my staff of artists I expected to be cheated but I wanted the goods
And I got the goods
Ill show you through the house after dinner
Its on this same scale throughout
And theyre putting me together a country placesame sort of thing
He threw back his little shoulders and protruded his little chest
And the joke of it is that the whole business isnt costing me a cent
Not a cent less than half a dozen or a dozen millions said Presbury
Not so much as thatnot quite protested the delightedly sparkling little general
But what I meant was that as fast as these fellows spend I go downtown and make
Fact is Im a little better off than I was when I started in to build
Well you didnt get any of MY money laughed Presbury
But I suppose pretty much everybody else in the country must have contributed
General Siddall smiled
Mildred wondered whether the points of his mustache and imperial would crack and break of if he should touch them
She noted that his hair was roached absurdly high above the middle of his forehead and that he was wearing the tallest heels she had ever seen
She calculated that with his hair flat and his feet on the ground he would hardly come to her shoulderand she was barely of womans medium height
She caught sight of his handsthe square stubby hands of a working man the fingers permanently slightly curved as by the handle of shovel and pick the skin shriveled but white with a ghastly sickening bleached white the nails repulsively manicured into long white curves
If he should touch me Id scream she thought
And then she looked at Presburyand around her at the evidences of enormous wealth
The generalshe wondered where he had got that titleled her mother in to dinner Presbury gave her his arm
On the way he found opportunity to mutter Lay it on thick
Flatter the fool
You cant offend him
Tell him hes divinely handsomea Louis Fourteen a Napoleon
Praise everythingnapkins tablecloth dishes food
Rave over the wine
But Mildred could not adopt this obviously excellent advice
She sat silent and cold while Presbury and her mother raved and drew out the general to talk of himselfthe only subject in the whole world that seemed to him thoroughly worth while
As Mildred listened and furtively observed it seemed to her that this tiny fool so obviously pleased by these coarse and insulting flatteries could not possibly have had the brains to amass the vast fortune he apparently possessed
But presently she noted that behind the personality that was pleased by this gross fawning and bootlicking there laylay in wait and on guard another personality one that despised these guests of his estimating them at their true value and using them contemptuously for the gratification of his coarse appetites
In the glimpse she caught of that deeper and real personality she liked it even less than she liked the one upon the surface
It was evidence of superior acumen that she saw even vaguely the real Bill Siddall the moneymaker beneath the General William Siddall raw and ignorant and vulgarmore vulgar in his refinement than the most shocking bum at home and at ease in foulsmelling stew
Every man of achievement hides beneath his surface personality this second and real man who makes the fortune discovers the secret of chemistry fights the battle carries the election paints the picture commits the frightful murder evolves the divine sermon or poem or symphony
Thus when we meet a man of achievement we invariably have a sense of disappointment
Why thats not the man
we exclaim
There must be some mistake
And it is indeed not the man
Him we are incapable of seeing
We have only eyes for surfaces and not being doers of extraordinary deeds but mere plodders in the routines of existence we cannot believe that there is any more to another than there is to ourselves
The pleasant or unpleasant surface for the conventional relations of life is about all there is to us therefore it is all there is to human nature
Well theres no help for it
In measuring our fellow beings we can use only the measurements of our own selves we have no others and if others are given to us we are as foozled as one knowing only feet and inches who has a tape marked off in meters and centimeters
It so happened that in her social excursions Mildred had never been in any of the numerous homes of the suddenly and vastly rich of humble origin
She was used toand regarded as proper and elegantthe ordinary ostentations and crudities of the rich of conventional society
No more than you or I was she moved to ridicule or disdain by the silliness and the tawdry vulgarity of the life of palace and liveried lackey and empty ceremonial by the tedious entertainments by the displays of costly and poisonous food
But General Siddalls establishment presented a new phase to herand she thought it unique in dreadfulness and absurdity
The general had had a home life in his youthin a coalminers cabin near WilkesBarre
Ever since he had lived in boardinghouses or hotels
As his shrewd and rapacious mind had gathered in more and more wealth he had lived more and more luxuriouslybut always at hotels
He had seen little of the private life of the rich
Thus he had been compelled to get his ideas of luxury and of ceremonial altogether from the hotelkeepers and caterers who give the rich what the more intelligent and informed of the rich are usually shamed by people of taste from giving themselves at home
She thought the tablecloth napkins and gaudy gold and flowery cut glass a little overdone but on the whole not so bad
She had seen such almost as grand at a few New York houses
The lace in the cloth and in the napkins was merely a little too magnificent
It made the table lumpy it made the napkins unfit for use
But the way the dinner was served
You would have said you were in a glorified palacehotel restaurant
You looked about for the cashiers desk you were certain a bill would be presented after the last course
The general tinier and more grotesque than ever in the great highbacked richly carved armchair surveyed the progress of the banquet with the air of a god performing miracles of creation and passing them in review and giving them his divine endorsement
He was well pleased with the enthusiastic praises Presbury and his wife lavished upon the food and drink
He would have been better pleased had they preceded and followed every mouthful with a eulogy
He supplemented their compliments with even more fulsome compliments adding details as to the origin and the cost
Darcythis to the butlertell the chef that this fish is the best yetreally exquisite
To Presbury I had it brought over from Francealive of course
We have many excellent fish but I like a change now and then
So I have a standing order with Prunierhes the big oyster and fishman of Paris to send me over some things every two weeks by special express
That way an oyster costs about fifty cents and a fish about five or six dollars
To Mrs Presbury Ill have Darcy make you and Miss Presburyexcuse me Miss Gowerbouquets of the flowers afterward
Most of them come from New Yorkand very high really firstclass flowers are
I pay two dollars apiece for my roses even at this season
And orchidswell I feel really extravagant when I indulge in orchids as I have this evening
Ten dollars apiece for those
But theyre worth it
The dinner was interminably longupward of twenty kinds of food no less than five kinds of wine enough served and spoiled to have fed and intoxicated a dozen people at least
And upon every item of food and drink the general had some remarks to make
He impressed it upon his guests that this dinner was very little better than the one served to him every night that the increase in expense and luxury was not in their honor but in his ownto show them what he could do when he wished to make a holiday
Finally the grand course was reached
Into the diningroom to the amazement of the guests were rolled two great restaurant joint wagons
Instead of being made of silverplated nickel or plain nickel they were of silver embossed with gold and the large carvers and serving spoons and forks had goldmounted silver handles
When the lackeys turned back the covers there were disclosed several truly wonderful young turkeys fattened as if by painstaking and skillful hand and superbly browned
Up to that time the rich and costly food had been sadly mediumlike the wines
But these turkeys were a genuine triumph
Even Mildred gave them a look of interest and admiration
In a voice that made General Siddall ecstatic Presbury cried GOD bless my soul
WHERE did you get those beauties old man
Paris said Siddall in a voice tremulous with pride and selfadmiration
You would have thought that he had created not merely the turkeys but Paris also
Potin sends them over to me
Potin you know is the finest dealer in groceries fruit game and so on in the world
I have a standing order with him for the best of everything that comes in
Id hate to tell you what my bill with Potin is every monthhe only sends it to me once a year
Really I think I ought to be ashamed of myself but I reason that if a man can afford it hes a fool to put anything but the best into his stomach
Youre right there
mumbled Presbury
His mouth was full of turkey
You HAVE got a chef General
He ought to cook well
I pay him more than most bankpresidents get
What do you think of those joint wagons Mrs
Presbury
Theyre veryinteresting replied she a little nervous because she suspected they were some sort of vulgar joke
I knew youd like them said the general
My own idea entirely
I saw them in several restaurants abroadonly of course those they had were just ordinary affairs not fit to be introduced into a gentlemans diningroom
But I took the idea and adapted it to my purposesand there you are
Very original old man said Presbury who had been drinking too much
Ive never seen it before and I dont think I ever shall again
Got the idea patented
But Siddall in his soberest moment would have been slow to admit a suspicion that any of the human race which he regarded as on its knees before him was venturing to poke fun at him
Drunk as he now was the openest sarcasm would have been accepted as a compliment
After a gorgeous dessert which nobody more than toucheda molded mousse of whipped and frozen cream and strawberriesspecially sent on to me from Florida and costing me a dollar apiece I guessafter this costly wonder had disappeared fruit was served
General Siddall had ready a long oration upon this course
He delivered it in a disgustingly thick tone
The pineapple was an English hothouse product the grapes were grown by a costly process under glass in Belgium
As for the peaches Potin had sent those deli cately blushing marvels and the charge for this would be not less than a louis apiece sira louis dor which as you no doubt know is about four dollars of Uncle Sams money
The coffeethe Queen of Holland may have it on her PRIVATE tableMAY I saybut I doubt if anyone else in the world gets a smell of it except me the coffee and the brandy came not a moment too soon
Presbury was becoming stupefied with indigestion his wife was nodding and was wearing that vague forced pleasant smile which stands proprietyguard over a mind asleep Mildred Gower felt that her nerves would endure no more and the general was falling into a besotted state spilling his wine mumbling his words
The coffee and the brandy revived them all somewhat
Mildred lifting her eyes saw by way of a mirrored section of the enormous sideboard the English butler surveying master and guests with slowly moving sneering glance of ineffable contempt
In the drawingroom again Mildred requested by Siddall and ordered by Presbury sang a little French song and thenat the urging of SiddallAnnie Laurie
Siddall was wiping his eyes when she turned around
He said to Presbury Take your wife into the conservatory to look at my orchids
I want to say a word to your stepdaughter
Mildred started up nervously
She saw how drunk the general was saw the expression of his face that a woman has to be innocent indeed not to understand
She was afraid to be left alone with him
Presbury came up to her said rapidly in a low tone Its all right
Hes got a high sense of whats due a respectable woman of our class
He isnt as drunk as he looks and acts
Having said which he took his wife by the arm and pushed her into the adjoining conservatory
Mildred reseated herself upon the inlaid pianobench
The little man his face now shiny with the sweat of drink and emotion drew up a chair in front of her
He sat and he was almost as tall sitting as standing
He said graciously Dont be afraid my dear girl
Im not that dangerous
She lifted her eyes and looked at him
She tried to conceal her aversion she feared she was not succeeding
But she need not have concerned herself about that
General Siddall after the manner of very rich men could not conceive of anyone being less impressed with his superiority in any way than he himself was
For years he had heard only flatteries of himselfhis own voice singing his praises the fawning voices of those he hired and of those hoping to get some financial advantage
He could not have imagined a mere woman not being overwhelmed by the prospect of his courting her
Nor would it have entered his head that his money would be the chief much less the only consideration with her
He had long since lost all point of view and believed that the adulation paid his wealth was evoked by his charms of person mind and manner
Those who imagine this was evidence of folly and weakmindedness and extraordinary vanity show how little they know human nature
The strongest head could not re main steady the most accurate eyes could not retain their measuring skill in such an environment as always completely envelops wealth and power
And the much talkedof difference between those born to wealth and power and those who rise to it from obscurity resolves itself to little more than the difference between those born mad and those who go insane
Looking at the little man with the disagreeable eyes so dull yet so shrewd Mildred saw that within the drunkard who could scarcely sit straight upon the richly upholstered and carved gilt chair there was another person coldly sober calmly calculating
And she realized that it was this person with whom she was about to have the most serious conversation of her life thus far
The drunkard smiled with a repulsive wiping and smacking of the thin sensual lips
I suppose you know why I had you brought here this evening
said he
Mildred looked and waited
I didnt intend to say anything tonight
In fact I didnt expect to find in you what Ive been looking for
I thought that old fool of a stepfather of yours was cracking up his goods beyond their merits
But he wasnt
My dear you suit me from the ground up
Ive been looking you over carefully
You were made for the place I want to fill
Mildred had lowered her eyes
Her face had become deathly pale
I feel faint she murmured
It is very warm here
Youre not sickly
inquired the general sharply
You look like a good solid womanthin but wiry
Ever been sick
I must look into your health
Thats a point on which I must be satisfied
A wave of anger swept through her restoring her strength
She was about to speaka rebuke to his colossal impudence that he would not soon forget
Then she remembered and bit her lips
I dont ask you to decide tonight pursued he hastening to explain this concession by adding I dont intend to decide myself
All I say is that I am willingif the goods are up to the sample
Mildred saw her stepfather and her mother watching from just within the conservatory door
A movement of the portiere at the door into the hall let her know that Darcy the butler was peeping and listening there
She stood up clenched her hands struck them together struck them against her temples crossed the room swiftly flung herself down upon a sofa and burst into tears
Presbury and his wife entered
Siddall was standing looking after Mildred with a grin
He winked at Presbury and said I guess we gave her too much of that wine
Its all old and stronger than youd think
My daughter hardly touched her glasses cried Mrs Presbury
I know that maam replied Siddall
I watched her
If shed done much drinking Id have been done then and there
I suspect shes upset by what youve been saying General said Presbury
Wasnt it enough to upset a girl
You dont realize how magnificent you are how magnificent everything is here
Im sorry if I upset her said the general swelling and loftily contrite
I don t know why it is that people never seem to be able to act natural with me
He hated those who did regarding them as sodden unappreciative fools
Mrs Presbury was quieting her daughter
Presbury and Siddall lighted cigars and went into the smoking and billiardroom across the hall
Said Presbury I didnt deceive you did I General
Shes entirely satisfactory replied Siddall
Im going to make careful inquiries about her character and her health
If those things prove to be all right Im ready to go ahead
Then the things settled said Presbury
Shes all that a lady should be
And except a cold now and then she never has anything the matter with her
She comes of good healthy stock
I cant stand a sickly ailing woman said Siddall
I wouldnt marry one and if one I married turned out to be that kind Id make short work of her
When you get right down to facts what is a woman
Why a body
If she aint pretty and well she aint nothing
While Im looking up her pedigree so to speak I want you to get her mother to explain to her just what kind of a man I am
Certainly certainly said Presbury
Have her told that I dont put up with foolishness
If she wants to look at a man let her look at me
Youll have no trouble in that way said Presbury
I DID have trouble in that way replied the general sourly
Women are foolsALL women
But the principal trouble with the second Mrs Siddall was that she wasnt a lady born
Thats why I say youll have no trouble said Presbury
Well I want her mother to talk to her plainer than a gentleman can talk to a young lady
I want her to understand that I am marrying so that I can have a WIFEcheerful ready and healthy
Ill not put up with foolishness of any kind
I understand said Presbury
Youll find that shell meet all your conditions
Explain to her that while Im the easiest most liberalspending man in the world when Im getting what I want I am just the opposite when Im not getting what I pay for
If I take her and if she acts right shell have more of everything that women want than any woman in the world
Id take a pride in my wife
There isnt anything I wouldnt spend in showing her off to advantage
And Im willing to be liberal with her mother too
Presbury had been hoping for this
His eyes sparkled
Youre a prince General he said
A genuine prince
You know how to do things right
I flatter myself I do said the general
Ive been up and down the world and I tell you most of the kings live cheap beside me
And when I get a wife worth showing of Ill do still better
Ive got wonderful creative ability
There isnt anything I cant and wont buy
Presbury noted uneasily how cold and straight how obviously repelled and repelling the girl was as she yielded her fingers to Siddall at the leavetaking
He and her mother covered the silence and ice with hot and voluble sycophantry
They might have spared themselves the exertion
To Siddall Mildred was at her most fascinating when she was thus the lady and the queen
The final impression she made upon him was the most favorable of all
In the cab Mrs Presbury talked out of the fullness of an overflowing heart
What a remarkable man the general is
said she
Youve only to look at him to realize that youre in the presence of a really superior person
And what tact he hasand how generous he isand how beautifully he entertains
So much dignityso much simplicityso much Fiddlesticks
interrupted Presbury
Your daughter isnt a damn fool Mrs
Presbury
Mildred gave a short dry laugh
Up flared her mother
I mean every word I said
cried she
If I hadnt admired and appreciated him Id certainly not have acted as I did
I couldnt stoop to such hypocrisy
Fiddlesticks
sneered Presbury
Bill Siddall is a horror
His house is a horror
His dinner was a horror
These loathsome rich people
Theyre ruining the worldas they always have
Theyre making it impossible for anyone to get good service or good food or good furniture or good clothing or good anything
They dont know good things and they pay exorbitant prices for showy trash for crude vulgar luxury
They corrupt taste
They make everyone round them or near them sycophants and cheats
They substitute money for intelligence and discrimination
They degrade every fine thing in life
Civilization is built up by brains and hard work and along come the rich and rot and ruin it
Mildred and her mother were listening in astonishment
Said the mother Id be ashamed to confess myself such a hypocrite
And I madam would be ashamed to be such a hypocrite without taking a bath of confession afterward retorted Presbury
At least you might have waited until Mildred wasnt in hearing snapped she
I shall marry him if I can said Mildred
And blissfully happy youll be said Presbury
Women ladiestrue ladies like you and your motherhave no sensibilities
All you ask is luxury
If Bill Siddall were a thousand times worse than he is his money would buy him almost any refined delicate lady anywhere in Christendom
Mrs Presbury laughed angrily
YOU talking like thisyou of all men
Is there anything YOU wouldnt stoop to for money
Do you think I laid myself open to that charge by marrying you
said Presbury made cheerful despite his savage indigestion by the opportunity for effective insult she had given him and he had promptly seized
I am far too gallant to agree with you
But Im also too gallant to contradict a lady
By the way you must be careful in dealing with Siddall
Rich people like to be fawned on but not to be slobbered on
You went entirely too far
Mrs Presbury whom indigestion had rendered stupid could think of no reply
So she burst into tears
And my own daughter sitting silent while that man insults her mother
she sobbed
Mildred sat stiff and cold
Itll be a week before I recover from that dinner Presbury went on sourly
What a dinner
What a villainous mess
These vulgar showy rich
That champagne
He said it cost him six dollars a bottle and no doubt it did
I doubt if it ever saw France
The dealers rarely waste genuine wine on such cattle
The winecellars of fine houses the world through are the laughingstock of connoisseurslike their picture galleries and their other attempts to make money do the work of taste
I forgot to put my pills in my bag
Ill have to hunt up an allnight drugstore
Id not dare go to bed without taking an antidote for that poison
But Presbury had not been altogether improvident
He had hoped great things of Bill Siddalls winecellar this despite an almost unbroken series of bitter disillusionments and disappointments in experience with those who had the wealth to buy if they had had the taste to select the fine wines he loved
So resolving to indulge himself he had put into his bag his pair of goutboots
This was a device of his own inventing on which he prided himself
It consisted of a pair of roomy doe skin slippers reenforced with heavy soles and provided with a set of three thin insoles to be used according as the state of his toes made advisable
The cost of the Presbury goutboot had been thanks to patient search for a cheap cobbler something under four dollars this when men paid shoe specialists twenty thirty and even forty dollars a pair for goutboots that gave less comfort
The morning after the dinner at which he had drunk to drown his chagrin and to give him courage and tongue for sycophantry he put on the boots
Without them it would have been necessary to carry him from his room to a cab and from cab to train
With them he was able to hobble to a streetcar
He tried to distract his mind from his sufferings by lashing away without ceasing at his wife and his stepdaughter
When they were once more at home and the mother and daughter escaped from him the mother said I was glad to see that you put up with that wretch and didnt answer him back
Of course said Mildred
Hes mad to be rid of me but if I offended him he might snatch away this chance
He would said Mrs Presbury
Im sure he would
But she laughed viciouslyonce youre married you can revenge yourselfand me
I wonder said Mildred thoughtfully
Why not
exclaimed her mother irritated
I cant make Mr Presbury out replied the girl
I understand why hes helping me to this chance but I dont understand why he isnt making friends with me in the hope of getting something after Im married
Her mother saw the point and was instantly agitated
Perhaps hes simply leading you on intending to up set it all at the last minute
She gritted her teeth
Oh what a wretch
Mildred was not heeding
I must have General Siddall looked up carefully she went on
It may be that he isnt rich or that he has another wife somewhere or that theres some other awful reason why marrying him would be even worse than it seems
Worse than it seems
cried her mother
How CAN you talk so Milly
The general seems to be an ideal husbandsimply ideal
I wish I had your chance
Any sensible woman could love him
A strange look came into the girls face and her mother could not withstand her eyes
Dont mother she said quietly
Either you take me for a fool or you are trying to show me that you have no self respect
I am not deceiving myself about what Im doing
Mrs Presbury opened her lips to remonstrate changed her mind drew a deep sigh
Its frightful to be a woman she said
To be a lady Mr Presbury would say suggested Mildred
After some discussion they fixed upon Joseph Tilker as the best available investigator of General Siddall
Tilker had been head clerk for Henry Gower
He was now in for himself and had offered to look after any legal business Mrs Presbury might have without charging her
He presently reported that there was not a doubt as to the wealth of the little general
There are all sorts of ugly stories about how he made his money said Tilker but all the great fortunes have a scandalous history and I doubt if Siddalls is any worse than the others
I dont see how it well could be
Siddall has the reputation of being a mean and cruel little tyrant
He is said to be pompous vain ignorant Indeed hes not cried Mrs Presbury
Hes a rough diamond but a natural gentleman
Ive met him
Well hes rich enough and that was all you asked me to find out said Tilker
But I must warn you Mrs Presbury not to have any business or intimate personal relations with him
Mrs Presbury congratulated herself on her wisdom in having come alone to hear Tilkers report
She did not repeat any part of it to Mildred except what he had said about the wealth
That she enlarged upon until Mildreds patience gave out
She interrupted with a shrewd Anything else mamma
Anything about him personally
Weve got to judge him in that way for ourselves replied Mrs Presbury
You know how wickedly they lie about anyone who has anything
I should like to read a full account of General Siddall said Mildred reflectively just to satisfy my curiosity
Mrs Presbury made no reply
Presbury had decided that it was best to make no advance but to wait until they heard from Siddall
He let a week ten days go by then his impatience got the better of his shrewdness
He sought admittance to the great man at the offices of the International Metals and Minerals Company in Cedar Street
After being subjected to varied indignities by sundry under strappers he received a message from the general through a secretary The general says hell let you know when hes ready to take up that matter
He says he hasnt got round to it yet
Presbury apologized courteously for his intrusion and went away cursing under his breath
You may be sure that he made his wife and his stepdaughter suffer for what he had been through
Two weeks more passedthreea month
One morning in the mail there arrived this notetype written upon business paper JAMES PRESBURY Esqr
 DEAR SIR General Siddall asks me to present his compliments and to say that he will be pleased if you and your wife and the young lady will dine with him at his house next Thursday the seventeenth at halfpast seven sharp
ROBERT CHANDLESS Secretary
The only words in longhand were the two forming the name of the secretary
Presbury laughed and tossed the note across the breakfast table to his wife
You see what an ignorant creature he is said he
He imagines he has done the thing up in grand style
Hes the sort of man that cant be taught manners because he thinks manners the ordinary civilities are for the lower orders of people
Oh hes a joke is Bill Siddalla horrible joke
Mrs Presbury read and passed the letter to Mildred
She simply glanced at it and returned it to her stepfather
Im just about over that last dinner pursued Presbury
Ill eat little Thursday and drink less
And Id advise you to do the same Mrs
Presbury
He always addressed her as Mrs Presbury because he had discovered that when so addressed she always winced and if he put a certain tone into his voice she quivered
That dinner aged you five years he went on
Besides you drank so much that it went to your head and made you slather him with flatteries that irritated him
He thought you were a fool and no one is stupid enough to like to be flattered by a fool
Mrs Presbury bridled swallowed hard said mildly Well have to spend the night in town again I suppose
You and your daughter may do as you like said Presbury
I shall return here that night
I always catch cold in strange beds
We might as well all return here said Mildred
I shall not wear evening dress that is Ill wear a highneck dress and a hat
She had just got a new hat that was peculiarly becoming to her
She had shown Siddall herself at the best in evening attire another sort of costume would give him a different view of her looks one which she flattered herself was not less attractive
But Presbury interposed an emphatic veto
Youll wear full evening dress said he
Bare neck and arms for men like Bill Siddall
They want to see what theyre getting
Mildred flushed scarlet and her lips trembled as though she were about to cry
In fact her emotion was altogether shamea shame so poignant that even Presbury was abashed and mumbled something apologetic
Nevertheless she wore a lowneck dress on Thursday evening one as daring as the extremely daring fashions of that year permitted an unmarried woman to wear
It seemed to her that Siddall was still more costly and elegantlooking than before though this may have been due to the fact that he always created an impression that in the retrospect of memory seemed exaggerated
It seemed impossible that anyone could be so clean so polished and scoured so groomed and tailored so bedecked so highheeled and loftily coiffed
His mean little countenance with its grotesquely waxed mustache and imperial wore an expression of gracious benignity that assured his guests they need anticipate no disagreeable news
I owe you an apology for keeping you in suspense so long said he
Im a very busy man with interests in all parts of the world
I keep house some of em bigger than thisopen and going in sis different places
I always like to be at home wherever my business takes me
Mrs Presbury rolled her eyes
Isnt that WONDERFUL
she exclaimed
What an interesting life you must lead
Oh soso replied the general
But I get awful lonesome
Im naturally a domestic man
I dont care for friends
Theyre expensive and dangerous
A man in my position is like a king
He cant have friends
So if he hasnt got a family he hasnt got nothanything
Nothing like home life said Presbury
Yes indeed cried Mrs Presbury
The little general smiled upon Mildred sitting pale and silent with eyes downcast
Well I dont intend to be alone much longer if I can help it said he
And I may say that I can make a woman happy if shes the right sortif she has sense enough to appreciate a good husband
This last he said sternly with more than a hint of his past matrimonial misfortunes in his frown and in his voice
The trouble with a great many women is that theyre foolsflighty ungrateful fools
If I married a woman like that Id make short work of her
And shed deserve it General said Mildreds mother earnestly
But youll have no trouble if you select a ladya girl whos been well brought up and has respect for herself
Thats my opinion maam said the general
Im convinced that while a man can become a gentleman a womans got to be born a lady or she never is one
Very true General cried Mrs Presbury
I never thought of it before but its the truest thing I ever heard
Presbury grinned at his plate
He stole a glance at Mildred
Their eyes met
She flushed faintly
Ive had a great deal of experience of women pur sued the general
In my boyhood days I was a ladies man
And of course since Ive had money theyve swarmed round me like bees in a cloverpatch
Oh General youre far too modest cried Mrs Presbury
A man like you wouldnt need to be afraid if he hadnt a cent
But not the kind of women I want replied he firmly if complacently
A lady needs money to keep up her position
She has to have it
On the other hand a man of wealth and station needs a lady to assist him in the proper kind of life for men of his sort
So they need each other
Theyve got to have each other
Thats the practical sensible way to look at it
Exactly said Presbury
And Ive made up my mind to marry and marry right away
But well come back to this later on
Presbury youre neglecting that wine
Im drinking it slowly to enjoy it better said Presbury
The dinner was the same unending and expensive function that had wearied them and upset their digestions on Thanksgiving Day
There was too much of everything and it was all just wrong
The general was not quite so voluble as he had been before his gaze was fixed most of the time on Mildredroving from her lovely face to her smooth slender shoulders and back again
As he drank and ate his gesture of slightly smacking his thin lips seemed to include an enjoyment of the girls charms
And a sensitive observer might have suspected that she was not unconscious of this and was suffering some such pain as if abhorrent and cruel lips and teeth were actually mouthing and mumbling her
She said not a word from sitting down at table until they rose to go into the library for coffee
Do tell me about your early life General Mrs Presbury said
Only the other day Millie was saying she wished she could read a biography of your romantic career
Yes it has been ratherunusual conceded the general with swelling chest and gently waving dollar andahalfapiece cigar
I do so ADMIRE a man who carves out his own fortune Mrs Presbury went onshe had not obeyed her husbands injunction as to the champagne
It seems so wonderful to me that a man could with his own hands just dig a fortune out of the ground
He couldnt maam said the general with gracious tolerance
It wasnt till I stopped the fool digging and hunting around for gold that I began to get ahead
I threw away the pick and shovel and opened a hotel
There were two or three sleepingrooms of a kind in that hotel but it was rather a saloon of the species known as doggery
Yes it was in the hotel that I got my start
The fellows that make the money in mining countries aint the prospectors and diggers maam
Really
cried Mrs Presbury breathlessly
How interesting
Theyre fools they are proceeded the general
No the moneys made by the fellows that grubstake the foolsgive em supplies and send em out to nose around in the mountains
Then them that find any thing have to give half to the fellow that did the grub staking
And he looks into the claim and if theres anything in it why he buys the fool out
In mines like everywhere else maam it aint work its brains that makes the money
No miner ever made a mining fortunenot one
Its the brainy foxy fellows that stay back in the camps
I used to send out fifty and a hundred men a year
Maybe only two or threed turn up anything worth while
No maam I never got a dollar ahead on my digging
All the gold I ever dug went right off for grubor a good time
Wonderful
exclaimed Mrs Presbury
I never heard of such a thing
But were not here to talk about mines said the general his eyes upon Mildred
Ive been looking into mattersto get down to businessand Ive asked you here to let you know that Im willing to go ahead
Profound silence
Mildred suddenly drew in her breath with a sound so sharp that the three others started and glanced hastily at her
But she made no further sign
She sat still and cold and pale
The general perfectly at ease broke the silence
I think Miss Gower and I would get on faster alone
Presbury at once stood up his wife hesitated her eyes uneasily upon her daughter
Presbury said Come on Alice
She rose and preceded him into the adjoining conservatory
The little general posed himself before the huge open fire one hand behind him the other at the level of his waistcoat the big cigar be tween his first and second fingers
Well my dear
said he
Mildred somewhat hesitatingly lifted her eyes but once she had them up their gaze held steadily enough upon histoo steadily for his comfort
He addressed himself to his cigar Im not quite ready to say Im willing to go the limit said he
We dont exactly know each other sufficiently well as yet do we
No said Mildred
Ive been making inquiries he went on that is I had my chief secretary make themand hes a very thorough man thanks to my training
He reports everything entirely all right
I admire dignity and reserve in a woman and you have been very particular
Were you engaged to Stanley Baird
Mildred flushed veiled her eyes to hide their resentful flash at this impertinence
She debated with herself decided that any rebuke short of one that would anger him would be wasted upon him
No said she
That agrees with Hardings report said the general
It was a mere girlish flirtationvery dignified and proper he hastened to add
I dont mean to suggest that you were at all flighty
Thank you said Mildred sweetly
Are there any questions you would like to ask about me
inquired he
No said Mildred
As I understand itfrom my talk with Presbury you are willing to go on
Yes said Mildred
The general smiled genially
I think I may say without conceit that you will like me as you know me better
I have no bad habitsIve too much regard for my health to overindulge or run loose
In my boyhood days I may have put in rather a heavy sowing of wild oatsthe general laughed Mildred conjured up the wintriest and faintest of echoing smilesbut thats all past he went on and theres nothing that could rise up to interfere with our happiness
You are fond of children
A pause then Mildred said quite evenly Yes
Excellent said the general
Ill expect you and your mother and father to dinner Sunday night
Is that satisfactory
Yes said Mildred
A longish pause
Then the general You seem to be a littleafraid of me
I dont know why it is that people are always that way with me
A halt to give her the opportunity to say the obvious flattering thing
Mildred said nothing gave no sign
He went on It will wear away as we know each other better
I am a simple plain mankind and generous in my instincts
Of course I am dignified and I do not like familiarity
But I do not mean to inspire fear and awe
A still longer pause
Well everything is settled said the general
We understand each other clearly
not an engagement nothing binding on either side simply aaan option without forfeit
And he laughedhis laugh was a ghoulish sound not loud but explosive and an instant check upon demonstration of mirth from anyone else
I understand said Mildred with a glance toward the door through which Presbury and his wife had disappeared
Now well join the others and Ill show you the houseagain the laughwhat may be your future homeone of them
The four were soon started upon what was for three of them a weariful journey despite the elevator that spared them the ascents of the stairways
The house was an exaggerated reproduction of all the establishments of the rich who confuse expenditure with luxury and comfort
Bill Siddall had bought the best of everything that is the things into which the purveyors of costly furnishings have put the most excuses for charging
Of taste of comfort of discrimination there were few traces and these obviously accidental
I picked out the men acknowledged to be the best in their different lines said the general and I gave them carte blanche
I see that at a glance said Presbury
Youve done the grand thing on the grandest possible scale
Ive looked into the finest of the famous places on the other side said the general
All I can say is Ive had no regrets
I should say not cried Mrs Presbury
With an affectation of modest hesitationto show that he was a gentleman with a gentlemans fine appreciation of the due of maiden modestySiddall paused at the outer door of his own apartments
But at one sentence of urging from Mrs Presbury he opened the door and ushered them in
And soon he was showing them everythinghis Carrara marble bathroom and bathingpool his bed that had been used by several French kings his dressingroom with its appliances of gold and platinum and precious stones his clothing
They had to inspect a room full of suits huge chiffoniers crowded with shirts and ties and underclothes
He exhibited silk dressingrobes and pajamas pointed out the marks of the fashionable London and Paris makers the monograms the linings of ermine and sable
Im very particular about everything that touches me explained he
It seems to me a gentleman cant be too particular
With a meaning glance at Mildred And Id feel the same way about my wife
You hear that Mildred
said Presbury with a nasty little laugh
He had been relieving the tedium of this sightseeing tour by observingand from time to time aggravatingMildreds sufferings
The general released his mirthstrangling goat laugh Mrs Presbury echoed it with a gale of rather wild hysterics
So well pleased was the general with the excursion and so far did he feel advanced toward intimacy that on the way down the majestic marble stairway he ventured to give Mildreds arm a gentle playful squeeze
And at the parting he kissed her hand
Presbury had changed his mind about returning to the country
On the way to the hotel he girded at Mildred reviewing all that the little general had said and done and sneering jeering at it
Mildred made not a single retort until they were upstairs in the hotel
At the door to her room she said to Presburysaid it in a quiet cold terrible way If you really want me to go through with this thing you will stop insulting him and me
If you do it again Ill give upand go on the streets before Ill marry him
Presbury shrugged his shoulders and went on to the other room
But he did not begin again the next day and from that time forth avoided reference to the general
In fact there was an astonishing change in his whole demeanor
He ceased to bait his wife became polite even affable
If he had conducted himself thus from the outset he would have got far less credit would have made far less progress toward winning the liking of his wife and of her daughter than he did in a brief two weeks of change from petty and malignant tyrant to goodnatured interestingly talkative old gentleman
After the manner of human nature Mildred and her mother in their relief in their pleasure through this amazing sudden and wholly unexpected geniality not merely forgave but forgot all they had suffered at his hands
Mildred was not without a suspicion of the truth that this change inaugurated in his own good time was fresh evidence of his contempt for both of themof his feeling that he could easily make reparation with a little kindness and decency and put himself in the way of getting any possible benefits from the rich alliance
But though she practically knew what was going on in his mind she could not prevent herself from softening toward him
Now followed a succession of dinners of theater and operagoings of weekends at the generals new country palace in the fashionable region of Long Island
All these festivities were of the same formal and tedious character
At all the general was the central sun with the others dim and draggled satellites hardly more important than the outer rim of satellite servants
He did most of the talking he was the sole topic of conversation for when he was not talking about himself he wished to be hearing about himself
If Mildred had not been seeing more and more plainly that other and real personality of his her contempt for him and for herself would have grown beyond control
But with him or away from him at every instant there was the sense of that other real William Siddalla shadowy menace full of terror
She dreamed of itwas startled from sleep by visions of a monstrous and mighty distortion of the little generals grotesque exterior
I shall marry him if I can she said to her self
Butcan I
And she feared and hoped that she could not that courage would fail her or would come to her rescue whichever it was and that she would refuse him
Aside from the sense of her body that cannot but be with any woman who is beautiful she had never theretofore been especially physical in thought
That side of life had remained vague as she had never indulged in or even been strongly tempted with the things that rouse it from its virginal sleep
But now she thought only of her body because that it was and that alone that had drawn this prospective purchaser and his eyes never let her forget it
She fell into the habit of looking at herself in the glass at her face at her shoulders at her whole person not in vanity but in a kind of wonder or aversion
And in the visions both the waking and the sleeping she reached the climax of horror when the monster touched herwith clammy creepy fingers with munching lips with the sharp ends of the mustache or imperial
Said Mrs Presbury to her husband Im afraid the general will be irritated by Mildreds unresponsiveness
Dont worry replied Presbury
Hes so crazy about himself that he imagines the whole world is in the same state
Isnt it strange that he doesnt give her presents
Never anything but candy and flowers
And he never will said Presbury
Not until theyre married I suppose
Presbury was silent
I cant help thinking that if Milly were to rouse herself and show somesome likingor at least interest itd be wiser
Shes taking the best possible course said Presbury
Unconsciously to both of them shes leading him on
He thinks thats the way a lady should act restrained refined
Mildreds attitude was simple inertia
The most positive effort she made was avoiding saying or doing anything to displease himno difficult matter as she was silent and almost lifeless when he was near
Without any encouragement from her he gradually got a deep respect for herwhich meant that he became convinced of her coldness and exclusiveness of her absolute trustworthiness
Presbury was more profoundly right than he knew
The girl pursued the only course that made possible the success she longed for yet dreaded and loathed
For at the outset Siddall had not been nearly so strongly in earnest in his matrimonial project as he had professed and had believed himself
He wished to marry wished to add to his possessions the admirable showpiece and exhibition opportunity afforded by the right sort of wife but in the bottom of his heart he felt that such a woman as he dreamed of did not exist in all the foolish fickle and shallow female sex
This girlso cold so proud beautiful yet not eager to display her charms or to have them praisedshe was the rare bird he sought
In a month he asked her to marry him that is he said My dear I find that I am ready to go the limitif you are
And she assented
He put his arm around her and kissed her cheekand was delighted to discover that the alluring embrace made no impression upon the ice of her purity and ladylike dignity
Up to the very last moment of the formal courtship he held himself ready to withdraw should she reveal to his watchfulness the slightest sign of having any unladylike tendencies or feelings
She revealed no such sign but remained ladylike and certainly so the general reasoned a woman who could thus resist him even in the license of the formal engagement would resist anybody
As soon as the engagement was formally concluded the general hurried on the preparations for the wedding
He opened accounts at half a dozen shops in New Yorkdressmakers milliners dealers in fine and fashionable clothing of every kindand gave them orders to execute whatever commands Miss Gower or her motherfor HERmight give them
When he told her of this munificence and magnificence and paused for the outburst of gratitude he listened in vain
Mildred colored to the roots of her hair and was silent was seeking the courage to refuse
I know that you and your people cant afford to do the thing as things related to me must be done he went on to say
So I decided to just start in a little early at what Ive got to do anyhow
Not that I blame you for your not having money my dear
On the contrary thats one of your merits with me
I wouldnt marry a woman with money
It puts the family life on a wrong basis
I had planned a quiet wedding said Mildred
Id much prefer it
Now you can be frank with me my dear said the general
I know you ladieshow cheated you feel if you arent married with all the frills and fixings
So thats the way it shall be done
Really protested Mildred Im absolutely frank
I wish it to be quite quietin our drawingroom with no guests
Siddall smiled genial and tolerant
Dont argue with me my dear
I know what you want and Ill see that you get it
Go ahead with these shoppeople Ive put at your disposaland go as far as you like
There isnt anythingANYTHINGin the way of clothes that you cant havethat you mustnt have
Mrs General Siddall is going to be the bestdressed woman in the worldas she is the prettiest
I havent opened an account for you with Tiffanys or any of those people
Ill look out for that part of the business myself
I dont care for jewelry said Mildred
Naturally not for the kind thats been within your means heretofore replied he but youll open your eyes when you see MY jewelry for MY wife
All in good time my dear
You and your mother must start right in with the shopping and a week or so before the wedding Ill send my people down to transform the house
I may be wrong but I rather think that the Siddall wedding will cause some talk
He was not wrong
Through his confidential secretary Harding the thorough the newspaper press was induced to take an interest in the incredible extravagance Siddall was perpetrating in arranging for a fitting wedding for General William Siddall
For many days before the ceremony there were daily columns about him and his romantic career and his romantic wooing of the New Jersey girl of excellent family and social position but of comparatively modest means
The shopkeepers gave interviews on the trousseau
The decorators and caterers detailed the splendors and the costliness of the preparations of which they had charge
From morning until dark a crowd hung round the house at Hanging Rock and on the wedding day the streets leading to it were blockedchiefly with people come from a distance many of them from New York
At the outset all this noise was deeply distasteful to Mildred but after a few days she recovered her normal point of view forgot the kind of man she was marry ing in the excitement and exultation over her sudden splendor and fame
So strongly did the delusion presently become that she was looking at the little general with anything but unfavorable eyes
He seemed to her a quaint fascinating benevolent necromancer having miraculous powers which he was exercising in her behalf
She even reproached herself with ingratitude in not being wildly in love with him
Would not any other girl in her place have fallen over ears in love with this marvelous man
However while she could not quite convince herself that she loved she became convinced without effort that she was happy that she was going to be still happier
The excitement wrought her into a state of exaltation and swept her through the wedding ceremony and the going away as radiant a bride as a man would care to have
There is much to be said against the noisy showy wedding
Certainly love has rarely been known to degrade himself to the point of attending any such
But there is something to be said for that sort of married startfor instance where love is neither invited nor desired an effort must be made to cover the painful vacancy his absence always causes
The little generals insistence on a real wedding was most happy for him
It probably got him his bride
III THE intoxication of that wedding held on long enough and strongly enough to soften and blunt the disillusionments of the first few days of the honeymoon
In the prospect that period had seemed even to Mildreds rather unsophisticated imagination appalling beyond her power to endure
In the factthanks in large part to that intoxicationit was certainly not unendurable
A human being even an innocent young girl can usually bear up under any experience to which a human being can be subjected
The general in pajamas of the finest silk and of pigeonsegg blue with a vast gorgeous monogram on the pocketwas more grotesque rather than more repellent than the general in morning or evening attire
Also hethat is his expert staff of providers of luxuryhad arranged for the bride a series of the most ravishing sensations in whisking her like the heroine of an Arabian Nights tale from straitened circumstances to the very paradise of luxury
The generals ideas on the subject of woman were old fashioned of the hardshell variety
Woman was made for luxury and luxury was made for woman
His woman must be the most divinely easeful of the luxurious
At all times she must be fit and ready for any and every sybaritic idea that might enter her husbands headand other purpose she had none
When she was not directly engaged in ministering to his joy she must be busy preparing herself for his next call upon her
A woman was a luxury was the luxury of luxuries must have and must use to their uttermost all capacities for gratifying his senses and his vanity
Alone with him she must make him constantly feel how rich and rare and expensive a prize he had captured
When others were about she must be constantly making them envy and admire him for having exclusive rights in such wonderful preserves
All this with an inflexible devotion to the loftiest ideals of chastity
But the first realizations of her husbands notions as to women were altogether pleasant
As she entered the automobile in which they went to the private car in the special train that took them to New York and the steameras she entered that new and prodigally luxurious automobile she had a first keen sense of her changed position
Then there was the superb private carher car since she was his wifeand there was the beautiful suite in the magnificent steamer
And at every instant menials thrusting attentions upon her addressing her as if she were a queen revealing in their nervous tones and anxious eyes their eagerness to please their fear of displeasing
And on the steamer from New York to Cherbourg she was never permitted to lose sight of the material splendors that were now hers
All the servants all the passengers reminded her by their looks their tones
At Paris in the hotel in the restaurants in the shopsespecially in the shops those snobbish instincts that are latent in the sanest and the wisest of us were fed and fattened and pampered until her head was quite turned
And the general began to buy jewels for her
Such jewels ropes of diamonds and pearls and emeralds rings such as she had never dreamed existed
Those shopping excursions of theirs in the Rue de la Paix would make such a tale as your ordinary simple citizen ignorant of the worlds resources in luxury and therefore incredulous about them would read with a laugh at the extravagance of the teller
Before the intoxication of the wedding had worn away it was reenforced by the intoxication of the honey moonnot an intoxication of loves providing but one exceeding potent in its influence upon our weak human brains and hearts one from which the strongest of us instead of sneering at poor Mildred would better be praying to be delivered
At her marriage she had a few hundred dollars left of her patrimonythree hundred and fifty and odd to be more exact
She spent a little money of her own here and therein tips in buying presents for her mother in picking up trifles for her own toilet
The day came when she looked in her purse and found two onefranc pieces a fiftyfranc note and a few coppers
And suddenly she sat back and stared her mouth open like her almost empty gold bag which the general had bought her on their first day in the Rue de la Paix
About ten dollars in all the world and the general had forgotten to speakor to make any arrangement at least any arrangement of which she was awareabout a further supply of money
They had been married nearly a month
He knew that she was poor
Why hadnt he said something or better still DONE something
Doubtless he had simply forgotten
But since he had forgotten for a month might he not continue to forget
True he had himself been poor at one time in his life very poor and that for a long time
But it had been so many years ago that he had probably lost all sense of the meaning of poverty
She frowned at this evidence of his lack of the finer sensibilitiesby no means the first time that lack had been disagreeably thrust upon her
Soon she would be without moneyand she must have money not much as all the serious expenses were looked after by the general but still a little money
How could she get it
How could she remind him of his neglect without seeming to be indelicate
It was a difficult problem
She worked at it more and more continuously and irritably and nervously as the days went by and her fiftytwo francs dwindled to five
She lay awake planning long and elaborate conversations that would imperceptibly lead him up to where he must see what she needed without seeing that he had been led
She carried out these ingenious conversations
She led him along he docilely and unsuspectingly following
She brought him up to where it seemed to her impossible for any human being endowed with the ordinary faculties to fail to see what was so plainly in view
All in vain
General William Siddall gazed placidlyand saw nothing
Several days of these failures and with her funds reduced to a fiftycentime piece and a twosous copper she made a frontal attack
When they went forth for the days shopping she left her gold bag behind
After an hour or so she said Ive got to go to the Galleries Lafayette for some little things
I shant ask you to sacrifice yourself
I know you hate those stuffy smelly big shops
Very well said he
Ill use the time in a call on my bankers
As they were about to separate she taking the motor and he walking she made a face of charming dismay and said How provoking
Ive left my bag at the hotel
Instead of the expected prompt offer of money he said Itll only take you a minute or so to drive there
But its out of the way she replied
Ill need only a hundred francs or so
Said he Ive an account at the Bon Marche
Go there and have the things charged
Its much the best big shop in Paris
Very well was all she could trust herself to say
She concealed her anger beneath a careless smile and drove away
How dense he was
Could anything be more exasperatingor more disagreeable
What SHOULD she do
The situation was intolerable yet how could it be ended except by a humiliating direct request for money
She wondered how young wives habitually dealt with this problem when they happened to marry husbands so negligent not to say underbred as to cause them the awkwardness and the shame
There followed several days during which the money idea was an obsession nagging and grinning at her every in stant
The sight of money gave her a peculiar itching sensation
When the little general paid for anything always drawing out a great sheaf of bank notes in doing itshe flushed hot and cold her glance fell guiltily and sought the money furtively
At last her desperation gave birth to an inspiration
About her and the general or rather about the general revolved the usual rich mans small army of satellites of various degreessecretaries butlers footmen valets other servants male and female some of them supposed to be devoted entirely to her service but all in fact looking ever to the little general
The members of this company regardless of differences of rank and pay were banded together in a sort of democratic fellowship talking freely with one another on terms of perfect equality
She herself had curiously gotten on excellent terms with this motley fraternity and found no small relief from the strain of the generals formal dignity in talking with them with a freedom and ease she had never before felt in the society of underlings
The most conspicuous and most agreeable figure in this company was Harding the generals factotum
Why not lay the case before Harding
He was notably sensible and sympatheticand discreet
The following day she did so
Said she blushing furiously Mr Harding I find myself in a very embarrassing position
I wonder if you can help me
Harding a young man and of one of the best blond types said No doubt I canand Ill be glad to
The fact is Her voice was trembling with nervousness
She opened the gold bag took out the little silver pieces and the big copper piece extended her pink palm with them upon ittheres all Ive got left of the money I brought with me
Harding gazed at the exhibit tranquilly
He was chiefly remarkable for his perfect selfpossession
Said he Do you wish me to cash a check for you
The stupidity of men
Tears of vexation gathered in her eyes
When she could speak she faltered No
He was looking at her nowa grave kind glance
She somehow felt encouraged and heartened
She went on I was hopingthatthat the gen that my husband had said something to you and that you perhaps had not thought to say anything to me
Their glances met his movingly sympathetic and understanding hers piteously forlornthe look of a lovely girl stranded and friendless in a far strange land
Presently he said gently Yes he told me to say something to youif you should speak to me about this matter
His tone caused in her heart a horrible stillness of suspense
He went on He saidI give you his exact words If my wife should ask you for money tell her my ideas on the subject
 A pause
She started up crimson her glance darting nervously this way and that to avoid his
Never mind
Really its of no importance
Thank you Ill get on very wellIm sorry to have troubled you Pardon me Mrs Siddall he interposed but I think youd best let me finish
She started to protest she tried to move toward the door
Her strength failed her she sat down waited nervously clasping and unclasping the costly jewel embroidered bag
He has explained to me many times continued Harding that he believes women do not understand the value of money and ought not to be trusted with it
He proposes to provide everything for you every comfort and luxuryI am using his own language Mrs Siddalland he has open accounts at the principal shops in every city where you will goNew York Washington Chicago Denver Paris London Rome
He says you are at liberty to get practically anything you please at these shops and he will pay the bills
He thus entirely spares you the necessity of ever spending any money
Should you see anything you wish at some shop where he has no account you can have it sent collect and I or my assistant Mr Drawl will settle for it
All he asks is that you use discretion in this freedom
He says it would be extremely painful to him to have to withdraw it
Harding had pronounced this long speech in a dry monotonous voice like one reading mechanically from a dull book
As Mildred listened her thoughts began to whirl about the central idea until she fell into a kind of stupor
When he finished she was staring vacantly at the bag in her lapthe bag she was holding open wide
Harding continued He also instructed me to say something about his formerhis experiences
The first Mrs Siddall he married when he was very young and poor
As he grew rich she became madly extravagant
And as they had started on a basis on which she had free access to his money he could not check her
The result finally was a succession of bitter quarrels and they were about to divorce when she died
He made the second Mrs Siddall an allowance a liberal allowance
Her follies compelled him to withdraw it
She resorted to underhanded means to get money from him without his knowing it
He detected the fraud
After a series of disagreeable incidents she committed the indiscretion which caused him to divorce her
He says that these experiences have convinced him that The second Mrs Siddall interrupted Mildred is she still alive
Harding hesitated
Yes he said reluctantly
Is shepoor
asked Mildred
I should prefer not to Did the general forbid you to tell me
On the contrary he instructed me But Id rather not talk about it Mrs
Siddall
Is she poor
repeated Mildred
Yes
What became of her
A long pause
Then Harding said She was a poor girl when the general married her
After the divorce she lived for a while with the man
But he had nothing
They separated
She tried various kinds of workand other things
Since she lost her looks She writes from time to time asking for money
Which she never gets
said Mildred
Which she never gets said Harding
Lately she was cashier or head waitress in a cheap restaurant in St
Louis
After a long silence Mildred said I understand
I understand
She drew a long breath
I shall understand better as time goes on but I understand fairly well now
I need not tell you Mrs Siddall said Harding in his gentle tranquil way that the general is the kindest and most generous of men but he has his own methods as who has not
Mildred had forgotten that he was therenot a difficult matter when he had in its perfection the secretarial manner of complete selfeffacement
Said she reflectively like one puzzling out a difficult problem He buys a woman as he buys a dog or a horse
He does not give his dog his horse pocketmoney
Why should he give his woman pocketmoney
Will it help matters Mrs Siddall to go to the other extreme and do him a grave injustice
She did not hear
At the picture presented to her mind by her own thoughts she gave a short satirical laugh
How stupid of me not to have understood from the outset said she
Why Ive often heard of this very thing
It is more and more the custom among men of large property I believe said Harding
Perhaps Mrs Siddall you would not blame them if you were in their position
The rich men who are carelessthey ruin everybody about them I assure you
Ive seen it again and again
But the young wife was absorbed in her own thoughts
Harding feeling her mood did not interrupt
After a while she said I must ask you some questions
These jewels the general has been buying Harding made a movement of embarrassment and protest
She smiled ironically and went on One moment please
Every time I wish to wear any of them I have to go to him to get them
He asks me to return them when I am undressing
He says it is safer to keep everything in his strong box
I have been assuming that that was the only reason
I begin to suspect Am I right Mr
Harding
Really I cant say Mrs Siddall said Harding
These are not matters to discuss with me if you will permit me to say so
Oh yes they are replied she laughingly
Arent we all in the same boatall employes of the general
Harding made no reply
Mildred was beside herself with a kind of rage that because outlet was necessary and because raving against the little general would be absolutely futile found outlet in selfmockery and reckless sarcasm
I understand about the jewels too she went on
They are not mine
Nothing is mine
Everything including myself belongs to him
If I give satisfaction in the position for which Ive been hired for my board and clothes I may continue to eat the generals food and sleep in the generals house and wear the generals jewels and dresses and ride in the generals traps and be waited on by the generals servants
If I dont like my place or he doesnt like my way of filling itshe laughed merrily mockinglyout I gointo the streetsafter the second Mrs Siddall
And the general will hire a new She paused cast about for a word in vain appealed to the secretary What would you call it Mr
Harding
Harding rose looking at her with a very soothing tranquillity
If I were you Mrs Siddall said he I should get into the auto and go for a long drive out to the Boisout to Versaillesa long long drive
I should be gone four or five hours at least and I should look at the thing from all sides
Especially Id look at it from HIS standpoint
Mildred somewhat quieter but still mocking said If I should decide to quit would my expenses be paid back to where I was engaged
I fancy not
Harding looked grave
If you had had money enough to pay your own expenses about would you have married him
said he
Isnt he payingpaying liberally Mrs Siddallfor ALL he gets
Mildred stung drew herself up haughtily gave him a look that reminded him who she was and who he was
But Harding was not impressed
You said a moment agotrulythat we are all in the same boat observed he
I put those questions to you because I honestly wish to help youbecause I wish you not to act foolishly hastily
Thank you Mr Harding said Mildred coldly
And with a slight nod she went angry and ashamed that she had so unaccountably opened up her secret soul bared its ugly wounds before a man she knew so slightly a man in a position but one remove from menial
However she took his advicenot as to trying to view the matter from all sides for she was convinced that there was only the one side but as to calming herself by a long drive alone in the woods and along quiet roads
When she returned she was under control once more
She found the general impatiently awaiting her
Many packages had comefrom the jewelers from the furriers from a shop whose specialty was the thinnest and most delicate of handmade underwear
The general loved to open and inspect finery for her loved it more than he loved inspecting finery for himself because feminine finery was far more attractive than masculine
To whet his pleasure to the keenest she must be there to admire with him to try on to exhibit
As she entered the salon where the little man was fussing about among the packages their glances met
She saw that Harding had told himat least in discreet outlineof their conversation
She also saw that if she reopened the subject she would find herself straightway whirled out upon a stormy sea of danger that might easily overwhelm her flimsy boat
She silently and sullenly dropped into her place she ministered to the generals pleasure in packages of finery
But she did not exclaim or admire or respond in any way
The honeymoon was over
Her dream of wifehood was dissipated
She understood now the look she so often had seen on the faces of rich mens poor wives driving in state in Fifth Avenue
That night as she inspected herself in the glass while the generals maid for her brushed her long thick hair she saw the beginnings of that look in her own face
I dont know just what I am she said to herself
But I do know what I am not
I am not a wife
She sent away the maid and sat there in the dressing room before the mirror waiting her glance traveling about and noting the profuse and prodigal luxury
In the corner stood a circular rack loaded with dressing gownsmore than a score of exquisite combinations of silk and lace or silk and chiffon
It so happened that there was nowhere in sight a single article of her apparel or for her toilet that was not bought with the generals money
No there were some hairpins that she had paid for herself and a comb with widely separated teeth that she had chanced to see in a window when she was alone one day
Anything else
Yes a twofranc box of pins
And that was all
Everything else belonged to the general
In the closets in the trunksall the generals part of the trousseau he had paid for
Not an undergarment not an outer garment not a hat or a pair of shoes not a wrap not a pair of gloves
All the generals
He was in the door of the dressingroomthe small wiry figure in rosesilk pajamas
The mustache and imperial were carefully waxed as always day and night
On the little feet were highheeled slippers
On the head was a rosesilk Neapolitan nightcap with gay tassel
The nightcap hid the bald spot from which the lofty toupee had been removed
A grotesque little figure but not grotesque to her
Through the mask of the vain boastful little face she saw the general watching her as she had seen him that afternoon when she came inthe mysterious and terrible personality that had made the vast fortune that had ridden ruthlessly over friend and foe over man and woman and childto the goal of its desires
Its late my dear
said the little man
Come to bed
She rose to obeyshe in the generals purchases of filmy nightgown under a palepink silk dressinggown
He smiled with that curious noiseless mumbling and smacking of the thin lips
She sat down again
Dont keep me waiting
Its chilly he said advancing toward her
I shall sleep in here tonighton the couch said she
She was trembling with fright at her own audacity
She could see a fiftycentime piece and a copper dancing before her eyes
She felt horribly alone and weak but she had no desire to retract the words with which she had thrown down the gauntlet
The little general halted
The mask dropped the man the monster looked at her
Whats the matter
said he in an ominously quiet voice
Mr Harding delivered your message today said she and her steady voice astonished her
So I am going back home
He waited looking steadily at her
After he told me and I thought about it I decided to submit but just now I saw that I couldnt
I dont know what possesses me
I dont know what Im going to do or how Im going to do it
But its all over between us
She said this rapidly fluently in a decisive way quite foreign to her character as she had thought it
You are coming to bed where you belong said he quietly
No replied she pressing herself against her chair as if force were being used to drag her from it
She cast about for something that would make yielding impossible
You arerepulsive to me
He looked at her without change of countenance
Said he Come to bed
I ask you for the last time
There was no anger in his voice no menace either open or covert simply finalitythe last word of the man who had made himself feared and secure in the miningcamps where the equation of personal courage is straightway applied to every situation
Mildred shivered
She longed to yield to stammer out some excuse and obey him
But she could not nor was she able to rise from her chair
She saw in his hard eyes a look of astonishment of curiosity as to this unaccountable defiance in one who had seemed docile who had apparently no alternative but obedience
He was not so astonished at her as she was at herself
What is to become of me
her terrorstricken soul was crying
I must do as he saysI mustyet I cannot
And she looked at him and sat motionless
He turned away moved slowly toward the door halted at the threshold to give her time was gone
A fit of trembling seized her she leaned forward and rested her arms upon the dressingtable or she would have fallen from the chair to the floor
Yet even as her fear made her sick and weak she knew that she would not yield
The cold drove her to the couch to lie under half a dozen of the dressinggowns and presently to fall into a sleep of exhaustion
When she awoke after what she thought was a few minutes of unconsciousness the clamor of traffic in the Rue de Rivoli startled her
She started up glanced at the clock on the chimneypiece
It was ten minutes past nine
When by all the rules governing the action of the nerves she ought to have passed a wakeful night she had overslept more than an hour
Indeed she had had the first sound and prolonged sleep that had come to her since the honeymoon began for until then she had slept alone all her life and the new order had almost given her chronic insomnia
She rang for her maid and began to dress
The maid did not come
She rang again and again apparently the bell was broken
She finished dressing and went out into the huge grandly and gaudily furnished salon
Harding was at a carved oldgold and lacquer desk writing
As she entered he rose and bowed
Wont you please call one of the servants
said she
I want my coffee
I guess the bell in my room is broken
My maid doesnt answer
No the bell is not broken said Harding
She looked at him questioningly
The general has issued an order that nothing is to be done in this apartment and nothing served unless he personally authorizes it
Mildred paled drew herself up in what seemed a gesture of haughtiness but was an effort to muster her strength
To save herself from the humiliation of a breakdown before him she hastily retreated by the way she had come
After perhaps a quarter of an hour she reappeared in the salon she was now dressed for the street
Harding looked up from his writing rose and bowed gravely
Said she I am going out for a walk
Ill be back in an hour or so
One moment said Harding halting her as she was opening the door into the public hall
The general has issued an order that if you go out you are not to be allowed to return
Her hand fell from the knob
With flashing eyes she cried But that is impossible
It is his orders said Harding in his usual quiet manner
And as he pays the bills he will be obeyed
She debated
Against her will her trembling hand sought the knob again
Against her will her weak arm began to draw the door open
Harding came toward her stood before her and looked directly into her eyes
His eyes had dread and entreaty in them but his voice was as always when he said You know him Mrs
Siddall
Yes she said
The reason he has got ALL he wantedwhatever he wantedis that he will go to any length
Every other human being almost has a limit beyond which they will not goa physical fear or a moral fear or a fear of public opinion
But the generalhe has no limit
Yes she said
And deathly pale and almost stag gering she drew open the door and went out into the public hall
For Gods sake Mrs
Siddall
cried Harding in great agitation
Come in quickly
They are watching they will tell him
Are you mad
I think I must be said she
I am sick with fear
I can hardly keep from dropping down here in a faint
Yet a strange look a mingling of abject terror and passionate defiance gave her an aspect quite insane I am going
Perhaps I too have no limit
And she went along the corridor past a group of gaping and frightened servants down the stairway and out by the private entrance for the grand apartments of the hotel in the Rue Raymond de lIsle
She crossed the Rue de Rivoli and entered the Tuileries Gardens
It was only bracingly cool in the sunshine of that winter day
She seated herself on a chair on the terrace to regain her ebbed strength
Hardly had she sat down when the woman collector came and stood waiting for the two sous for the chair
Mildred opened her bag found two coins
She gave the coppers to the woman
The otherall the money she hadwas the fiftycentime piece
But the bagI can get a good deal for that she said aloud
I beg your pardonI didnt catch that
She came back to a sense of her surroundings
Stanley Baird was standing a few feet away smiling down at her
He was if possible even more attractively dressed than in the days when he hovered about her hoping vague things of which he was ashamed and try ing to get the courage to put down his snobbishness and marry her because she so exactly suited him
He was wearing a new kind of collar and tie striking yet in excellent quiet taste
Also his face and figure had filled out just enoughhe had been too thin in the former days
But he was now entered upon that period of the fearsome forties when unless a man amounts to something he begins to look insignificant
He did not amount to anything he was therefore paling and waning as a personality
Was I thinking aloud
said Mildred as she gave him her hand
You said something about getting a good deal
 He inspected her with the freedom of an old friend and with the thoroughness of a connoisseur
Women who took pains with themselves and were satisfied with the results liked Stanley Bairds knowing and appreciative way of noting the best points in their toilets
Youre looking fine declared he
It must be a pleasure to them up in the Rue de la Paix to dress you
Thats more than can be said for nine out of ten of the women who go there
Yes youre looking fineand in grand health too
Why you look younger than I ever saw you
Nothing like marriage to freshen a girl up
Well I suppose waiting round for a husband who may or may not turn up does wear a woman down
It almost killed me laughed Mildred
And you were largely responsible
I
said Baird
You didnt want me
I was too old for you
No I didnt want you said Mildred
But you spoiled me
I couldnt endure the boys of my own age
Stanley was remembering that Mildred had married a man much older than he
With some notion of a careless sort of tact in mind he said I was betwixt and betweenneither young enough nor old enough
Youve married too since we met
By the way thank you again for that charming remembrance
You always did have such good taste
But why didnt you come to the weddingyou and your wife
He laughed
We were busy busting up said he
You hadnt heard
Its been in the papers
Shes gone back to her people
Oh nothing disgraceful on either side
Simply that we bored each other to death
She was crazy about horses and dogs and that set
I think the stables the place for horsesdont care to have em parading through the house all the time every room every meal sleeping and waking
And dogs the infernal brutes always have fleas
Fleas only tickled her but they bite meraise welts and hills
Theres your husband now isnt it
Baird was looking up at the windows of the Continental across the street
Mildreds glance slowly and carelessly followed his
At one window stood the little general gazing abstractedly out over the gardens
At another window Mildred saw Harding at a third her maid at a fourth Hardings assistant Drawl at a fifth three servants of the retinue
Except the general all were looking at her
Youve married a very extraordinary man said Baird in a correct tone of admiration
One of the ablest and most interesting men weve got I think
So you are free again
said Mildred looking at him with a queer cold smile
Yes and no replied Stanley
I hope to be entirely free
Its her move next
Im expecting it every day
But Im thoroughly respectable
Wont you and the general dine with me
Thanks but Im sailing for home tomorrow or next day
Thats interesting said Baird with enthusiasm
So am I
What ship do you go on
I dont know yet
Im to decide this afternoon after lunch
She laughed
Im sitting here waiting for someone to ask me to lunch
Ive not had even coffee yet
Lunch with me
cried Baird
Ill go get the generalI know him slightly
I didnt say anything about the general said Mildred
Stanley smiled apologetically
It wouldnt do for you to go about with menot when my missus is looking for grounds for divorce
Why not
said Mildred
Sos my husband
You busted up too
Now thats what I call jolly
And he cast a puzzled glance up at the abstracted general
I say Mildred this is no place for either of us is it
Id rather be where theres food confessed she
You think its a joke but I assure you Oh you WERE jokingabout YOUR bustup
No indeed she assured him
I walked out a while ago and I couldnt go back if I wouldand I dont think I would if I could
Thats foolish
Better go back advised he
He was preparing hastily to decamp from so perilous a neighborhood
One marriage is about like another once you get through the surface
Im sure youll be better off thanback with your stepfather
Ive no intention of going to his house she declared
Oh theres your brother
I forgot
So had I forgotten him
Ill not go there either
In fact Ive not thought where Ill go
You seem to have done mighty little thinking before you took a very serious step for a woman
He was uneasily eying the rigid abstracted little figure a story up across the way
Those things arent a question of thinking said she absently
I never thought in my lifedont think I could if I tried
But when the time came I I walked out
She came back to herself laughed
I dont understand why Im telling you all this especially as youre mad with fright and wild to get away
Well goodby Stanley
He lifted his hat
Goodby
Well meet when we can do so without my getting a scandal on you
He walked a few paces turned and came back
By the way Im sailing on the Deutschland
I thought youd like to knowso that you and I wouldnt by any chance cross on the same boat
Thanks said she dryly
Whats the matter
asked he arrested despite his anxiety to be gone by the sad scornful look in her eyes
Nothing
Why
You had such asuch a queer look
Really
Goodby
In fact she had thoughthad hoped for the sake of her liking for himthat he had come back to make the glaringly omitted offer of help that should have come from any human being learning that a fellow being was in the precarious position in which she had told him she was
Not that she would have accepted any such offer
Still she would have liked to have heard the kindly words
She sat watching his handsome graceful figure draped in the most artistically cut of long dark overcoats until he disappeared in the crowd in the Rue de Castiglione
Then without a glance up at the interested not to say excited windows of the generals splendid and spreading apartments she strolled down the gardens toward the Place Concorde
In Paris the beautiful on a bright and brisk day it is all but impossible to despair when one still has left youth and health
Mildred was not happyfar from it
The future the immediate future pressed its terrors upon her
But in mitigation there was perhaps born of youth and inexperience a giddy sense of relief
She had not realized how abhorrent the general was married life with the general
She had been resigning herself to it accepting it as the only thing possible keeping it heavily draped with her vanities of wealth and luxuryuntil she discovered that the wealth and the luxury were in reality no more hers than they were her maids
And now she was free
That word free did not have its full meaning for her
She had never known what real freedom was women of the comfortable classand men too for that matter usually are born into the petty slavery of conventions at least and know nothing else their whole lives throughnever know the joy of the thought and the act of a free mind and a free heart
Still she was released from a bondage that seemed slavish even to her and the release gave her a sensation akin to the joy of freedom
A heavy hand that was crushing her very soul had been lifted offno FLUNG off and by herself
That thought terrifying though it was also gave her a certain new and exalting selfrespect
After all she was not a worm
She must have somewhere in her the germs of something less contemptible than the essential character of so many of the eminently respectable women she knew
She could picture them in the situation in which she had found herself
What would they have done
Why what every instinct of her education impelled her to do what some latent love of freedom some unsuspected courage of selfrespect had forbidden her to do had withheld her from doing
Her thoughts and the gorgeous sunshine and her youth and health put her in a steadily less cheerless mood as by a roundabout way she sought the shop of the jeweler who sold the general the gold bag she had selected
The proprietor himself was in the front part of the shop and received Madame la Generale with all the honors of her husbands wealth
She brought no experience and no natural trading talent to the enterprise she was about to undertake so she went directly to the main point
This bag said she laying it upon the glass between them I bought it here a short time ago
I remember perfectly madame
It is the handsomest the most artistic we have sold this year
I wish to sell it back to you said she
You wish to get something else and include it as part payment madame
No I wish to get the money for it
Ah but that is difficult
We do not often make those arrangements
Secondhand articles But the bag is quite new
Anyhow it must have some value
Of course Id not expect the full price
The jeweler smiled
The full price
Ah madame we should not think of offering it again as it is
We should No matter interrupted Mildred
The mans expressionthe normally pleasant and agreeable countenance turned to repulsive by craft and lyingmade her eager to be gone
What is the most you will give me
I shall have to consider Ive only a few minutes
Please do not irritate me
The man was studying her countenance with a desperate look
Why was she the bride of the monstrously rich American why was she trying to sell the bag
Did it mean the end of her resources
Or were there still huge orders to be got from her
His shrewd ness trained by thirty years of dealing with all kinds of luxurious human beings went exploring in vain
He was alarmed by her frown
He began hesitatingly The jewels and the gold are only a small part of the value
The chief value is the unique design so elegant yet so simple
For the jewels and the gold perhaps two thousand francs The purse was twelve thousand francs interrupted she
Perfectly madame
But I am in great haste
How much will you give me
The most would be four thousand I fear
I shall count up more carefully if madame will No four thousand will do
I will send the money to madame at her hotel
The Continental is it not
No I must have it at once
The jeweler hesitated
Mildred flushing scarlet with shamebut he luckily thought it angertook up the bag and moved toward the door
Pardon madame but certainly
Do you wish some gold or all notes
Notes answered she
Fifty and hundredfranc notes
A moment later she was in the street with the notes in a small bundle in the bosom of her wrap
She went hurriedly up the street
As she was about to turn the corner into the boulevard she on impulse glanced back
An automobile had just drawn up at the jewelers door and General Siddalltophat sablelined overcoat waxed mustache and imperial highheeled boots gold mounted canewas descending
And she knew that he had awakened to his one oversight and was on his way to repair it
But she did not know that the jeweler old and wise in human wayswould hastily vanish with the bag and that an assistant would come forward with assurances that madame had not been in the shop and that if she should come in no business would be negotiated without the generals express consent
She all but fainted at the narrowness of her escape and fled round into the boulevard
She entered a taxi and told the man to drive to Foyots restaurant on the left bank where the general would never think of looking for her
When she had breakfasted she strolled in the Luxembourg Gardens in even better humor with herself and with the world
There was still that horridfaced future but it was not leering into her very face
It was nearly four thousand francs awayand if I hadnt been so stupid Id have got eight thousand Im sure she said
But she was rather proud of a stupidity about money matters
And four thousand francs eight hundred dollarsthat was quite a good sum
She had an instinct that the general would do something disagreeable about the French and English ports of departure for America
But perhaps he would not think of the Italian ports
That night she set out for Genoa and three days later in a different dress and with her hair done as she never wore it sailed as Miss Mary Stevens for America on a German Mediterranean boat
She had taken the whole of a cabin on the quieter deck below the promenade paying for it nearly half of what was left of the four thousand francs
The first three days she kept to her cabin except at the dinnerhour when she ventured to the deck just outside and walked up and down for exercise
Then followed four days of nasty weather during which she did not leave her bed
As the sea calmed she wretched and reckless had a chair put for herself under her window and sat there veiled and swathed and turning her face away whenever a rare wandering passenger happened to pass along
Toward noon a man paused before her to light a cigarette
She forgetting for the moment her precautions looked at him
It chanced that he looked at her at exactly the same instant
Their glances met
He started nervously moved on a few steps returned
Said she mockingly You know you neednt speak if you dont want to Stanley
There isnt a soul on board that anybody ever knew or that ever knew anybody said he
So why not
And you look horribly bored
Unspeakably replied Baird
Ive spoken to no one since I left Paris
What are you doing on this ship
inquired she
To be perfectly honest said he I came this way to avoid you
I was afraid youd take passage on my steamer just to amuse yourself with my nervousness
Andhere you are
Amusing myself with your nervousness
But Im not nervous
Theres no danger
Will you let me have a chair put beside yours
It will be a charity on your part said she
When he was comfortably settled he explained his uneasiness
I see Ive got to tell you said he for I dont want you to think me a shouting ass
The fact is my wife wants to get a divorce from me and to soak me for big alimony
Shes a woman wholl do anything to gain her end andwell for some reason shes always been jealous of you
I didnt care to get into trouble or to get you into trouble
Im traveling as Mary Stevens said Mildred
No one knows Im aboard
Oh Im sure were quite safe
We can enjoy the rest of this voyage
A sea voyage not merely induces but compels a feeling of absolute detachment from the world
To both Stanley and Mildred their affairsthe difficulties in which they were involved on terra firmaceased for the time to have any reality
The universe was nothing but a vast stretch of water under a vast stretch of sky the earth and the things thereof were a retrospect and a foreboding
Without analyzing it both he and she felt that they were freefree from cares from responsibilitiesfree to amuse themselves
And they proceeded to enjoy themselves in the necessarily quiet and limited way imposed by the littleness of their present world and the meagerness of the resources
As neither had the kind of mind that expands in abstractions they were soon talking in the most intimate and personal way about themselveswere confessing things which neither would have breathed to anyone on land
It was the man who set the example of breaking through the barriers of conventional restraint perhaps of delicacy though it must be said that human beings are rarely so fine in their reticences as the theory of refinement would have us believe
Said Stanley after the preliminaries of partial confidence and halting avowal that could not be omitted even at sea by a man of gentlemanly instinct I dont know why I shouldnt own up
I know youll never tell anybody
Fact is I and my wife were never in love with each other for a second
We married because we were in the same set and because our incomes together gave us enough to do the thing rather well
After a solemn pause
I was in love with another womanone I couldnt marry
But Ill not go into that
As for my wife I dont think she was in love with anyone
Shes as cold as a stone
Mildred smiled ironically
Baird saw and flushed
At least she was to me
I was ready to make a sort of bluff
You see a man feels guilty in those circumstances and doesnt want to humiliate a woman
But she he laughed unpleasantlyshe wasnt bothering about MY feelings
Thats a nice selfish little way you ladies have
She probably saw through you and hated you for playing the hypocrite to her said Mildred
You may be right I never thought of that confessed he
She certainly had a vicious way of hammering the other woman indirectly
Not that she ever admitted being jealous
I guess she knew
Everybody usually knows everything
And there was a great deal of talk about you and me said Mildred placidly
I didnt say it was you protested Stanley reddening
No matter said Mildred
Dont bother about that
Its all past and gone
Well at any rate my marriage was the mistake of my life
Im determined that she shant trip me up and trim me for any alimony
And as matters stand she cant
She left me of her own accord
Then said Mildred thoughtfully if the wife leaves of her own accord she cant get alimony
Certainly notnot a cent
I supposed so said she
Im not sure Id take it if I could get it
Still I suppose I would
She laughed
Whats the use of being a hypocrite with oneself
I know I would
All I could get
Then you had no LEGAL excuse for leaving
No said she
Ijust bolted
I dont know whats to become of me
I seem not to care at present but no doubt I shall as soon as we see land again
Youll go back to him said Stanley
No replied she without emphasis or any accent whatever
Sure you will rejoined he
Its your living
What else can you do
Thats what I must find out
Surely theres something else for a woman besides such a married life as mine
I cant and wont go back to my husband
And I cant and wont go to the house at Hanging Rock
Those two things are settled
You mean that
Absolutely
And Ive gotless than three hundred and fifty dollars in the whole world
Baird was silent
He was roused from his abstraction by gradual consciousness of an ironical smile on the face of the girl for she did not look like a married woman
You are laughing at me
Why
inquired he
I was reading your thoughts
You think youve frightened me
Naturally
Isnt a confession such as I made enough to frighten a man
It sounded as though I were getting ready to ask alms
So it did said he
But I wasnt thinking of it in that way
You WILL be in a frightful fix pretty soon wont you
It looks that way
But you need not be uneasy
Oh I want to help you
Ill do everything I can
I was trying to think of something you could make money at
I was thinking of the stage but I suppose youd balk at that
Ill admit it isnt the life for a lady
But the same things true of whatever money can be made at
If I were you Id go back
If I were myself Id go back said Mildred
But Im not myself
You will be again as soon as you face the situation
No said she slowly no I shall never be myself again
But you could have everything a woman wants
Except of courseperhaps But you never struck me as being especially sentimental
Sentiment has nothing to do with it rejoined she
Do you think I could get a place on the stage
Oh youd have to study a while I suppose
But I cant afford that
If I could afford to study Id have my voice trained
Bairds face lighted up with enthusiasm
The very thing
he cried
Youve got a voice a grandopera voice
Ive heard lots of people say so and it sounded that way to me
You must cultivate your voice
Mildred laughed
Dont talk nonsense
Even I know thats nonsense
The lessons alone would cost thousands of dollars
And how could I live for the four or five years
You didnt let me finish said Baird
I was going to say that when you get to New York you must go and have your voice passed onby some impartial person
If that person says its worth cultivating why Im willing to back youas a business proposition
I can afford to take the risk
So you see its all perfectly simple
He had spoken rapidly with a covert suggestion of fear lest she would rebuke him sharply for what she might regard as an impertinent offer
She surprised him by looking at him calmly reflectively and saying Yes you could afford it couldnt you
Im sure I could
And its the sort of thing thats done every day
Of course no oned know that we had made this little business arrangement
But thats easily managed
Id be glad if youd let me do it Mildred
Id like to feel that I was of some use in the world
And Id like to do something for YOU
By way of exceedingly cautious experiment he ventured to put ever so slight an accent of tenderness upon the you
He observed her furtively but nervously
He could not get a hint of what was in her mind
She gazed out toward the rising and falling horizon line
Presently she said Ill think about it
You must let me do it Mildred
Its the sensible thingand you know me well enough to know that my friendship can be counted on
Ill think about it was all she would concede
They discussed the singing career all that and the succeeding daysthe possibilities the hopes the dangers but the hopes a great deal more than the dangers
He became more and more interested in her and in the project as her beauty shone out with the tranquillizing sea and as her old charm of cleverness at saying things that amused him reasserted itself
She dubious and lukewarm at first soon was trying to curb her own excited optimism but long before they sighted Sandy Hook she was merely pretending to hang back
He felt discouraged by her parting
If I decide to go on Ill write you in a few days
But he need not have felt so
She had made up her mind to accept his offer
As for the complications involved in such curiously intimate relations with a man of his temperament habits and inclinations she saw them very vaguely in deedrefused to permit herself to see them any less vaguely
Time enough to deal with complications when and as they arose why needlessly and foolishly annoy herself and hamper herself
Said she to herself I must begin to be practical
IV AT the pier Mildred sent her mother a telegram giving the train by which she would arrivethat and nothing more
As she descended from the parlorcar there stood Mrs Presbury upon the platform face wreathed in the most joyous of welcoming smiles not a surface trace of the curiosity and alarm storming within
After they had kissed and embraced with a genuine emotion which they did not try to hide because both suddenly became unconscious of that world whereof ordinarily they were constantly mindfulafter caresses and tears Mrs Presbury said Its all very well to dress plain when everyone knows you can afford the best
But dont you think youre overdoing it a little
Mildred laughed somewhat nervously
Wait till were safe at home said she
On the way up from the station in the carriage they chattered away in the liveliest fashion to make the proper impression upon any observing Hanging Rockers
Luckily Presburys gone to town today said his wife
But really hes quite livablehasnt gone back to his old ways
He doesnt know it but hes rapidly growing deaf
He imagines that everyone is speaking more and more indistinctly and he has lost interest in conversation
Then too he has done well in Wall Street and that has put him in a good humor
Hell not be surprised to see mealone said Mildred
Wait till were home said her mother nervously
At the house Mrs Presbury carried on a foolish falsesounding conversation for the benefit of the servants and finally conducted Mildred to her bedroom and shut doors and drew portieres and glanced into closets before saying Now what IS the matter Millie
WHERE is your husband
In Paris I suppose replied Mildred
I have left him and I shall never go back
Presbury said you would
cried her mother
But I didnt believe it
I dont believe it
I brought you up to do your duty and I know you will
This was Mildreds first opportunity for frank and plain speaking and that is highly conducive to frank and plain thinking
She now began to see clearly why she had quit the general
Said she Mamma to be honest and not mince words Ive left him because theres nothing in it
Isnt he rich
inquired her mother
Ive always had a kind of present Oh hes rich all right interrupted the girl
But he saw to it that I got no benefit from that
But you wrote me how he was buying you everything
So I thought
In fact he was buying ME nothing
And she went on to explain the generals system
Her mother listened impatiently
She would have in terrupted the long and angry recital many times had not Mildred insisted on a full hearing of her grievances of the outrages that had been heaped upon her
And she ended I suppose hes got it so arranged that he could have me arrested as a thief for taking the gold bag
Yes its terrible and all that said her mother
But I should have thought living with me here when Presbury was carrying on so dreadfully would have taught you something
Your case isnt an exception any more than mine is
Thats the sort of thing we women have to put up with from men when were in their power
Not I said Mildred loftily
Yes you retorted her mother
ANY woman
EVERY woman
Unless we have money of our own we all have trouble with the men about money sooner or later in one way or another
And rich menwhy its notorious that theyre always more or less mean about money
A wife has got to use tact
Why I even had to use some tact with your father and he was as generous a man as ever lived
Tactthats a womans whole life
You ought to have used tact
Youll go back to him and use tact
You dont know him mamma
cried Mildred
Hes a monster
He isnt human
Mrs Presbury drew a long face and said in a sad soothing voice Yes I know dear
Men are very very awful in some ways to a nice womanwith refined ladylike instincts
Its a great shock to a pure Oh gammon
interrupted Mildred
Dont be silly mother
It isnt worth while for one woman to talk that kind of thing to another
I didnt fully know what I was doing when I married a man I didnt love a man who was almost repulsive to me
But I knew enough
And I was getting along well enough as any woman does no matter what she may sayyes you neednt look shocked for thats hypocrisy and I know it now But as I was saying I didnt begin to HATE him until he tried to make a slave of me
A slave
she shuddered
Hes a monster
A little tact and you can get everything you want insisted her mother
I tell you you dont know the man cried Mildred
By tact I suppose you mean I could have sold things behind his backand all that
She laughed
He hasnt got any back
He had it so arranged that those cold wicked eyes of his were always watching me
His second wife tried tact
He caught her and drove her into the streets
Id have had no chance to get a cent and if I had gotten it Id not have dared spend it
Do you imagine I ran away from him without having THOUGHT
If thered been any way of staying on any way of making things even endurable Id have stayed
But youve got to go back Milly cried her mother in tears
You mean that you cant support me
And your brother Frank Mrs Presburys eyes flashed and her rather stout cheeks quivered
I never thought Id tell anybody but Ill tell you
I never liked your brother Frank and he never liked me
That sounds dreadful doesnt it
No mother dear said Mildred gently
Ive learned that life isnt at all asas everybody pretends
Indeed it isnt said her mother
Mothers always have favorites among their children and very often a mother dislikes one of her children
Of course she hides her feeling and does her duty
But all the same she cant help the feeling that is down in her heart
I had a presentiment before he was born that I wouldnt like him and sure enough I didnt
And he didnt like me or his father or any of us
It would never occur to me to turn to him said Mildred
Then you see that youve got to go back to the general
You cant get a divorce and alimony for it was you that left himand for no cause
He was within his rights
Mildred hesitated confessed I had thought of going back to him and acting in such a way that hed be glad to give me a divorce and an allowance
Yes you might do that said her mother
A great many women do
And after all havent they a right to
A lady has got to have proper support and is it just to ask her to live with a man she loathes
I havent thought of the right or wrong of it said Mildred
It looks to me as though right and wrong have very little to do with life as its lived
Theyre for hypocritesand fools
Mildred
exclaimed her mother deeply shocked
Mildred was not a little shocked at her own thoughts as she inspected them in the full light into which speech had dragged them
Anyhow she went on I soon saw that such a plan was hopeless
Hes not the man to be trifled with
Long before I could drive him to give me a living and let me go he would have driven me to flight or suicide
Her mother had now had time to reflect upon Mildreds revelations
Aided by the impressions she herself had gotten of the little general she began to understand why her daughter had fled and why she would not return
She felt that the situation was one which time alone could solve
Said she Well the best thing is for you to stay on here and wait until he makes some move
Hell have me watchedthats all hell do said Mildred
When he gets ready hell divorce me for deserting him
Mrs Presbury felt that she was right
But concealing her despondency she said All we can do is to wait and see
You must send for your luggage
Ive nothing but a large bag said Mildred
I checked it in the parcelroom of the New York station
Mrs Presbury was overwhelmed
How account to Hanging Rock for the reappearance of a baggageless and husbandless bride
But she held up bravely
With a cheerfulness that did credit to her heart and showed how well she loved her daughter she said We must do the best we can
Well get up some story
No said Mildred
Im going back to New York
You can tell people here what you please that Ive gone to rejoin him or to wait for himany old thing
At least youll wait and talk with Presbury pleaded her mother
He is VERY sensible
If he has anything to suggest said Mildred he can write it
Ill send you my address
Milly cried her mother agitated to the depths where ARE you going
WHAT are you going to do
You look so strangenot at all like yourself
Im going to a hotel tonightprobably to a boardinghouse tomorrow said Mildred
In a few days I shall begin to she hesitated decided against confidence begin to support myself at something or other
You must be crazy
cried her mother
You wouldnt do anythingand you couldnt
Lets not discuss it mamma said the girl tranquilly
The mother looked at her with eyes full of the suspicion one lady cannot but have as to the projects of another lady in such circumstances
Mildred she said pleadingly you must be careful
Youll find yourself involved in a dreadful scandal
I know you wouldnt DO anything WRONG no matter how you were driven
But Ill not do anything FOOLISH mamma interrupted the girl
You are thinking about men arent you
Men are always ready to destroy a woman said her mother
You must be careful Mildred was laughing
Oh mamma she cried do be sensible and do give me credit for a little sense
Ive got a very clear idea of what a woman ought to do about men and I assure you Im not going to be FOOLISH
And you know a woman who isnt foolish can be trusted where a woman whos only protected by her principles would yield to the first temptationor hunt round for a temptation
But you simply cant go to New York and live there all aloneand with nothing
Can I stay herefor more than a few days
But maybe after a few days stammered her mother
You see Ive got to begin said Mildred
So why delay
Id gain nothing
Id simply start Hanging Rock to gossipingand start Mr Presbury to acting like a fiend again
Her mother refused to be convincedwas the firmer perhaps because she saw that Mildred was unshakable in her resolve to leave forthwiththe obviously sensible and less troublesome course
They employed the rest of Mildreds three hours stop in arguingwhen Mildred was not raging against the little general
Her mother was more than willing to assist her in this denunciation but Mildred preferred to do it all herself
She hadperhaps by unconsciously absorbed training from her lawyer fatheran unusual degree of ability to see both sides of a question
When she assailed her husband she saw only her own side but somehow when her mother railed and raved she began to see another sideand the sight was not agreeable
She wished to feel that her husband was altogether in the wrong she did not wish to have intruded upon her such facts as that she had sold herself to himquite in the customary way of ladies but nevertheless quite shamelessly or that in strict justice she had done nothing for him to entitle her to a liberal money allowance or any allowance at all
On the train going back to New York she admitted to herself that the repulsive little general had held strictly to the terms of the bargain but only a devil and one with not a single gentlemanly instinct would insist on such a bargain
It took away much of the shame and all of the sting of despising herself to feel that she was looking still lower when she turned to despising him
To edge out the little general she began to think of her mother but as she passed in review what her mother had said and how she had said it she saw that for all the protests and arguings her mother was more than resigned to her departure
Mildred felt no bitterness ever since she could remember her mother had been a shifter of responsibility
Still to stare into the face of so disagreeable a fact as that one had no place on earth to go to no one on earth to turn to not even ones own motherto stare on at that grimacing ugliness did not tend to cheerfulness
Mildred tried to think of the futurebut how could she think of something that was nothing
She knew that she would go on somehow in some direction but by no effort of her imagination could she picture it
She was so impressed by the necessity of considering the future that to rouse herself she tried to frighten herself with pictures of poverty and misery of herself a derelict in the vast and cold desert of New Yorkperhaps in rags hungry ill but all in vain
She did not believe it
Always she had had plenty to wear and to eat and comfortable surroundings
She could no more think of herself as without those things than a living person can imagine himself dead
Im a fool she said to herself
Im certain to get into all sorts of trouble
How can it be otherwise when Ive no money no friends no experience no way of making a livingno honest wayperhaps no way of the other kind either
There are many women who ecstasize their easily tickled vanities by fancying that if they were so disposed they need only flutter an eyelid to have men by the legion striving for their favors each man with a bag of gold
Mildred inexperienced as she was had no such delusions
Her mind happened not to be of that chastely licentious caste which continually revolves and fantastically exaggerates the things of the body
She could not understand her own indifference about the future
She did not realize that it was wholly due to Stanley Bairds offer
She was imagining she was regarding that offer as something she might possibly consider but probably would not
She did not know that her soul had seized upon it had enfolded it and would on no account let it go
It is the habit of our secret selves thus to make decisions and await their own good time for making us acquainted with them
With her bag on the seat beside her she set out to find a temporary lodging
Not until several hotels had refused her admittance on the pretext that they were full up did she realize that a young woman alone is an object of suspicion in New York
When a fourth roomclerk expressed his polite regrets she looked him straight in the eye and said I understand
But I cant sleep in the street
You must tell me where I can go
Well theres the Ripon over in Seventh Avenue said he
Is it respectable
said she
Oh its very clean and comfortable there said he
Theyll treat you right
Is it respectable
said she
Well now it doesnt LOOK queer if thats what you mean replied he
Youll do very nicely there
You can be just as quiet as you want
She saw that hotel New York would not believe her respectable
So to the Ripon she went and was admitted without discussion
As the last respectable clerk had said it did not LOOK queer
But it FELT queer she resolved that she would go into a boardinghouse the very next day
Here again what seemed simple proved difficult
No respectable boardinghouse would have Miss Mary Stevens
She was confident that nothing in her dress or manner hinted mystery
Yet those sharpeyed land ladies seemed to know at once that there was something peculiar about her
Most of them became rude the instant they set eyes upon her
A fewof the obviously less prosperous classtalked with her seemed to be listening for something which her failing to say decided them upon all but ordering her out of the house
She hindered by her innocence was slow in realizing that she could not hope for admission to any select respectable circle even of highclass salesladies and clerks unless she gave a free and clear account of herself whence she had come what she was doing how she got her money
Toward the end of the second days wearisome and humiliating search she found a house that would admit her
It was a pretentious wellfurnished big house in Madison Avenue
The pricethirtyfive dollars a week for board a bedroom with a folding bed in an alcove and a bath was more than double what she had counted on paying but she discovered that decent and clean lodgings and food fit to eat were not to be had for less
And I simply cant live pigfashion said she
Id be so depressed that I could do nothing
I cant live like a wild animal and I wont
She had some vague notionforebodingthat this was not the proper spirit with which to face life
I suppose Im horribly foolish reflected she but if I must go down Ill go down with my colors flying
She did not know precisely what that phrase meant but it sounded fine and brave and heartened her to take the expensive lodgings
The landlady was a Mrs Belloc
Mildred had not talked with her twenty minutes before she had a feeling that this name was assumed
The evening of her first day in the house she learned that her guess was correct learned it from the landlady herself
After dinner Mrs Belloc came into her room to cheer her up to find out about her and to tell her about herself
Now that youve come said she the house is full upexcept some little rooms at the top that Id as lief not fill
The probabilities are that any ladies who would take them wouldnt be refined enough to suit those I have
There are six not counting me every one with a bath and two with private parlors
And as theyre all handsome sensible women ladylike and steady I think the prospects are that theyll pay promptly and that I wont have any trouble
Mildred reflected upon this curious statement
It sounded innocent enough yet what a peculiar way to put a simple fact
Of course its none of my business how people live as long as they keep up the respectabilities pursued Mrs Belloc
It dont do to inquire into people in New York
Most of em come here because they want to live as they please
No doubt said Mildred a little nervously for she suspected her landlady of hitting at her and wondered if she had come to crossexamine her and if the results were not satisfactory to put her into the street
I know I came for that reason pursued Mrs Belloc
I was a schoolteacher up in New England until about two years ago
Did you ever teach school
Not yet said Mildred
And I dont think I ever shall
I dont know enough
Oh yes you do
A teacher doesnt need to know much
The wages are so poorat least up in New Englandthat they dont expect you to know anything
Its all in the books
I left because I couldnt endure the life
Lord
how dull those little towns are
Ever live in a little town
All my life said Mildred
Well youll never go back
I hope not
You wont
Why should you
A sensible woman with looksespecially if she knows how to carry her clothescan stay in New York as long as she pleases and live off the fat of the land
Thats good news said Mildred
She began to like the landladynot for what she said but for the free and frank and friendly way of the sayinga human way a comradely way a liveandletlive way
I didnt escape from New England without a struggle continued Mrs Belloc who was plainly showing that she had taken a great fancy to Mary Stevens
I suppose it was hard to save the money out of your salary said Mildred
Mrs Belloc laughed
She was about thirtyfive years old though her eyes and her figure were younger than that
Her mouth was pleasant enough but had lost some of its freshness
Save money
cried she
Id never have succeeded that way
Id be there yet
I had never marriedhad two or three chances but all from poor sticks looking for someone to support them
I saw myself getting old
I was looking years older than I do now
Talk about sea air for freshening a woman upit isnt in it with the air of New York
Heres the town where women stay young
If I had come here five years ago I could almost try for the squab class
Squab class
queried Mildred
Yes squabs
Dont you see them around everywhere the women dressed like girls of sixteen to eighteenand some of them are that and younger
They go hopping and laughing aboutand they seem to please the men and to have no end of a good time
Especially the oldish men
Oh yes you know a squab on sighttight skirt low shoes and silk stockings cute pretty face always laughing hat set on rakishly and hair done to match and always a big purse or bagwith a yellowback or so in itas a kind of a hint I guess
Mildred had seen squabs
Ive envied themin a way said she
Their parents seem to let them do about as they please
Their parents dont knowor dont care
Sometimes its one sometimes the other
They travel in two sets
One is where they meet young fellows of their own classthe kind theyll probably marry unless they happen to draw the capital prize
The other set they travel inwell its the older men they meet round the swell hotels and so onthe yellowback men
How queer
exclaimed Mildred before whose eyes a new world was opening
But how do theythese squabsaccount for the money
How do a thousand and one women in this funny town account at home for money and things
retorted Mrs Belloc
Nothings easier
For instance often these squabs door pretend to doa little something in the way of worka little canvassing or artists model or anything you please
That helps them to explain at homeand also to make each of the yellow back men think hes the only one and that hes being almost loved for himself alone
Mrs Belloc laughed
Mildred was too astonished to laugh and too interestedand too startled or shocked
But I was telling you how I got down here continued the landlady
Up in my town there was an old manabout seventyfiveclose as the bark on a tree and ugly and mean
She paused to draw a long breath and to shake her head angrily yet triumphantly at some figure her fancy conjured up
Oh he WAS a pupand is
Well anyhow I decided that Id marry him
So I wrote home for fifty dollars
I borrowed another fifty here and there
I had seventyfive saved up against sickness
I went up to Boston and laid it all out in underclothes and house thingsnot showy but fine and good to look at
Then one day when the weather was fine and I knew the old man would be out in his buggy driving roundI dressed myself up to beat the band
I took hours to itscrubbing powdering sacheting perfuming fixing the hair fixing my fingernails fixing up my feet polishing every nail and making them look better than most hands
Mildred was so interested that she was excited
What strange freak was coming
You never could guess pursued Mrs Belloc complacently
I took my sunshade and went out all got up to kill
And I walked along the road until I saw the old mans buggy coming with him in it
Then I gave my ankle a frightful wrench
My
How it hurt
What a pity
said Mildred sympathetically
What a shame
A pity
A shame
cried Mrs Belloc laughing
Why my dear I did it apurpose
On purpose
exclaimed Mildred
Certainly
That was my game
I screamed out with painand the scream was no fake I can tell you
And I fell down by the roadside on a nice grassy spot where no dust would get on me
Well up comes the old skinflint in his buggy
He climbed down and helped me get off my slipper and stocking
I knew I had him the minute I saw his old face looking at that foot I had fixed up so beautifully
How DID you ever think of it
exclaimed Mildred
Go and teach school for ten years in a dull little town my dearand look in the glass every day and see your youth fading awayand youll think of most anything
Well to make a long story short the old man took me in the buggy to his house where he lived with his deaf halfblind old widowed daughter
I had to stay there three weeks
I married him the fourth week
And just two months to a day from the afternoon I sprained my ankle he gave me fifty dollars a weekall signed and sealed by a lawyerto go away and leave him alone
I might have stood out for more but I was too anxious to get to New York
And here I am
She gazed about the wellfurnished room typical of that almost luxurious house with an air of triumphant satisfaction
Said she Ive no patience with a woman who says she cant get on
Wheres her brains
Mildred was silent
Perhaps it was a feeling of what was hazily in the younger womans mind and a desire to answer it that led Mrs Belloc to say further I suppose theres some that would criticize my way of getting there
But I want to know dont all women get there by working men
Only most of them are so stupid that they have to go on living with the man
I think its low to live with a man you hate
Oh Im not criticizing anybody said Mildred
I didnt think you were said Mrs Belloc
If I hadnt seen you werent that kind Id not have been so confidential
Not that Im secretive with anybody
I say and do what I please
Anyone who doesnt like my way or me can take the other side of the street
I didnt come to New York to go in society
I came here to LIVE
Mildred looked at her admiringly
There were things about Mrs Belloc that she did not admire other thingssuspected rather than known thingsthat she knew she would shrink from but she heartily admired and profoundly envied her utter indifference to the opinion of others her fine independent way of walking her own path at her own gait
I took this boardinghouse Mrs Belloc went on because I didnt want to be lonesome
I dont like allor even most ofthe ladies that live here
But theyre all amusing to talk withand dont put on airs except with their men friends
And one or two are the real thinggoodhearted fond of a joke with out any meanness
I tell you New York is a mighty fine place if you get in right
Of course if you dont its hell Mrs Belloc took off its unrefined edge by spelling it
But what place isnt
she added
And your husband never bothers you
inquired Mildred
And never will replied Mrs Belloc
When he dies Ill come into a little moreabout a hundred and fifty a week in all
Not a fortune but enough with what the boardinghouse brings in
Im a pretty fair business woman
I should say so
exclaimed Mildred
You said you were Miss Stevens didnt you
said Mrs Bellocand Mildred knew that her turn had come
Yes replied she
But I am also a married woman
She hesitated reddened
I didnt give you my married name
Thats your own business said Mrs Belloc in her easiest manner
My right name isnt Belloc either
But Ive dropped that other life
You neednt feel a bit embarrassed in this house
Some of my boarders SEEM to be married
All that have regularappearing husbands SAY they are
What do I care so long as everything goes along smoothly
I dont get excited about trifles
Some day perhaps Ill tell you about myself said Mildred
Just at present Iwell I seem not to be able to talk about things
Its not a bad idea to keep your mouth shut as long as your affairs are unsettled advised Mrs Belloc
I can see youve had little experience
But youll come out all right
Just keep cool and dont fret about trifles
And dont let any man make a fool of you
Thats where we women get left
Were afraid of men
We neednt be
We can mighty easily make them afraid of us
Use the soft hand till you get him well in your grip
Then the firm hand
Nothing coarse or cruel or mean
But firm and selfrespecting
Mildred was tempted to take Mrs Belloc fully into her confidence and get the benefit of the advice of shrewdness and experience
So strong was the temptation she would have yielded to it had Mrs Belloc asked a few tactful penetrating questions
But Mrs Belloc refrained and Mildreds timidity or delicacy induced her to postpone
The next day she wrote Stanley Baird giving her address and her name and asking him to call any afternoon at four or five
She assumed that he would come on the following day but the letter happened to reach him within an hour of her mailing it and he came that very afternoon
When she went down to the drawingroom to receive him she found him standing in the middle of the room gazing about with a quizzical expression
As soon as the greetings were over he said You must get out of here Mildred
This wont do
Indeed I shant said she
Ive looked everywhere and this is the only comfortable place I could findwhere the rates were reasonable and where the landlady didnt have her nose in everybodys business
You dont understand said he
This is a bird cage
Highly gilded but a birdcage
She had never heard the phrase but she understood and instantly she knew that he was right
She colored violently sat down abruptly
But in a moment she recovered herself and with fine defiance said I dont care
Mrs Belloc is a kindhearted woman and its as easy to be respectable here as anywhere
Sure assented he
But youve got to consider appearances to a certain extent
You wont be able to find the right sort of a boardinghouseone youd be comfortable in
Youve got to have a flat of your own
I cant afford it said Mildred
I cant afford this even
But I simply will not live in a shabby mussy way
Thats right
cried Stanley
You cant do proper work in poor surroundings
Some women could but not your sort
But dont worry
Im going to see you through
Ill find a placeright away
You want to start in at once dont you
Ive got to said Mildred
Then leave it all to me
But WHAT am I to do
Sing if you can
If not then act
Well have you on the stage within a year or so
Im sure of it
And Ill get my money back with interest
I dont see how I can accept it said Mildred very feebly
Youve got to said Stanley
What alternative is there
None
So lets bother no more about it
Ill consult with those who know find out what the thing costs and arrange everything
Youre as helpless as a baby and you know it
Yes Mildred knew it
He looked at her with an amused smile
Come out with it
he cried
Youve got something on your mind
Lets get everything straightand keep it that way
Mildred hung her head
Youre uneasy because I a man am doing this for you a young woman
Is that it
Yes she confessed
He leaned back in his chair crossed his legs and spoke in a brisk businesslike way
In the first place its got to be done hasnt it
And someone has got to do it
And there is no one offering but me
Am I right
She nodded
Then Ive got to do it and youve GOT to let me
Theres logic if ever there was logic
A Philadelphia lawyer couldnt knock a hole in it
You trust me dont you
She was silent
You dont trust me then said he cheerfully
Well perhaps youre right
But you trust yourself dont you
She moved restlessly but remained silent
You are afraid I might put you in a difficult position
Something like that she admitted in a low embarrassed voice
You fear that I expect some return which you do not intend to give
She was silent
Well I dont said he bluntly
So put your mind at rest
Some day Ill tell you why I am doing this but I want you to feel that I ask nothing of you but my money back with interest when you can afford to pay
I cant feel that said she
Youre putting me in your debtso heavily that Id feel I ought to pay anything you asked
But I couldnt and wouldnt pay
Unless you felt like it
suggested he
Its honest for me to warn you that Im not likely to feel that way
There is such a thing as winning a womans love isnt there
said he jestingly
It was difficult to tell when Stanley Baird was jesting and when he was in earnest
Is that what you expect
said she gravely
If I say yes
She lowered her eyes and laughed in an embarrassed way
He was frankly amused
You see you feel that youre in my power
And you are
So why not make the best of it
A pause then he said abruptly and with a convincing manliness I think Mildred you can trust me not to be a beast
She colored and looked at him with quick contrition
Im ashamed of myself said she
Please forget that I said anything
Ill take what I must and Ill pay it back as soon as I can
Andthank you Stanley
The tears were in her eyes
If I had anything worth your taking Id be glad to give it to you
What vain fools we women are
Arent you though
laughed he
And now its all settleduntil youre on the stage and free and the moneys paid backWITH interest
I shall charge you six per cent
When she first knew him she had not been in the least impressed by what now seemed to her his finest and rarest trait for in those days she had been as ignorant of the realities of human nature as one who has never adventured his boat beyond the mouth of the peaceful landlocked harbor is ignorant of the open sea
But in the hard years she had been learningnot only from Presbury and General Siddall but from the cook and the housemaid from every creditor every tradesman everyone whose attitude socially toward her had been modified by her changed fortunesand whose attitude had not been changed
Thus she was now able to appreciateat least in some measureStanley Bairds delicacy and tact
No not delicacy and tact for that implied effort
His ability to put this offer in such a way that she could accept without serious embarrassment arose from a genuine indifference to money as money a habit of looking upon it simply as a means to an end
He offered her the money precisely as he would have offered her his superior strength if it had been necessary to cross a too deep and swift creek
She had the sense that he felt he was doing something even less notable than he admitted and that he talked of it as a valuable and rather unusual service simply because it was the habit thus to regard such matters
As they talked on of the great career her spirits went up and up
It was evident that he now had a new and keen interest in life that she was doing him a greater favor than he was doing her
He had always had money plenty of it more than he could use
He now had more than everfor several rich relatives had died and after the habit of the rich had left everything to him the one of all the connections who needed it least
He had a very human aversion to spending money upon people or things he did not like
He would have fought to the last court an attempt by his wife to get alimony
He had a reputation with the charity gang of being stingy because he would not give them so much as the price of a bazaar ticket
Also the impecunious spongers at his clubs spread his fame as a tightwad because he refused to let them stick him up for even a round of drinks
Where many a really stingy man yielded through weakness or fear of public opinion he stood firm
His one notable surrender of any kind had been his marriage that bitter experience had cured him of the surrendering habit for all time
Thenceforth he did absolutely and in everything as he pleased
Mildred had heard that he was close about money
She had all but forgotten it because her own experience with him had made such a charge seem ridiculous
She now assumedso far as she thought about it at allthat he was extremely generous
She did not realize what a fine discriminating generosity his was or how striking an evidence of his belief in her as well as of his liking for her
As he rose to go he said You mustnt forget that our arrangement is a secret between us
Neither of us can afford to have anyone know it
There isnt anyone in the world who wouldnt misunderstand it said she without the least feeling of embarrassment
Just so said he
And I want you to live in such a way that I can come to call
We must arrange things so that you will take your own name I intend to use the name Mary Stevens in my work she interrupted
But there mustnt be any concealment any mystery to excite curiosity and scandal This time the interruption was her expression
He turned to see what had startled her and saw in the doorway of the drawingroom the grotesquely neat and stylish figure of the little general
Before either could speak he said How dyou do Mr Baird
Youll pardon me if I ask you to leave me alone with my WIFE
Stanley met the situation with perfect coolness
How are you General
said he
Certainly I was just going
He extended his hand to Mildred said in a correct tone of conventional friendliness Then youll let me know when youre settled
He bowed moved toward the door shook hands with the general and passed out giving from start to finish a model example of a man of the world extricating him self from an impossible situation and leaving it the better for his having been entangled
To a man of Siddalls incessant and clumsy selfconsciousness such unaffected ease could not but be proof positive of Mildreds innocenceunless he had overheard
And his first words convinced her that he had not
Said he So you sent for your old admirer
I ran across him accidentally replied Mildred
I know said the little general
My men picked you up at the pier and havent lost sight of you since
Its fortunate that Ive kept myself informed or I might have misunderstood that chaps being here
A queer cloudy look came into his eyes
I must give him a warning for safetys sake
He waved his hand in dismissal of such an unimportant trifle as the accidental Baird
He went on his wicked eyes bent coldly and dully upon her Do you know what kind of a house this is
Stanley Baird urged me to leave replied she
But I shall stay until I find a betterand thats not easy
Yes my men have reported to me on the difficulties youve had
It was certainly fortunate for you that I had them look after you
Otherwise Id never have understood your landing in this sort of a house
You are ready to come with me
Your secretary explained that if I left the hotel it was the end
He told you that by my orders
So he explained said Mildred
She seated herself overcome by a sudden lassitude that was accompanied not by fear but by indifference
Wont you sit down
I am willing to hear what you have to say
The little general about to sit was so astonished that he straightened and stiffened himself
In consenting to overlook your conduct and take you back I have gone farther than I ever intended
I have taken into consideration your youth and inexperience
But I am not going back said Mildred
The little general slowly seated himself
You have less than two hundred and fifty dollars left said he
Really
Your spies know better than I
I have seen Presbury
He assures me that in no circumstances will he and your mother take you back
They will not have the chance to refuse said Mildred
As for your brother I have no brother said she coldly
Then you are coming back with me
No said Mildred
I shouldshe cast about for an impressive alternativeI should stay on here rather
The little generalhis neat varnished leather and bespatted shoes just touched the floorexamined his highly polished tophat at several angles
Finally he said You need not fear that your misconduct will be remembered against you
I shall treat you in every way as my wife
I shall assume that youryour flight was an impulse that you regret
I shant go back said Mildred
Nothing you could offer would change me
I cannot make any immediate concession on the the matter that caused you to go pursued he as if she had not spoken but if I see that you have reliability and good sense Ill agree to give you an allowance later
Mildred eyed him curiously
Why are you making these offers these concessions
she said
You think everyone in the world is a fool except yourself
Youre greatly deceived
I know that you dont mean what youve been saying
I know that if you got me in your power again you would do something frightful
Ive seen through that mask you wear
I know the kind of man you are
If you know that said the general in his even slow way monotonous almost lifeless you know youd better come with me than stand out against me
She did not let him see how this struck terror into her
She said No matter what you might do to me when Im away from you it would be less than youd do with me under your roof
At any rate itd seem less
The general reflected decided to change to another point You made a bargain with me
Youve broken it
I never let anyone break a bargain with me without making them regret it
Im giving you a chance to keep your bargain
She was tempted to discuss but she could not find the words or the strength
Besides how futile to discuss with such a man
She sank back in her chair wearily
I shall never go back she said
He looked at her his face devoid of expression but she had a sense of malignance unutterable eying her from behind a screen
He said I see youve misunderstood my generosity
You think Im weak where you are concerned because Ive come to you instead of doing as I said and making you come to me
He rose
Well my offer to you is closed
And once more I say you will come to me and ask to be taken back
I may or may not take you back
It depends on how Ill feel at that time
Slowly with his ludicrously pompous strut he marched to the drawingroom door
She had not felt like smiling but if there had been any such inclination it would have fled before the countenance that turned upon her at the threshold
It was the lean little face with the funny toupee and needlelike mustache and imperial but behind it lay a personality like the dull cold yellow eyes of the devilfish ambushed in the hazy mass of duncolored formlessness of collapsed body and tentacles
He said Youd best be careful how you conduct yourself
Youll be under constant observation
And any friends you maketheyd do well to avoid you
He was gone
She sat without the power of motion without the power of thought
After a timeperhaps long perhaps short she did not knowMrs Belloc came in and entered upon a voluble apology for the maids having shown the little gentleman into the drawingroom when another was already there
That maids as green as spring corn said she
Such a thing never happened in my house before
And itll never happen again
I do hope it didnt cause trouble
It was my husband said Mildred
I had to see him some time
Hes certainly a very elegant little gentleman said Mrs Belloc
I rather like small men myself
Mildred gazed at her vaguely and said Tell me a rich man a very rich manif he hates anyone can he make trouble
Money can do anything in this town replied Mrs Belloc
But usually rich men are timid and stingy
If they werent theyd make us all cringe
As it is Ive heard some awful stories of how men and women whove got some powerful person down on them have been hounded
Mildred turned deathly sick
I think Ill go to my room she said rising uncertainly and forcing herself toward the door
Mrs Bellocs curiosity could not restrain itself
Youre leaving
she asked
Youre going back to your husband
She was startled when the girl abruptly turned on her and cried with flashing eyes and voice strong and vibrant with passion Never
Never
No matter what comesNEVER
The rest of the day and that night she hid in her room and made no effort to resist the terror that preyed upon her
Just as our strength is often the source of weakness so our weaknesses often give birth to strength
Her terror of the little general given full swing shrieked and grimaced itself into absurdity
She was ashamed of her orgy was laughing at it as the sun and intoxicating air of a typical New York morning poured in upon her
She accepted Mrs Bellocs invitation to take a turn through the park and up Riverside Drive in a taxicab came back restored to her normal state of blind confidence in the future
About noon Stanley Baird telephoned
We must not see each other again for some time said he
I rather suspect that youknowwho may be having you watched
Im sure of it said she
He warned me
Dont let that disturb you pursued Stanley
A mana singing teacherhis names Eugene Jennings will call on you this afternoon at three
Do exactly as he suggests
Let him do all the talking
She had intended to tell Baird frankly that she thought indeed knew that it was highly dangerous for him to enter into her affairs in any way and to urge him to draw off
She felt that it was only fair to act so toward one who had been unselfishly generous to her
But now that the time for speaking had come she found herself unable to speak
Only by flatly refusing to have anything to do with his project could she prevail upon him
To say less than that she had completely and finally changed her mind would sound and would be insincere
And that she could not say
She felt how noble it would be to say this how selfish and weak too it was to cling to him possibly to involve him in disagreeable and even dangerous complications but she had no strength to do what she would have denounced another as base for not doing
Instead of the lofty words that flow so freely from the lips of stage and fiction heroines instead of the words that any and every reader of this history would doubtless have pronounced in the same circumstances she said Youre quite sure you want to go on
Why not
came instantly back over the wire
He is a very very relentless man replied she
Did he try to frighten you
Im afraid he succeeded
Youre not going back on the career
exclaimed he excitedly
Ill come down there and No no cried she
I was simply giving you a chance to free yourself
She felt sure of him now
She scrambled toward the heights of moral grandeur
I want you to stop
Ive no right to ask you to involve yourself in my misfortunes
Stanley you mustnt
I cant allow it
Oh fudge
laughed he
Dont give me these scares
Dont forgetJennings at three
Goodby and good luck
And he rang off that she might have no chance on impulse to do herself mischief with her generous thoughtfulness for him
She felt rather mean but not nearly so mean as she would have felt had she let the opportunity go by with no generous word said
And no doubt my aversion for that little wretch thought she makes me think him more terrible than he is
After all what can he do
Watch meand discover nothing because therell be nothing to discover
Jennings came exactly at threecame with the air of a man who wastes no ones time and lets no one waste his time
He was a youngish man of forty or there abouts with a long sharp nose a large tight mouth and eyes that seemed to be looking restlessly about for money
That they had not looked in vain seemed to be indicated by such facts as that he came in a private brougham and that he was most carefully dressed apparently with the aid of a valet
Miss Stevens he said with an abrupt bow before Mildred had a chance to speak you have come to New York to take singing lessonsto prepare yourself for the stage
And you wish a comfortable place to live and to work
He extended his gloved hand shook hers frigidly dropped it
We shall get onIF you work but only if you work
I do not waste myself upon triflers
He drew a card from his pocket
If you will go to see the lady whose name and address are written on this card I think you will find the quarters you are looking for
Thank you said Mildred
Come to memy address is on the card also at halfpast ten on Saturday
We will then lay out your work
If you find I have a voice worth while Mildred ventured
That of course said Mr Jennings curtly
Until halfpast ten on Saturday good day
Again he gave the abrupt foreign bow and while Mildred was still struggling with her surprise and confusion she saw him through the window driving rapidly away
Mrs Belloc came drifting through the room she had the habit of looking about whenever there were new visitors and in her it was not irritating because her interest was innocent and sympathetic
Said Mildred Did you see that man Mrs
Belloc
What an extraordinary nose he had replied she
Yes I noticed that said Mildred
But it was the only thing I did notice
He is a singing teacher Mr
Jennings
Eugene Jennings
Yes Eugene
Hes the best known singing teacher in New York
He gets fifteen dollars a halfhour
Then I simply cant take from him
exclaimed Mildred before she thought
Thats frightful
Isnt it though
echoed Mrs Belloc
Ive heard his income is fifty thousand a year what with lessons and coaching and odds and ends
Theres a lot of them that do well because so many fool women with nothing to do cultivate their voiceswhen they cant sing a little bit
But he tops them all
I dont see how ANY teacher can put fifteen dollars of value into half an hour
But I suppose he does or he wouldnt get it
Still his may be just another case of New York nerve
This is the biggest bluff town in the world I do believe
Here you can get away with anything I dont care what it is if only you bluff hard enough
As there was no reason for delay and many reasons against it Mildred went at once to the address on the card Jennings had left
She found Mrs Howell Brindley installed in a plain comfortable apartment in Fiftyninth Street overlooking the park and high enough to make the noise of the traffic endurable
A Swedish maid prepossessingly white and clean ushered her into the little drawingroom which was furnished with more simplicity and individual taste than is usual anywhere in New York cursed of the mania for useless and tasteless showiness
There were no messy draperies no fussy statuettes vases gilt boxes and the like
Mildred awaited the entrance of Mrs Brindley hopefully
She was not disappointed
Presently in came a quietlydressed franklooking woman of a young forty a woman who had by no means lost her physical freshness but had gained charm of another and more enduring kind
As she came forward with extended but not overeager hand she said I was expecting you Mrs Siddallthat is Miss Stevens
Mr Jennings did not say when I was to come
If I am disturbing you Mrs Brindley hastened to assure her that her visit was quite convenient
I must have someone to share the expense of this apartment with me and I want the matter settled
Mr Jennings has explained about you to me and now that Ive seen you here she smiled charminglyI am ready to say that it is for you to say
Mildred did not know how to begin
She looked at Mrs Brindley with appeal in her troubled young eyes
You no doubt wish to know something about me said Mrs Brindley
My husband was a composer a friend of Mr Jennings
He died two years ago
I am here in New York to teach the piano
What the lessons will bring with my small income will enable me to liveif I can find someone to help out at the expenses here
As I understand it you are willing to pay forty dollars a week I to run the house pay all the bills and so onall of course if you wish to come here
Mildred made a not very successful attempt to conceal her embarrassment
Perhaps you would like to look at the apartment
suggested Mrs Brindley
Thank you yes said Mildred
The tour of the apartmenttwo bedrooms dining room kitchen sittingroom large bathroom drawing roomtook only a few minutes but Mildred and Mrs Brindley contrived to become much better acquainted
Said Mildred when they were in the drawingroom again Its most attractivejust what I should like
Whathow much did Mr Jennings say
Forty dollars a week
She colored slightly and spoke with the nervousness of one not in the habit of discussing money matters
I do not see how I could make it less
That is the fair share of the Oh I think that is most reasonable interrupted Mildred
And I wish to come
Mrs Brindley gave an almost childlike sigh of relief and smiled radiantly
Then its settled said she
Ive been so nervous about it
She looked at Mildred with friendly understanding
I think you and I are somewhat alike about practical things
Youve not had much experience either have you
I judge so from the fact that Mr Jennings is looking after everything for you
Ive had no experience at all said Mildred
That is why Im hesitating
Im wondering if I can afford to pay so much
Mrs Brindley laughed
Mr Jennings wished to fix it at sixty a week but I insisted that forty was enough said she
Mildred colored high with embarrassment
How much did Mrs Brindley knowor how little
She stammered Well if Mr Jennings says it is all right Ill come
Youll let me know tomorrow
You can telephone Mr
Jennings
Yes Ill let you know tomorrow
Im almost sure Ill come
In fact Im quite sure
AndI think we shall get on well together
We can help each other said Mrs Brindley
I dont care for anything in the world but music
I want to be that way said Mildred
I shall be that way
Its the only sure happinessto care for something for some THING said Mrs Brindley
People die or disappoint one or become estranged
But when one centers on some kind of work it gives pleasure alwaysmore and more pleasure
I am so afraid I havent voice enough or of the right kind said Mildred
Mr Jennings is going to try me on Saturday
Really Ive no right to settle anything until he has given his opinion
Mrs Brindley smiled with her eyes only and Mildred wondered
If he should say that I wouldnt do she went on Id not know which way to turn
But hell not say that said Mrs Brindley
You can sing cant you
You have sung
Oh yes
Then youll be accepted by him
And it will take him a long time to find out whether youll do for a professional
Im afraid I sing very badly
That will not matter
Youll sing better than at least half of Jenningss pupils
Then he doesnt take only those worth while
Mrs Brindley looked amused
How would he live if he did that
Its a teachers business to teach
Learningthats the pupils lookout
If teachers taught only those who could and would learn how would they live
Then Ill not know whether Ill do
exclaimed Mildred
Youll have to find out for yourself said Mrs Brindley
No one can tell you
Anyones opinion might be wrong
For example Ive known Jennings who is a very good judge to be wrongboth ways
Hesitatingly Why not sing for me
Id like to hear
Would you tell me what you honestly thought
said Mildred
Mrs Brindley laughingly shook her head
Mildred liked her honesty
Then itd be useless to sing for you said she
Im not vain about my voice
Id simply like to make a living by it if I could
Ill even confess that there are many things I care for more than for music
Does that prove that I can never sing professionally
No indeed Mrs Brindley assured her
Itd be strange if a girl of your age cared exclusively for music
The passion comes with the work with progress success
And some of the greatestthat is the most famous and best paidsingers never care much about music except as a vanity and never understand it
A singer means a person born with a certain shape of mouth and throat a certain kind of vocal chords
The rest may be natural or acquired
Its the instrument that makes the singer not brains or temperament
Do let me sing for you said Mildred
I think it will help me
Between them they chose a little French song Chanson dAntonineand Mrs Brindley insisted on her playing her own accompaniment
I wish to listen said she and I cant if I play
Mildred was surprised at her own freedom from nervousness
She sang neither better nor worse than usual sang in the clear and pleasant soprano which she flattered herself was not unmusical
When she finished she said Thats about as I usually sing
What do you think
Mrs Brindley reflected before she replied I BELIEVE its worth trying
If I were you I should keep on trying no matter what anyone said
Mildred was instantly depressed
You think Mr Jennings may reject me
she asked
I KNOW he will not replied Mrs Brindley
Not as long as you can pay for the lessons
But I was thinking of the real thingof whether you could win out as a singer
And you dont think I can
said Mildred
On the contrary I believe you can replied Mrs Brindley
A singer means so much besides singing
The singing is the smallest part of it
Youll understand when you get to work
I couldnt explain now
But I can say that you ought to go ahead
Mildred who had her share of vanity had hoped for some enthusiasm
Mrs Brindleys judicial tone was a severe blow
She felt a little resentful began to cast about for vanityconsoling reasons for Mrs Brindleys restraint
She means well she said to herself but shes probably just a tiny bit jealous
Shes not so young as she once was and she hasnt the faintest hope of ever being anything more than a pianoteacher
Mrs Brindley showed that she had more than an inkling of Mildreds frame of mind by going on to say in a gentle candid way I want to help you
So I shall be careful not to encourage you to believe too much in what you have
That would prevent you from getting what you need
You must remember you are no longer a drawingroom singer but a candidate for the profession
Thats a very different thing
Mildred saw that she was mistaken that Mrs Brindley was honest and frank and had doubtless told her the exact truth
But her vanity remained sore
Never be fore had anyone said any less of her singing than that it was wonderful marvelous equal to a great deal that passed for fine in grand opera
She had known that this was exaggeration but she had not known how grossly exaggerated
Thus this her first experience of the professional attitude was galling
Only her unusual good sense saved her from being angry with Mrs Brindley
And it was that same good sense that moved her presently to try to laugh at herself
With a brave attempt to smile gayly she said You dont realize how youve taken me down
I had no idea I was so conceited about my singing
I cant truthfully say I like your frankness but theres a part of me thats grateful to you for it and when I get over feeling hurt Ill be grateful through and through
Mrs Brindleys face lighted up beautifully
Youll DO
she cried
Im sure youll do
Ive been waiting and watching to see how you would take my criticism
Thats the testhow they take criticism
If they dont take it at all theyll not go very far no matter how talented they are
If they take it as youve taken it theres hopegreat hope
Now Im not afraid to tell you that you sang splendidly for an amateurthat you surprised me
Dont spoil it all said Mildred
You were right I cant sing
Not for grand opera not for comic opera even replied Mrs Brindley
But you will sing and sing well in one or the other if you work
You really mean that
said Mildred
If you work intelligently and persistently said Mrs Brindley
Thats a big ifas youll discover in a year or so
Youll see said Mildred confidently
Why Ive nothing else to do and no other hope
Mrs Brindleys smile had a certain sadness in it
She said Its the biggest if in all this world
V AT Mrs Bellocs a telephone message from Jennings was awaiting her he would call at a quarterpast eight and would detain Miss Stevens only a moment
And at eight fifteen exactly he rang the bell
This time Mildred was prepared she refused to be disconcerted by his abrupt manner and by his long sharp nose that seemed to warn away to threaten away even to thrust away any glance seeking to investigate the rest of his face or his personality
She looked at him candidly calmly and seeingly
Seeingly
With eyes that saw as they had never seen before
Perhaps from the death of her father certainly from the beginning of Siddalls courtship Mildred had been waking up
There is a part of our naturethe active and aggressive part that sleeps all our lives long or becomes atrophied if we lead lives of ease and secure dependence
It is the important part of us toothe part that determines character
The thing that completed the awakening of Mildred was her acquaintance with Mrs Belloc
That positive and finelypoised lady fascinated her influenced her powerfullygave her just what she needed at the particular moment
The vital moments in life are not the crises over which shallow people linger but are the moments where we met and absorbed the ideas that enabled us to weather these crises
The acquaintance with Mrs Belloc was one of those vital moments for Mrs Bellocs personalityher look and manner what she said and the way she said itwas a proffer to Mildred of invaluable lessons which her awakening character eagerly absorbed
She saw Jennings as he was
She decided that he was of common origin that his vanity was colossal and aquiver throughout with sensitiveness that he belonged to the familiar type of NewYorker who succeeds by bluffing
Also she saw or felt a certain sexlessness or indifference to sexand this she later understood
Men whose occupation compels them constantly to deal with women go to one extreme or the othereither become acutely sensitive to women as women or become utterly indifferent unless their highly discriminated taste is appealed towhich cannot happen often
Jennings teaching only women because only women spending money they had not earned and could not earn would tolerate his terms and his methods had as much through necessity as through inclination gone to the extreme of lack of interest in all matters of sex
One look at him and the woman who had come with the idea of offering herself in full or part payment for lessons drooped in instinctive discouragement
Jennings hastened to explain to Mildred that she need not hesitate about closing with Mrs Brindley
Your lessons are arranged for said he
There has been put in the Plaza Trust Company to your credit the sum of five thousand dollars
This gives you about a hundred dollars a week for your board and other personal expenses
If that is not enough you will let me know
But I estimated that it would be enough
I do not think it wise for young women entering upon the preparation for a serious career to have too much money
It is more than enough murmured the girl
I know nothing about those things but it seems to me You can use as little of it as you like interrupted Jennings rising
Mildred felt as though she had been caught and exposed in a hypocritical protest
Jennings was holding out something toward her
She took it and he went on Thats your checkbook
The bank will send you statements of your account and will notify you when any further sums are added
Now I have nothing more to do with your affairsexcept of course the artistic sideyour development as a singer
Youve not forgotten your appointment
No said Mildred like a primary schoolchild before a formidable teacher
Be prompt please
I make no reduction for lessons wholly or partly missed
The halfhour I shall assign to you belongs to you
If you do not use it that is your affair
At first you will probably be like all womencareless about your appointments coming with lessons unprepared telephoning excuses
But if you are serious you will soon fall into the routine
I shall try to be regular murmured Mildred
Jennings apparently did not hear
Im on my way to the operahouse said he
One of my old pupils is appearing in a new role and she is nervous
Good night
Once more that swift quiet exit followed almost instantaneously by the sound of wheels rolling away
Never had she seen such rapidity of motion without loss of dignity
Yes hes a fraud she said to herself but hes a good one
The idea of a career had now become less indefinite
It was still without any attractionnot because of the toil it involved for that made small impression upon her who had never worked and had never seen anyone work but because a career meant cutting herself off from everything she had been brought up to regard as fit and proper for a lady
She was ashamed of this she did not admit its existence even to herself and in her talks with Baird about the career she had professed exactly the opposite view
Yet there it wasnor need she have been ashamed of a feeling that is instilled into women of her class from babyhood as part of their ladylike education
The career had not become definite
She could not imagine herself out on a stage in some sort of a costume with a painted face singing before an audience
Still the career was less indefinite than when it had no existence beyond Stanley Bairds enthusiasm and her own whippedup pretense of enthusiasm
She shrank from the actual start but at the same time was eager for it
Inaction began to fret her nerves and she wished to be doing something to show her appreciation of Stanley Bairds generosity
She telephoned Mrs Brindley that she would come in the morning and then she told her landlady
Mrs Belloc was more than regretful she was distressed
Said she Ive taken a tremendous fancy to you and I hate to give you up
Id do most anything to keep you
Mildred explained that her work compelled her to go
Thats very interesting said Mrs Belloc
If I were a few years younger and hadnt spent all my energy in teaching school and putting through that marriage Id try to get on the stage myself
I dont want to lose sight of you
Oh Ill come to see you from time to time
No you wont said Mrs Belloc practically
No more than Id come to see you
Our lives lie in different directions and in New York that means well never have time to meet
But we may be thrown together again some time
As Ive got a twenty years lease on this house I guess youll have no trouble in finding me
I suppose I could look you up through Professor Jennings
Yes said Mildred
Then impulsively Mrs Belloc theres a reason why Id like to change without anyones knowing what has become of meI mean anyone that might bewatching me
I understand perfectly said Mrs Belloc with a ready sympathy that made Mildred appreciate the advantages of the friendship of unconventional knock about people
Nothing could be easier
Youve got no luggage but that bag
Ill take it up to the Grand Central Station and check it and bring the check back here
You can send for it when you please
But what about me
said Mildred
I was coming to that
You walk out of here say about half an hour after I go in the taxi
You walk through to the corner of Lexington Avenue and Thirty seventh Streetthere arent any cabs to be had there
Ill be waiting in the taxi and well make a dash up the East Side and I can drop you at some quiet place in the park and go onand you can walk to your new address
How does that strike you
Mildred expressed her admiration
The plan was carried out as Mrs Belloca born genius at all forms of intriguehad evolved it in perfection on the spur of the moment
As they went up the far East Side Mrs Belloc looking back through the little rear window saw a taxi a few blocks behind them
We havent given them the slip yet said she but we will in the park
They entered the park at East Ninetieth Street crossed to the West Drive
Acting on Mrs Bellocs instructions the motorman put on full speed with due regard to the occasional policeman
At a sharp turning near the Mall when the taxi could be seen from neither direction he abruptly stopped
Out sprang Mildred and disappeared behind the bushes completely screening the walk from the drive
At once the taxi was underway again
She waiting where the screen of bushes was securely thick saw the taxi that had followed them in the East Side flash byin pursuit of Mrs Belloc alone
She was freeat least until some mischance uncovered her to the little general
At Mrs Brindleys she found a note awaiting hera note from Stanley Baird DEAR MILDRED Im of for the Far West and probably shall not be in town again until the early summer
The club forwards my mail and repeats telegrams as marked
Go in and win and dont hesitate to call on me if you need me
No false pride PLEASE
Im getting out of the way because its obviously best for the present
STANLEY
As she finished her sense of freedom was complete
She had not realized how uneasy she was feeling about Stanley
She did not doubt his generosity did not doubt that he genuinely intended to leave her free and she believed that his delicacy was worthy of his generosity
Still she was constantly fearing lest circumstances should thrust them bothas much against his will as hersinto a position in which she would have to choose between seeming not to say being ungrateful and playing the hypocrite perhaps basely with him
The little general eluded Stanley voluntarily removed she was indeed free
Now she could work with an un troubled mind could show Mrs Brindley that intelligent and persistent workher biggest if in all the worldwas in fact a very simple matter
She had not been settled at Mrs Brindleys many hours before she discovered that not only was she free from all hindrances but was to have a positive and great help
Mrs Brindleys talent for putting people at their ease was no mere drawingroom trick
She made Mildred feel immediately at home as she had not felt at home since her mother introduced James Presbury into their house at Hanging Rock
Mrs Brindley was absolutely devoid of pretenses
When Mildred spoke to her of this quality in her she said I owe that to my husband
I was brought up like everybody elseto be more or less of a poser and a hypocrite
In fact I think there was almost nothing genuine about me
My husband taught me to be myself to be afraid of nobodys opinion to show myself just as I was and to let people seek or avoid me as they saw fit
He was that sort of man himself
He must have been a remarkable man said Mildred
He was replied Mrs Brindley
But not attractiveat least not to me
Our marriage was a mistake
We quarreled whenever we were not at work with the music
If he had not died we should have been divorced
She smiled merrily
Then he would have hired me as his musical secretary and wed have got on beautifully
Mildred was still thinking of Mrs Brindleys freedom from pretense
Ive never dared be myself confessed she
I dont know what myself really is like
I was thinking the other day how for one reason and another Ive been a hypocrite all my life
You see Ive always been a dependenthave always had to please someone in order to get what I wanted
You can never be yourself until you have an independent income however small said Mrs Brindley
Ive had that joy only since my husband died
Its as well that I didnt have it sooner
One is the better for having served an apprenticeship at selfrepression and at pretending to virtues one has not
Only those who earn their freedom know how to use it
If I had had it ten or fifteen years ago Id have been an intolerable tyrant making everyone around me unhappy and therefore myself
The ideal world would be one where everyone was born free and never knew anything else
Then no one being afraid or having to serve everyone would have to be considerate in order to get himself tolerated
I wonder if I really ever shall be able to earn a living
sighed Mildred
You must decide that whatever you can make shall be for you a living said the older woman
I have lived on my fixed income which is under two thousand a year
And I am ready to do it again rather than tolerate anything or anybody that does not suit me
I shall have to be extremely careful laughed Mildred
I shall be a dreadful hypocrite with you
Mrs Brindley smiled but underneath Mildred saw or perhaps feltthat her new friend was indeed not one to be trifled with
She said You and I will get on
Well let each other alone
We have to be more or less intimate but well never be familiar
After a time she discovered that Mrs Brindleys first name was Cyrilla but Mrs Brindley and Miss Stevens they remained to each other for a long timeuntil circumstances changed their accidental intimacy into enduring friendship
Not to anticipate in the course of that same conversation Mildred said If there is anything about meabout my life that you wish me to explain I shall be glad to do so
I know all I wish to know replied Cyrilla Brindley
Your face and your manner and your way of speaking tell me all the essentials
Then you must not think it strange when I say I wish no one to know anything about me
It will be impossible for you entirely to avoid meeting people said Cyrilla
You must have some simple explanation about yourself or you will attract attention and defeat your object
Lead people to believe that Im an orphanperhaps of some obscure familywho is trying to get up in the world
That is practically the truth
Mrs Brindley laughed
Quite enough for New York said she
It is not interested in facts
All the NewYorker asks of you is Can you pay your bills and help me pay mine
 Competent men are rare but thanks to the advantage of the male sex in having to make the struggle for a living they are not so rare as competent women
Mrs Brindley was the first competent woman Mildred had ever known
She had spent but a few hours with her before she began to appreciate what a bad atmosphere she had always breathedbad for a woman who has her way to make in the world or indeed for any woman not willing to be content as mere more or less shiftless more or less hypocritical and pretentious dependent and parasite
Mrs Brindleywell bred and well educatedknew all the little matters which Mildred had been taught to regard as the whole of a ladys education
But Mildred saw that these trifles were but a trifling incident in Mrs Brindleys knowledge
She knew real things this woman who was a thoroughgoing housekeeper and who trebled her income by giving music lessons a few hours a day to such pupils as she thought worth the teaching
When she spoke she always said something one of the first things noticed by Mildred who being too lazy to think except as her naturally good mind insisted on exercising itself usually talked simply to kill time and without any idea of getting anywhere
But while Cyrillawithout in the least intending itroused her to a painful sense of her own limitations she did not discourage her
Mildred also began to feel that in this new atmosphere of ideas of work of accomplishment she would rapidly develop into a different sort of person
It was extremely fortunate for her thought she that she was living with such a person as Cyrilla Brindley
In the old atmosphere or with any taint of it she would have been unable to become a serious person
She would simply have dawdled along twaddling about art and seriousness and careers and sacrifice content with the amateurs methods and the amateurs resultsand deluding herself that she was making progress
Now It was as different as public school from private school public school where the mind is rudely stimulated private school where it is sedulously mollycoddled
She had come out of the hothouse into the open
At first she thought that Jennings was to be as great a help to her as Cyrilla Brindley
Certainly if ever there was a man with the air of a worker and a place with the air of a workshop that man and that place were Eugene Jennings and his studio in Carnegie Hall
When Mildred entered on that Saturday morning at exactly halfpast ten Jenningsin a plain if elegant housesuitlooked at her looked at the clock stopped a girl in the midst of a burst of tremulous noisy melody
That will do Miss Bristow said he
You have never sung it worse
You do not improve
Another lesson like this and we shall go back and begin all over again
The girl a fattish temperamental blonde burst into tears
Kindly take that out into the hall said Jennings coldly
Your time is up
We cannot waste Miss Stevenss time with your hysterics
Miss Bristow switched from tears to fury
You brute
You beast
she shrieked and flung herself out of the room slamming the door after her
Jennings took a book from a pile upon a table opened it and set it on a musicstand
Evidently Miss Bristow was forgottenindeed had passed out of his mind at halfpast ten exactly not to enter it again until she should appear at ten on Monday morning
He said to Mildred Now well see what you can do
Begin
Im a little nervous said Mildred with a shy laugh
If you dont mind Id like to wait till Ive got used to my surroundings
Jennings looked at her
The long sharp nose seemed to be rapping her on the forehead like a wood peckers beak on the bark of the tree
Begin he said pointing to the book
Mildred flushed angrily
I shall not begin until I CAN begin said she
The time to show this man that he could not treat her brutally was at the outset
Jennings opened the door into the hall
Good day Miss Stevens he said with his abrupt bow
Mildred looked at him he looked at her
Her lip trembled the hot tears flooded and blinded her eyes
She went unsteadily to the musicstand and tried to see the notes of the exercises
Jennings closed the door and seated himself at the far end of the room
She begana ridiculous attempt
She stopped gritted her teeth began again
Once more the result was absurd but this time she was able to keep on not improving but maintaining her initial offkey quavering
She stopped
You see said she
Shall I go on
Dont stop again until I tell you to please said he
She staggered and stumbled and somersaulted through two pages of DOREMEFASOLLASI
Then he held up his finger
Enough said he
Silence an awful silence
She recalled what Mrs Belloc had told her about him what Mrs Brindley had implied
But she got no consolation
She said timidly Really Mr Jennings I can do better than that
Wont you let me try a song
God forbid
said he
You cant stand
You cant breathe
You cant open your mouth
Naturally you cant sing
She dropped to a chair
Take the book and go over the same thing sitting said he
She began to remove her wraps
Just as you are he commanded
Try to forget yourself
Try to forget me
Try to forget what a brute I am and what a wonderful singer you are
Just open your mouth and throw the notes out
She was rosy with rage
She was reckless
She sang
At the end of three pages he stopped her with an enthusiastic handclapping
Good
Good
he cried
Ill take you
Ill make a singer of you
Yes yes theres something to work on
The door opened
A tall thin woman with many jewels and a superb fur wrap came gliding in
Jennings looked at the clock
The hands pointed to eleven
Said he to Mildred Take that book with you
Practice what youve done today
Learn to keep your mouth open
Well go into that further next time
He was holding the door open for her
As she passed out she heard him say Ah Mrs Roswell
Well go at that third song first
The door closed
Reviewing all that had occurred Mildred decided that she must revise her opinion of Jennings
A moneymaker he no doubt was
And why not
Did he not have to live
But a teacher also and a great teacher
Had he not destroyed her vanity at one blow demolished ityet without discouraging her
And he went straight to the bottom of things very different from any of the teachers she used to have when she was posing in drawingrooms as a person with a voice equal to the most difficult opera if only she werent a lady and therefore not forced to be a professional singing person
Yes a great teacherand in deadly earnest
He would permit no trifling
How she would have to work
And she went to work with an energy she would not have believed she possessed
He instructed her minutely in how to stand in how to breathe in how to open her mouth and keep it open in how to relax her throat and leave it relaxed
He filled every second of her halfhour she had never before realized how much time half an hour was how use could be made of every one of its eighteen hundred seconds
She went to hear other teachers give lessons and she understood why Jennings could get such prices could treat his pupils as he saw fit
She became an extravagant admirer of him as a teacher thought him a genius felt confident that he would make a great singer of her
With the second lesson she began to progress rapidly
In a few weeks she amazed herself
At last she was really singing
Not in a great way but in the beginnings of a great way
Her voice had many times the power of her drawingroom days
Her notes were full and round and came without an effort
Her former ideas of what constituted facial and vocal expression now seemed ridiculous to her
She was now singing without making those dreadful faces which she had once thought charming and necessary
Her lower register always her best was almost perfect
Her middle registerthe test part of a voicewas showing signs of strength and steadiness and evenness
And she was fast getting a real upper register as distinguished from the forced and shrieky high notes that pass as an upper register with most singers even opera singers
After a month of this marvelous forward march she sang for Mrs Brindleysang the same song she had essayed at their first meeting
When she finished Mrs Brindley said Yes youve done wonders
Ive been noticing your improvement as you practiced
You certainly have a very different voice and method from those you had a month ago and so on through about five minutes of critical and discriminating praise
Mildred listened wondering why her dissatisfaction her irritation increased as Mrs Brindley praised on and on
Beyond question Cyrilla was sincere and was saying even more than Mildred had hoped she would say
Yet Mildred sat moodily measuring off octaves on the keyboard of the piano
If she had been looking at her friends face she would have flared out in anger for Cyrilla Brindley was taking advantage of her abstraction to observe her with friendly sympathy and sadness
Presently she concealed this candid expression and said You are satisfied with your progress arent you Miss Stevens
Mildred flared up angrily
Certainly
replied she
How could I fail to be
Mrs Brindley did not answerperhaps because she thought no answer was needed or expected
But to Mildred her silence somehow seemed a denial
If you can only keep what youve gotand go on said Mrs Brindley
Oh I shall never fear retorted Mildred
But I do fear said Mrs Brindley
I think its always well to fear until success is actually won
And then theres the awful fear of not being able to hold it
After a moments silence Mildred who could not hide away resentment against one she liked said Why arent YOU satisfied Mrs
Brindley
But I am satisfied protested Cyrilla
Only it makes me afraid to see YOU so well satisfied
Ive seen that often in people first starting and its always dangerous
You see my dear youve got a straightaway hundred miles to walk
Cant you see that it would be possible for you to become too much elated by the way you walked the first part of the first mile
Why do you try to discourage me
said Mildred
Mrs Brindley colored
I do it because I want to save you from despair a little later said she
But that is foolish of me
I shall only irritate you against me
Ill not do it again
And please dont ask my opinion
If you do I cant help showing exactly what I think
Then you dont think Ive done well
cried Mildred
Indeed you have replied Cyrilla warmly
Then I dont understand
What DO you mean
Ill tell you and then Ill stop and you must not ask my opinion again
We live too close together to be able to afford to criticize each other
What I meant was this You have done well the first part of the great task thats before you
If you had done it any less well it would have been folly for you to go on
That is what Ive done doesnt amount to anything
Mr Jennings doesnt agree with you
Doubtless hes right said Mrs Brindley
At any rate we all agree that you have shown that you have a voice
She said this so simply and heartily that Mildred could not but be mollified
Mrs Brindley changed the subject to the song Mildred had sung and Mildred stopped puzzling over the mystery of what she had meant by her apparently enthusiastic words which had yet diffused a chill atmosphere of doubt
She was doing her scales so well that she became impatient of such tiresome childs play
And presently Jennings gave her songs and did not discourage her when she talked of roles of getting seriously at what after all she intended to do
Then there came a week of vile weather and Mildred caught a cold
She neglected it
Her voice left her
Her tonsils swelled
She had a bad attack of ulcerated sore throat
For nearly three weeks she could not take a single one of the lessons which were nevertheless paid for
Jennings rebuked her sharply
A singer has no right to be sick said he
You have a cold yourself retorted she
But I am not a singer
Ive nothing that interferes with my work
Its impossible not to take cold said Mildred
You are unreasonable with me
He shrugged his shoulders
Go get well he said
The sore throat finally yielded to the treatment of Dr Hicks the throatspecialist
His bill was seventy five dollars
But while the swelling in the tonsils subsided it did not depart
She could take lessons again
Some days she sang as well as ever and on those days Jennings was charming
Other days she sang atrociously and Jennings treated her as if she were doing it deliberately
A third and worse state was that of the days when she in the same halfhour alternately sang well and badly
On those days Jennings acted like a lunatic
He raved up and down the studio all but swearing at her
At first she was afraid of him withered under his scorn feared he would throw open his door and order her out and forbid her ever to enter again
But gradually she came to understand him not enough to lose her fear of him altogether but enough to lose the fear of his giving up so profitable a pupil
The truth was that Jennings like every man who succeeds at anything in this world operated upon a system to which he rigidly adhered
He was a man of small talent and knowledge but of great persistence and not a little common sense
He had tried to be a singer had failed because his voice was small and unreliable
He had adopted teaching singing as a means of getting a living
He had learned just enough about it to enable him to teach the technical elementswhat is set down in the books
By observing other and older teachers he had got together a teaching system that was as goodand as badas any and this he dubbed the Jennings Method and proceeded to exploit as the only one worth while
When that method was worked out and perfected he ceased learning ceased to give a thought to the professional side of his profession just as most professional men do
He would have resented a suggestion or a new idea as an attack upon the Jennings Method
The overwhelming majority of the human raceindeed all but a small handfulhave this passion for stagnation this ferocity against change
It is in large part due to laziness for a new idea means work in learning it and in unlearning the old ideas that have been true until the unwelcome advent of the new
In part also this resistance to the new idea arises from a fear that the new idea if tolerated will put one out of business will set him adrift without any means of support
The coachman hates the automobile the handworker hates the machine the orthodox preacher hates the heretic the politician hates the reformer the doctor hates the bacteriologist and the chemist the old woman hates the newall these in varying proportions according to the degree in which the iconoclast attacks laziness or livelihood
Finally we all hate any and all new ideas because they seem to imply that we who have held the old ideas have been ignorant and stupid in so doing
A new idea is an attack upon the vanity of everyone who has been a partisan of the old ideas and their established order
Jennings thoroughly human in thus closing his mind to all ideas about his profession was equally human in that he had his mind and his senses opened full width to ideas on how to make more money
If there had been money in new ideas about teaching singing Jennings would not have closed to them
But the money was all in studying and learning how better to handle the womenthey were all women who came to him for instruction
His common sense warned him at the outset that the obviously easygoing teacher would not long retain his pupils
On the other hand he saw that the really severe teacher would not retain his pupils either
Who were these pupils
In the first place they were all ignorant for people who already know do not go to school to learn
They had the universal delusion that a teacher can teach
The fact is that a teacher is a well
Some wells are full others almost dry
Some are so arranged that water cannot be got from them others have attachments of various kinds making the drawing of water more or less easy
But not from the best well with the latest pump attachment can one get a drink unless one does the drinking oneself
A teacher is rarely a well
The pupil must not only draw the water but also drink it must not only teach himself but also learn what he teaches
Now we are all of us born thirsty for knowledge and nearly all of us are born both capable of teaching ourselves and capable of learning what we teach that is of retaining and assimilating it
There is such a thing as artificially feeding the mind just as there is such a thing as artificially feeding the body but while everyone knows that artificial feeding of the body is a success only to a limited extent and for a brief period everyone believes that the artificial feeding of the mind is not only the best method but the only method
Nor does the discovery that the mind is simply the brain is simply a part of the body subject to the bodys laws seem materially to have lessened this fatuous delusion
Some of Jenningss pupilsnot more than two of the fortyodd were in genuine earnest that is those two were educating themselves to be professional singers were determined so to be had limited time and means and endless capacity for work
Others of the forty about halfthought they were serious though in fact the idea of a career was more or less hazy
They were simply taking lessons and toiling aimlessly along not less aimlessly because they indulged in vague talk and vaguer thought about a career
The restthe other half of the fortywere amusing themselves by taking singing lessons
It killed time it gave them a feeling of doing something it gave them a reputation of being serious people and not mere idlers it gave them an excuse for neglecting the domestic duties which they regarded as degradingprobably because to do them well requires study and earnest hard work
The Jennings singing lesson at fifteen dollars a halfhour was rather an expensive hypocrisy but the women who used it as a cloak for idleness as utter as the mere yawners and bridgers and shoppers had rich husbands or fathers
Thus it appears that the Jennings School was a perfect microcosm as the scientists would say of the human racethe serious very few toiling more or less successfully toward a definite goal the many compelled to do something and imagining themselves serious and purposeful as they toiled along toward nothing in par ticular but the next lessonthat is the next days appointed task the utterly idle fancying themselves busy and important when in truth they were simply a fraud and an expense
Jennings got very little from the deeply and genuinely serious
One of them he taught free taking promissory notes for the lessons
But he held on to them because when they finally did teach themselves to sing and arrived at fame his would be part of the gloryand glory meant more and more pupils of the paying kinds
His large income came from the other two kinds of pupils the larger part of it from the kind that had no seriousness in them
His problem was how to keep all these paying pupils and also keep his reputation as a teacher
In solving that problem he evolved a method that was the true Jenningss method
Not in all New York filled as it is with people living and living well upon the manipulation of the weaknesses of their fellow beingsnot in all New York was there an adroiter manipulator than Eugene Jennings
He was harsh to brutality when he saw fit to be soor rather when he deemed it wise to be so
Yet never had he lost a paying pupil through his harshness
These were fashionable womenmost delicate sensitive ladiesat whom he swore
They wept stayed on advertised him as a wonderful serious teacher who wont stand any nonsense and doesnt care a hang whether you stay or goand he can teach absolutely anybody to sing
He knew how to be gentle without seeming to be so he knew how to flatter without uttering a single word that did not seem to be reluctant praise or savage criticism he knew how to make a lady with a little voice work enough to make a showing that would spur her to keep on and on with him he knew how to encourage a rich woman with no more song than a peacock until she would come to him three times a week for many yearsand how he did make her pay for what he suffered in listening to the hideous squawkings and yelpings she inflicted upon him
Did Jennings think himself a fraud
No more than the next human being who lives by fraud
Is there any trade or profession whose practitioners in the bottom of their hearts do not think they are living excusably and perhaps creditably
The Jennings theory was that he was a great teacher that there were only a very few serious and worthwhile seekers of the singing art that in order to live and to teach these few he had to receive the others that anyhow singing was a fine art for anyone to have and taking singing lessons made the worst voice a little less bador at the least singing was splendid for the health
One of his favorite dicta was Every child should be taught singing for its health if for nothing else
And perhaps he was right
At any rate he made his forty to fifty thousand a yearand on days when he had a succession of the noisy tuneless squawkers he felt that he more than earned every cent of it
Mildred did not penetrate far into the secret of the moneymaking branch of the Jennings method
It was crude enough too
But are not all the frauds that fool the human race crude
Human beings both cannot and will not look beneath surfaces
All Mildred learned was that Jennings did not give up paying pupils
She had not confidence enough in this discovery to put it to the test
She did not dare disobey him or shirk even when she was most disposed to do so
But gradually she ceased from that intense application she had at first brought to her work
She kept up the forms
She learned her lessons
She did all that was asked
She seemed to be toiling as in the beginning
In reality she became by the middle of spring a mere lessontaker
Her interest in clothes and in going about revived
She saw in the newspapers that General Siddall had taken a party of friends on a yachting trip around the world so she felt that she was no longer being searched for at least not vigorously
She became acquainted with smart rich West Side women taking lessons at Jenningss
She amused herself going about with them and with the musical men they attractedamateur and semiprofessional singers and players upon instruments
She drew Mrs Brindley into their society
They had little parties at the flat in Fiftyninth Streetthe most delightful little parties imaginabledinners and suppers music clever conversations flirtations of a harmless but fascinating kind
If anyone had accused Mildred of neglecting her work of forgetting her career she would have grown indignant and if Mrs Brindley had overheard she would have been indignant for her
Mildred worked as much as ever
She was making excellent progress
She was doing all that could be done
It takes time to develop a voice to make an operasinger
Forcing is dangerous when it is not downright useless
In Maytoward the end of the monthStanley Baird returned
Mildred who happened to be in unusually good voice that day sang for him at the Jennings studio and he was enchanted
As the last note died away he cried out to Jennings Shes a wonder isnt she
Jennings nodded
Shes got a voice said he
She ought to go on next year
Not quite that said Jennings
We want to get that upper register right first
And its a young voiceshes very young for her age
We must be careful not to strain it
Why whats a voice for if not to sing with
said Stanley
A fine voice is a very delicate instrument replied the teacher
He added coldly You must let me judge as to what shall be done
Certainly certainly said Stanley in haste
Shes had several colds this winter and spring pursued Jennings
Those things are dangerous until the voice has its full growth
She should have two months complete rest
Jennings was going away for a two months vacation
He was giving this advice to all his pupils
Youre right said Baird
Did you hear Mildred
But I hate to stop work objected Mildred
I want to be doing something
Im very impatient of this long wait
And honest she was in this protest
She had no idea of the state of her own mind
She fancied she was still as eager as ever for the career as intensely interested as ever in her work
She did not dream of the real meaning of her content with her voice as it was of her lack of uneasiness over the appalling fact that such voice as she had was unreliable came and went for no apparent reason
Absolute rest for two months declared Jennings grimly
Not a note until I return in August
Mildred gave a resigned sigh
There is much inveighing against hypocrisy a vice unsightly rather than desperately wicked
And in the excitement about it its dangerous even deadly near kinsman selfdeception escapes unassailed
Seven cardinal sins but what of the eighththe parent of all the others the one beside which the children seem almost white
During the first few weeks Mildred had been careful about spending money
Economy she did not understand how could she when she had never had a lesson in it or a valuable hint about it
So economy was impossible
The only way in which such people can keep order in their finances is by not spending any money at all
Mildred drew nothing spent nothing
This so long as she gave her whole mind to her work
But after the first great cold so depressing so subtly undermining she began to go about to think of to need and to buy clothes to spend money in a dozen necessary ways
After all she was simply borrowing the money
Presently she would be making a career would be earning large sums
She would pay back everything with interest
Stanley meant for her to use the money
Really she ought to use it
How would her career be helped by her going about looking a dowd and a frump
She had always been used to the comforts of life
If she deprived herself of them she would surely get into a frame of mind where her work would suffer
No she must lead the normal life of a woman of her class
To work all the timewhy as Jennings said that took away all the freshness made one stale and unfit
A little distractionalways of course with musical people people who talked and thought and did musicthat sort of distraction was quite as much a part of her education as the singing lessons
Mrs Brindley certainly a sensible and serious woman if ever there was oneMrs Brindley believed so and it must be so
After that illness and before she began to go about she had fallen into several fits of hideous blues had been in despair as to the future
As soon as she saw something of peoplealways the valuable musical sort of peopleher spirits improved
And when she got a few new dressesvery simple and inexpensive but stylish and charmingand the hats too were successful as soon as she was freshly arrayed she was singing better and was talking hopefully of the career again
Yes it was really necessary that she live as she had always been used to living
When Stanley came back her account was drawn up to the last cent of the proportionate amount
In fact it might have been a few dollarsa hundred or so overdrawn
She was not sure
Still that was a small matter
During the summer she would spend less and by fall she would be far ahead againand ready to buy fall clothes
One day he said You must be needing more money
No indeed cried she
Ive been living within the hundred a weekor nearly
Im afraid Im frightfully extravagant and Extravagant
laughed he
You are afraid to borrow
Why three or four nights of singing will pay back all youve borrowed
I suppose I WILL make a lot of money said she
They all tell me so
But it doesnt seem real to me
She hastily added I dont mean the career
That seems real enough
I can hardly wait to begin at the roles
I mean the money part
You see I never earned any money and never really had any money of my own
Well youll have plenty of it in two or three years said Stanley confidently
And you mustnt try to live like girls whove been brought up to hardship
It isnt necessary and it would only unfit you for your work
I think thats true said she
But Ive enough more than enough
She gave him a nervous shy almost agonized look
Please dont try to put me under any heavier obligations than I have to be
Please dont talk nonsense about obligation retorted he
Lets get away from this subject
You dont seem to realize that youre doing me a favor that its a privilege to be allowed to help develop such a marvelous voice as yours
Scores of people would jump at the chance
That doesnt lessen my obligation said she
And she thought she meant it though in fact his generous and plausible statement of the case had immediately lessened not a little her sense of obligation
On the whole however she was not sorry she had this chance to talk of obligation
Slowly as they saw each other from time to time often alone Stanley had begunperhaps in spite of himself and unconsciously to show his feeling for her
Sometimes his hand accidentally touched hers and he did not draw it away as quickly as he might
And sheit was impossible for her to make any gesture much less say anything that suggested sensitiveness on her part
It would put him in an awkward position would humiliate him most unjustly
He fell into the habit of holding her hand longer than was necessary at greeting or parting of touching her caressingly of looking at her with the eyes of a lover instead of a friend
She did not like these things
For some mysterious reasonfrom sheer perversity she thoughtshe had taken a strong physical dislike to him
Perfectly absurd for there was nothing intrinsically repellent about this handsome clean most attractively dressed man of the best type of American and NewYorker
No only perversity could explain such a silly notion
She was always afraid he would try to take advantage of her delicate positionalways afraid she would have to yield something some trifle yet the idea of giving anything from a sense of obligation was galling to her
His very refraining made her more nervous the more shrinking
If he would only commit some overt actseize her kiss her make outrageous demandsbut this refrain ing these touches that might be accidental and again might be stealthy approach She hated to have him shake hands with her would have liked to draw away when his clothing chanced to brush against hers
So she was glad of the talk about obligation
It set him at a distance immediately
He ceased to look lovingly to indulge in the nerverasping little caresses
He became carefully formal
He was evidently eager to prove the sincerity of his protestationstoo eager perhaps her perverse mind suggested
Still sincere or not he held to all the forms of sincerity
Some friends of Mrs Brindleys who were going abroad offered her their cottage on the New Jersey coast near Seabright and a big new touringcar and chauffeur
She and Mildred at once gave up the plan for a summer in the Adirondacks the more readily as several of the men and women they saw the most of lived within easy distance of them at Deal Beach and Elberon
When Mildred went shopping she was lured into buying a lot of summer things she would not have needed in the Adirondacksa mere matter of two hundred and fifty dollars or thereabouts
A little additional economy in the fall would soon make up for such a trifle and if there is one time more than another when a woman wishes to look well and must look well that time is summerespecially by the sea
When her monthly statement from the bank came on the first of July she found that five thousand dollars had been deposited to her credit
She was moved by this discovery to devote several hoursvery depressed hours they wereto her finances
She had spent a great deal more money than she had thought indeed since March she had been living at the rate of fifteen thousand a year
She tried to account for this amazing extravagance
But she could recall no expenditure that was not really almost if not quite necessary
It took a frightful lot of money to live in New York
How DID people with small incomes manage to get along
Whatever would have become of her if she had not had the good luck to be able to borrow from Stanley
What would become of her if before she was succeeding on the stage Stanley should die or lose faith in her or interest in her
What would become of her
She had been living these last few months among people who had wideopen eyes and knew everything that was going onand did some goingon themselves as she was now more than suspecting
There were many women thousands of themamong the attractive costily dressed throngs she saw in the carriages and autos and cabswho would not like to have it published how they contrived to live so luxuriously
No they would not like to have it published though they cared not a fig for its being whispered New York too thoroughly understood how necessary luxurious living was and was too completely divested of the follies of the oldfashioned straightlaced morality to mind little shabby details of queer conduct in striving to keep up with the procession
Even the married women using their husbandsand letting their husbands use themdid not frown on the irregularities of their sisters less fortunately married or not able to find a permanent leg to pull
As for the girlsMildred had observed strange things in the lives of the girls she knew more or less well nowadays
In fact all the women of all classes and conditions were engaged in the same mad struggle to get hold of money to spend upon fun and finerya struggle matching in recklessness and resoluteness the struggle of the men downtown for money for the same purposes
It was curious this double mania of the men and the womenthe mania to get money no matter how the instantly succeeding mania to get rid of it no matter how
Looking about her Mildred felt that she was peculiar and apart from nearly all the women she knew
SHE got her money honorably
SHE did not degrade herself did not sell herself did not wheedle or cajole or pretend in the least degree
She had grown more liberal as her outlook on life had widened with contact with the New York mindno with the mind of the whole easygoing luxurymad moralityscorning modern world
She still kept her standard for herself high and believed in a purity for herself which she did not exact or expect in her friends
In this respect she and Cyrilla Brindley were sympathetically alike
No Mildred was confident that in no circumstances in NO circumstances would she relax her ideas of what she personally could do and could not do
Not that she blamed or judged at all women who did as she would not but she could not simply could not however hard she might be driven do those things though she could easily understand how other women did them in preference to sinking down into the working class or eking out a frowsy existence in some poor boardinghouse
The temptation would be great
Thank Heaven it was not teasing her
She would resist it of course
But What if Stanley Baird should lose interest
What if after he lost interest she should find herself without money worse of than she had been when she sold herself into slaveryhighly moral and conventionally correct slavery but still slaveryto the little general with the peaked pinksilk nightcap hiding the absence of the removed toupeeand with the wonderful pinksilk pajamas gorgeously monogramed in violet and the tiny feet and ugly handsand those loathsome needlepointed mustaches and the hideous habit of mumbling his tongue and smacking his lips
What if moneyless she should not be able to find another Stanley or a man of the class gentleman willing to help her generously even on ANY terms
What then
She was looking out over the sea her bankbook and statements and canceled checks in her lap
Their cottage was at the very edge of the strand its veranda was often damp from spray after a storm
It was not storming as she sat there taking stock under a blue sky an almost tranquil sea was crooning softly in the sunlight innocent and happy and playful as a child
She dressed in a charming negligee and looking forward to a merry day in the auto with lunch and dinner at attractive luxurious places farther down the coast she was stricken with a horrible sadness with a terror that made her heart beat wildly
I must be crazy
she said half aloud
Ive never earned a dollar with my voice
And for two months it has been unreliable
Im acting like a crazy person
What WILL become of me
Just then Stanley Baird came through the pretty little house seeking her
There you are
he cried
Do go get dressed
Hastily she flung a scarf over the book and papers in her lap
She had intended to speak to him about that fresh deposit of five thousand dollarsto refuse it to rebuke him
Now she did not dare
Whats the matter
he went on
Headache
It was the wine at dinner last night explained she
I ought never to touch red wine
It disagrees with me horribly
That was filthy stuff said he
You must take some champagne at lunch
Thatll set you right
She stealthily wound the scarf about the papers
When she felt that all were secure she rose
She was looking sweet and sad and peculiarly beautiful
There was an exquisite sheen on her skin
She had washed her hair that morning and it was straying fascinatingly about her brow and ears and neck
Baird looked at her lowered his eyes and colored
Ill not be long she said hurriedly
She had to pass him in the rather narrow doorway
From her garments shook a delicious perfume
He caught her in his arms
The blood had flushed into his face in a torrent swelling out the veins giving him a distorted and wild expression
Mildred
he cried
Say that you love me a little
Im so lonely for youso hungry for you
She grew cold with fear and with repulsion
She neither yielded to his embrace nor shook it off
She simply stood her round smooth body hard though corsetless
He kissed her on the throat kissed the lace over her bosom crying out inarticulately
In the frenzy of his passion he did not for a while realize her lack of response
As he felt it his arms relaxed dropped away from her fell at his side
He hung his head
He was breathing so heavily that she glanced into the house apprehensively fearing someone else might hear
I beg pardon he muttered
You were too much for me this morning
It was your fault
You are maddening
She moved on into the house
Wait a minute
he called after her
She halted hesitating
Come back he said
Ive got something to say to you
She turned and went back to the veranda he retreating before her and his eyes sinking before the cold clear blue of hers
Youre going up not to come down again he said
You think Ive insulted youthink Ive acted outrageously
How glad she was that he had so misread her thoughts had not discovered the fear the weakness the sudden collapse of all her boasted confidence in her strength of character
Youll never feel the same toward me again he went fatuously on
You think Im a fraud
Well Ill admit that I am in love with youhave been ever since the steameralways was crazy about that mouth of yoursand your figure and the sound of your voice
Ill admit Im an utter fool about yourespect you and trust you as I never used to think any woman deserved to be respected and trusted
Ill even admit that Ive been hopingall sorts of things
I knew a woman like you wouldnt let a man help her unless she loved him
At this her heart beat wildly and a blush of shame poured over her face and neck
He did not see
He had not the courage to look at herto face that expression of the violated goddess he felt confident her face was wearing
In love he reasoned and felt about her like an inexperienced boy all his experience going for nothing
He went on I understand we can never be anything to each other until youre on the stage and arrived
Id not have it otherwise if I could
For I want YOU and Id never believe I had you unless you were free
The color was fading from her cheeks
At this it flushed deeper than before
She must speak
Not to speak was to lie was to play the hypocrite
Yet speak she dared not
At least Stanley Baird was better than Siddall
Anyhow who was she that had been the wife of Siddall to be so finicky
You dont believe me
he said miserably
You think Ill forget myself sometime again
I hope not she said gently
I believe not
I trust you Stanley
And she went into the house
He looked after her in admiration of the sweet and pure calm of this quiet rebuke
She tried to take the same exalted view of it herself but she could not fool herself just then with the familiar good woman fake
She knew that she had struck the flag of selfrespect
She knew what she would really have done had he been less delicate less in love and more practical
And she found a small and poor consolation in reflecting I wonder how many women there are who take high ground because it costs nothing
We are prone to suspect everybody of any weakness we find in ourselvesand perhaps we are not so far wrong as are those who accept without question the noisy protestations of a world of selfdeceivers
Thenceforth she and Stanley got on better than ever apparently
But though she ignored it she knew the truthknew her new and deep content was due to her not having challenged his assertion that she loved him
He believing her honest and high minded assumed that the failure to challenge was a good womans way of admitting
But with the day of reckoning not only with him but also with her own self respectput off until that vague and remote time when she should be a successful prima donna she gave herself up to enjoyment
That was a summer of rarely fine weather particularly fine along the Jersey coast
They always in gay partiesmotored up and down the coast and inland
Several of the musical men notably Richardson of Elberonhad plenty of money Stanley stopping with his cousins the Frasers on the Rumson Road brought several of his friends all rich and more or less free
As every moment of Mildreds day was full and as it was impossible not to sleep and sleep well in that ocean air with the surf soothing the nerves as the lullaby of a nurse soothes a baby she was able to put everything unpleasant out of mind
She was resting her voice was building up her health therefore the career was being steadily advanced and no time was being wasted
She felt sorry for those who had to do unpleasant or disagreeable things in making their careers
She told herself that she did not deserve her good fortune in being able to advance to a brilliant career not through hardship but over the most delightful road imaginableamusing herself wearing charming and satisfactory clothes swimming and dancing motoring and feasting
Without realizing it she was strongly under the delusion that she was herself already richthe inevitable delusion with a woman when she moves easily and freely and luxuriously about never bothered for money always in the company of rich people
The rich are fated to demoralize those around them
The stingy rich fill their satellites with envy and hatred
The generous rich fill them with the feeling that the light by which they shine and the heat with which they are warm are not reflected light and heat but their own
Never had she been so happy
She even did not especially mind Donald Keith a friend of Stanleys and of Mrs Brindleys who much too often to suit her made one of the party
She had tried in vain to discover what there was in Keith that inspired such intense liking in two people so widely different as expansive and emotional Stanley Baird and reserved and distinctly cold Cyrilla Brindley
Keith talked little not only seemed not to listen well but showed plainly even in teteatete conversations that his thoughts had been elsewhere
He made no pretense of being other than he wasan indifferent man who came because it did not especially matter to him where he was
Sometimes his silence and his indifference annoyed Mildred againthanks to her profound and reckless contentmentshe was able to forget that he was along
He seemed to be and probably was about forty years old
His head was beautifully shaped the line of its profilefront top and backbeing perfect in intellectuality strength and symmetry
He was rather under the medium height about the same height as Mildred herself
He was extremely thin and loosely built and his clothes seemed to hang awry giving him an air of slovenliness which became surprising when one noted how scrupulously neat and clean he was
His brown hair considerably tinged with rusty gray grew thinly upon that beautiful head
His skin was dry and smooth and dead white
This taken with the classic regularity of his features gave him an air of lifelessness of one burnt out by the fire of too much living but whether the living had been done by Keith himself or by his immediate ancestors appearances did not disclose
This look of passionless motionless repose like classic sculpture was sharply and startlingly belied by a pair of really wonderful eyes deeply and intensely blue brilliant all seeing all comprehending eyes that seemed never to sleep seemed the ceaselessly industrious servants of a brain that busied itself without pause
The contrast between the dead white calm of his face the listlessness of his relaxed figure and these vivid eyes so intensely alive gave to Donald Keiths personality an uncanniness that was most disagreeable to Mildred
Thats what fascinates me said Cyrilla when they were discussing him one day
Fascinates
exclaimed Mildred
Hes tiresome when he isnt rude
Rude
Not actively rude but worse still passively rude
He is the only man Ive ever seen with whom I could imagine myself falling in love said Mrs Brindley
Mildred laughed in derision
Why hes a dead man
cried she
You dont understand said Cyrilla
Youve never lived with a man
She forgot completely as did Mildred herself so completely had Mrs Siddall returned to the modes and thoughts of a girl
At hometo live withyou want only reposeful things
That is why the Greeks whose instincts were unerring had so much reposeful statuary
One grows weary of agitating objects
They soon seem hysterical and shallow
The same things true of persons
For permanent love and friendship you want reposeful men calm strong silent
The other kind either wear you out or wear themselves out with you
You forget his eyes put in Stanley
Did you ever see such eyes
Yes those eyes of his
cried Mildred
You certainly cant call them reposeful Mrs
Brindley
Mrs Brindley did not seize the opportunity to convict her of inconsistency
Said she I admit the eyes
Theyre the eyes of the kind of man a woman wants or another man wants in his friend
When Keith looks at you you feel that you are seeing the rarest being in the worldan absolutely reliable person
When I think of him I think of reliable just as when you think of the sun you think of brightness
I had no idea it was so serious as this teased Stanley
Nor had I returned Cyrilla easily until I began to talk about him
Dont tell him Mr Baird or he might take advantage of me
The idea amused Stanley
He doesnt care a rap about women said he
I hear he has let a few care about him from time to time but he soon ceased to be goodnatured
He hates to be bored
As he came just then they had to find another subject
Mildred observed him with more interest
She had learned to have respect for Mrs Brindleys judgments
But she soon gave over watching him
That profound calm those eyes concentrating all the life of the man like a burning glass She had a disagreeable sense of being seen through even to her secretest thought of being understood and measured and weighed and found wanting
It occurred to her for the first time that part of the reason for her not liking him was the best of reasonsthat he did not like her
The first time she was left alone with him after this discovery she happened to be in an audacious and talkative mood and his lack of response finally goaded her into saying WHY dont you like me
She cared nothing about it she simply wished to hear what he would sayif he could be roused into saying anything
He was sitting on the steps leading from the veranda to the seawas smoking a cigarette and gazing out over the waves like a graven image as if he had always been posed there and always would be there the embodiment of repose gazing in ineffable indifference upon the embodiment of its opposite
He made no answer
I asked you why you do not like me said she
Did you hear
Yes replied he
She waited nothing further from him
Said she Well give me one of your cigarettes
He rose extended his case then a light
He was never remiss in those kinds of politeness
When she was smoking he seated himself again and dropped into the former attitude
She eyed him wondering how it could be possible that he had endured the incredible fatigues and hardships Stanley Baird had related of himhunting and exploring expeditions into tropics and into frozen regions mountain climbs wild sea voyages in small boats all with no sign of being able to stand anything yet also with no sign of being any more disturbed than now in this seaside laziness
Stanley had showed them a picture of him taken twenty years and more ago when he was in college he had looked almost the same thenperhaps a little older
Well I am waiting persisted she
She thought he was about to look at hera thing he had never done to her knowledge since they had known each other
She nerved herself to receive the shock with a certain flutter of expectancy of excitement even
But instead of looking he settled himself in a slightly different position and fixed his gaze upon another point in the horizon
She noted that he had splendid handsideal hands for a man with the same suggestion of intense vitality and aliveness that flashed from his eyes
She had not noted this before
Next she saw that he had good feet and that his boots were his only article of apparel that fitted him or rather that looked as if made for him
She tossed her cigarette over the rail to the sand
He startled her by speaking in his unemotional way
He said Now I like you better
I dont understand said she
No answer from him
The cigarette depending listlessly from his lips seemedas usualuncertain whether it would stay or fall
She watched this uncertainty with a curious nervous interest
She was always thinking that cigarette would fall but it never did
Said she Why did you say you liked me less
Better corrected he
We used to have a pump in our back yard at home laughed she
One toiled away at the handle but nothing ever came
And it was a promisinglooking pump too
He smileda slow reluctant smile but undeniably attractive
Said he Because you threw away your cigarette
You object to women smoking
No said he
His tone made her feel how absurd it was to suspect him of such provincialism
You object to MY smoking
suggested she laughing Pump
Pump
No said he
Then your remark meant nothing at all
He was silent
You are rude said she coldly rising to go into the house
He said something what she did not hear in her agitation
She paused and inquired What did you say
I said I am not rude but kind replied he
That is detestable
cried she
I have not liked you but I have been polite to you because of Stanley and Mrs Brindley
Why should you be insulting to me
What have I done
inquired he unmoved
He had risen as she rose but instead of facing her he was leaning against the post of the veranda bent upon his seaward vigil
You have insinuated that your reasons for not liking me were a reflection on me
You insisted said he
You mean that they are
demanded she furiously
She was amazed at her wild unaccountable rage
He slowly turned his head and looked at hera glance without any emotion whatever simply a look that like the beam of a powerful searchlight seemed to thrust through fog and darkness and to light up everything in its path
Said he Do you wish me to tell you why I dont like you
No
she cried hysterically
Never mindI dont know what Im saying
And she went hastily into the house
A moment later in her own room upstairs she was wondering at herself
Why had she become confused
What did he mean
What had she seenor half seenin the darkness and fog within herself when he looked at her
In a passion she cried If he would only stay away
VI BUT he did not stay away
He owned and lived in a small house up on the Rumson Road
While the house was little more than a bungalow and had a simplicity that completely hid its rare good taste from the average observer its grounds were the most spacious in that neighborhood of costly showy houses set in grounds not much more extensive than a city building lot
The grounds had been cleared and drained to drive out and to keep out the obnoxious insect life but had been left a forest concealing the house from the roads
Stanley Baird was now stopping with Keith and brought him along to the cottage by the sea every day
The parties narrowed to the same four persons
Mrs Brindley seemed never to tire of talking to Keith or to tire of talking about him when the two men had left late each night
As for Stanley he referred everything to Keiththe weather prospects where they should go for the day what should be eaten and drunk any point about politics or fashion life or literature or what not that happened to be discussed
And he looked upon Donalds monosyllabic reply to his inquiry as a final judgment ending all possibility of argument
Mildred held out long
Then in spite of herself she began to yield ceased to dislike him found a kind of pleasureor perhaps fascinated interestin the nervousness his silent and indifferent presence caused her
She liked to watch that immobile perfect profile neither young nor old indeed not suggesting age in any degree but only experience and knowledgeand an infinite capacity for emotion for passion even
The deadwhite color declared it had already been lived the brilliant usually averted or veiled eyes asserted present vitality pulsing under a calm surface
One day when Stanley in the manner of one who wishes a thing settled and settled right said he would ask Donald Keith about it Mildred a little piqued a little amused retorted And what will he answer
Why simply yes or no
Thats all assented Stanley
And thats quite enough isnt it
But how do you know hes as wise as he pretends
He doesnt pretend to be anything or to know anything
Thats precisely it
Mildred suddenly began to like Keith
She had never thought of this before
Yes it was true he did not pretend
Not in the least not about anything
When you saw him you saw at once the worst there was to see
It was afterward that you discovered he was not slovenly but clean and neat not badly but well dressed not homely but handsome not sickly but soundly well not physically weak but strong not dull but vividly alive not a tiresome void but an unfathomable mystery
What does he do
she asked Mrs Brindley
Cyrillas usually positive gray eyes looked vague
She smiled
I never asked said she
Ive known him nearly three years and it never occurred to me to ask or to wonder
Isnt that strange
Usually about the first inquiry we make is what a man does
Ill ask Stanley said Mildred
And she did about an hour later when they were in the surf together with the other two out of earshot
Said Stanley Hes a lawyer of course
Also hes written a novel or two and a book of poems
Ive never read them
Somehow I never get around to reading
Oh hes a lawyer
Thats the way he makes his living
A queer kind of lawyer
He never goes to court and his clients are almost all other lawyers
They go to him to get him to tell them what to do and what not to do
Hes got a big reputation among lawyers Fred Norman tells me but makes comparatively little as he either cant or wont charge what he ought
I told him what Norman said and he only smiled in that queer way he has
I said You make twenty or thirty thousand a year
You ought to make ten times that
 And what did he answer
asked Mildred
Nothing
He said I make all I want
If I took in more Id be bothered getting rid of it or investing it
I can always make all Ill wantunless I go crazy
And what could a crazy man do with money
It doesnt cost anything to live in a lunatic asylum
 Several items of interest to add to those she had collected
He could talk brilliantly but he preferred silence
He could make himself attractive to women and to men but he preferred to be detached
He could be a great lawyer but he preferred the quiet of obscurity
He could be a rich man but he preferred to be comparatively poor
Said Mildred I suppose some womansome disappointment in lovehas killed ambition and everything like that
I dont think so replied Baird
The men who knew him as a boy say he was always as he is now
He lived in the Arabian desert for two years
Why didnt he stay
laughed Mildred
That life would exactly suit him
It did said Stanley
But his father died and he had to come home and support his motheruntil she died
Thats the way his whole life has been
He drifts in the current of circumstances
He might let himself be blown away tomorrow to the other end of the earth and stay away yearsor never come back
But how would he live
On his wits
And as well or as poorly as he cared
Hes the sort of man everyone instinctively asks advice ofme you his valet the farmer who meets him at a boundary fence the fellow who sits nest him in a trainanyone
Mildred did not merely cease to dislike him she went farther and rapidly
She began to like him to circle round that tantalizing indolent mystery as a deer about a queer bit of brush in the undergrowth
She liked to watch him
She was alternately afraid to talk before him and recklessly confidentialall with no response or sign of interest from him
If she was silent when they were alone together he was silent too
If she talked still he was silent
What WAS he thinking about
What did he think of herthat especially
What ARE you thinking
she interrupted herself to say one afternoon as they sat together on the strand under a big sunshade
She had been talking on and on about her careertalking conceitedly as her subject intoxicated hertelling him what triumphs awaited her as soon as she should be ready to debut
As he did not answer she repeated her question adding I knew you werent listening to me or I shouldnt have had the courage to say the foolish things I did
No I wasnt admitted he
Why not
For the reason you gave
That what I said wasjust talk
Yes
You dont believe Ill do those things
Do you
Ive GOT to believe it said she
If I didnt She came to a full stop
If you didnt then what
It was the first time he had ever flattered her with interest enough to ask her a question about herself
If I didnt believe I was going to succeedand succeed big she began
After a pause she added Id not dare say it
Or think it said he
She colored
What do you mean
she asked
He did not reply
What do you mean Mr
Keith
she urged
You are always asking me questions to which you already know the answer said he
Youre referring to a week or so ago when I asked you why you disliked me
No answer
No sign of having heard
No outward sign of interest in anything even in the cigarette drooping from the corner of his mouth
Wasnt that it
she insisted
You are always asking me questions to which you already know the answer repeated he
I am annoying you
No answer
She laughed
Do you want me to go away and leave you in peace with thatlaw caseor whatever it is
I dont like to be alone
But anyone would doa dog
No reply
You mean a dog would be better because it doesnt ask questions to which it knows the answer
No reply
Well I have a pleasantsounding voice
As Im saying nothing it may be soothinglike the sound of the waves
Ive learned to take you as you are
I rather like your pose
No reply
No sign that he was even tempted to rise to this bait and protest
But you dont like mine she went on
Yes it is a pose
But Ive got to keep it up and to pretend to myself that it isnt
And it isnt altogether
I shall be a successful singer
When
said he
Actually he was listening
She answered Inabout two years I think
No comment
You dont believe it
Do you
A pause
Why ask these questions youve already answered yourself
Ill tell you why replied she her face suddenly flushed with earnestness
Because I want you to help me
You help everyone else
Why not me
You never asked me said he
I didnt know I wanted it until just nowas I said it
But YOU must have known because you are so much more experienced than Iand understand peoplewhats going on in their minds deeper than they can see
Her tone became indignant reproachful
Yes you must have known I needed your help
And you ought to have helped me even if you did dislike me
Youve no right to dislike anyone as young as I
He was looking at her now the intensely alive blue eyes sympathetic penetrating understanding
It was frightful to be so thoroughly understoodall ones weaknesses laid bareyet it was a relief and a joy too like the cruel healing knife of the surgeon
Said he I do not like kept women
She gasped grew ghastly
It was a frightful insult one for which she was wholly unprepared
You believethat
she said slowly
Another of those questions he said
And he looked calmly away out over the sea as if his interest in the conversation were at an end
What should she say
How denyhow convince him
For convince him she must and then go away and never permit him to speak to her again until he had apologized
She said quietly Mr Keith you have insulted me
I do not like kept women either with or without a license said he in the same even indifferent way
When you ceased to be a kept woman I would help you if I could
But no one can help a kept woman
There was nothing to do but to rise and go away
She rose and went toward the house
At the veranda she paused
He had not moved
She returned
He was still inspecting the horizon the cigarette depending from his lipshow DID he keep it alight
She said Mr Keith I am sure you did not mean to insult me
What did you mean
Another of those questions said he
Honestly I do not understand
Then think
And when you have thought you will understand
But I have thought
I do not understand
Then it would be useless to explain said he
That is one of those vital things which if one cannot understand them for oneself one is hopelessis beyond helping
You mean I am not in earnest about my career
Another of those questions
If you had not seen clearly what I meant you would have been really offended
Youd have gone away and not come back
She saw that this was true
And seeing she wondered how she could have been so stupid as not to have seen it at once
She had yet to learn that overlooking the obvious is a universal human failing and that seeing the obvious is the talent and the use of the superior of earththe few who dominate and determine the race
You reproach me for not having helped you he went on
How does it happen that you are uneasy in mindso uneasy that you are quarreling at me
A light broke upon her
You have been drawing me on from the beginning she cried
You have been helping memaking me see that I needed help
No said he
Ive been waiting to see whether you would rouse from your dream of grandeur
YOU have been rousing me
No he said
Youve roused yourself
So you may be worth helping or rather worth encouraging for no one can HELP you but yourself
She looked at him pathetically
But what shall I do
she asked
Ive got no money no experience no sense
Im a vain luxuryloving fool cursed with awith ais it a conscience
I hope its something more substantial
I hope its common sense
But I have been workinghonestly I have
Dont begin lying to yourself again
Dont be harsh with me
He drew in his legs in preparation for risingno doubt to go away
I dont mean that she cried testily
You are not harsh with me
Its the truth thats harshthe truth Im beginning to seeand feel
I am afraid afraid
I havent the courage to face it
Why whine
said he
Theres nothing in that
Do you think theres any hope for me
That depends said he
On what
On what you want
I want to be a singer a great singer
No theres no hope
She grew cold with despair
He had a way of saying a thing that gave it the full weight of a verdict from which there was no appeal
Now if you wanted to make a living he went on and if you were determined to learn to sing as well as you could with the idea that you might be able to make a livingwhy then there might be hope
You think I can sing
I never heard you
Can you
They say I can
What do YOU say
I dont know she confessed
Ive never been able to judge
Sometimes I think Im singing well and I find out afterward that Ive sung badly
Again its the other way
Then obviously whats the first thing to do
To learn to judge myself said she
I never thought of it beforehow important that is
Do you know JenningsEugene Jennings
The singing teacher
No
Is he a good teacher
No
Why not
Because he has not taught you that you will never sing until you are your own teacher
Because he has not taught you that singing is a small and minor part of a career as a singer
But it isnt protested she
A long silence
Looking at him she felt that he had dismissed her and her affairs from his mind
Is it
she said to bring him back
What
asked he vaguely
You said that a singer didnt have to be able to sing
Did I
He glanced down the shore toward the house
It feels like lunchtime
He rose
What did you mean by what you said
When you have thought about your case a while longer well talk of it againif you wish
But until youve thought talking is a waste of time
She rose stood staring out to sea
He was observing her a faint smile about his lips
He said Why bother about a career
After all kept woman is a thoroughly respectable occupationor can be made so by any preacher or justice of the peace
Its followed by many of our best womenthose who pride themselves on their high charactersand on their pride
I could not belong to a man unless I cared for him said she
I tried it once
I shall never do it again
That sounds fine said he
Lets go to lunch
You dont believe me
Do you
She sank down upon the sand and burst into a wild passion of sobs and tears
When her fight for self control was over and she looked up to apologize for her pitiful exhibition of weaknessand to note whether she had made an impression upon his sympathiesshe saw him just entering the house a quarter of a mile away
To anger succeeded a mood of desperate forlornness
She fell upon herself with gloomy ferocity
She could not sing
She had no brains
She was taking moneya disgracefully large amount of money from Stanley Baird under false pretenses
How could she hope to sing when her voice could not be relied upon
Was not her throat at that very moment slightly sore
Was it not always going queer
Shesing
Absurd
Did Stanley Baird suspect
Was he waiting for the time when she would gladly accept what she must have from him on his own terms
No not on his terms but on the terms she herself would arrange the only terms she could make
No Stanley believed in her absolutelybelieved in her career
When he discovered the truth he would lose interest in her would regard her as a poor worthless creature would be eager to rid himself of her
Instead of returning to the house she went in the opposite direction made a circuit and buried herself in the woods beyond the Shrewsbury
She was mad to get away from her own company but the only company she could fly to was more depressing than the solitude and the taunt and sneer and lash of her own thoughts
It was late in the afternoon before she nerved herself to go home
She hoped the others would have gone off somewhere but they were waiting for her Stanley anxious and Cyrilla Brindley irritated
Her eyes sought Keith
He was as usual the indifferent spectator
Where have you been
cried Stanley
Making up my mind said she in the tone that forewarns of a storm
A brief pause
She struggled in vain against an impulse to look at Keith
When her eyes turned in his direction he not looking at her moved in his listless way toward the door
Said he The autos waiting
Come on
She vacillated yielded began to put on the wraps Stanley was collecting for her
It was a big touring car and they sat two and two with the chauffeur alone
Keith was beside Mildred
When they were under way she said Why did you stop me
Perhaps Ill never have the courage again
Courage for what
asked he
To take your advice and break off
MY advice
Yes your advice
You have to clutch at and cling to somebody dont you
You cant bear the idea of standing up by your own strength
You think Im trying to fasten to you
she said with an angry laugh
I know it
You admitted it
You are not satisfied with the way things are going
You have doubts about your career
You shrink from your only comfortable alternative if the career winks out
You ask me my opinion about yourself and about careers
I give it
Now I find you asked only that you might have someone to lean on to accuse of having got you into a mess if doing what you think you ought to do turns out as badly as you fear
It was the longest speech she had heard him make
She had no inclination to dispute his analysis of her motives
I did not realize it said she but that is probably so
Butremember how I was brought up
Theres only one thing for you to do
Go back to my husband
You knowabout me dont you
Yes I cant go back to him
No
Thenwhat
she asked
Go on as now replied he
You despise me dont you
No
But you said you did
Dislike and despise are not at all the same
You admit that you dislike me cried she triumphantly
He did not answer
You think me a weak clinging creature not able to do anything but make pretenses
No answer
Dont you
she persisted
Probably I have about the same opinion of you that you have of yourself
What WILL become of me
she said
Her face lighted up with an expression of reckless beauty
If I could only get started Id go to the devil laughing and dancingand taking a train with me
You ARE started said he with an amiable smile
Keep on
But I doubt if youll be so well amused as you may imagine
Going to the devil isnt as its painted in novels by homely old maids and by men too timid to go out of nights
A few steps farther and your disillusionment will begin
But therell be no turning back
Already you are almost too old to make a career
Im only twentyfour
I flattered myself I looked still younger
Its worse than I thought said he
Most of the singers even the secondrate ones began at fifteen began seriously
And you havent begun yet
Thats unjust she protested
Ive done a little
Many great people would think it a great deal
You havent begun yet repeated he calmly
You have spent a lot of money and have done a lot of dreaming and talking and listening to compliments and have taken a lot of lessons of an expensive charlatan
But what have those things to do with a career
Youve never heard me sing
I do not care for singing
Oh
said she in a tone of relief
Then you know nothing about all this
On the contrary I know everything about a career
And we were talking of careers not of singing
You mean that my voice is worthless because I havent the other elements
What else could I have meant
said he
You havent the strength
You havent the health
She laughed as she straightened herself
Do I look weak and sickly
cried she
For the purposes of a career as a female you are strong and well said he
For the purpose of a career as a singer He smiled and shook his head
A singer must have muscles like wire ropes like a blacksmith or a washerwoman
The other day we were climbing a hilla not very steep hill
You stopped five times for breath and twice you sat down to rest
She was literally hanging her head with shame
I wasnt very well that day she murmured
Dont deceive yourself said he
Dont indulge in the fatal folly of selfexcuse
Go on she said humbly
I want to hear it all
Is your throat sore today
pursued he
She colored
Its better she murmured
A singer with sore throat
mocked he
Youve had a slight fogginess of the voice all summer
Its this sea air she eagerly protested
It affects everyone
No selfexcuse please interrupted he
Cigarettes champagne all kinds of foolish food an impaired digestionthats the truth and you know it
Ive got splendid digestion
I can eat anything
she cried
Oh you dont know the first thing about singing
You dont know about temperament about art about all the things that singing really means
We were talking of careers said he
A career means a person who can be relied upon to do what is demanded of him
A singers career means a powerful body perfect health a sound digestion
Without them the voice will not be reliable
What you need is not singing teachers but teachers of athletics and of hygiene
To hear you talk about a career is like listening to a child
You think you can become a professional singer by paying money to a teacher
There are lawyers and doctors and business men in all lines who think that way about their professionsthat learning a little routine of technical knowledge makes a lawyer or a doctor or a merchant or a financier
Tell meWHAT ought I to learn
Learn to thinkand to persist
Learn to concentrate
Learn to make sacrifices
Learn to handle yourself as a great painter handles his brush and colors
Then perhaps youll make a career as a singer
If not itll be a career as something or other
She was watching him with a wistful puzzled expression
Could I ever do all that
Anyone could by working away at it every day
If you gain only one inch a day in a year youll have gained three hundred and sixtyfive inches
And if you gain an inch a day for a while and hold it you soon begin to gain a foot a day
But theres no need to worry about that
He was gazing at her now with an expression of animation that showed how feverishly alive he was behind that mask of calmness
The days workthats the story of success
Do the days work persistently thoroughly intelligently
Never mind about tomorrow
Thinking of it means dreaming or despairingboth futilities
Just the days work
I begin to understand she said thoughtfully
You are right
Ive done nothing
Oh Ive been a foolmore foolish even than I thought
A long silence then she said somewhat embarrassed and in a low voice though there was no danger of those in front of them hearing I want you to know that there has been nothing wrongbetween Stanley and me
Do you wish me to put that to your credit or to your discredit
inquired he
What do you mean
Why youve just told me that you havent given Stanley anything at all for his moneythat youve cheated him outright
The thing itself is discreditable but your tone suggests that you think Ill admire you for it
Do you mean to say that youd think more highly of me if I werewhat most women would be in the same circumstances
I mean to say that I think the whole business is discreditable to both of youto his intelligence to your character
You are frank said she trying to hide her anger
I am frank replied he undisturbed
He looked at her
Why should I not be
You know that I need you that I dont dare resent said she
So isnt ita little cowardly
Why do you need me
Not for money for you know youll not get that
I dont want it cried she agitated
I never thought of it
Yes youve probably thought of it replied he coolly
But you will not get it
Well thats settledIll not get it
Then why do you need me
Of what use can I be to you
Only one use in the world
To tell you the truththe exact truth
Is not that so
Yes she said
That is what I want from you what I cant get from anyone else
No one else knows the truthnot even Mrs Brindley though shes intelligent
I take back what I said about your being cowardly
Oh you do stab my vanity so
You mustnt mind my crying out
I cant help itat least not till I get used to you
Cry out said he
It does no harm
How wonderfully you understand me
exclaimed she
Thats why I let you say to me anything you please
He was smiling peculiarlya smile that somehow made her feel uncomfortable
She nerved herself for some still deeper stab into her vanity
He said his gaze upon her and ironical Im sorry I cant return the compliment
What compliment
asked she
Cant say that you understand me
Why do you think I am doing this
She colored
Oh no indeed Mr Keith she protested I dont think you are in love with meor anything of that sort
Indeed I do not
I know you better than that
Really
said he amused
Then you are not human
How can you think me so vain
she protested
Because you are so replied he
You are as vainno more so but just as much soas the average pretty and attractive woman brought up as you have been
You are not obsessed by the notion that your physical charms are allpowerful and in that fact there is hope for you
But you attach entirely too much importance to them
You will find them a hindrance for a long time before they begin to be a help to you in your career
And they will always be a temptation to you to take the easy stupid way of making a livingthe only way open to most women that is not positively repulsive
I think it is the most repulsive said Mildred
Dont cant replied he unimpressed
Its not so repulsive to your sort of woman as manual labor or as any kind of work that means no leisure no luxury and small pay
I wonder said Mildred
IIm afraid youre right
But I WONT admit it
I dont dare
Thats the finest truest thing Ive ever heard you say said Keith
Mildred was pleased out of all proportion to the compliment
Said she with frank eagerness Then Im not altogether hopeless
As a character no indeed replied he
But as a career I was about to say you may set your mind at rest
I shall never try to collect for my services
I am doing all this solely out of obstinacy
Obstinacy
asked the puzzled girl
The impossible attracts me
Thats why Ive never been interested to make a career in law or politics or those things
I care only for the thing that cant be done
When I saw you and studied you as I study every new thing I decided that you could not possibly make a career
Why have you changed your mind
she interrupted eagerly
I havent replied he
If I had I should have lost interest in you
Just as soon as you show signs of making a career I shall lose interest in you
I have a friend a doctor who will take only cases where cure is impossible
Looking at you it occurred to me that here was a chance to make an experiment more interesting than any of his
And as I have no other impossible task inviting me at present I decided to undertake youif you were willing
Why do you tell me this
she asked
To discourage me
No
Your vanity will prevent that
Then why
To clear myself of all responsibility for you
You understandI bind myself to nothing
I am free to stop or to go on at any time
And I
said Mildred
You must do exactly as I tell you
But that is not fair cried she
Why not
inquired he
Without me you have no hopenone whatever
I dont believe that declared she
It is not true
Very well
Then well drop the business said he tranquilly
If the time comes when you see that Im your only hope and if then Im in my present humor we will go on
And he lapsed into silence from which she soon gave over trying to rouse him
She thought of what he had said studied him but could make nothing of it
She let four days go by days of increasing unrest and unhappiness
She could not account for herself
Donald Keith seemed to have cast a spell over heran evil spell
Her throat gave her more and more trouble
She tried her voice found that it had vanished
She examined herself in the glass and saw or fancied that her looks were goingnot so that others would note it but in the subtle ways that give the first alarm to a woman who has beauty worth taking care of and thinks about it intelligently
She thought Mrs Brindley was beginning to doubt her suspected a covert uneasiness in Stanley
Her foundations such as they were seemed tottering and ready to disintegrate
She saw her own past with clear vision for the first time saw how futile she had been and why Keith believed there was no hope for her
She made desperate efforts to stop thinking about past and future to absorb herself in present comfort and luxury and opportunities for enjoyment
But Keith was always thereand to see him was to lose all capacity for enjoyment
She was curt almost rude to himhad some vague idea of forcing him to stay away
Yet every time she lost sight of him she was in terror until she saw him again
She was alone on the small veranda facing the high road
She happened to glance toward the station her gaze became fixed her body rigid for coming leisurely and pompously toward the house was General Siddall in the full panoply of his wonderful tailoring and haberdashery
She thought of flight but instantly knew that flight was useless the little general was not there by accident
She waited her rigidity giving her a deceptive seeming of calm and even ease
He entered the little yard taking off his glossy hat and exposing the rampant toupee
He smiled at her so slightly that the angle of the needlepointed mustaches and imperial was not changed
The cold expressionless fishy eyes simply looked at her
A delightful little house said he with a patronizing glance around
May I sit down
She inclined her head
And you are looking well charming he went on and he seated himself and carefully planted his neat boots side by side
For the summer theres nothing equal to the seashore
You are surprised to see me
I thought you were abroad said Mildred
So I wasuntil yesterday
I came back because my men had found you
And Im here because I venture to hope that you have had enough of this foolish escapade
I hope we can come to an understanding
Ive lost my taste for wandering about
I wish to settle downto have a home and to stay in it
By that I mean of course two or threeor possibly four houses according to the season
Mildred sent her glance darting about
The little general saw and began to talk more rapidly
Ive given considerable thought to ourour misunderstanding
I feel that I gave too much importance to youryour I did not take your youth and inexperience of the world and of married life sufficiently into account
Also the first Mrs Siddall was not a ladynor the second
A lady a young lady was a new experience to me
I am a generous man
So I say frankly that I ought to have been more patient
You said you would never see me again until I came to you said Mildred
As he was not looking at her she watched his face
She now saw a changebehind the mask
But he went on in an unchanged voice Were you aware that Mrs Baird is about to sue her husband for a separationnot for a divorce but for a separationand name you
Mildred dropped limply back in her chair
That means scandal continued Siddall scandal touching my namemy honor
I may say I do not believe what Mrs Baird charges
My men have had you under observation for several weeks
Also Mrs Brindley is I learn a woman of the highest character
But the thing looks badyou hiding from your husband living under an assumed name receiving the visits of a former admirer
You are mistaken said Mildred
Mrs Baird would not bring such a false wicked charge
You are innocent my dear said the general
You dont realize how your conduct looks
She intends to charge that her husband has been supporting you
Mildred quivering started up sank weakly back again
But he went on you will easily prove that your money is your inheritance from your father
I assured myself of that before I consented to come here
Consented
said Mildred
At whose request
That of my own generosity replied he
But my honor had to be reassured
When I was satisfied that you were innocent and simply flighty and foolish I came
If there had been any taint upon you of course I could not have taken you back
As it is I am willingI may say more than willing
Mrs Baird can be bought off and frightened off
When she finds you have me to protect you she will move very cautiously you may be sure
As the little man talked Mildred saw and felt behind the mask the thoughts the longings of his physical infatuation for her coiling and uncoiling and reaching tremulously out toward her like unclean horrible tentacles
She was drawn as far as could be back into her chair and her soul was shrinking within her body
I am willing to make you a proper allowance and to give you all proper freedom he went on
He showed his sharp white teeth in a gracious smile
I realize I must concede something of my oldfashioned ideas to the modern spirit
I never thought I would but I didnt appreciate how fond I was of you my dear
He mumbled his tongue and noiselessly smacked his thin lips
Yes you are worth concessions and sacrifices
I am not going back said Mildred
Nothing you could offer me would make any difference
She felt suddenly calm and strong
She stood
Please consider this final
But my dear said the general softly though there was a wicked gleam behind the mask you forget the scandal I forget nothing interrupted she
I shall not go back
Before he could attempt further to detain her she opened the screen door and entered
It closed on the spring and on the spring lock
Donald Keith coming in from the seafront veranda was just in time to save her from falling
She pushed him fiercely away and sank down on the sofa just within the pretty little drawingroom
She said Thank you
I didnt mean to be rude
I was only angry with myself
Im getting to be one of those absurd females who blubber and keel over
Youre white and limp said he
Whats the matter
General Siddall is out there
Umhes come back has he
said Keith
And I am afraid of himhorribly afraid of him
In some places and circumstances he would be a dangerous proposition said Keith
But not here in the Eastand not to you
He would do ANYTHING
I dont know what he can do but I am sure it will be frightfulwill destroy me
You are going with him
She laughed
I loathe him
I thought I left him through fear and anger
I was mistaken
It was loathing
And my fear of himits loathing too
You mean that
said Keith observing her intently
You wish to be rid of him
What a poor opinion you have of me said she
Really I dont deserve quite that
Then come with me
The look of terror and shrinking returned
Where
To see him
For the last time said Keith
Therell be no scene
It was the supreme test of her confidence in him
Without hesitation she rose preceded him into the hall and advanced firmly toward the screen door through which the little general could be seen
He was standing at the top step his back to them
At the sound of the opening door he turned
This is Mr Donald Keith said Mildred
He wishes to speak to you
The general bowed Keith bent his head
They eyed each other with the measuring glance
Keith said in his dry terse way I asked Miss Gower to come with me because I wish her to hear what I have to say to you
You mean my wife said the general with a gracious smile
I mean Miss Gower returned Keith
As you know she is not your wife
Mildred uttered a cry but the two men continued to look each at the other with impassive countenances
Your only wife is the woman who has been in the private insane asylum of Doctor Rivers at Pueblo Colorado for the past eleven years
For about twenty years before that she was in the Delavan private asylum near Denver
You could not divorce her under the laws of Colorado
The divorce you got in Nevada was fraudulent
Thats a lie said the general coldly
Keith went on as if he had not heard You will not annoy this lady again
And you will stop bribing Stanley Bairds wife to make a fool of herself
And you will stop buying houses in the blocks where Baird owns real estate and moving colored families into them
I tell you that about my divorce is a lie replied Siddall
I can prove it said Keith
And I can prove that you knew it before you married your second wife
For the first time Siddall betrayed at the surface a hint of how hard he was hit
His skin grew bright yellow wrinkles round his eyes and round the base of his nose sprang into sudden prominence
I see you know what I meanthat attempt to falsify the record at Carson City said Keith
He opened the screen door for Mildred to pass in
He followed her and the door closed behind them
They went into the drawingroom
He dropped into an easy chair crossed his legs leaned his head back indolentlya favorite attitude of his
How long have you known
said she
Her cheeks were flushed with excitement
Oh a good many years replied he
It was one of those accidental bits of information a man runs across in knocking about
As soon as Baird told me about you I had the thing looked up quietly
I was going up to see him tomorrowabout the negroes and Mrs Bairds suit
Does Stanley know
inquired she
No said Keith
Not necessary
Never will be
If you like you can have the marriage annulled without notoriety
But thats not necessary either
After a long silence she said What does this make out of me
You mean what would be thought of you if it were known
inquired he
Well it probably wouldnt improve your social position
I am disgraced said she curiously rather than emotionally
Would be if it were known corrected he and if you are nothing but a woman without money looking for a husband
If you happened to be a singer or an actress it would add to your reputationmake you more talked about
But I am not an actress or a singer
On the other hand I should say you didnt amount to much socially
Except in Hanging Rock of course if there is still a Hanging Rock
Dont worry about your reputation
Fussing and fretting about your social position doesnt help toward a career
Naturally you take it coolly
But you can hardly expect me to cried she
You are taking it coolly said he
Then why try to work yourself up into a fit of hysterics
The thing is of no importanceexcept that youre free nowwill never be bothered by Siddall again
You ought to thank me and forget it
Dont be one of the little people who are forever agitating about trifles
Trifles
To speak of such things as trifles
And yet Well what did they actually amount to in her life
Yes I AM free she said thoughtfully
Ive got what I wantedgot it in the easiest way possible
Thats better said he approvingly
And Ive burnt my bridges behind me pursued she
Theres nothing for me now but to go ahead
Which road
inquired he carelessly
The career cried she
Theres no other for me
Of course I COULD marry Stanley when hes free as he would be before very long if I suggested it
Yes I could marry him
Could you
observed he
Doesnt he love me
Undoubtedly
Then why do you say he would not marry me
demanded she
Did I say that
You insinuated it
You suggested that there was a doubt
Then there is no doubt
Yes there is she cried angrily
You wont let me enjoy the least bit of a delusion
He might marry me if I were famous
But as I am now Hes an inbred snob
He cant help it
He simply couldnt marry a woman in my position
But youre overlooking one thingthat I would not marry HIM
Thats unimportant if true said Keith
You dont believe it
I dont care anything about it my dear lady said Keith
Have you got time to waste in thinking about how much I am in love with you
What a womanly woman you are to be sure
Your true woman you know never thinks of anything but lovenot how much she loves but how much she is loved
Be careful
she warned
Some day youll go too far in saying outrageous things to me
And then
said he smilingly
You care nothing for our friendship
The experiment is the only interest I have in you replied he
That is not true said she
You have always liked me
Thats why you looked up my hus General Siddalsic and got ready for him
Thats why you saved me today
You are a very tenderhearted and generous manand you hide it as you do everything else about yourself
He was looking off into space from the depths of the easy chair a mocking smile on his classical impassive face
What puzzles me she went on is why you interest yourself in as vain and shallow and vacillating a woman as I am
You dont care for my looksand thats all there is to me
Dont pause to be contradicted said he
She was in a fine humor now
You might at least have said I was up to the female average for I am
What have they got to offer a man but their looks
Do you know why I despise men
Do you
I do
And its because they put up with women as much as they dospend so much money on them listen to their chatter admire their ridiculous clothes
Oh I understand why
Ive learned that
And I can imagine myself putting up with anything in some one man I happened to fancy strongly
But men are foolish about the whole sexor all of them that have a shadow of a claim to good looks
Yes the men make fools of themselves admitted he
But I notice that the men manage somehow to make the careers and hold on to the money and the power while the women have to wheedle and fawn and submit in order to get what they want from the men
Theres nothing to be said for your sex
Its been hopelessly corrupted by mine
For all the talk about the influence of woman what impression has your sex made upon mine
And your sexit has been made by mine into exactly what we wished it to be
Take my advice get out of your sex
Abandon it and make a career
After a while she recalled with a start the events of less than an hour agoevents that ought to have seemed wildly exciting arousing the deepest and strongest emotions
Yet they had made no impression upon her
Absolutely none
She had no horror in the thought that she had been the victim of a bigamist she had no elation over her release into freedom and safety
She wondered whether this arose from utter frivolousness or from indifference to the trifles of conventional joys sorrows agitations excitements which are the whole life of most peoplethat indifference which is the cause of the general opinion that men and women who make careers are usually hardened in the process
As she lay awake that nightshe had got a very bad habit of lying awake hour after hourshe suddenly came to a decision
But she did not tell Keith for several days
She did it in this way Dont you think Im looking better
she asked
Youre sleeping again said he
Do you know why
Because my minds at rest
Ive decided to accept your offer
And my terms
said he apparently not interested by her announcement
And your terms assented she
You are free to stop whenever the whim strikes you I must do exactly as you bid
What do you wish me to do
Nothing at present replied he
I will let you know
She was disappointed
She had assumed that something something new and interesting probably irritating perhaps enraging would occur at once
His indifference his putting off to a future time which his manner made seem most hazily indefinite gave her the foolish and collapsing sense of having broken through an open door
VII THE first of September they went up to town
Stanley left at once for his annual shooting trip Donald Keith disappeared sayingas was his habit neither what he was about nor when he would be seen again
Mrs Brindley summoned her pupils and her musical friends
Mildred resumed the lessons with Jennings
There was no doubt about it she had astonishingly improved during the summer
There had comeor rather had come backinto her voice the birdlike quality free joyous spontaneous that had not been there since her fathers death and the familys downfall
She was glad that her arrangement with Donald Keith was of such a nature that she was really not bound to go on with itif he should ever come back and remind her of what she had said
Now that Jennings was enthusiasticgiving just and deserved praise as her own ear and Mrs Brindley assured her she was angry at herself for having tolerated Keiths frankness his insolence his insulting and contemptuous denials of her ability
She was impatient to see him that she might put him down
She said to Jennings You think I can make a career
There isnt a doubt in my mind now replied he
You ought to be one of the few great lyric sopranos within five years
A man this summera really unusual man in some waystold me there was no hope for me
A singing teacher
No a lawyer
A Mr KeithDonald Keith
Ive heard of him said Jennings
His mother was Rivi the famous coloratura of twenty years ago
Mildred was astounded
He must know something about music
Probably replied Jennings
He lived with her in Italy I believe until he was almost grown
Then she died
You sang for him
No Mildred said it hesitatingly
Oh
said Jennings and his expressioninterested disturbed puzzledmade Mildred understand why she had been so reluctant to confess
Jennings did not pursue the subject but abruptly began the lesson
That day and several days thereafter he put her to tests he had never used before
She saw that he was searching for somethingfor the flaw implied in the adverse verdict of the son of Lucia Rivi
She was enormously relieved when he gave over the search without having found the flaw
She felt that Donald Keiths verdict had been proved false or at least faulty
Yet she was not wholly reassured and from time to time she suspected that Jennings had not been either
Soon the gayety of the preceding winter and spring was in full swing again
Keith did not return did not write and Cyrilla Brindley inquired and telephoned in vain
Mildred worked with enthusiasm with hope presently with confidence
She hoped every day that Keith would come she would make him listen to her force him to admit
She caught a slight cold neglected it tried to sing it away
Her voice left her abruptly
She went to Jennings as usual the day she found herself able to do nothing more musical than squeak
She told him her plight
Said he Begin
Lets hear
She made a few dismal attempts stopped short and half laughing half ashamed faced him for the lecture she knew would be forthcoming
Now it so happened that Jennings was in a frightful humor that dayone of those humors in which the most prudent lose their selfcontrol
He had been listening to a succession of new pupilswomen with money and no voice women who screeched and screamed and thoroughly enjoyed themselves and angled confidently for compliments
As Jennings had an acute musical ear his sufferings had been frightful
He was used to these torments had the habit of turning the fury into which they put him into excellent financial or disciplinary account
But on this particular day his nerves went to pieces and it was with Mildred that the explosion came
When she looked at him she was horrified to see a face distorted and discolored by sheer rage
You fool
he shouted storming up and down
You fool
You cant sing
Keith was right
You wouldnt do even for a church choir
You cant be relied on
Theres nothing behind your voiceno strength no endurance no brains
No brains
Do you hearno brains I say
Mildred was terrified
She had seen him in tantrums before but always there had been a judicious reserving of part of the truth
Instead of resenting instead of flashing eye or quivering lips Mildred sat down and with white face and dazed eyes stared straight before her
Jennings raved and roared himself out
As he came to his senses from this debauch of truthtelling his first thought was how expensive it might be
Thus long before there was any outward sign that the storm had passed the ravings the insults were shrewdly tempered with qualifyings
If she kept on catching these colds if she did not obey his instructions she might put off her debut for yearsfor three years for two years at least
And she would always be rowing with managers and irritating the publicand so on and on
But the mischief had been done
The girl did not rouse
No use to go on today he said grufflythe pretense at last rumblings of an expiring storm
Nor any other day said Mildred
She stood and straightened herself
Her face was beautiful rather than lovely
Its pallor its strong lines the melancholy intensity of the eyes made her seem more the woman fully developed less far less the maturing girl
Nonsense
scolded Jennings
But no more colds like that
They impair the quality of the voice
I have no voice said the girl
I see the truth
Jennings was inwardly cursing his insane temper
In about the kindliest tone he had ever used with her he said My dear Miss Stevens you are in no condition to judge today
Come back tomorrow
Do something for that cold tonight
Clear out the throat and come back tomorrow
You will see
Yes I know those tricks said she with a sad little smile
You can make a crow seem to sing
But you told me the truth
Tomorrow he cried pleasantly giving her an encouraging pat on the shoulder
He knew the folly of talking too much the danger of confirming her fears by pretending to make light of them
A good sleep and tomorrow things will look brighter
He did not like her expression
It was not the one he was used to seeing in those vain temperamental pupils of histhe downcast vanity that will be up again in a few hours
It was rather the expression of one who has been finally and forever disillusioned
On her way home she stopped to send Keith a telegram I must see you at once
There were several at the apartment for tea among them Cullan an amateur violinist and critic on music whom she especially liked
For instead of the dreamy romantic character his large brown eyes and sensitive features suggested he revealed in talk and actions a boyish gayetyfree be it said from boyish silliness that was most infectious
His was one of those souls that put us in the mood to laugh at all seriousness to forget all else in the supreme fact of the reality of existence
He made her forget that dayforget until Keiths answering telegram interrupted Next Monday afternoon
A week less a day away
She shrank and trembled at the prospect of relying upon herself alone for six long days
Every prop had been taken away from her
Even the dubious prop of the strange unsatisfactory Keith
For had he not failed her
She had said must and at once and he had responded with three words of curt refusal
After dinner Stanley unexpectedly appeared
He hardly waited for the necessary formalities of the greeting before he said to Mrs Brindley I want to see Mildred alone
I know you wont mind Mrs Brindley
Its very important
He laughed nervously but cheerfully
And in a few minutes Ill call you in
I think Ill have something interesting to tell you
Mrs Brindley laughed
With her cigarette in one hand and her cup of afterdinner coffee in the other she moved toward the door saying gayly to Mildred Ill be in the next room
If you scream I shall hear
So dont be alarmed
Stanley closed the door turned beaming upon Mildred
Said he Heres my news
My missus has got her divorce
Mildred started up
Yes the real thing he assured her
Of course I knew what was doing
But I kept mumdidnt want to say anything to you till I could say everything
Mildred Im free
We can be married tomorrow if you will
Then you know about me
said she confused
On the way I stopped in to see Keith
He told me about that skunktold me you were free too
Mildred slowly sat down
Her elbows rested upon the table
There was her bare forearm slender and round and her long graceful fingers lay against her cheek
The light from above reflected charmingly from the soft waves and curves of her hair
Youre lovelysimply lovely
cried Stanley
Mildred darlingyou WILL marry me wont you
You can go right on with the career if you like
In fact Id rather you would for Im frightfully proud of your voice
And Ive changed a lot since I became sincerely interested in you
The other sort of life and people dont amuse me any more
Mildred say youll marry me
Ill make you as happy as the days are long
She moved slightly
Her hand dropped to the table
I guess I came down on you too suddenly said he
You look a bit dazed
No Im not dazed replied she
Ill call Mrs Brindley in and well all three talk it over
Please dont said she
Ive got to think it out for myself
I know there isnt anyone else he went on
So Im suredead sure Mildred that I can teach you to love me
She looked at him pleadingly
I dont have to answer right away
Certainly not laughed he
But why shouldnt you
What is there against our getting married
Nothing
And everything for it
Our marriage will straighten out all thethe little difficulties and you can go ahead with the singing and not bother about money or what people might say or any of those things
IIve got to think about it Stanley she said gently
I want to do the decent thing by you and by myself
Youre afraid Ill interfere in the careerwont want you to go on
Mildred I swear Im It isnt that she interrupted her color high
The truth is she faltered came to a full stop cried Oh I cant talk about it tonight
Tomorrow
he suggested
Idont know she stammered
Perhaps to morrow
But it may be two or three days
Stanley looked crestfallen
That hurts Mildred he said
I was SO full of it so anxious to be entirely happy and I thought youd fall right in with it
Something to do with money
Youre horribly sensitive about money dear
I like that in you of course
Not many women would have been as square would have taken as littleand worked hardand thought and cared about nothing but making good By Jove its no wonder Im stark crazy about YOU
She was flushed and trembling
Dont she pleaded
Youre beating me down into the dust
I Im She started up
I cant talk tonight
I might say things Id be I cant talk about it
I must She pressed her lips together and fled through the hall to her own room to shut and lock herself in
He stared in amazement
When he heard the distant sound of the turning key he dropped to a chair again and laughed
Certainly women were queer creatures always doing what one didnt expect
Still in the end well a sensible woman knew a good chance to marry and took it
There was no doubt a good deal of pretense in Mildreds delicacy as to money mattersbut a devilish creditable sort of pretense
He liked the ladylike nice pretenses of women of the right sort liked them when they fooled him liked them when they only half fooled him
Presently he knocked on the door of the little library opened it when permission came in Cyrillas voice
She was reading the evening paperhe did not see the glasses she hastily thrust into a drawer
In that soft light she looked a scant thirty handsome but for his taste too intellectual of type to be attractiveexcept as a friend
Well said he as he lit a cigarette and dropped the match into the big copper ashbowl Ill bet you cant guess what Ive been up to
Making love to Miss Stevens replied she
And very foolish it is of you
Shes got a steady head in that way
Youre mighty right said he heartily
And I admire her for that more than for anything else
Id trust her anywhere
Youre paying yourself a high compliment laughed Cyrilla
Hows that
inquired he
Youre too subtle for me
Im a bit slow
Mrs Brindley decided against explaining
It was not wise to risk raising an unjust doubt in the mind of a man who fancied that a woman who resisted him would be adamant to every other man
Then Ive got to guess again
said she
Ive been asking her to marry me said Stanley who could contain it no longer
Mrs B was released from me today by the court in Providence
But SHES not free said Cyrilla a little severely
Stanley looked confused finally said Yes she is
Its a queer story
Dont say anything
I cant explain
I know I can trust you to keep a close mouth
Minding my own business is my one supreme talent said Cyrilla
She hasnt accepted mein so many words pursued Baird but Ive hopes that itll come out all right
Naturally commented Cyrilla dryly
I know Im notnot objectionable to her
And how I do love her
He settled himself at his ease
I cant believe its really me
I never thought Id marryjust for love
Did you
Youre very selfindulgent said Cyrilla
You mean Im marrying her because I cant get her any other way
Theres where youre wrong Mrs Brindley
Im marrying her because I dont want her any other way
Thats why I know its love
I didnt think I was capable of it
Of course Ive been rather strong after the ladies all my life
You know how it is with men
I do said Mrs Brindley
No you dont either retorted he
Youre one of those cold standmeoff women who cant comprehend the nature of man
As you please said she
In her eyes there was a gleam that more than suggested a possibility of some mansome man she might fancyseeing an amazingly different Cyrilla Brindley
I may say I was daft about pretty women continued Baird
I never read an item about a pretty woman in the papers or saw a picture of a pretty woman that I didnt wish I knew herwell
Can you imagine that
laughed he
Commonplace said Cyrilla
All men are so
Thats why the papers always describe the woman as pretty and why the pictures are published
Really
Yes I suppose so
Baird looked chagrined
Anyhow here I am all for one woman
And why
I cant explain it to myself
Shes pretty lovely entrancing sometimes
She has charm grace sweetness
She dresses well and carries herself with a kind of sweet haughtiness
She looks as if she knew a lotand nothing bad
Do you know I cant imagine her having been married to that beast
Ive tried to imagine it
I simply cant
I shouldnt try if I were you said Mrs Brindley
But I was talking about why I love her
Does this bore you
A little laughed Cyrilla
Id rather hear some man talking about MY charms
But go on
You are amusing in a way
Ill wager I am
You never thought Id be caught
I believed I was immunevaccinated against it
I thought I knew all the tricks and turns of the sex
Yet here I am
What do you think caught you
Thats the mystery
Its simply that I cant do without her
Everything she looks and says and does interests me more than anything else in the world
And when Im not with her Im wishing I were and wondering how shes looking or what shes saying or doing
You dont think shell refuse me
This last with real anxiety
I havent an idea replied Mrs Brindley
Shes peculiar
In some moods she would
In others she couldnt
And Ive never been able to settle to my satisfaction which kind of mood was the real Mary Stevens
She IS queer isnt she
said Stanley thoughtfully
But Ive told her shed be free to go on with the career
Fact is I want her to do it
Mrs Brindleys eyes twinkled
You think it would justify you to your set in marrying her if she made a great hit
Stanley blushed ingenuously
Ill not deny that has something to do with it he admitted
And why not
Why not indeed
said she
But after she had made the hit youd want her to quit the stage and take her place in society
Isnt that so
You ARE a keen one exclaimed he admiringly
But I didnt say that to her
And you wont will you
Its hardly necessary to ask that said Mrs Brindley
Now suppose You dont mind my talking about this
What I want replied he
I cant talk or think anything but her
Now suppose she shouldnt make a hit
Suppose she should failshould not develop reliable voice enough
Stanley looked frightened
But she cant fail he cried with overenergy
Theres no question about her voice
I understand Mrs Brindley hastened to say
I was simply making conversation with her as the subject
Oh I see
Stanley settled back
Suppose she should prove not to be a great artist what then
persisted Cyrilla who was deeply interested in the intricate obscure problem of what people really thought as distinguished from what they professed and also from what they imagined they thought
The fact that shes a great artistthats part of her said Baird
If she werent a great singer she wouldnt be shedont you see
Yes I see said Mrs Brindley with an ironic sadness which she indulged openly because there was no danger of his understanding
I dont exactly love her because she amounts to a lotor is sure to pursued he vaguely dissatisfied with himself
Its just as she doesnt care for me because Ive got the means to take care of her right yet thats part of meand shed not be able to marry me if I hadnt
Dont you see
Yes I see said Mrs Brindley with more irony and less sadness
Theres always SOME reason beside love
Id say theres always some reason FOR love said Baird and he felt that he had said something brilliant as is the habit of people of sluggish mentality when they say a thing they do not themselves understand
You dont doubt that I love her
he went on
Why should I ask her to marry me if I didnt
I suppose that settles it said Cyrilla
Of course it does declared he
For an hour he sat there talking on most of it a pretty dull kind of drivel
Mrs Brindley listened patiently because she liked him and because she had nothing else to do until bedtime
At last he rose with a long sigh and said I guess I might as well be going
Shell not come in tonight again said Cyrilla slyly
He laughed
You are a good one
Ill own up Ive been staying on partly in the hope that shed come back
But its been a great joy to talk to you about her
I know you love her too
Yes Im extremely fond of her said she
Ive not known many womenmany people without petty mean tricks
Shes one
Isnt she though
exclaimed he
I dont mean shes perfect said Mrs Brindley
I dont even mean that shes as angelic as you think her
Id not like her if she were
But shes a superior kind of human
She was tired of him now and got him out speedily
As she closed the front door upon him Mildreds door down the hall opened
Her head appeared an inquiring look upon her face
Mrs Brindley nodded
Mil dred her hair done close to her head a dressingrobe over her nightgown and her bare feet in little slippers came down the hall
She coiled herself up in a big chair in the library and lit a cigarette
She looked like a handsome young boy
He told you
she said to Mrs Brindley
Yes replied Cyrilla
Silence
In all their intimate acquaintance there had never been an approach to the confidential on either side
It was Cyrillas notion that confidences were a mistake and that the more closely people were thrown together the more resolutely they ought to keep certain barriers between them
She and Mildred got on too admirably liked each other too well for there to be any trifling with their relationsand overintimacy inevitably led to trifling
Mildred had restrained herself because Mrs Brindley had compelled it by rigid example
Often she had longed to talk things over to ask advice but she had never ventured further than generalities and Mrs Brindley had never proffered advice had never accepted opportunities to give it except in the vaguest way
She had taught Mildred a great deal but always by example by doing never by saying what ought or ought not to be done
Thus such development of Mildreds character as there had been was natural and permanent
He has put me in a peculiar position said Mildred
Or rather I have let myself drift into a peculiar position
For I think youre right in saying that oneself is always to blame
Wont you let me talk about it to you please
I know you hate confidences
But Ive got toto talk
Id like you to advise me if you can
But even if you dont itll do me good to say things aloud
Often one sees more clearly was Cyrillas reply noncommittal yet not discouraging
Im free to marry him Mildred went on
That is Im not married
Id rather not explain Dont said Mrs Brindley
Its unnecessary
You know that its Stanley who has been lending me the money to live on while I study
Well from the beginning Ive been afraid Id find myself in a difficult position
Naturally said Mrs Brindley as she paused
But Ive always expected it to come in another waynot about marriage but I understand said Mrs Brindley
You feared youd be called on to pay in the way women usually pay debts to men
Mildred nodded
But this is worse than I expected much worse
I hadnt thought of that said Cyrilla
Yes youre right
If he had hinted the other thing you could have pretended not to understand
If he had suggested it you could have made him feel cheap and mean
I did said Mildred
He has beenreally wonderfulbetter than almost any man would have been more considerate than I deserved
And I took advantage of it
A woman has to said Cyrilla
The fight between men and women is so unequal
I took advantage of him repeated Mildred
And he apologized and II went on taking the money
I didnt know what else to do
Isnt that dreadful
Nothing to be proud of said Cyrilla
But a very usual transaction
And then pursued Mildred I discovered that Ithat Id not be able to make a career
But still I kept on though Ive been trying to force myself to to show some pride and selfrespect
I discovered it only a short time ago and it wasnt really until today that I was absolutely sure
You ARE sure
Theres hardly a doubt replied Mildred
But never mind that now
Ive got to make a living at something and while Im learning whatever it is Ive got to have money to live on
And I can get it only from him
Now he asks me to marry him
He wouldnt ask me if he didnt think I was going to be a great singer
He doesnt know it but I do
Mrs Brindley smiled sweetly
And he thinks that I love him also
If I accept him it will be under doubly false pretenses
If I refuse him Ive got to stop taking the money
A long silence then Mrs Brindley said Women the good ones toooften feel that theyve a right to treat men as men treat them
I think almost any woman would feel justified in putting off the crisis
You mean I might tell him Id give him my answer when I was independent and had paid back
Cyrilla nodded
Mildred relit her cigarette which she had let go out
I had thought of that said she
ButI doubt if hed tolerate it
Alsoshe laughed with the peculiar intonation that accompanies the lifting of the veil over a deeply and carefully hidden corner of ones secret selfI am afraid
If I dont marry him in a few weeks or months at most hell probably find out that I shall never be a great singer and then Id not be able to marry him if I wished to
He IS a temptation said Cyrilla
That is his money isand he personally is very nice
I married a man I didnt care for pursued Mildred
I dont want ever to do that again
It is even in the best circumstancesnot agreeable not as simple as it looks to the inexperienced girls who are always doing it
Still a woman can endure that sort of thing said Mrs Brindley unless she happens to be in love with another man
She was observing the unconscious Mildred narrowly a state of inward tension and excitement hinted in her face but not in her voice
Thats just it
said Mildred her face carefully averted
II happen to be in love with another man
A spasm of pain crossed Cyrillas face
A man who cares nothing about meand never will
Hes just a friendso much the friend that he couldnt possibly think of me asas a woman needing him and wanting himher eyes were on fire now and a soft glow had come into her cheeksand never daring to show it because if I did he would fly and never let me see him again
Cyrilla Brindleys face was tragic as she looked at the beautiful girl so gracefully adjusted to the big chair
She sighed covertly
You are lovely she said and youngabove all young
This man is peculiar replied Mildred forlornly
Anyhow he doesnt want ME
He knows me for the futile weak worthless creature I am
He saw through my bluff even before I saw through it myself
If it werent for him I could go aheaddo the sensible thingdo as women usually do
But She came to a full stop
Love is a womans sense of honor said Cyrilla softly
Were merciless and unscrupulousanything everythingwhere we dont love
But where we do love well go farther for honor than the most honorable man
Thats why were both worse and better than menand seem to be so contradictory and puzzling
Id do anything for him said Mildred
She smiled drearily
And he wants nothing
She had nothing more to say
She had talked herself out about Stanley and her mind was now filled with thoughts that could not be spoken
As she rose to go to bed she looked appealingly at Cyrilla
Then with a sudden and shy rush she flung her arms round her and kissed her
Thank youso much she said
Youve done me a world of good
Saying it all out loud before YOU has made me see
I know my own mind now
She did not note the pathetic tenderness of Cyrillas face as she said Good night Mildred
But she did note the use of her first nameand her own right first namefor the first time since they had known each other
She embraced and kissed her again
Good night Cyrilla she said gratefully
As she entered Jenningss studio the next day he looked at her and when Jennings looked he sawas must anyone who lives well by playing upon human nature
He did not like her expression
She did not habitually smile her lightheartedness her optimism did not show themselves in that inane way
But this seriousness of hers was of a new kind of the kind that bespeaks sobriety and saneness of soul
And that kind of seriousness the deep inward gravity of a person whose days of trifling with themselves and with the facts of life and of being trifled with are overwould have impressed Jennings equally had she come in laughing had her every word been a jest
No I didnt come for a lessonat least not the usual kind said she
He was not one to yield without a struggle
Also he wished to feel his way to the meaning of this new mood
He put her music on the rack
Well begin where we This halfhour of your time is mine is it not
said she quietly
Lets not waste any of it
Yesterday you told me that I could not hope to make a career because my voice is unreliable
Why is it unreliable
Because you have a delicate throat replied he yielding at once where he instinctively knew he could not win
Then why can I sing so well sometimes
Because your throat is in good condition some days in perfect condition
Its the colds thenand the slight attacks of colds
Certainly
If I did not catch coldsif I kept perfectly well could I rely on my voice
But thats impossible said he
Why
Youre not strong enough
Then I havent the physical strength for a career
Thatand also you are lacking in muscular development
But after several years of lessons If I developed my musclesif I became strong Most of the great singers come from the lower classesfrom people who do manual labor
They did manual labor in their youth
You girls of the better class have to overcome that handicap
But so many of the great singers are fat
Yes and under that fat youll find great ropes of musclelike a blacksmith
What Keith meant she said
I wonder Why do I catch cold so easily
Why do I almost always have a slight catch in the throat
Have you noticed that I nearly always have to clear my throat just a little
Her expression held him
He hesitated tried to evade gave it up
Until that passes you can never hope to be a thoroughly reliable singer said he
That is I cant hope to make a career
His silence was assent
But I have the voice
You have the voice
An unusual voice
Yes but not so unusual as might be thought
As a matter of fact there are thousands of fine voices
The trouble is in reliability
Only a few are reliable
She nodded slowly and thoughtfully
I begin to understand what Mr Keith meant she said
I begin to see what I have to do and howhow impossible it is
By no means declared Jennings
If I did not think otherwise Id not be giving my time to you
She looked at him gravely
His eyes shifted then returned defiantly aggressively
She said You cant help me to what I want
So this is my last lessonfor the present
I may come back some daywhen I am ready for what you have to give
You are going to give up
Oh nooh dear me no replied she
I realize that youre laughing in your sleeve as I say so because you think Ill never get anywhere
But youand Mr Keithmay be mistaken
She drew from her muff a piece of musicthe Batti Batti from Don Giovanni
If you please said she well spend the rest of my time in going over this
I want to be able to sing it as well as possible
He looked searchingly at her
If you wish said he
But I doubt if youll be able to sing at all
On the contrary my colds entirely gone replied she
I had an exciting evening I doctored myself before I went to bed and three or four times in the night
I found this morning that I could sing
And it was so
Never had she sung better
Like a true artist
he declared with an enthusiasm that had a foundation of sincerity
You know Miss Stevens you came very near to having that rarest of all gifts a naturally placed voice
If you hadnt had singing teachers as a girl to make you selfconscious and to teach you wrong youd have been a wonder
I may get it back said Mildred
That never happens replied he
But I can almost do it
He coached her for half an hour straight ahead sending the next pupil into the adjoining rooman unprecedented transgression of routine
He showed her for the first time what a teacher he could be when he wished
There was an astonishing difference between her first singing of the song and her sixth and lastfor they went through it carefully five times
She thanked him and then put out her hand saying This is a long goodby
Tomorrow replied he ignoring her hand
No
My money is all gone
Besides I have no time for amateur trifling
Your lessons are paid for until the end of the month
This is only the nineteenth
Then you are so much in
Again she put out her hand
He took it
You owe me an explanation
She smiled mockingly
As a friend of mine says dont ask questions to which you already know the answer
And she departed the smile still on her charming face but the new seriousness beneath it
As she had anticipated she found Stanley Baird waiting for her in the drawingroom of the apartment
Being by habit much interested in his own emotions and not at all in the emotions of others he saw only the healthful radiance the sharp October air had put into her cheeks and eyes
Certainly to look at Mildred Gower was to get no impression of lack of health and strength
Her glance wavered a little at sight of him then the expression of firmness came back
You look like that picture you gave me a long time ago said he
Do you remember it
She did not
It has adifferent expression he went on
I dont think Id have noticed it but for Keith
I happened to show it to him one day and he stared at it in that way he hasyou know
Yes I know said Mildred
She was seeing those uncanny brilliant penetrating eyes in such startling contrast to the calm lifeless coloring and classic chiseling of features
And after a while he said So THATS Miss Stevens
And I asked him what he meant and he took one of your later photos and put the two side by side
To my notion the later was a lot the more attractive for the face was rounder and softer and didnt have a certain kind ofwell hardness as if you had a will and could ride rough shod
Not that you look so frightfully unattractive
I remember the picture interrupted Mildred
It was taken when I was twentyjust after an illness
The face WAS thin said Stanley
Keith called it a give away
 Id like to see it said Mildred
Ill try to find it
But Im afraid I cant
I havent seen it since I showed it to Keith and when I hunted for it the other day it didnt turn up
Ive changed valets several times in the last six months But Mildred had ceased listening
Keith had seen the picture had called it a give away had been interested in itand the picture had disappeared
She laughed at her own folly yet she was glad Stanley had given her this chance to make up a silly daydream
She waited until he had exhausted himself on the subject of valets their drunkenness their thievish habits their incompetence then she said I took my last lesson from Jennings today
Whats the matter
Do you want to change
You didnt say anything about it
Isnt he good
Good enough
But Ive discovered that my voice isnt reliable and unless one has a reliable voice theres no chance for a grandopera careeror for comic opera either
Stanley was straightway all agitation and protest
Who put that notion in your head
Theres nothing in it Mildred
Jennings is crazy about your voice and he knows
Jennings is after the money replied Mildred
What Im saying is the truth
Stanley our beautiful dream of a career has winked out
His expression was most revealing
And she went on Im not going to take any more of your moneyand of course Ill pay back what Ive borrowed when I canshe smiledwhich may not be very soon
Whats all this about anyhow
demanded he
I dont see any sign of it in your face
You wouldnt take it so coolly if it were so
I dont understand why Im not wringing my hands and weeping replied she
Every few minutes I tell myself that I ought to be
But I stay quite calm
I suppose Imsort of stupefied
Do you really mean that youve given up
cried he
Its no use to waste the money Stanley
Ive got the voice and thats what deceived us all
But theres nothing BEHIND the voice
With a great singer the greatness is in whats behind the voice not in the voice itself
I dont believe a word of it cried he violently
Youve been discouraged by a little cold
Everybody has colds
Why in this climate the colds are always getting the Metropolitan singers down
But theyve got strong throats and my throats delicate
You must go to a better climate
You ought to be abroad anyhow
That was part of my planfor us to go abroad He stopped in confusion reddened went bravely onand you to study there and make your debut
Mildred shook her head
Thats all over said she
Ive got to change my plans entirely
Youre a little depressed thats all
For a minute you almost convinced me
What a turn you did give me
I forgot how your voice sounded the last time I heard it
No youd not be so calm if you didnt know everything was all right
Her eyes lit up with sly humor
Perhaps Im calm because I feel that my futures secure as your wife
What more could a woman ask
He forced an uncomfortable laugh
Of course of course he said with a painful effort to be easy and jocose
I knew youd marry me even if I couldnt sing a note
I knew your belief in my career had nothing to do with it
He hesitated blurted out the truth
Speaking seriously that isnt quite so said he
Ive got my heart set on your making a great tearand I know youll do it
And if you knew I wouldnt youd not want to marry me
I dont say that protested he
How can I say how Id feel if you were different
She nodded
Thats sensible and its candid she said
She laid her hand impulsively on his arm
I DO like you Stanley
You have got such a lot of good qualities
Dont worry
Im not going to insist on your marrying me
You dont have to do that Mildred said he
Im staring raving crazy about you though Im a damn fool to let you know it
Yes it is foolish said she
If youd kept me worrying Still I guess not
But it doesnt matter
You can protest and urge all you please quite safely
Im not going to marry you
Now lets talk business
Lets talk marriage said he
I want this thing settled
You know you intend to marry me Mildred
Why not say so
Why keep me gasping on the hook
They heard the front door open and the rustling of skirts down the hall
Mildred called Mrs Brindley
Cyrilla
An instant and Cyrilla appeared in the doorway
When she and Baird had shaken hands Mildred said Cyrilla I want you to tell the exact honest truth
Is there any hope for a woman with a delicate throat to make a grandopera career
Cyrilla paled looked pleadingly at Mildred
Tell him commanded Mildred
Very little said Mrs Brindley
But Dont try to soften it interrupted Mildred
The truth the plain truth
Youve no right to draw me into this cried Cyrilla indignantly and she started to leave the room
I want him to know said Mildred
And he wants to know
I refuse to be drawn into it Cyrilla said and disappeared
But Mildred saw that Stanley had been shaken
She proceeded to explain to him at length what a singers career meantthe hardships the drafts on health and strength the absolute necessity of being reliable of singing true of not disappointing audienceswhat a delicate throat meanthow delicate her throat was how deficient she was in the kind of physical strength neededmuscular power with endurance back of it
When she finished he understood
Id always thought of it as an art he said ruefully
Why its mostly health and muscles and things that have nothing to do with music
He was dazed and offended by this uncovering of the mechanism of the artby the discovery of the coarse and painful toil the grossly physical basis of what had seemed to him all idealism
He had been full of the delusions of spontaneity and inspiration like all laymen and all artists too except those of the higher ranksthose who have fought their way up to the heights and so have learned that one does not achieve them by being caught up to them gloriously in a fiery cloud but by doggedly and dirtily and sweatily toiling over every inch of the cruel climb
He sat silent when she had finished
She waited then said Now you see
I release you and Ill take no more money to waste
He looked at her with dumb misery that smote her heart
Then his expression changedto the shining hungry eyes the swollen veins the reddened countenance the watering lips of desire
He seized her in his arms and in a voice trembling with passion he cried You must marry me anyhow
Ive GOT to have you Mildred
If she had loved him his expression his impassioned voice would have thrilled her
But she did not love him
It took all her liking for him and the memory of all she owed himthat unpaid debtto enable her to push him away gently and to say without any show of the repulsion she felt Stanley you mustnt do that
And its useless to talk of marriage
Youre generous so you are taking pity on me
But believe me Ill get along somehow
Pity
I tell you I love you he cried catching desperately at her hands and holding them in a grip she could not break
Youve no right to treat me like this
It was one of those veiled and stealthy reminders of obligation habitually indulged in by delicate people seeking repayment of the debt but shunning the coarseness of direct demand
Mildred saw her opportunity
Said she quietly You mean you want me to give myself to you in payment or part payment for the money youve loaned me
He released her hands and sprang up
He had meant just that but he had not had the courage or the meanness or both to admit boldly his own secret wish
She had calculated on thishad calculated well
Mildred
he cried in a shocked voice
YOU so lacking in delicacy as to say such a thing
If you didnt mean that Stanley what DID you mean
I was appealing to our friendshipourour love for each other
Then you should have waited until I was free
Good God
he cried dont you see thats hopeless
Mildred be sensiblebe merciful
I shall never marry a man when he could justly suspect I did it to live off him
What an idea
Its a mans place to support a woman
I was speaking only of myself
I cant do it
And its absurd for you and me to be talking about love and marriage when anyone can see Id be marrying you only because I was afraid to face poverty and a struggle
Her manner calmed him somewhat
Of course its obvious that youve got to have money said he and that the only way you can get it is by marriage
But theres something else too and in my opinion its the principal thingwe care for each other
Why not be sensible Mildred
Why not thank God that as long as you have to marry you can marry someone you care for
Could you feel that I cared for you if I married you now
inquired she
Why not
Im not so entirely lacking in self esteem
I feel that I must count for something
Mildred sat silently wondering at this phenomenon so astounding yet a commonplace of masculine egotism
She had no conception of this vanity which causes the man at whom the street woman smiles to feel flattered though he knows full well what she is and her dire ne cessity
She could not doubt that he was speaking the truth yet she could not believe that conceit could so befog common sense in a man who for all his slowness and shallowness was more than ordinarily shrewd
Even if I thought I loved you said she I couldnt be sure in these circumstances that I wasnt after your money
Dont worry about that replied he
I understand you better than you understand yourself
Lets stop talking about it said she impatiently
I want to explain to you the business side of this
She took her purse from the table
Here are the papers
She handed him a check and a note
I made them out at the bank this morning
The note is for what I owe youand draws interest at four per cent
The check is for all the money I have left except about four hundred dollars
Ive some bills I must pay and also I didnt dare quite strip myself
The note may not be worth the paper its written on but I hope Before she could prevent him he took the two papers and holding them out of her reach tore them to bits
Her eyes gleamed angrily
I see you despise me as much as Ive invited
But Ill make them out again and mail them to you
Youre a silly child said he gruffly
Were going to be married
She eyed him with amused exasperation
Its too absurd
she cried
And if I yielded youd be trying to get out of it
She hesitated whether to tell him frankly just how she felt toward him
She decided against it not through considerationfor a woman feels no consideration for a man she does not love if he has irritated herbut through being ashamed to say harsh things to one whom she owed so much
Its useless for you to pretend and to plead she went on
I shall not yield
Youll have to wait until Im free and independent
Youll marry me then
No replied she laughing
But Ill be able to refuse you in such a way that youll believe
But youve got to marry Mildred and right away
A suspicion entered his mind and instantly gleamed in his eyes
Are you in love with someone else
She smiled mockingly
It looks as if you were he went on arguing with himself aloud
For if you werent youd marry me even though you didnt like me
A woman in your fix simply couldnt keep herself from it
Is THAT why youre so calm
Im not marrying anybody said she
Then what are you going to do
Youll see
Once more the passionate side of his nature showed not merely grotesque unattractive repellent as in the mood of longing but hideous
Among men Stanley Baird passed for a man of rather arrogant and violent temper but that man who had seen him at his most violent would have been amazed
The temper men show toward men bears small resemblance either in kind or in degree to the temper of jealous passion they show toward the woman who baffles them or arouses their suspicions and no man would recognize his most intimate man friendor himselfwhen in that paroxysm
Mildred had seen this mood gleaming at her through a mask in General Siddall
It had made her sick with fear and repulsion
In Stanley Baird it first astounded her then filled her with hate
Stanley
she gasped
WHO is it
he ground out between his teeth
And he seized her savagely
If you dont release me at once said she calmly I shall call Mrs Brindley and have you put out of the house
No matter if I do owe you all that money
Stop
he cried releasing her
Youre very clever arent youturning that against me and making me powerless
But for that would you dare presume to touch me to question me
said she
He lowered his gaze stood panting with the effort to subdue his fury
She went back to her own room
A few hours later came a letter of apology from him
She answered it friendlily said she would let him know when she could see him again and enclosed a note and a check
VIII MILDRED went to bed that night proud of her strength of character
Were there many women was there any other woman she knew or knew about who in her desperate circumstances would have done what she had done
She could have married a man who would have given her wealth and the very best social position
She had refused him
She could have continued to borrow from him the wherewithal to keep her in luxurious comfort while she looked about at her ease for a position that meant independence
She had thrust the temptation from her
All this from purely highminded motives for other motive there could be none
She went to sleep confident that on the morrow she would continue to tread the path of self respect with unfaltering feet
But when morning came her throat was once more slightly offenough to make it wise to postpone the excursion in search of a trial for musical comedy
The excitement or the reaction from excitementit must be the one or the other had resulted in weakness showing itself naturally at her weakest pointthat delicate throat
When life was calm and orderly and her mind was at peace the trouble would pass and she could get a position of some kind
Not the career she had dreamed that was impossible
But she had voice enough for a little part where a living could be made and perhaps she would presently fathom the secret of the cause of her delicate throat and would be able to go farpossibly as far as she had dreamed
The delay of a few days was irritating
She would have preferred to push straight on while her courage was taut
Still the delay had one advantageshe could prepare the details of her plan
So instead of going to the office of the theatrical managerCrossley the most successful producer of light musical pieces of all kindsshe went to call on several of the girls she knew who were more or less in touch with matters theatrical
And she found out just how to proceed toward accomplishing a purpose which ought not to be difficult for one with such a voice as hers and with physical charms peculiarly fitted for stage exhibition
Not until Saturday was her voice at its best again
She naturally decided not to go to the theatrical office on Monday but to wait until she had seen and talked with Keith
One more day did not matter and Keith might be stimulating might even have some useful suggestions to offer
She received him with a manner that was a version and a most charming version of his own tranquil indifference
But his first remark threw her into a panic
Said he Ive only a few minutes
No thanks Ill not sit
You neednt have bothered to come said she coldly
I always keep my engagements
Baird tells me you have given up the arrangement you had with him
Youll probably be moving from here as youll not have the money to stay on
Send me your new address please
He took a paper from his pocket and gave it to her
You will find this usefulif you are in earnest said he
Goodby and good luck
Ill hope to see you in a few weeks
Before she had recovered herself in the least she was standing there alone the paper in her hand her stupefied gaze upon the door through which he had disappeared
All his movements and his speech had been of his customary his invariable deliberateness but she had the impression of whirling and rushing haste
With a long gasping sigh she fell to trembling all over
She sped to her room got its door safely closed just in time
Down she sank upon the bed to give way to an attack of hysterics
We are constantly finding ourselves putting forth the lovely flowers and fruit of the virtues whereof the heroes and heroines of romance are so prolific
Usually nothing occurs to disillusion us about ourselves
But now and then fate in unusually brutal ironic mood forces us to see the real reason why we did this or that virtuous selfsacrificing action or blossomed forth in this or that nobility of character
Mildred was destined now to suffer one of these savage blows of disillusionment about self that thrust us down from the exalted moral heights where we have been preening into humble kinship with the weak and frail human race
She saw why she had refused Stanley why she had stopped borrowing why she had put off going to the theatrical managers why she had delayed moving into quarters within her diminished and rapidly diminishing means
She had been counting on Donald Keith
She had convinced herself that he loved her even as she loved him
He would fling away his cold reserve would burst into raptures over her virtue and her courage would ask her to marry him
Or if he should put off that he would at least undertake the responsibility of getting her started in her career
Well
He had come he had shown that Stanley had told him all or practically all and he had gone without asking a sympathetic question or making an encouraging remark
As indifferent as he seemed
Burnt out cold heartless
She had leaned upon him he had slipped away leaving her to fall painfully and ludicrously to the ground
She had been boasting to herself that she was strong that she would of her own strength establish herself in independence
She had not dreamed that she would be called upon to make good
She raved against Keith against herself against fate
And above the chaos and the wreck within her round and round hither and yon flapped and shied the black thought What SHALL I do
When she sat up and dried her eyes she chanced to see the paper Keith had left with wonder at her having forgotten it and with a throb of hope she opened and began to read his small difficult writing A career means selfdenial
Not occasional intermittent but steady constant daily hourlya purpose that never relaxes
A career as a singer means not only the routine the patient tedious work the cutting out of timewasting people and timewasting pleasures that are necessary to any and all careers
It means in additionfor such a person sacrifices far beyond a character so undisciplined and so corrupted by conventional life as is yours
The basis of a singing career is health and strength
You must have great physical strength to be able to sing operas
You must have perfect health
Diet and exercise
A routine life its routine rigidly adhered to day in and day out month after month year after year
Small and uninteresting and monotonous food nothing to drink and of course no cigarettes
Such is the secret of a reliable voice for you who have a delicate throatwhich is the silly shallow and misleading way of saying a delicate digestion for sore throat always means indigestion never means anything else
To sing the instrument the absolutely material machine must be in perfect order
The rest is easy
Some singers can commit indiscretions of diet and of lack of exercise
But not you because you lack this natural strength
Do not be deceived and misled by their example
Exercise
You must make your body strong powerful
You have not the muscles by nature
You must acquire them
The following routine of diet and exercise made one of the great singers and kept her great for a quarter of a century
If you adopt it without variation you can make a career
If you do not you need not hope for anything but failure and humiliation
Within my knowledge sixtyeight young men and young women have started in on this system
Not one had the character to persist to success
This may suggest why except two who are at the very top all of the great singers are men and women whom nature has made powerful of body and of digestionso powerful that their indiscretions only occasionally make them unreliable
There Mildred stopped and flung the paper aside
She did not care even to glance at the exercises pre scribed or at the diet and the routine of daily work
How dull and uninspired
How grossly material
Stomach
Chewing
Exercising machines
Plodding dreary miles daily rain or shine
What could such things have to do with the free and glorious career of an inspired singer
Keith was laughing at her as he hastened away abandoning her to her fate
She examined herself in the glass to make sure that the ravages of her attack of rage and grief and despair could be effaced within a few hours then she wrote a noteformal yet friendlyto Stanley Baird informing him that she would receive him that evening
He came while Cyrilla and Mildred were having their after dinner coffee and cigarettes
He was a man who took great pains with his clothes and got them where pains was not in vain
That evening he had arrayed himself with unusual care and the result was a fine manly figure of the wellbred NewYorker type
Certainly Stanley had ground for his feeling that he deserved and got liking for himself
The three sat in the library for perhaps half an hour then Mrs Brindley rose to leave the other two alone
Mildred urged her to stayMildred who had been impatient of her presence when Stanley was announced
Urged her to stay in such a tone that Cyrilla could not persist but had to sit down again
As the three talked on and on Mildred continued to picture life with Stanleycontinued the vivid picturing she had begun within ten minutes of Stanleys entering the picturing that had caused her to insist on Cyrillas remaining as chaperon
A young girl can do no such picturing as Mildred could not avoid doing
To the young girl married life its teteatetes its intimacies its routine are all a blank
Any attempt she makes to fill in details goes far astray
But Mildred with Stanley there before her could see her life as it would be
Toward halfpast ten Stanley said shamefaced and pleading Mildred I should like to see you alone for just a minute before I go
Mildred said to Cyrilla No dont move
Well go into the drawingroom
He followed her there and when the sound of Mrs Brindleys step in the hall had died away he began I think I understand you a little now
I shant insult you by returning or destroying that note or the check
I accept your decisionunless you wish to change it
He looked at her with eager appeal
His heart was trembling was sick with apprehension with the sense of weakness of danger and gloom ahead
Why shouldnt I help you at least Mildred
he urged
Whence the courage came she knew not but through her choking throat she forced a positive No
And he went on I meant what I said
I love you
Im wretched without you
I want you to marry me career or no career
Her fears were clamorous but she forced herself to say I cant change
I hopeda littlethat you sent me the note to day because you You didnt
No said Mildred
I want us to be friends
But you must keep away
He bent his head
Then Ill go way off somewhere
I cant bear being here in New York and not seeing you
And when Ive been away a year or so perhaps Ill get control of myself again
Going awayto try to forgetno doubt to succeed in forgetting
Then this was her last chance
Must I go Mildred
Wont you relent
I dont love youand I never can
She was deathly white and trembling
She lifted her eyes to begin a retreat for her courage had quite oozed away
He was looking at her his face distorted with a mingling of the passion of desire and the passion of jealousy
She shrank caught at the back of a chair for support felt suddenly strong and defiant
To be this mans plaything to submit to his moods to his jealousies to his capricesto be his to fumble and caress his to have the fury of his passion wreak itself upon her with no response from her but only repulsion and loathingand the long dreary hours and days and years alone with him listening to his commonplaces often so tedious forced to try to amuse him and to keep him in a good humor because he held the purse strings Please go she said
She was still very young still had years and years of youth unspent
Surely she could find something better than this
Surely life must mean something more than this
At least it was worth a trial
He held out his hand
She gave him her reluctant and cold fingers
He said something what she did not hear for the blood was roaring in her ears as the room swam round
He was gone and the next thing she definitely knew she was at the threshold of Cyrillas room
Cyrilla gave her a tenderly sympathetic glance
She saw herself in a mirror and knew why her face was gray and drawn and her eyes lay dully deep within dark circles
I couldnt do it she said
I sent for him to marry him
But I couldnt
Im glad said Cyrilla
Marriage without love is a last resort
And youre a long way from last resorts
You dont think Im crazy
I think youve won a great victory
Victory
And Mildred laughed dolefully
If this is victory I hope Ill never know defeat
Why did Mildred refuse Stanley Baird and cut herself off from him even after her hopes of Donald Keith died through lack of food real or imaginary
It would be gratifying to offer this as a case of pure courage and high principle untainted of the motives which govern ordinary human actions
But unluckily this is a biography not a romance a history and not a eulogy
And Mildred Gower is a human being even as you and I not a galvanized embodiment of superhuman virtues such as you and I are pretending to be perhaps even to ourselves
The explanation of her strange aberration which will be doubted or secretly condemned by every woman of the sheltered classes who loves her dependence and seeks to disguise it as something sweet and fine and womanlythe explanation of her almost insane act of renunciation of all that a lady holds most dear is simple enough puzzling though she found it
Ignorance which accounts for so much of the squalid failure in human life accounts also for much if not all the most splendid audacious achievement
Very oftenvery very oftenthe impossibilities are achieved by those who in their ignorance advance not boldly but unconcernedly where a wiser man or woman would shrink and retreat
Fortunate indeed is he or she who in a crisis is by chance equipped with neither too little nor too much knowledgewho knows enough to enable him to advance but does not know enough to appreciate how perilous how foolhardy how harsh and cruel advance will be
Mildred was in this instance thus fortunateunfortunate she was presently to think it
She knew enough about loveless marriage to shrink from it
She did not know enough about what poverty moneylessness and friendlessness mean in the actuality to a woman bred as she had been
She imagined she knewand sick at heart her notion of poverty made her
But imagination was only faintest foreshadowing of actuality
If she had known she would have yielded to the temptation that was almost too strong for her
And if she had yieldedwhat then
Not such a repulsive lot as our comfortable classes look at it
Plenty to eat and drink and to wear servants and equipages and fine houses and fine society the envy of her gaping kinda comfortable life for the body a comfortable death for mind and heart slowly and softly suffocated in luxury
Partly through knowledge that strongly affected her character which was on the whole aspiring and sensitive beyond the average to the true and the beautiful partly through ignorance that veiled the future from her none too valorous and hardy heart she did not yield to the temptation
And thus instead of dying she began to live for what is life but growth in experience in strength and knowledge and capability
A baby enters the world screaming with pain
The first sensations of living are agonizing
It is the same with the birth of souls for a soul is not really born until that day when it is offered choice between life and death and chooses life
In Mildred Gowers case this birth was an agony
She awoke the following morning with a dull headache a fainting heart and a throat so sore that she felt a painful catch whenever she tried to swallow
She used the spray she massaged her throat and neck vigorously
In vain it was folly to think of going where she might have to risk a trial of her voice that day
The sun was brilliant and the air sharp without being humid or too cold
She dressed breakfasted went out for a walk
The throat grew worse then better
She returned for luncheon and afterward began to think of packing not that she had chosen a new place but because she wished to have some sort of a sense of action
But her unhappiness drove her out againto the park where the air was fine and she could walk in comparative solitude
What a silly fool I am
thought she
Why did I do this in the worst the hardest possible way
I should have held on to Stanley until I had a position
No Im such a poor creature that I could never have done it in that way
Id simply have kept on bluffing fooling myself putting off and putting of
I had to jump into the water with nobody near to help me or Id never have begun to learn to swim
I havent begun yet
I may never learn to swim
I may drown
Yes I probably shall drown
She wandered aimlessly onaround the upper reservoir where the strong breeze freshened her through and through and made her feel less forlorn in spite of her chicken heart
She crossed the bridge at the lower end and came down toward the East Drive
A taxicab rushed by not so fast however that she failed to recognize Donald Keith and Cyrilla Brindley
They were talking so earnestlyKeith was talking for a wonder and Mrs Brindley listeningthat they did not see her
She went straight home
But as she was afoot the journey took about half an hour
Cyrilla was already there in a negligee looking as if she had not been out of the little library for hours
She was writing a letter
Mildred strolled in and seated herself
Cyrilla went on writing
Mildred watched her impatiently
She wished to talk to be talked to to be consoled and cheered to hear about Donald Keith
Would that letter never be finished
At last it was and Cyrilla took a book and settled herself to reading
There was a vague something in her mannera change an attitude toward Mildredthat disturbed Mildred
Or was that notion of a change merely the offspring of her own somber mood
Seeing that Mrs Brindley would not begin she broke the silence herself
Said she awkwardly Ive decided to move
In fact Ive got to move
Cyrilla laid down the book and regarded her tran quilly
Of course said she
Ive already begun to arrange for someone else
Mildred choked and the tears welled into her eyes
She had not been mistaken Cyrilla had changed toward her
Now that she had no prospects for a brilliant career now that her money was gone Cyrilla had begun toto be human
No doubt in the course of that drive Cyrilla had discovered that Keith had no interest in her either
Mildred beat down her emotion and was soon able to say in a voice as unconcerned as Cyrillas Ill find a place tomorrow or next day and go at once
Ill be sorry to lose you said Mrs Brindley but I agree with you that you cant get settled any too soon
You dont happen to know of any cheap good place
said Mildred
If its cheap I dont think its likely to be good in New York replied Cyrilla
Youll have to put up with inconveniencesand worse
Id offer to help you find a place but I think everything selfreliant one does helps one to learn
Dont you
Yes indeed assented Mildred
The thing was selfevidently true still she began to hate Cyrilla
This coldhearted New York
How she would grind down her heel when she got it on the neck of New York
Friendship love helpfulnesswhat did New York and NewYorkers know of these things
Or Hanging Rock either reflected she
What a cold and lonely world
Have you been to see about a position
inquired Cyrilla
Mildred was thrown into confusion
I cant go for aday or so she stammered
The changeable weather has rather upset my throat
Nothing serious but I want to be at my best
Certainly said Mrs Brindley
Her direct gaze made Mildred uncomfortable
She went on Youre sure its the weather
What else could it be
demanded Mildred with a latent resentment whose interesting origin she did not pause to inquire into
Well salad or sauces or desserts or cafe au lait in the morning or candy or tea said Cyrilla
Or it might be cigarettes or all those thingsand thin stockings and low shoesmightnt it
Never before had she known Cyrilla to say anything meddlesome or cattish
Said Mildred with a faint sneer That sounds like Mr Keiths crankiness
It is replied Cyrilla
I used to think he was a crank on the subject of singing and stomachs and singing and ankles
But Ive been convinced partly by him mostly by what Ive observed
Mildred maintained an icy silence
I see you are resenting what I said observed Cyrilla
Not at all said Mildred
No doubt you meant well
You will please remember that you asked me a question
So she had
But the discovery that she was clearly in the wrong that she had invited the disguised lecture only aggravated her sense of resentment against Mrs Brindley
She spent the rest of the afternoon in sorting and packing her belongingsand in crying
She came upon the paper Donald Keith had left
She read it through carefully thoughtfully read it to the last direction as to exercise with the machine the last arrangement for a daily routine of life the last suggestion as to diet
Fortunately all that isnt necessary said she to herself when she had finished
If it were I could never make a career
Im not stupid enough to be able to lead that kind of life
Why Id not care to make a career at that price
Slaveryplain slavery
When she went in to dinner she saw instantly that Cyrilla too had been crying
Cyrilla did not look old anything but that indeed was not old and would not begin to be for many a year
Still after thirtyfive or forty a woman cannot indulge a good cry without its leaving serious traces that will show hours afterward
At sight of the evidences of Cyrillas grief Mildred straightway forgot her resentment
There must have been some other cause for Cyrillas peculiar conduct
No matter what since it was not hardness of heart
It was a sad even a gloomy dinner
But the two women were once more in perfect sympathy
And afterward Mildred brought the Keith paper and asked Cyrillas opinion
Cyrilla read slowly and without comment
At last she said He got this from his mother Lucia Rivi
Have you read her life
No
Ive heard almost nothing about her except that she was famous
She was more than that said Mrs Brindley
She was great a great personality
She was an almost sickly child and girl
Her first attempts on the stage were humiliating failures
She had no health no endurance nothing but a small voice of rare quality
Cyrilla held up the paper
This tells how she became one of the surest and most powerful dramatic sopranos that ever lived
She must have been a dull person to have been able to lead the kind of life thats described there said Mildred
Only two kinds of persons could do it replied Cyrillaa dull persona plodderand a genius
Middling peopletheyre the kind that fill the world theyre you and I my dearmiddling people have to fuss with the trifles that must be sacrificed if one is to do anything big
You call those trifles your freedom but theyre your slavery
And by sacrificing them the Lucia Rivis buy their freedom
Cyrilla looked at the paper with a heavy sigh
Ah I wish I had seen this when I was your age
Now its too late
Said Mildred Would you seriously advise me to try that
Cyrilla came and sat beside her and put an arm around her
Mildred she said Ive never thrust advice on you
I only dare do it now because you ask me and because I love you
You must try it
Its your one chance
If you do not you will fail
You dont believe me
In a tone that was admission Mildred said I dont know
Keith has given you there the secret of a successful career
Youll never read it in any book or get it from any teacher or from any singer or manager or doctor
You must live like that you must do those things or you will fail even in musical comedy
You would fail even as an actress if you tried that when you found out that the singing was out of the question
Mildred was impressed
Perhaps she would have been more impressed had she not seen Keith and Mrs Brindley in the taxi Keith talking earnestly and Mrs Brindley listening as if to an oracle
Said she Perhaps Ill adopt some of the suggestions
Cyrilla shook her head
Its a route to success
You must go the whole route or not at all
Dont forget that there have been other singers besides Rivi
Not any that I recall who werent naturally powerful in every way
And how many of them break down
Mildred please do put the silly nonsense about nerves and temperament and inspiration and overwork and weather and climateput all that out of your head
Build your temple of a career as high and graceful and delicate as you like but build it on the coarse hard solid rock dear
Mildred tried to laugh lightly
How Mr Keith does hypnotize people
cried she
Mrs Brindleys cheeks burned and her eyes lowered in acute embarrassment
He has a way of being splendidly and sensibly right said she
And the truth is wonderfully convincingonce one sees it
She changed the subject and it did not come upor perhaps come OUT againbefore they went to bed
The next day Mildred began the depressing hopeless search for a place to live that would be clean comfortable and cheap
Those three adjectives describe the ideal lodging but it will be noted that all these are relative
In fact none of the three means exactly the same thing to any two members of the human family
Mildreds notion of cleanlike her notion of comfortableon account of her bringing up implied a large element of luxury
As for the word cheap it really meant nothing at all to her
From one stand point everything seemed cheap from another everything seemed dear that is too dear for a young woman with less than five hundred dollars in the world and no substantial prospect of getting a single dollar more unless by hook and crook both of which means she was resolved not to employ
Never having earned so much as a single penny the idea of anyones giving her anything for what she might be able to do was disturbingly vague and unreal
On the other hand looking about her she saw scores of men and women personally known to her to be dull of conversation and not well mannered or well dressed or well anything who were making livings without overwhelming difficulty
Why not Mildred Gower
In this view the outlook was not discouraging
Ill no doubt go through some discomfort getting myself placed
But somewhere and somehow I shall be placed and how I shall revenge myself on Donald Keith
His fascination for her had not been destroyed by his humiliating lack of belief in her nor by his coldhearted desertion at just the critical moment
But his conduct had given her the incentive of rage of stung vanity or wounded pride if you prefer
She would get him back she would force him to admit she would win him if she couldand that ought not to be difficult when she should be successful
Having won him then What then
Something superb in the way of revenge she would decide what when the hour of triumph came
Meanwhile she must search for lodgings
In her journeyings under the guidance of attractive advertisements and carefully selected agents lists she found herself in front of her first lodgings in New Yorkthe house of Mrs Belloc
She had often thought of the New England schoolteacher arrived by such strange paths at such a strange position in New York
She had started to call on her many times but each time had been turned aside New York makes it more than difficult to find time to do anything that does not have to be done at a definite time and for a definite reason
She was worn out with her futile trampings up and down streets up and down stairs
Up the stone steps she went and rang the bell
Yes Mrs Belloc was in and would be glad to see her if Miss Stevens would wait in the drawingroom a few minutes
She had not seated herself when down the stairs came the fresh pleasantly countrified voice of Mrs Belloc inviting her to ascend
As Mildred started up she saw at the head of the stairs the frank and cheerful face of the lady herself
She was holding together at the neck a thin silk wrapper whose lines strongly suggested that it was the only garment she had on
Why should old friends stand on ceremony
said Mrs Belloc
Come right up
Ive been taking a bath
My masseuse has just gone
Mrs Belloc enclosed her in a delightfully perfumed embrace and they kissed with enthusiasm
I AM glad to see you said Mildred feeling all at once a thrilling sense of athomeness
I didnt realize how glad Id be till I saw you
Itd be a pretty stiff sort that wouldnt feel at home with me observed Mrs Belloc
New York usually stiffens people up
Its had the opposite effect on me
Though I must say I have learned to stiffen with people I dont likeand Ill have to admit that I like fewer and fewer
People dont wear well do they
What IS the matter with them
Why cant they be natural and not make themselves into rubbishy old scrapbags full of fakes and pretenses
Youre looking at my hair
They were in Mrs Bellocs comfortable sittingroom now and she was smoking a cigarette and regarding Mildred with an expression of delight that was most flattering
Said Mildred Your hair does look well
Its thickerisnt it
Think so
said Mrs Belloc
It ought to be with all the time and money Ive spent on it
My how New York does set a woman to repairing and fixing up
Nothing artificial goes here
It mustnt be paint and plumpers and pads but the real teeth
Why Ive had four real teeth set in as if they were rootedand my hips toned down
You may remember what heavy legs I hadpianolegs
Look at em now
Mrs Belloc drew the wrapper to her knee and exposed in a pale blue silk stocking a thin and comely calf
You HAVE been busy
said Mildred
Thats only a little part
I started to tell you about the hair
It was getting graynot in a nice pretty way all over but in spots and streaks
Nothing else makes a woman look so ragged and dingy and old as spotted streaky gray hair
So I had the hairwoman touch it up
She vows it wont make my face hard
Thats the trouble with dyed or touched hair you know
But this is a new process
Its certainly a success said Mildred
And in fact it was and thanks to it and the other improvements Mrs Belloc was an attractive and even a pretty woman years younger than when Mildred saw her
Yes I think Ive improved said Mrs Belloc
Nothing to scream aboutbut worth while
Thats what were alive forto improveisnt it
Ive no patience with people who slide back or dont get on people who get less and less as they grow older
The trouble with them is theyre vain satisfied with themselves as they are and lazy
Most women are too lazy to live
Theyll only fix up to catch a man
Mildred had grown sober and thoughtful
To catch a man continued Mrs Belloc
And not much even for that
Ill warrant YOURE getting on
Tell me about it
Tell me about yourself first said Mildred
WHY all this excitement about improving
And she smiled significantly
No youll have to guess again said Mrs Belloc
Not a man
You remember I used to be crazy about gay life in New Yorkgoing out and men theaters and lobsterpalaceseverything I didnt get in my home town everything the city means to the jays
Well Ive gotten over all that
Im improving mind and body just to keep myself interested in life to keep myself young and cheerful
Im interested in myself in my house and in womans suffrage
Not that the women are fit to vote
They arent any more than the men
But what MAKES people
Why responsibility
That old scamp I marriedhes dead
And Ive got the money and everythings very comfortable with me
Just think I didnt have any luck till I was an old maid far gone
Im not telling my age
All my life it had rained bad luckpitchforks tines down
And why
Yes why
said Mildred
She did not understand how it was but Mrs Belloc seemed to be saying the exact things she needed to hear
Ill tell you why
Because I didnt work
Drudging along isnt work any more than dawdling along
Work means purpose means head
And my luck began just as anybodys doeswhen I rose up and got busy
You may say it wasnt very creditable the way I began but it was the best I could do
I know it isnt good morals but Im willing to bet that many a man has laid the foundations of a big fine career by doing something that wasnt at all nice or right
He had to do it to get through
If he hadnt done it hed never have got through
Anyhow whether thats so or not everyones got to make a fight to break into the part of the world where livings really worth living
But I neednt tell YOU that
Youre doing it
No Im not replied Mildred
Im ashamed to say so but Im not
Ive been bluffingand wasting time
Thats bad thats bad said Mrs Belloc
Especially as youve got it in you to get there
Whats been the trouble
The wrong kind of associations
Partly said Mildred
Mrs Belloc watching her interestedly suddenly lighted up
Why not come back here to live
said she
Now please dont refuse till I explain
You remember what kind of people I had here
Mildred smiled
Ratherunconventional
Thats polite
Well Ive cleared em out
Not that I minded their unconventionality I liked it
It was so different from the straightjackets and the hypocrisy Id been living among and hating
But I soon found out thatwell Miss Stevens the average human being ought to be pretty conventional in his morals of a certain kind
If heor SHEisnt they begin to get unconventional in every wayabout paying their bills for instance and about drinking
I got sick and tired of those people
So I put em all outmade a sweep
And now Ive become quite as respectable as I care to beor as is necessary
The couples in the house are married and theyre nice people of good families
It was Mrs Dyckmanshes got the whole sec ond floor front she and her husband and the daughter it was Mrs Dyckman who interested me in the suffrage movement
You must hear her speak
And the daughter does well at it tooand keeps a fashionable millineryshopand shes only twentyfour
Then theres Nora Blond
The actress
The actress
Shes the quietest hardestworking person here
Shes got the whole first floor front
Nobody ever comes to see her except on Sunday afternoon
She leads the queerest life
Tell me about that said Mildred
I dont know much about it confessed Mrs Belloc
Shes regular as a clockdoes everything on time and at the same time
Two meals a dayone of them a dry little breakfast she gets herself
Walks fencing athletics study
What slavery
Shes the happiest person I ever saw retorted Mrs Belloc
Why shes got her work her career
You dont look at it right Miss Stevens
You dont look happy
Whats the matter
Isnt it because you havent been working rightbecause youve been doing these alleged pleasant things that leave a bad taste in your mouth and weaken you
Ill bet if you had been working hard youd not be unhappy now
Better come here to live
Will you let me tell you about myself
Go right ahead
May I ask questions where I want to know more
I do hate to get things halfway
Mildred freely gave her leave then proceeded to tell her whole story omitting nothing that was essential to an understanding
In conclusion she said Id like to come
You see Ive very little money
When its gone Ill go unless I make some more
Yes you must come
That Mrs Brindley seems to be a nice woman a mighty nice woman
But her house and the people that come therethey arent the right sort for a girl thats making a start
I can give you a room on the top floorin front
The young lady next to you is a clerk in an architects office and a fine girl she is
How much does she pay
said Mildred
Your room wont be quite as nice as hers
I put you at the top because you can sing up there part of the mornings and part of the afternoons without disturbing anybody
I dont have a general table any more
You can take your meals in your room or at the restaurant in the apartmenthouse next door
Its good and quite reasonable
How much for the room
persisted Mildred laughing
Seven dollars a week and the use of the bath
Mildred finally wrung from her that the right price was twelve dollars a week and insisted on paying that until my money gets low
Dont worry about that said Mrs Belloc
You mustnt weaken me cried Mildred
You mustnt encourage me to be a coward and to shirk
Thats why Im coming here
I understand said Mrs Belloc
Ive got the New England streak of hardness in me though I believe that masseuse has almost ironed it out of my face
Do I look like a New England schoolmarm
Mildred could truthfully answer that there wasnt a trace of it
When she returned to Mrs Brindleysalready she had ceased to think of it as homeshe announced her new plans
Mrs Brindley said nothing but Mildred understood the quick tightening of the lines round her mouth and the shifting of the eyes
She hastened to explain that Mrs Belloc was no longer the sort of woman or the sort of landlady she had been a few months before
Mrs Brindley of the older New York could neither understand nor believe in the people of the new and real New York whom it molds for better or for worse so rapidlyand even remolds again and again
But Mildred was able to satisfy her that the house was at least not suspicious
It doesnt matter where youre going said Mrs Brindley
Its that you are going
I cant bear giving you up
I had hoped that our lives would flow on and on together
She was with difficulty controlling her emotions
Its these separations that age one that take ones life
I almost wish I hadnt met you
Mildred was moved herself
Not so much as Mrs Brindley because she had the necessities of her career gripping her and claiming the strongest feelings there were in her
Also she was much the younger not merely in years but in experience
And separations have no real poignancy in them for youth Yes I know you love me said Cyrilla but love doesnt mean to you what it means to me
Im in that middle period of life where everything has its fullest meaning
In youth were easily consoled and distracted because life seems so full of possibilities and we cant believe friendship and love are rare and still more rarely worth while
In old age when the arteries harden and the blood flows slow and cold we become indifferent
But between thirtyfive and fiftyfive how the heart can ache
She smiled with trembling lips
And how it can rejoice
she cried bravely
I must not forget to mention that
Ah my dear you must learn to live intensely
If I had had your chance
Ridiculous
laughed Mildred
You talk like an old woman
And I never think of you as older than myself
I AM an old woman said Cyrilla
And with a tightening at the heart Mildred saw deep in the depths of her eyes the look of old age
Ive found that Im too old for lovefor manandwoman loveand that means Im an old woman
Mildred felt that there was only a thin barrier of reserve between her and some sad secret of this strange shy loving womansa barrier so thin that she could almost hear the stifled moan of a broken heart
But the barrier remained it would have been impossible for Cyrilla Brindley to talk frankly about herself
When Mildred came out of her room the next morning Cyrilla had gone leaving a note I cant bear goodbys
Besides well see each other very soon
Forgive me for shrinking but really I cant
Before night Mildred was settled in the new place and the new room with no sense of strangeness
She was reproaching herself for hardness for not caring about Cyrilla the best and truest friend she had ever had
But the truth lay in quite a different direction
The house the surroundings where she had lived luxuriously dreaming her foolish and fatuous dreams was not the place for such a struggle as was now upon her
And for that struggle she preferred to sensitive sober refined impractical Cyrilla Brindley the companionship and the sympathy the practical sympathy of Agnes Belloc
No one need be ashamed or nervous before Agnes Belloc about being poor or unsuccessful or having to resort to shabby makeshifts or having to endure coarse contacts
Cyrilla represented refinement appreciation of the finished workluxurious and sterile appreciation and enjoyment
Agnes represented the workshopwhere all the doers of all that is done live and work
Mildred was descending from the heights where live those who have graduated from the lot of the human race and have lost all that superficial or casual resemblance to that race
She was going down to live with the race to share in its lot
She was glad Agnes Belloc was to be there
Generalizing about such a haphazard conglomerate as human nature is highly unsatisfactory but it may be cautiously ventured that in New England as in old England there is a curiously contradictory way of dealing with conventionality
Nowhere is conventionality more in reverence yet when a NewEnglander man or woman happens to elect to break with it nowhere is the break so utter and so defiant
If Agnes Belloc cut loose from the conventions that had bound her from childhood to well into middle life had remained at home no doubt she would have spent a large part of her nights in thinking out ways of employing her days in outraging the conventionalities before her horrified and infuriated neighbors
But of what use in New York to cuff and spit upon deities revered by only an insignificant classand only officially revered by that class
Agnes had soon seen that there was no amusement or interest whatever in an enterprise which in her New England home would have filled her life to the brim with excitement
Also she saw that she was well into that time of life where the absence of reputation in a woman endangers her comfort makes her liable to be left alone not despised and denounced but simply avoided and ignored
So she was telling Mildred the exact truth
She had laid down the arms she had taken up against the social system and had come inand was fighting it from the safer and wiser inside
She still insisted that a woman had the same rights as a man but she took care to make it clear that she claimed those rights only for others that she neither exercised them nor cared for them for herself
And to make her propaganda the more effective she was not only circumspect herself but was exceedingly careful to be surrounded by circumspect people
No one could cite her case as proof that woman would expand liberty into license
In theory there was nothing lively that she did not look upon at least with tolerance in practice more and more she disliked seeing one of her sex do anything that might cause the world to say woman would abuse liberty if she had it
Sensible people she now said do as they like
But they dont give fools a chance to titter and chatter
Agnes Belloc was typicalcertainly of a large and growing class in this dayof the decay of ancient temples and the decline of the oldfashioned idealism that made men fancy they lived nobly because they professed and believed nobly
She had no ethical standards
She simply met each situation as it arose and dealt with it as common sense seemed in that particular instance to dictate
For a thousand years genius has been striving with the human race to induce it to abandon its superstitions and hypocrisies and to defy common sense so adaptable so tolerant so conducive to long and healthy and happy life
Grossly materialistic but alluringly comfortable
Whether for good or for evil or for both good and evil the geniuses seem in a fair way at last to prevail over the idealists religious and political
And Mrs Belloc without in the least realizing it was a most significant sign of the times
Your throat seems to be better today said she to Mildred at breakfast
Those simple houseremedies I tried on you last night seem to have done some good
Nothing like heathot waterand no eating
The main thing was doing without dinner last night
My nerves are quieter advanced Mildred as the likelier explanation of the return of the soul of music to its seat
And my minds at rest
Yes thats good said plain Agnes Belloc
But getting the stomach straight and keeping it straights the main thing
My old grandmother could eat anything and do anything
Ive seen her put in a glass of milk or a saucer of icecream on top of a tomatosalad
The way she kept well was whenever she began to feel the least bit off she stopped eating
Not a bite would she touch till she felt well again
Mildred moved by an impulse stronger than her inclination produced the Keith paper
I wish youd read this and tell me what you think of it
Youve got so much common sense
Agnes read it through to the end began at the beginning and read it through again
That sounds good to me said she
I want to think it over
If you dont mind Id like to show it to Miss Blond
She knows a lot about those things
I suppose youre going to see Mr Crossley todaythats the musical managers name isnt it
Im going at eleven
That isnt too early is it
If I were you Id go as soon as I was dressed for the street
And if you dont get to see him wait till you do
Dont talk to understaffers
Always go straight for the head man
Youve got something thats worth his while
How did he get to be head man
Because he knows a good thing the minute he sees it
The under fellows are usually under because they are so taken up with themselves and with impressing people how grand they are that they dont see anything else
So when you talk to them you wear yourself out and waste your time
Theres only one thing that makes me nervous said Mildred
Everyone Ive ever talked with about going on the stageeveryone who has talked candidly has said Yes I know said Mrs Belloc as Mildred paused to search for smoothsounding words in which to dress without disguising a distinctly ugly idea
Ive heard that too
I dont know whether theres anything in it or not
She looked admiringly at Mildred who that morning was certainly lovely enough to tempt any man
If there is anything in it why I reckon YOUD be up against it
Thats the worst of having men at the top in any trade and profession
A womans got to get her chance through some man and if he dont choose to let her have it shes likely to fail
Mildred showed how this depressed her
But dont you fret about that till you have to advised Mrs Belloc
Ive a notion that even if its true it may not apply to you
Where a woman offers for a place that she can fill about as well as a hundred other women shes at the mans mercy but if she knows that shes far and away the best for the place I dont think a mans going to stand in his own light
Let him see that he can make money through YOU money he wont make if he dont get you
Then I dont think youll have any trouble
But Mildreds depression did not decrease
If my voice could only be relied on
she exclaimed
Isnt it exasperating that Ive got a delicate throat
Its always something said Mrs Belloc
One things about as bad as another and anything can be overcome
No not in my case said Mildred
The peculiar quality of my voicewhat makes it unusualis due to the delicateness of my throat
Maybe so said Mrs Belloc
Of course I can always singafter a fashion continued Mildred
But to be really valuable on the stage youve got to be able always to sing at your best
So Im afraid Im in the class of those wholl suit one about as well as another
Youve got to get out of that class said Mrs Belloc
The men in that class and the women have to do any dirty work the boss sees fit to give emand not much pay either
Let me tell you one thing Miss Stevens
If you cant get among the few at the top in the singing game you must look round for some game where you can hope to be among the few
No matter WHAT it is
By using your brains and working hard theres something you can do better than pretty nearly anybody else can or will do it
You find that
The words sank in sank deep
Mildred sense of her surroundings lost was gazing straight ahead with an expression that gave Mrs Belloc hope and even a certain amount of confidence
There was a distinct advance for after she reflected upon all that Mildred had told her little of her former opinion of Mildreds chances for success had remained but a hope detained not without difficulty
Mrs Belloc knew the human race unusually well for a womanunusually well for a human being of whatever sex or experience
She had discovered how rare is the temperament the combination of intelligence and tenacity that makes for success
She had learned that most people judged by any stand ard were almost total failures that most of the more or less successful were so merely because the world had an enormous amount of important work to be done even though halfway and had no one but those half competents to do it
As incompetence in a man would be tolerated where it would not be in a woman obviously a woman to get on must have the real temperament of success
She now knew enough about Mildred to be able to place her in the lady classthose brought up not only knowing how to do nothing with a money value except lawful or unlawful mantrapping but also trained to a sensitiveness and refinement and false shame about work that made it exceedingly difficult if not impossible for them to learn usefulness
She knew all Mildreds handicaps both those the girl was conscious of and those far heavier ones which she fatuously regarded as advantages
How was Mildred ever to learn to dismiss and disregard herself as the pretty woman of good social position an object of admiration and consideration
Mildred in the bottom of her heart was regarding herself as already successfulsuccessful at the highest a woman can achieve or ought to aspire to achievewas regarding her career however she might talk or might fancy she believed as a mere livelihood a side issue
She would be perhaps more than a little ashamed of her stage connections should she make any until she should be at the very top and how get to the top when one is working under the handicap of shame
Above all how was this indulgently and shelteredly reared lady to become a work ing woman living a routine life toiling away day in and day out with no let up permitting no one and nothing to break her routine
Really thought Agnes Belloc she ought to have married that Baird manor stayed on with the nasty general
I wonder why she didnt
Thats the only thing that gives me hope
There must be something in hersomething that dont appearsomething she doesnt know about herself
What is it
Maybe it was only vanity and vacillation
Again I dont know
The difficulty Mrs Belloc labored under in her attempt to explore and map Mildred Gower was a difficulty we all labor under in those same enterprises
We cannot convince ourselvesin spite of experience after experiencethat a human character is never consistent and homogeneous is always conglomerate that there are no two traits however naturally exclusive which cannot coexist in the same personality that circumstance is the dominating factor in human action and brings forward as dominant characteristics now one trait or set of traits consistent or inconsistent and now another
The Alexander who was Aristotles model pupil was the same Alexander as the drunken debaucher
Indeed may it not be that the characters which play the large parts in the comedy of life are naturally those that offer to the shifting winds of circumstances the greatest variety of strongly developed and contradictory qualities
For example if it was Mildreds latent courage rescued her from Siddall was it not her strong tendency to vacillation that saved her from a loveless and mercenary marriage to Stanley Baird
Perhaps the deep underlying truth is that all unusual people have in common the character that centers a powerful aversion to stagnation thus now by their strong qualities now by their weaknesses they are swept inevitably on and on and ever on
Good today bad tomorrow good again the day after weak in this instance strong in that now brave and now cowardly soft at one time hard at another generous and the reverse by turns they are consistent only in that they are never at rest but incessantly and inevitably go
Mildred reluctantly rose moved toward the door with lingering step
I guess Id better make a start said she
Thats the talk said Mrs Belloc heartily
But the affectionate glance she sent after the girl was dubious even pitying
IX TWO minutes walk through to Broadway and she was at her destination
There on the other side of the way stood the Gayety Theater with the offices of Mr Clarence Crossley overlooking the intersection of the two streets
Crossley was intrenched in the remotest of a series of rooms each tenanted by understaffers of diminishing importance as you drew way from the great man
It was next to impossible to get at him a cause of much sneering and dissatisfaction in theatrical circles
Crossley they said was exclusive had the swollen head had forgotten that only a few years before he had been a cheap little ticketseller grateful for a bow from any actor who had ever had his name up
Crossley insisted that he was not a victim of folie de grandeur that on the contrary he had become less vain as he had risen where he could see how trivial a thing rising was and how accidental
Said he Why do I shut myself in
Because Im what I am a good thing easy fruit
You say that men a hundred times bigger than Ill ever be dont shut themselves up
You say that Mountain the biggest financier in the country sits right out where anybody can go up to him
Yes but whod dare go up to him
Its generally known that hes a cannibal that he kills his own food and eats it warm and raw
So he can afford to sit in the open
If I did that all my time and all my money would go to the cheapskates with hardluck tales
I dont hide because Im haughty but because Im weak and soft
In appearance Mr Crossley did not suggest his name
He was a tallish powerfullooking person with a smooth handsome audacious face with fine laughing but somehow untrustworthy eyesat least untrustworthy for women though women had never profited by the warning
He dressed in excellent taste almost conspicuously and the gay and expensive details of his toilet suggested a man given over to liveliness
As a matter of fact this liveliness was potential rather than actual
Mr Crossley was always intending to resume the giddy ways of the years before he became a great man but was always so far behind in the important things to be done and done at once that he was forced to put off
However his neckties and his shirts and his flirtations untrustworthy eyes kept him a reputation for being one of the worst cases in Broadway
In vain did his achievements show that he could not possibly have time or strength for anything but work
He looked like a rounder he was in a business that gave endless dazzling opportunities for the lively life a rounder he was therefore
He was about forty
At first glance so vivid and energetic was he he looked like thirtyfive but at second glance one saw the lines the underlying melancholy signs of strain the heavy price he had paid for phenomenal success won by a series of the sort of risks that make the hair fall as autumn leaves on a windy day and make such hairs as stick turn rapidly gray
Thus there were many who thought Crossley was through vanity shy of the truth by five or six years when he said forty
In ordinary circumstances Mildred would never have got at Crossley
This was the first business call of her life where she had come as an unknown and unsupported suitor
Her reception would have been such at the hands of Crossleys insolent and illmannered underlings that she would have fled in shame and confusion
It is even well within the possibilities that she would have given up all idea of a career would have sent for Baird and so on
And not one of those who timid and inexperienced have suffered rude rebuff at their first advance would have condemned her
But it so chanced whether by good fortune or by ill the event was to tellthat she did not have to face a single underling
The hall door was open
She entered
It happened that while she was coming up in the elevator a quarrel between a motorman and a driver had heated into a fight into a small riot
All the underlings had rushed out on a balcony that commanded a superb view of the battle
The connecting doors were open Mildred advanced from room to room seeking someone who would take her card to Mr Crossley
When she at last faced a closed door she knocked
Come
cried a pleasant voice
And in she went to face Crossley himselfCrossley the weak and soft caught behind his last entrenchment with no chance to escape
Had Mildred looked the usual sort who come looking for jobs in musical comedy Mr Crossley would not have risennot be cause he was snobbish but because being a sensitive highstrung person he instinctively adopted the manner that would put the person before him at ease
He glanced at Mildred rose and thrust back forthwith the slangy offhand personality that was perhaps the most naturalor was it merely the most usedof his many personalities
It was Crossley the man of the world the man of the artistic world who delighted Mildred with a courteous bow and offer of a chair as he said You wished to see me
If you are Mr Crossley said Mildred
I should be tempted to say I was if I wasnt said he and his manner made it a mere pleasantry to put her at ease
There was no one in the outside room so I walked on and on until your door stopped me
Youll never know how lucky you were said he
They tell me those fellows out there have shocking manners
Have you time to see me now
Ive come to apply for a position in musical comedy
You have not been on the stage Miss Gower
Mildred Gower
Ive decided to use my own name
I know you have not been on the stage
Except as an amateurand not even that for several years
But Ive been working at my voice
Crossley was studying her as she stood talking she had refused the chair
He was more than favorably impressed
But the deciding element was not Mildreds excellent figure or her charm of manner or her sweet and lovely face
It was superstition
Just at that time Crossley had been abruptly deserted by Estelle Howard instead of going on with the rehearsals of The Full Moon in which she was to be starred she had rushed away to Europe with a violinist with whom she had fallen in love at the first rehearsal
Crossley was looking about for someone to take her place
He had been entrenched in those offices for nearly five years in all that time not a single soul of the desperate crowds that dogged him had broken through his guard
Crossley was as superstitious as was everyone else who has to do with the stage
What kind of a voice
asked he
Lyric soprano
You have music there
What
 Batti Batti and a little song in EnglishThe Rose and the Bee
 Crossley forgot his manners turned his back squarely upon her thrust his hands deep into his trousers pockets and stared out through the window
He presently wheeled round
She would not have thought his eyes could be so keen
Said he You were studying for grand opera
Yes
Why do you drop it and take up this
No money replied she
Ive got to make my living at once
Well lets see
Come with me please
They went out by a door into the hall went back to the rear of the building in at an iron door down a flight of steep iron skeleton steps dimly lighted
Mildred had often been behind the scenes in her amateur theatrical days but even if she had not she would have known where she was
Crossley called Moldini
Moldini
The name was caught up by other voices and repeated again and again more and more remotely
A moment and a small dark man with a superabundance of greasy dark hair appeared
Miss Gower said Crossley this is Signor Moldini
He will play your accompaniments
Then to the little Italian Piano on the stage
Yes sir
To Mildred with a smile Will you try
She bent her head
She had no voicenot for song not for speech not even for a monosyllable
Crossley took Moldini aside where Mildred could not hear
Mollie said he this girl crept up on me and Ive got to give her a trial
As you see shes a lady and you know what they are
Punk said Moldini
Crossley nodded
She seems a nice sort so I want to let her down easy
Ill sit back in the house in the dark
Run her through that Batti Batti thing shes got with her
If shes plainly on the fritz Ill light a cigarette
If I dont light up try the other song she has
If I still dont light up make her go through that Ah were you here love from the piece
But if I light up it means that Im going to light out and that youre to get rid of hertell her well let her know if shell leave her address
You understand
Perfectly
Far from being thrilled and inspired her surroundings made her sick at heartthe chill the dampness the bare walls the dim dreary lights the coarsely painted flats At last she was on the threshold of her chosen profession
What a profession for such a person as she had always been
She stood beside Moldini seated at the piano
She gazed at the darkness somewhere in whose depths Crossley was hidden
After several false starts she sang the Batti Batti through sang it atrociouslynot like a poor professional but like a pretentious amateur a reversion to a manner of singing she had once had but had long since got rid of
She paused at the end appalled by the silence by the awfulness of her own performance
From the darkness a slight click
If she had known
for it was Crossleys matchsafe
The sound slight yet so clear startled her roused her
She called out Mr Crossley wont you please be patient enough to let me try that again
A brief hesitation then Certainly
Once more she began
But this time there was no hesitation
From first to last she did it as Jennings had coached her did it with all the beauty and energy of her really lovely voice
As she ended Moldini said in a quiet but intense undertone Bravo
Bravo
Fresh as a bird on a bright spring morning
And from the darkness came Ahthats better Miss Gower
That was professional work
Now for the other
Thus encouraged and with her voice well warmed she could not but make a success of the song that was nearer to what would be expected of her in musical comedy
Crossley called out Now the sight singing Moldini
I dont expect you to do this well Miss Gower
I simply wish to get an idea of how youd do a piece we have in rehearsal
Youll have no trouble with this said Moldini as he opened the comedy song upon the rack with a contemptuous whirl
Its the easy showy stuff that suits the tired business man and his lacedin wife
Go at it and yell
Mildred glanced through it
There was a subtle something in the atmosphere now that put her at her ease
She read the words aloud laughing at their silly sentimentality she and Moldini and Crossley making jokes about it
Soon she said Im ready
She sang it well
She asked them to let her try it again
And the second time with the words in her mind and the simple melody she was able to put expression into it and to indicate with restraint the action
Crossley came down the aisle
What do you think Mollie
he said to Moldini
We might test her at a few rehearsals
Crossley meekly accepted the salutary check on his enthusiasm
Do you wish to try Miss Gower
Mildred was silent
She knew now the sort of piece in which she was to appear
She had seen a few of them those cheap and vulgar farces with their thin music their more than dubiouslooking people
What a comedown
What a degradation
It was as bad in its way as being the wife of General Siddall
And she was to do this in preference to marrying Stanley Baird
You will be paid of course during rehearsal that is as long as we are taking your time
Fifty dollars a week is about as much as we can afford
Crossley was watching her shrewdly was advancing these remarks in response to the hesitation he saw so plainly
Of course it isnt grand opera he went on
In fact its pretty lowalmost as low as the public taste
You see we arent subsidized by millionaires who want people to think theyre artistic so we have to hustle to separate the public from its money
But if you make a hit you can earn enough to put you into grand opera in fine style
I never heard of anyones graduating from here into grand opera said Mildred
Because our stars make so much money and make it so easily
Itll be your own fault if you dont
Cant I come to just one rehearsalto see whether I cancan do it
pleaded Mildred
Crossley made the more eager and the more superstitious by this unprecedented reluctance shook his head
No
You must agree to stay as long as we want you said he
We cant allow ourselves to be trifled with
Very well said Mildred resignedly
I will rehearse as long as you want me
And will stay for the run of the piece if we want that
said Crossley
You to get a hundred a week if you are put in the cast
More of course if you make a hit
You mean Im to sign a contract
cried Mildred in dismay
Exactly said Crossley
A truly amazing performance
Moldini was not astonished however for he had heard the songs and he knew Crossleys difficulties through Estelle Howards flight
Also he knew Crossley never so weak and soft that he trifled with unlikely candidates for his productions
Crossley had got up because he knew what to do and when to do it
Mildred acquiesced
Before she was free to go into the street again she had signed a paper that bound her to rehearse for three weeks at fifty dollars a week and to stay on at a hundred dollars a week for forty weeks or the run of The Full Moon if Crossley so desired if he did not she was free at the end of the rehearsals
A shrewdly onesided contract
But Crossley told himself he would correct it if she should by some remote chance be good enough for the part and should make a hit in it
This was no mere salve to conscience by the way
Crossley would not be foolish enough to give a successful star just cause for disliking and distrusting him and at the earliest opportunity leaving him to make money for some rival manager
Mrs Belloc had not gone out had been waiting in a fever of anxiety
When Mildred came into her sitting room with a gloomy face and dropped to a chair as if her last hope had abandoned her it was all Agnes Belloc could do to restrain her tears
Said she Dont be foolish my dear
You couldnt expect anything to come of your first attempt
That isnt it said Mildred
I think Ill give it updo something else
Grand operas bad enough
There were a lot of things about it that I was fighting my distaste for
I know said Agnes
And youd better fight them hard
Theyre unworthy of you
Butmusical comedy
Itsfrightful
Its an honest way of making a living and thats more than can be said ofof some things
I suppose youre afraid youll have to wear tightsor some nonsense like that
No no
Its doing it at all
Such rotten music and what a loathsome mess
Mrs Bellocs eyes flashed
Im losing all patience
she cried
I know youve been brought up like a fool and always surrounded by fools
I suppose youd rather sell yourself to some man
Do you know whats the matter with you at bottom
Why youre lazy and youre a coward
Too lazy to work
And afraid of what a lot of cheap womenll saywomen earning their board and clothes in about the lowest way such a thing can be done
Havent you got any self respect
Mildred rose
Mrs Belloc she said angrily I cant permit even you to say such things to me
The shoe seems to fit retorted Mrs Belloc
I never yet saw a lady a real silkanddiamonds sitin theparlor lady who had any selfrespect
If I had my way they wouldnt get a mouthful to eat till they had earned it
Thatd be a sure cure for the lady disease
Im ashamed of you Miss Stevens
And youre ashamed of yourself
Yes I am said Mildred with a sudden change of mood
The best thing you can do is to rest till lunchtime
Then start out after lunch and hunt a job
Ill go with you
But Ive got a job said Mildred
Thats whats the matter
Agnes Bellocs jaw dropped and her rather heavy eyebrows shot up toward the low sweeping line of her auburn hair
She made such a ludicrous face that Mildred laughed outright
Said she Its quite time
Fifty a week for three weeks of rehearsal
No doubt I can go on if I like
Nothing could be easier
Crossley
Yes
He was very niceheard me sing three piecesand it was all settled
Im to begin tomorrow
The color rose in Agnes Bellocs face until she looked apoplectic
She abruptly retreated to her bedroom
After a few minutes she came back her normal complexion restored
I couldnt trust myself to speak said she
That was the worst case of ingratitude I ever met up with
You getting a place at fifty dollars a weekand on your first trialand you come in looking as if youd lost your money and your reputation
What kind of a girl are you anyway
I dont know said Mildred
I wish I did
Well Im sorry you got it so easy
Now youll have a false notion from the start
Its always better to have a hard time getting things
Then you appreciate them and have learned how to hold on
No trouble about holding on to this said Mildred carelessly
Please dont talk that way child pleaded Agnes almost tearful
Its frightful to me whove had experience to hear you invite a falldown
Mildred disdainfully fluttered the typewritten copy of the musical comedy
This is childs play said she
The lines are beneath contempt
As for the songs you never heard such slop
The stars in those pieces get four and five hundred and more a week said Mrs Belloc
Believe me those managers dont pay out any such sums for childs play
You look out
Youre going at this wrong
I shant care if I do fail said Mildred
Do you mean that
demanded Mrs Belloc
No I dont said Mildred
Oh I dont know what I mean
I guess youre just talking said Mrs Belloc after a reflective silence
I guess a girl who goes and gets a good job first crack out of the box must have a streak of shrewdness
I hope so said Mildred doubtfully
I guess youll work hard all right
After you went out this morning I took that paper down to Miss Blond
Shes crazy about it
She wants to make a copy of it
I told her Id ask you
Certainly said Mildred
She says shell return it the same day
Tell her she can keep it as long as she likes
Mrs Belloc eyed her gravely started to speak checked herself
Instead she said No I shant do that
Ill have it back in your room by this evening
You might change your mind and want to use it
Very well said Mildred pointedly uninterested and ignoring Mrs Bellocs delicate but distinct emphasis upon might
Mrs Belloc kept a suspicious eye upon heran eye that was not easily deceived
The more she thought about Mildreds state of depression and disdain the more tolerant she became
That mood was the natural and necessary result of the girls bringing up and mode of life
The important thingand the wonderful thing was her being able to overcome it
After a week of rehearsal she said Im making the best of it
But I dont like it and never shall
I should hope not replied Mrs Belloc
Youre going to the top
Id hate to see you contented at the bottom
Arent you learning a good deal thatll be useful later on
Thats why Im reconciled to it said she
The stage director Mr Ransdell is teaching me everything even how to sing
He knows his business
Ransdell not only knew but also took endless pains with her
He was a tall thin dark man strikingly handsome in the distinguished way
So distinguished looking was he that to meet him was to wonder why he had not made a great name for himself
An extraordinary mind he certainly had and an insight into the reasons for things that is given only to genius
He had failed as a composer failed as a playwright failed as a singer failed as an actor
He had been forced to take up the profession of putting on dramatic and musical plays a profession that required vast knowledge and high talents and paid for them in niggardly fashion both in money and in fame
Crossley owed to him more than to any other single element the series of successes that had made him rich yet the ten thousand a year Crossley paid him was regarded as evidence of Crossleys lavish generosity and was so
It would have been difficult to say why a man so splendidly endowed by nature and so tireless in improving himself was thus unsuccessful
Probably he lacked judgment indeed that lack must have been the cause
He could judge for Crossley but not for himself not when he had the feeling of ultimate responsibility
Mildred had anticipated the most repulsive associations men and women of low origin and of vulgar tastes and of vulgarly loose lives
She found herself surrounded by simple pleasant people undoubtedly erratic for the most part in all their habits but without viciousness
And they were hard workers all
Ransdell for Crossleytolerated no nonsense
His people could live as they pleased away from the theater but there they must be prompt and fit
The discipline was as severe as that of a monastery
She saw many signs that all sorts of things of the sort with which she wished to have no contact were going on about her but as she held slightlybut not at all haughtilyaloof she would have had to go out of her way to see enough to scandalize her
She soon suspected that she was being treated with extraordinary consideration
This was by Crossleys orders
But the carrying out of their spirit as well as their letter was due to Ransdell
Before the end of that first week she knew that there was the personal element behind his admiration for her voice and her talent for acting behind his concentrating most of his attention upon her part
He looked his love boldly whenever they were alone he was always trying to touch hernever in a way that she could have resented or felt like resenting
He was not unattractive to her and she was eager to learn all he had to teach and saw no harm in helping herself by letting him love
Toward the middle of the second week when they were alone in her dressingroom hewith the ingenious lack of abruptness of the experienced man at the game took her hand and before she was ready kissed her
He did not accompany these advances with an outburst of passionate words or with any fiery lighting up of the eyes but calmly smilingly as if it were what she was expecting him to do what he had a right to do
She did not know quite how to meet this novel attack
She drew her hand away went on talking about the partthe changes he had suggested in her entrance as she sang her best solo
He discussed this with her until they rose to leave the theater
He looked smilingly down on her and said with the flattering air of the satisfied connoisseur Yes you are charming Mildred
I can make a great artist and a great success out of you
We need each other
I certainly need you said she gratefully
How much youve done for me
Only the beginning replied he
Ah I have such plans for yousuch plans
Crossley doesnt realize how far you can be made to gowith the right training
Without it He shook his head laughingly
But you shall have it my dear
And he laid his hands lightly and caressingly upon her shoulders
The gesture was apparently a friendly familiarity
To resent it even to draw away would put her in the attitude of the woman absurdly exercised about the desirability and sacredness of her own charms
Still smiling in that friendly assured way he went on Youve been very cold and reserved with me my dear
Very unappreciative
Mildred red and trembling hung her head in confusion
Ive been at the business ten years he went on and youre the first woman Ive been more than casually interested in
The pretty ones were bores
The homely onesI cant interest myself in a homely woman no matter how much talent she has
A woman must first of all satisfy the eye
And you He seated himself and drew her toward him
She cold all over and confused in mind and almost stupefied resisted with all her strength but her strength seemed to be oozing away
She said You must not do this
You must not do this
Im horribly disappointed in you
He drew her to his lap and held her there without any apparent tax upon his strength
He kissed her laughingly pushing away the arms with which she tried to shield her face
Suddenly she found strength to wrench herself free and stood at a distance from him
She was panting a little was pale was looking at him with cold anger
You will please leave this room said she
He lit a cigarette crossed his legs comfortably and looked at her with laughing eyes
Dont do that he said genially
Surely my lessons in acting havent been in vain
Thats too obviously a pose
She went to the mirror arranged her hat and moved toward the door
He rose and barred the way
You are as sensible as you are sweet and lovely said he
Why should you insist on our being bad friends
If you dont stand aside Ill call out to the watchman
Id never have thought you were dishonest
In fact I dont believe it yet
You dont look like one of those ladies who wish to take everything and give nothing
His tone and manner were most attractive
Besides she could not forget all he had done for herand all he could do for her
Said she Mr Ransdell if Ive done anything to cause you to misunderstand it was unconscious
And Im sorry
But I Be honest interrupted he
Havent I made it plain that I was fascinated by you
She could not deny it
Havent I been showing you that I was willing to do everything I could for you
I thought you were concerned only about the success of the piece
The piece be jiggered said he
You dont imagine YOU are necessary to its success do you
You a raw untrained girl
Dont your good sense tell you I could find a dozen who would do let us say ALMOST as well
I understand that murmured she
Perhaps you do but I doubt it rejoined he
Vanitys a fast growing weed
However I rather expected that you would remain sane and reasonably humble until youd had a real success
But it seems not
Now tell me why should I give my time and my talent to training youto putting you in the way of quick and big success
She was silent
What did you count on giving me in return
Your thanks
She colored hung her head
Wasnt I doing for you something worth while
And what had you to give in return
He laughed with gentle mockery
Really you should have been grateful that I was willing to do so much for so little for what I wanted oughtif you are a sensible woman to seem to you a trifle in comparison with what I was doing for you
It was my part not yours to think the complimentary things about you
How shallow and vain you women are
Cant you see that the value of your charms is not in them but in the imagination of some man
I cant answer you said she
Youve put it all wrong
You oughtnt to ask payment for a favor beyond price
No I oughtnt to HAVE to ask corrected he in the same pleasantly ironic way
You ought to have been more than glad to give freely
But curiously while weve been talking Ive changed my mind about those precious jewels of yours
Well say theyre pearls and that my taste has suddenly changed to diamonds
He bowed mockingly
So dear lady keep your pearls
And he stood aside opening the door for her
She hesitated dazed that she was leaving with the feeling of the conquered a field on which by all the precedents she ought to have been victor
She passed a troubled night debated whether to relate her queer experience to Mrs Belloc decided for silence
It drafted into service all her reserve of courage to walk into the theater the next day and to appear on the stage among the assembled company with her usual air
Ransdell greeted her with his customary friendly courtesy and gave her his attention as always
By the time they had got through the first act in which her part was one of four of about equal importance she had recovered herself and was in the way to forget the strange stage directors strange attack and even stranger retreat
But the situation changed with the second act in which she was on the stage all the time and had the whole burden
The act as originally written had been less generous to her but Ransdell had taken one thing after another away from the others and had given it to her
She made her first entrance precisely as he had trained her to make it and began
A few seconds and he stopped her
Please try again Miss Gower said he
Im afraid that wont do
She tried again again he stopped her
She tried a third time
His manner was all courtesy and consideration not the shade of a change
But she began to feel a latent hostility
Instinctively she knew that he would no longer help her that he would leave her to her own resources and judge her by how she acquitted herself
She made a blunder of her third trial
Really Miss Gower that will never do said he mildly
Let me show you how you did it
He gave an imitation of hera slight caricature
A titter ran through the chorus
He sternly rebuked them and requested her to try again
Her fourth attempt was her worst
He shook his head in gentle remonstrance
Not quite right yet said he regretfully
But well go on
Not far however
He stopped her again
Again the courteous kindly criticism
And so on through the entire act
By the end of it Mildreds nerves were unstrung
She saw the whole game and realized how helpless she was
Before the end of that rehearsal Mildred had slipped back from promising professional into clumsy amateur tolerable only because of the beautiful freshness of her voiceand it was a question whether voice alone would save her
Yet no one but Mildred herself suspected that Ransdell had done it had revenged himself had served notice on her that since she felt strong enough to stand alone she was to have every opportunity to do so
He had said nothing disagree able on the contrary he had been most courteous most forbearing
In the third act she was worse than in the second
At the end of the rehearsal the others theretofore flattering and encouraging turned away to talk among themselves and avoided her
Ransdell about to leave said Dont look so downhearted Miss Gower
Youll be all right tomorrow
An off days nothing
He said it loudly enough for the others to hear
Mildreds face grew red with white streaks across it like the prints of a lash
The subtlest feature of his malevolence had been that whereas on other days he had taken her aside to criticize her on this day he had spoken outgently deprecatingly but franklybefore the whole company
Never had Mildred Gower been so sad and so blue as she was that day and that night
She came to the rehearsal the following day with a sore throat
She sang but her voice cracked on the high notes
It was a painful exhibition
Her fellow principals who had been rather glad of her setback the day before were full of pity and sympathy
They did not express it they were too kind for that
But their looks their drawing away from herMildred could have borne sneers and jeers better
And Ransdell was SO forbearing SO gentle
Her voice got better got worse
Her acting remained mediocre to bad
At the fifth rehearsal after the break with the stagedirector Mildred saw Crossley seated far back in the dusk of the empty theater
It was his first appearance at rehearsals since the middle of the first week
As soon as he had satisfied himself that all was going well he had given his attention to other matters where things were not going well
Mildred knew why he was thereand she acted and sang atrociously
Ransdell aggravated her nervousness by ostentatiously trying to help her by making seemingly adroit attempts to cover her mistakesattempts apparently thwarted and exposed only because she was hopelessly bad
In the pause between the second and third acts Ransdell went down and sat with Crossley and they engaged in earnest conversation
The while the members of the company wandered restlessly about the stage making feeble attempts to lift the gloom with affected cheerfulness
Ransdell returned to the stage went up to Mildred who was sitting idly turning the leaves of a partbook
Miss Gower said he and never had his voice been so friendly as in these regretful accents dont try to go on today
Youre evidently not yourself
Go home and rest for a few days
Well get along with your understudy Miss Esmond
When Mr Crossley wants to put you in again hell send for you
You mustnt be discouraged
I know how beginners take these things to heart
Dont fret about it
You cant fail to succeed
Mildred rose and how she never knew crossed the stage
She stumbled into the flats fumbled her way to the passageway to her dressingroom
She felt that she must escape from that theater quickly or she would give way to some sort of wild attack of nerves
She fairly ran through the streets to Mrs Bellocs shut herself in her room
But instead of the relief of a storm of tears there came a black hideous depression
Hour after hour she sat almost without motion
The afternoon waned the early darkness came
Still she did not movecould not move
At eight oclock Mrs Belloc knocked
Mildred did not answer
Her door opened she had forgotten to lock it
In came Mrs Belloc
Isnt that you sitting by the window
she said
Yes replied Mildred
I recognized the outline of your hat
Besides who else could it be but you
Ive saved some dinner for you
I thought you were still out
Mildred did not answer
Whats the matter
said Agnes
Ill
bad news
Ive lost my position said Mildred
A pause
Then Mrs Belloc felt her way across the room until she was touching the girl
Tell me about it dear said she
In a monotonous lifeless way Mildred told the story
It was some time after she finished when Agnes said Thats badbad but it might be worse
You must go to see the manager Crossley
Why
said Mildred
Tell him what you told me
Mildreds silence was dissent
It cant do any harm urged Agnes
It cant do any good replied Mildred
That isnt the way to look at it
A long pause
Then Mildred said If I got a place somewhere else Id meet the same thing in another form
Youve got to risk that
Besides Id never have had a chance of succeeding if Mr Ransdell hadnt taught me and stood behind me
It was many minutes before Agnes Belloc said in a hesitating restrained voice They say that success any kind of successhas its price and that one has to be ready to pay that price or fail
Again the profound silence
Into it gradually penetrated the soft insistent sound of the distant roar of New Yorka cruel clamorous devouring sound like a demand for that price of success
Said Agnes timidly Why not go to see Mr
Ransdell
He wouldnt make it up said Mildred
And I I couldnt
I tried to marry Stanley Baird for moneyand I couldnt
It would be the same way nowonly more so
But youve got to do something
Yes and I will
Mildred had risen abruptly was standing at the window
Agnes Belloc could feel her soul rearing defiantly at the city into which she was gazing
I will
she replied
It sounds as if youd been pushed to where youd turn and make a fight said Agnes
I hope so said Mildred
Its high time
She thought out several more or less ingenious indirect routes into Mr Crossleys stronghold for use in case frontal attack failed
But she did not need them
Still the hours she spent in planning them were by no means wasted
No time is wasted that is spent in desperate concentrated thinking about any of the practical problems of life
And Mildred Gower as much as any other woman of her trainingor lack of training was deficient in ability to use her mind purposefully
Most of us let our minds act like a sheep in a pasturego wandering hither and yon nibbling at whatever happens to offer
Only the superior few deliberately select a pasture select a line of procedure in that pasture and keep to it concentrating upon what is useful to us and that alone
So it was excellent experience for Mildred to sit down and think connectedly and with wholly absorbed mind upon the phase of her career most important at the moment
When she had worked out all the plans that had promise in them she went tranquilly to sleep a stronger and a more determined person for she had said with the energy that counts I shall see him somehow
If none of these schemes works Ill work out others
Hes got to see me
But it was no occult bearing down that led him to order her admitted the instant her card came
He liked her he wished to see her again he felt that it was the decent thing and somehow not difficult gently but clearly to convey to her the truth
On her side she who had looked forward to the interview with some nervousness was at her ease the moment she faced him alone in that inner office
He had extraordinary personal charmmore than Ransdell though Ransdell had the charm invariably found in a handsome human being with the manysided intellect that gives lightness of mind
Crossley was not intellectual not in the least
One had only to glance at him to see that he was one of those men who reserve all their intelligence for the practical sides of the practical thing that forms the basis of their material career
He knew something of many things had a wonderful assortment of talents could sing could play piano or violin could compose could act could do mystifying card tricks could order womens clothes as discriminatingly as he could order his ownall these things a little but nothing much except making a success of musical comedy and comic opera
He had an ambition carefully restrained in a closet of his mind where it could not issue forth and interfere with his business
This ambition was to be a giver of grand opera on a superb scale
He regarded himself as a mere moneymakerwas not ashamed of this but neither was he proud of it
His ambition then represented a dream of a rise to something more than business man to friend and encourager and wet nurse to art
Mildred Gower had happened to set his imagination to working
The discovery that she was one of those whose personalities rouse high expectations only to mock them had been a severe blow to his confidence in his own judgment
Though he pretended to believe and had the habit of saying that he was weak and soft was always being misled by his good nature he really believed himself an unerring judge of human beings and as his success evidenced he was not far wrong
Thus though convinced that Mildred was a false alarm his secret vanity would not let him release his original idea
He had the tenacity that is an important element in all successes and tenacity become a fixed habit has even been known to ruin in the end the very careers it has made
Said Mildred in a manner which was astonishingly unemotional and businesslike Ive not come to tattle and to whine Mr Crossley
Ive hesitated about coming at all partly because Ive an instinct its useless partly because what I have to say isnt easy
Crossleys expression hardened
The old story excuses excuses selfexcusesomebody else to blame
If it hadnt been for Mr Ransdellthe trouble he took with me the coaching he gave meId have been a ridiculous failure at the very first rehearsal
But it is to Mr Ransdell that my failure is due
My dear Miss Gower said Crossley polite but cold I regret hearing you say that
The fact is very different
Not until you had done soso unacceptably at several rehearsals that news of it reached me by another waynot until I myself went to Mr Ransdell about you did he admit that there could be a possibility of a doubt of your succeeding
I had to go to rehearsal myself and directly order him to restore Miss Esmond and lay you off
Mildred was not unprepared
She received this tranquilly
Mr Ransdell is a very clever man said she with perfect good humor
Ive no hope of convincing you but I must tell my side
And clearly and simply with no concealments through fear of disturbing his high ideal of her ladylike deli cacy she told him the story
He listened seated well back in his tilted deskchair his gaze upon the ceiling
When she finished he held his pose a moment then got up and paced the length of the office several times his hands in his pockets
He paused looked keenly at her a goodhumored smile in those eyes of his so fascinating to women because of their frank wavering of an inconstancy it would indeed be a triumph to seize and hold
Said he And your bad throat
Did Ransdell give you a germ
She colored
He had gone straight at the weak point
If youd been able to sing he went on nobody could have done you up
She could not gather herself together for speech
Didnt you know your voice wasnt reliable when you came to me
Yes she admitted
And wasnt that the REAL reason you had given up grand opera
pursued he mercilessly
The reason was what I told youlack of money replied she
I did not go into the reason why I lacked money
Why should I when even on my worst days I could get through all my part in a musical comedy except songs that could be cut down or cut out
If I could have made good at acting would you have given me up on account of my voice
Not if you had been good enough he admitted
Then I did not get my engagement on false pretenses
No
You are right
Still your falldown as a singer is the important fact
Dont lose sight of it
I shant said she tersely
His eyes were frankly laughing
As to Ransdell what a clever trick
Hes a remarkable man
If he werent so shrewd in those little ways he might have been a great man
Same old storyjust a little too smart and so always doing the little thing and missing the big thing
Yes he went gunning for youand got you
He dropped into his chair
He thought a moment laughed aloud went on No doubt he has worked that same trick many a time
Ive suspected it once or twice but this time he fooled me
He got you Miss Gower and I can do nothing
You must see that I cant look after details
And I cant give up as invaluable a man as Ransdell
If I put you back hed put you outwould make the piece fail rather than let you succeed
Mildred was gazing somberly at the floor
Its hard linesdevilish hard lines he went on sympathetically
But what can I do
What can I do
said Mildred
Do as all people do who succeedmeet the conditions
Im not prepared to go as far as that at least not yet said she with bitter sarcasm
Perhaps when Im actually starving and in rags A very distressing future interrupted Crossley
ButI didnt make the world
Dont berate me
Be sensibleand be honest Miss Gower and tell me how could I possibly protect you and continue to give successful shows
If you can suggest any feasible way Ill take it
No there isnt any way replied she rising to go
He rose to escort her to the hall door
Personally the Ransdell sort of thing isdistasteful to me
Perhaps if I were not so busy I might be forced by my own giddy misconduct to take less high ground
Ive observed that the best that can be said for human nature at its best is that it is as well behaved as its real temptations permit
He was making you you know
Youve admitted it
Theres no doubt about that said Mildred
Mind you Im not excusing him
Im simply explaining him
If your voice had been all rightif you could have stood to any degree the test he put you to the test of standing aloneyoud have defeated him
He wouldnt have dared go on
Hes too shrewd to think a real talent can be beaten
The strong lines the latent character in Mildreds face were so strongly in evidence that looking at her then no one would have thought of her beauty or even of her sex but only of the force that resists all and overcomes all
Yesthe voice said she
The voice
If its ever reliable come to see me
Until then He put out his hand
When she gave him hers he held it in a way that gave her no impulse to draw back
You know the conditions of success now
You must prepare to meet them
If you put yourself at the mercy of the Ransdellsor any other of the petty intriguers that beset every avenue of successyou must take the consequences you must conciliate them as best you can
If you dont wish to be at their mercy you must do your part
She nodded
He released her hand opened the hall door
He said Forgive my little lecture
But I like you and I cant help having hope of you
He smiled charmingly his keen inconstant eyes dimming
Perhaps I hope because youre young and extremely lovely and I am pitifully susceptible
You see youd better go
Every mans a Ransdell at heart where pretty women are concerned
She did not leave the building
She went to the elevator and asked the boy where she could find Signor Moldini
His office was the big room on the third floor where voice candidates were usually tried out three days in the week
At the moment he was engaged
Mildred seated in the tiny anteroom heard through the glass door a girl singing or trying to sing
It was a distressing performance and Mildred wondered that Moldini could be so tolerant as to hear her through
He came to the door with her thanked her profusely told her he would let her know whenever there was an opening suited to your talents
As he observed Mildred he was still sighing and shaking his head over the departed candidate
Ugly and ignorant
he groaned
Poor creature
Poor poor creature
She makes three dollars a weekin a factory owned by a great philanthropist
Three dollars a week
And she has no way to make a cent more
Miss Gower they talk about the sad naughty girls who sell themselves in the street to piece out their wages
But think dear young lady how infinitely better of they are than the ugly ones who cant piece out their wages
There he looked directly at her for the first time
Before she could grasp the tragic sadness of his idea he with the mobility of candid and highly sensitized natures shifted from melancholy to gay for in looking at her he had caught only the charm of dress of face of arrangement of hair
What a pleasure
he exclaimed bursting into smiles and seizing and kissing her gloved hands
Voice like a bird face like an angel only not TOO good no not TOO good
But it is so rareto look as one sings to sing as one looks
For once compliment sincere compliment from one whose opinion was worth while gave Mildred pain
She burst out with her news Signor Moldini Ive lost my place in the company
My voice has gone back on me
Usually Moldini abounded in the consideration of fine natures that have suffered deeply from lack of consideration
But he was so astounded that he could only stare stupidly at her smoothing his long greasy hair with his thin brown hand
Its all my fault I dont take care of myself she went on
I dont take care of my health
At least I hope thats it
Hope
he said suddenly angry
Hope so because if it isnt that then Ive no chance for a career explained she
He looked at her feet pointed an uncannily long forefinger at them
The crossings and sidewalks are slushand you a singer without overshoes
Lunacy
Lunacy
Ive never worn overshoes
said Mildred apologetically
Dont tell me
I wish not to hear
It makes me like madness here
He struck his low sloping brow with his palm
What vanity
That the feet may look well to the passing stranger no overshoes
Rheumatism sore throat colds pneumonia
Is it not disgusting
If you were a man I should swear in all the languages I knowwhich are five including Hungarian and when one swears in Hungarian it is going some as you say in America
Yes it is going quite some
I shall wear overshoes said Mildred
And indigestionyou have that
A little I guess
Muchmuch I tell you
cried Moldini shaking the long finger at her
You Americans
You eat too fast and you eat too much
That is why you are always sick and consulting the doctors who give the medicines that make worse not better
Yes you Americans are like children
You know nothing
Sing
Americans cannot sing until they learn that a stomach isnt a wastebasket to toss everything into
You have been to that throat specialist Hicks
Ah yes said Mildred brightening
He said there was nothing organically wrong
He is an ass and a criminal
He ruins throats
He likes to cut and he likes to spray
He sprays those poisons that relieve colds and paralyze the throat and cords
Americans sing
It is to laugh
They have too many doctors they take too many pills
Do you know what your national emblem should be
A dollar signyes
But that for all nations
No a pilla pill I tell you
You take pills
Now and then said Mildred laughing
I admit I have several kinds always on hand
You see
cried he triumphantly
No it is not mere art that America needs but more sense about eatingand to keep away from the doctors
People full of pills they cannot make poems and pictures and write operas and sing them
Throw away those pills dear young lady I implore you
Signor Moldini Ive come to ask you to help me
Instantly the Italian cleared his face of its half humorous halfquerulous expression
In its place came a grave and courteous eagerness to serve her that was a pleasure even if it was not altogether sincere
And Mildred could not believe it sincere
Why should he care what became of her or be willing to put himself out for her
You told me one day that you had at one time taught singing continued she
Until I was starved out
replied he
I told people the truth
If they could not sing I said so
If they sang badly I told them why and it was always the upset stomach the foolish food and people will not take care about food
They will eat what they please and they say eating is good for them and that anyone who opposes them is a crank
So most of my pupils left except those I taught for nothingand they did not heed me and came to nothing
You showed me in ten minutes one day how to cure my worst fault
Ive sung better more naturally ever since
You could sing like the birds
You doalmost
You could be taught to sing as freely and sweetly and naturally as a flower gives perfume
That is YOUR divine gift young lady song as pure and fresh as a birds song raining down through the leaves from the treetop
I have no money
Ive got to get it and I shall get it continued Mildred
I want you to teach me at any hour that you are free
And I want to know how much you will charge so that I shall know how much to get
Two dollars a lesson
Or if you take six lessons a week ten dollars
Those were my terms
I could not take less
It is too little said Mildred
The poorest kinds of teachers get five dollars an hourand teach nothing
Two dollars ten dollars a week replied he
It is the most I ever could get
I will not take more from you
It is too little said she
But Ill not insist for obvious reasons
Now if youll give me your home address Ill go
When I get the money Ill write to you
But wait
cried he as she rose to depart
Why so hurried
Let us see
Take of the wrap
Step be hind the screen and loosen your corset
Perhaps even you could take it off
Not without undressing said Mildred
But I can do that if its necessary
She laughed queerly
From this time on Ill do ANYTHING thats necessary
Nonever mind
The dress of womanof your kind of women
It is not serious
He laughed grimly
As for the other kind their dress is the only serious thing about them
It is a mistake to think that women who dress badly are serious
My experience has been that they are the most foolish of all
Fashionable dressit is part of a womans tools
It shows that she is good at her business
The women who try to dress like men they are good neither at mens business nor at womens
This while Mildred was behind the screen loosening her corsetthough in fact she wore it so loose at all times that she inconvenienced herself simply to show her willingness to do as she was told
When she came out Moldini put her through a rigid physical examination made her breathe while he held one hand on her stomach the other on her back listened at her heart opened wide her throat and peered down thrust his long strong fingers deep into the muscles of her arms her throat her chest until she had difficulty in not crying out with pain
The foundation is there was his verdict
You have a good body good muscles but flabbya ladys muscles not an opera singers
And you are stiff not so stiff as when you first came here but stiff for a professional
Ah we must go at this scientifically thoroughly
You will teach me to breatheand how to produce my voice naturally
I will teach you nothing replied he
I will tell you what to do and you will teach yourself
You must get strongstrong in the supple wayand then you will sing as God intended
The way to sing dear young lady is to sing
Not to breathe artificially and make faces and fuss with your throat but simply to drop your mouth and throat open and let it out
Mildred produced from her handbag the Keith paper
What do YOU think of that
she asked
Presently he looked up from his reading
This part I have seen before said he
It is Lucia Rivis
Her cousin Lotta Drusini showed it to meshe was a great singer also
You approve of it
If you will follow that for two years faithfully you will be securely great and then you will follow it all your singing lifeand it will be long
But remember dear young lady I said IF you follow it and I said faithfully
I do not believe you can
Why not
said Mildred
Because that means selfdenial colossal selfdenial
You love things to eatyes
Mildred nodded
We all do said Moldini
And we hate routine and we like foolish aimless little pleasures of all kinds
And it will be two years before I can try grand operacan make my living
said Mildred slowly
I did not say that
I said before you would be great
No you can sing I think inwait
Moldini flung rapidly through an enormous mass of music on a large table
Ah here
he cried and he showed her a manuscript of scales
Those two papers
It does not look much
Well I have made it up myself
And when you can sing those two papers perfectly you will be a greater singer than any that ever lived
He laughed delightedly
Yes it is all therein two pages
But do not weep dear lady because you will never sing them perfectly
You will do very well if Always that if remember
Now let us see
Take this sit in the chair and begin
Dont bother about me
I expect nothing
Just do the best you can
Desperation when it falls short of despair is the best word for achievement
Mildreds voice especially at the outset was far from perfect condition
Her high notes which had never been developed properly were almost bad
But she acquitted herself admirably from the standpoint of showing what her possibilities were
And Moldini unkempt almost unclean but as natural and simple and human a soul as ever paid the penalties of poverty and obscurity and friendlessness for being natural and simple and human exactly suited her peculiar temperament
She knew that he liked her that he believed in her she knew that he was as sympathetic toward her as her own self that there was no meanness anywhere in him
So she sang like a bird a bird that was not too well in soul or in body but still a bird out in the sunshine with the airs of spring cheer ing his breast and its foliage gladdening his eyes
He kept her at it for nearly an hour
She saw that he was pleased that he had thought out some plan and was bursting to tell her but had forbidden himself to speak of it
He said You say you have no money
No but I shall get it
You may have to pay high for ityes
She colored but did not flinch
At worst it will be unpleasant but thats all
Wait onetwo daysuntil you hear from me
I mayI do not say will but mayget it
Yes I who have nothing
He laughed gayly
And we you and Iwe will divide the spoils
Gravely
Do not misunderstand
That was my little joke
If I get the money for you it will be quite honorable and businesslike
Sowait dear young lady
As she was going she could not resist saying You are SURE I can singIF of coursealways the if
It is not to be doubted
How well do you think
You mean how many dollars a night well
You mean as well as this great singer or that
I do not know
And you are not to compare yourself with anyone but yourself
You will sing as well as Mildred Gower at her best
For some reason her blood went tingling through her veins
If she had dared she would have kissed him
X THAT same afternoon Donald Keith arrived at the top of Mrs Bellocs steps met Mildred coming out
Seeing their greeting one would have thought they had seen each other but a few minutes before or were casual acquaintances
Said she Im going for a walk
Lets take the taxi said he
There it stood invitingly at the curb
She felt tired
She disliked walking
She wished to sit beside him and be whirled awayout of the noisy part of the city up where the air was clean and where there were no crowds
But she had begun the regimen of Lucia Rivi
She hesitated
What matter if she began now or put off beginning until after this one last drive
No we will walk said she
But the streets are in frightful condition
She thrust out a foot covered with a new and shiny stormrubber
Lets drive to the park then
Well walk there
No
If I get into the taxi Ill not get out
Send it away
When they were moving afoot up Madison Avenue he said Whats the matter
This isnt like you
Ive come to my senses replied she
It may be too late but Im going to see
When I called on Mrs Brindley the other day said he she had your note saying that you were going into musical comedy with Crossley
Thats over said she
I lost my voice and I lost my job
So I heard said he
I know Crossley
I dropped in to see him this morning and he told me about a foolish fashionable girl who made a bluff at going on the stagehe said she had a good voice and was a swell looker but proved to be a regular four flusher
I recognized you
Thanks said she dryly
So I came to see you
She inquired about Mrs Brindley and then about Stanley Baird
Finding that he was in Italy she inquired Do you happen to know his address
Ill get it and send it to you
He has taken a house at Monte Carlo for the winter
And you
I shall stay hereI think
You may join him
It dependshe looked at herupon you
He could put a wonderful amount of meaning into a slight inflection
She strugglednot in vainto keep from changing expression
You realize now that the career is quite hopeless
said he
She did not answer
You do not like the stage life
No
And the stage life does not like you
No
Your voice lacks both strength and stability
Yes
And you have found the one way by which you could get onand you dont like it
Crossley told you
said she the color flaring
Your name was not mentioned
You may not believe it but Crossley is a gentleman
She walked on in silence
I did not expect your failure to come so soonor in quite that way he went on
I got Mrs Brindley to exact a promise from you that youd let her know about yourself
I called on Mrs Belloc one day when you were out and gave her my confidence and got hers and assured myself that you were in good hands
Crossleys tale gave mea shock
I came at once
Then you didnt abandon me to my fate as I thought
He smiled in his strange way
Iwhen I loved you
Hardly
Then you did interest yourself in me because you caredprecisely as I said laughed she
And I should have given you up if you had succeededprecisely as I said replied he
You wished me to fail
I wished you to fail
I did everything I could to help you to succeed
I even left you absolutely alone set you in the right waythe only way in which anyone can win success
Yes you made me throw away the crutches and try to walk
It was hard to do that
Those strains are very wearing at my time of life
You never were any younger and youll never be any older laughed she
Thats your charmone of them
Mildred do you still care
How did you know
inquired she mockingly
You didnt try to conceal it
Id not have ventured to say and do the things I said and did if I hadnt felt that we cared for each other
But so long as you were leading that fatuous life and dreaming those foolish dreams I knew we could never be happy
That is trueoh SO true replied she
But nowyou have tried and that has made a woman of you
And you have failed and that has made you ready to be a wifeto be happy in the quiet private ways
She was silent
I can make enough for us bothas much as we will need or wantas much as you please if you arent too extravagant
And I can do it easily
Its making little sumsa small incomethats hard in this ridiculous world
Lets marry go to California or Europe for several months then come back here and live like human beings
She was silent
Block after block they walked along as if neither had anything especial in mind anything worth the trouble of speech
Finally he said Well
I cant answeryet said she
Not today not till Ive thought
She glanced quickly at him
Over his impassive face so beautifully regular and to her so fascinating there passed a quick dark shadow and she knew that he was suffering
He laughed quietly his old careless indifferent laugh
Oh yes you can answer said he
You have answered
She drew in her breath sharply
You have refused
Why do you say that Donald
she pleaded
To hesitate over a proposal is to refuse said he with gentle raillery
A man is a fool who does not understand and sheer off when a woman asks for time
You know that I love you she cried
I also know that you love something else more
But its finished
Lets talk about something else
Wont you let me tell you why I hesitate
begged she
It doesnt matter
But it does
Yes I do refuse Donald
Ill never marry you until I am independent
You said a while ago that what Ive been through had made a woman of me
Not yet
Im only beginning
Im still weak still a coward
Donald I must and will be free
He looked full at her with a strange smile in his brilliant eyes
Said he with obvious intent to change the subject Mrs Brindleys very unhappy that you havent been to see her
When you asked me to marry you the only reason I almost accepted was because I want someone to support me
I love youyes
But it is as one loves before one has given oneself and has lived the same life with another
In the ordinary sense its love that I feel
Butdo you understand me dearestin another sense its only the hope of love the belief that love will come
He stopped short and looked at her his eyes alive with the stimulus of a new and startling idea
If you and I had been everything to each other and you were saying Let us go on living the one life and I were hesitating then youd be right
And I couldnt hesitate Donald
If you were mine nothing could make me give you up but when its only the hope of having you then pride and selfrespect have a chance to be heard
He was ready to move on
Theres something in that said he lapsed into his usual seeming of impassiveness
But not much
I never before knew you to fail to understand
I understand perfectly
You care but you dont care enough to suit me
I havent waited all these years before giving a woman my love to be content with a love seated quietly and demurely between pride and self respect
You wouldnt marry me until I had failed said she shrewdly
Now you attack me for refusing to marry you until Ive succeeded
A slight shrug
Proposal withdrawn said he
Now lets talk about your career your plans
Im beginning to understand myself a little said she
I suppose you think that sort of personal talk is very silly and vainand trivial
On the contrary replied he it isnt absolutely necessary to understand oneself
One is swept on in the same general direction anyhow
But understanding helps one to go faster and steadier
It began away back when I was a girlthis idea of a career
I envied men and despised women the sort of women I knew and met with
I didnt realize why then
But it was because a man had a chance to be somebody in himself and to do something while a woman was just aa more or less ornamental belonging of some manswhat you want me to become now
As far as possible from my idea
Dont you want me to belong to you
As I belong to you
That sounds well but it isnt what could happen
The fact is Donald that I want to belong to you want to be owned by you and to lose myself in you
And its that Im fighting
She felt the look he was bending upon her and glowed and colored under it but did not dare to turn her eyes to meet it
Said he Why fight it
Why not be happy
Ah but thats just it cried she
I shouldnt be happy
And I should make you miserable
The idea of a careerthe idea thats rooted deep in me and cant ever be got out Donald it would torment me
You couldnt kill it no matter how much you loved me
Id yield for the time
Then Id go back or if I didnt Id be wretched and make you wish youd never seen me
I understand said he
I dont believe it but I understand
You think Im deceiving myself because you saw me wasting my life playing the idler and the fool pretending I was working toward a career when I was really making myself fit for nothing but to be Stanley Bairds mistress
And youre still deceiving yourself
You wont see the truth
No matter said she
I must go on and make a careersome kind of a career
At what
At grand opera
Howll you get the money
Of Stanley if necessary
Thats why I asked his address
I shant ask for much
Hell not refuse
A few minutes ago you were talking of self respect
As something I hoped to get
It comes with independence
Ill pay any price to get it
Any price
said he and never before had she seen his selfcontrol in danger
I shant ask Stanley until my other plans have failed
What other plans
I am going to ask Mrs Belloc for the money
She could afford to giveto lendthe little Id want
Im going to ask her in such a way that it will be as hard as possible for her to refuse
That isnt ladylike butIve dropped out of the lady class
And if she refuses
Then Ill go one after another to several very rich men I know and ask them as a business proposition
Go in person advised he with an undisguised sneer
Ill raise no false hopes in them she said
If they choose to delude themselves Ill not go out of my way to undeceive themuntil I have to
So THIS is Mildred Gower
You made that remark before
Really
When Stanley showed you a certain photograph of me
I remember
This is the same woman
Its me laughed she
The real me
Youd not care to be married to her
No said he
Then after a brief silence Yet curiously it was that woman with whom I fell in love
No not exactly in love for Ive been thinking about what you said as to the difference between love in posse and love in esse to put it scientificallybetween love as a prospect and love as a reality
And I was right said she
It explains why marriages go to pieces and affairs come to grief
Those lovers mistook loves promise to come for fulfillment
Love doesnt die
It simply fails to comedoesnt redeem its promise
Thats the way it might be with us said he
Thats the way it would be with us rejoined she
He did not answer
When they spoke again it was of indifferent matters
An hour and a half after they started they were at Mrs Bellocs again
She asked him to have tea in the restaurant next door
He declined
He went up the steps with her said Well I wish you luck
Moldini is the best teacher in America
How did you know Moldini was to teach me
exclaimed she
He smiled put out his hand in farewell
Crossley told me
Goodby
He told Crossley
I wonder why
She was so interested in this new phase that she did not see his outstretched hand or the look of bitter irony that came into his eyes at this proof of the subordinate place love and he had in her thoughts
Im nervous and anxious she said apologetically
Moldini told me he had some scheme about getting the money
If he only could
But no such luck for me she added sadly
Keith hesitated debated with himself said You neednt worry
Moldini got itfrom Crossley
Fifty dollars a week for a year
You got Crossley to do it
No
He had done it before I saw him
He had just promised Moldini and was cursing himself as weak and soft
But that means nothing
You may be sure he did it because Moldini convinced him it was a good speculation
She was radiant
She had not vanity enough where he was concerned to believe that he deeply cared that her joy would give him pain because it meant forgetfulness of him
Nor was she much impressed by the expression of his eyes
And even as she hurt him she made him love her the more for he appreciated how rare was the woman who in such circumstances does not feed her vanity with pity for the poor man suffering so horribly because he is not to get her precious self
It flashed upon her why he had not offered to help her
There isnt anybody like you said she with no explanation of her apparent irrelevancy
Dont let Moldini see that you know said he with characteristic fine thoughtfulness for others in the midst of his own unhappiness
It would deprive him of a great pleasure
He was about to go
Suddenly her eyes filled and opening the outer door she drew him in
Donald she said I love you
Take me in your arms and make me behave
He looked past her his arms hung at his sides
Said he And tonight Id get a note by messenger saying that you had taken it all back
No the girl in the photographthat was you
She wasnt made to be MY wife
Or I to be her husband
I love you because you are what you are
I should not love you if you were the ordinary woman the sort who marries and merges
But Im old enough to spare myselfand youthe consequences of what it would mean if we were anything but strangers to each other
Yes you must keep awayaltogether
If you didnt Id be neither the one thing nor the other but just a poor failure
Youll not fail said he
I know it
Its written in your face
He looked at her
She was not looking at him but with eyes gazing straight ahead was revealing that latent inexplicable power which when it appeared at the surface so strongly dominated and subordinated her beauty and her sex
He shut his teeth together hard and glanced away
You will not fail he repeated bitterly
And thats the worst of it
Without another word without a handshake he went
And she knew that except by chance he would never see her againor she him
Moldini disheveled and hysterical with delight and suspense was in the drawingroomhad been there half an hour
At first she could hardly force her mind to listen but as he talked on and on he captured her attention and held it
The next day she began with Moldini and put the Lucia Rivi system into force in all its more than conventual rigors
And for about a month she worked like a devouring flame
Never had there been such energy such enthusiasm
Mrs Belloc was alarmed for her health but the Rivi system took care of that and presently Mrs Belloc was moved to say Well Ive often heard that hard work never harmed anyone but I never believed it
Now I know the truth
Then Mildred went to Hanging Rock to spend Saturday to Monday with her mother
Presbury reduced now by various infirmitiesby absolute deafness by dimness of sight by difficulty in walkingto where eating was his sole remaining pleasure or indeed distraction spent all his time in concocting dishes for him self
Mildred could not resistand who can when seated at table with the dish before ones eyes and under ones nose
The Rivi regimen was suspended for the visit
Mildred back in New York and at work again found that she was apparently none the worse for her holiday was in fact better
So she drifted into the way of suspending the regimen for an evening now and thenwhen she dined with Mrs Brindley or when Agnes Belloc had something particularly good
All went well for a time
Thena cold
She neglected it feeling sure it could not stay with one so soundly healthy through and through
But it did stay it grew worse
She decided that she ought to take medicine for it
True starvation was the cure prescribed by the regimen but Mildred could not bring herself to two or three days of discomfort
Also many people told her that such a cure was foolish and even dangerous
The cold got better got worse got better
But her throat became queer and at last her voice left her
She was ashamed to go to Moldini in such a condition
She dropped in upon Hicks the throat specialist
He fixed her up beautifully with a few sprayings
A weekand her voice left her again and Hicks could not bring it back
As she left his office it was raining an icy dreary drizzle
She splashed her way home in about the lowest spirits she had ever known
She locked her door and seated herself at the window and stared out while the storm raged within her
After an hour or two she wrote and sent Moldini a note I have been making a fool of myself
Ill not come again until I am all right
Be patient with me
I dont think this will occur again
She first wrote happen
She scratched it out and put occur in its place
Not that Moldini would have noted the slip simply that she would not permit herself the satisfaction of the false and selfexcusing happen
It had not been a happen
It had been a deliberate folly a lapse to the Mildred she had buried the day she sent Donald Keith away
When the note was on its way she threw out all her medicines and broke the new spraying apparatus Hicks had instructed her to buy
She went back to the Rivi regime
A week passed and she was little better
Two weeks and she began to mend
But it was six weeks before the last traces of her folly disappeared
Moldini said not a word gave no sign
Once more her life went on in uneventful unbroken routinediet exercise singingsinging exercise dietno distractions except an occasional visit to the opera with Moldini and she was hating opera now
All her enthusiasm was gone
She simply worked doggedly drudged slaved
When the days began to grow warm Mrs Belloc said I suppose youll soon be off to the country
Are you going to visit Mrs
Brindley
No said Mildred
Then come with me
Thank you but I cant do it
But youve got to rest somewhere
Rest
said Mildred
Why should I rest
Mrs Belloc started to protest then abruptly changed
Come to think of it why should you
Youre in perfect health and itll be time enough to rest when you get there
 Im tired through and through said Mildred but it isnt the kind of tired that could be rested except by throwing up this frightful nightmare of a career
And you cant do that
I wont said Mildred her lips compressed and her eyes narrowed
She and Moldiniand fat funny little Mrs Moldini went to the mountains
And she worked on
She would listen to none of the suggestions about the dangers of keeping too steadily at it about working oneself into a state of staleness about the imperative demands of the artistic temperament for rest change variety
It may be so she said to Mrs Brindley
But Ive gone mad
I can no more drop this routine thanthan you could take it up and keep to it for a week
Ill admit I couldnt said Cyrilla
And Mildred youre making a mistake
Then Ill have to suffer for it
I must do what seems best to me
But Im sure youre wrong
I never knew anyone to act as youre acting
Everyone rests and freshens up
Mildred lost patience almost lost her temper
Youre trying to tempt me to ruin myself she said
Please stop it
You say you never knew anyone to do as Im doing
Very well
But how many girls have you known who have succeeded
Cyrilla hesitatingly confessed that she had known none
Yet youve known scores whove tried
But they didnt fail because they didnt work enough
Many of them worked too much
Mildred laughed
How do you know why they failed
said she
You havent thought about it as I have
You havent LIVED it
Cyrilla I served my apprenticeship at listening to nonsense about careers
I want to have nothing to do with inspiration and artistic temperament and spontaneous genius and all the rest of the lies
Moldini and I know what we are about
So Im living as those who have succeeded lived and not as those who have failed
Cyrilla was silenced but not convinced
The amazing improvement in Mildreds health the splendid slim strength and suppleness of her body the new and stable glories of her voiceall these she knew about but they did not convince her
She believed in work in hard work but to her work meant the music itself
She felt that the Rivi system and the dirty obscure little Moldini between them were destroying Mildred by destroying all temperament in her
It was the old old criticism of talent upon genius
Genius has always won in its own time and generation all the world except talent
To talent contemporaneous genius genius seen at its patient plodding toil seems coarse and obvious and lacking altogether in inspiration
Talent cannot comprehend that creation is necessarily in travail and in all manner of unloveliness
Mildred toiled on like a slave under the lash and Moldini and the Rivi system were her twin relentless drivers
She learned to rule herself with an iron hand
She discovered the full measure of her own deficiencies and she determined to make herself a competent lyric soprano perhaps something of a dramatic soprano
She dismissed from her mind all the high thoughts all the dreams wherewith the little people even the little people who achieve a certain success beguile the tedium of their journey along the hard road
She was not working to interpret the thought of the great master or to advance the singing art yet higher or even to win fame and applause
She had one object to earn her living on the grand opera stage and to earn it as a prima donna because that meant the best living
She frankly told Cyrilla that this was her object when Cyrilla forced her one day to talk about her aims
Cyrilla looked pained broke a melancholy silence to say I know you dont mean that
You are too intelligent
You sing too well
Yes I mean just that said Mildred
A living
At any rate dont say it
You give such a false impression
To whom
Not to Crossley and not to Moldini and why should I care what any others think
They are not paying my expenses
And regardless of what they think now theyll be at my feet if I succeed and theyll put me under theirs if I dont
How hard you have grown cried Cyrilla
How sensible you mean
Ive merely stopped being a selfdeceiver and a sentimentalist
Believe me my dear you are sacrificing your character to your ambition
I never had any real character until ambition came replied Mildred
The soft vacillating sweet and weak thing I used to have wasnt character
But dear you cant think it superior character to center ones whole life about a sordid ambition
Sordid
Merely to make a living
Mildred laughed merrily and mockingly
You call that sordid
Then for heavens sake what is high
You had left you money enough to live on if you have to
No one left me an income
So Im fighting for independenceand that means for selfrespect
Is selfrespect sordid Cyrilla
And then Cyrilla understoodin part not altogether
She lived in the ordinary environment of flap doodle and sweet hypocrisy and sentimentality and none such can more than vaguely glimpse the realities
Toward the end of the summer Moldini said Its over
You have won
Mildred looked at him in puzzled surprise
You have learned it all
You will succeed
The rest is detail
But Ive learned nothing as yet protested she
You have learned to teach yourself replied the Italian
You at last can hear yourself sing and you know when you sing right and when you sing wrong and you know how to sing right
The rest is easy
Ah my dear Miss Gower you will work NOW
Mildred did not understand
She was even daunted by that You will work NOW
She had been thinking that to work harder was impossible
What did he expect of her
Something she feared she could not realize
But soon she understoodwhen he gave her songs then began to teach her a role the part of Madame Butterfly herself
I can help you only a little there he said
You will have to go to my friend Ferreri for roles
But we can make a beginning
She had indeed won
She had passed from the stage where a career is all drudgerythe stage through which only the strong can pass without giving up and accepting failure or small success
She had passed to the stage where there is added pleasure to the drudgery for the drudgery never ceases
And what was the pleasure
Why more workalways workbringing into use not merely the routine parts of the mind but also the imaginative and creative faculties
She had learned her tradenot well enough for no superior man or woman ever feels that he or she knows the trade well enoughbut well enough to begin to use it
Said Moldini When the great one who has achieved and arrived is asked for advice by the sweet enthusiastic young beginner what is the answer
Always the same My dear child dont
Go back home and marry and have babies
You know why now
And Mildred looking back over the dreary drudgery that had been and looking forward to the drudgery yet to come dreary enough for all the prospects of a few flowers and a little sunMildred said Indeed I do maestro
They think it means what you Americans call moralsas if that were all of morality
But it doesnt mean morals not at all
Sex and the game of sex is all through life everywherein the home no less than in the theater
In town and country indoors and out sunlight moonlight and rainalways it goes on
And the temptations and the struggles are no more and no less on the stage than off
No there is too much talk about morals
The reason the great one says dont is the work
He shook his head sadly
They do not realize those eager young beginners
They read the storybooks and the lives of the great successes and they hear the foolish chatter of common place peoplethose imbecile cultured people who know nothing
And they think a career is a triumphal march
What think you Miss Gowereh
If I had known Id not have had the courage or the vanity to begin said she
And if I could realize whats before me I probably shouldnt have the courage to go on
But why not
Havent you also learned that its just the days work doing every day the best you can
Oh I shall go on rejoined she
Yes said he looking at her with awed admiration
It is in your face
I saw it there the day you cameafter you sang the Batti Batti the first time and failed
There was nothing to me then
The seed replied he
And I saw it was an acorn not the seed of one of those weak plants that spring up overnight and wither at noon
Yes you will win
He laughed gayly rolled his eyes and kissed his fingers
And then you can afford to take a little holiday and fall in love
Love
Ah it is a joyous pastime for a holiday
Only for a holiday mind you
I shall be there and I shall seize you and take you back to your art
In the following winter and summer Crossley disclosed why he had been sufficiently interested in grand opera to begin to back undeveloped voices
Crossley was one of those men who are never so practical as when they profess to be and fancy themselves impractical
He became a grandopera manager and organized for a season that would surpass in interest any New York had known
Thus it came about that on a March night Mildred made her debut
The opera was Faust
As the three principal men singers were all expensivethe tenor alone twelve hundred a nightCrossley put in a comparatively modestly salaried Marguerite
She was seized with a cold at the last moment and Crossley ventured to substitute Mildred Gower
The Rivi system was still in force
She was readyindeed she was always ready as Rivi herself had been
And within ten minutes of her coming forth from the wings Mildred Gower had leaped from obscurity into fame
It happens so often in the story books the newly gloriously arrived one having been wholly unprepared achieving by sheer force of genius
It occurs so occasionally in lifenever when there is lack of preparation never by force of unassisted genius never by accident
Mildred succeeded because she had got ready to succeed
How could she have failed
Perhaps you read the stories in the newspapers how she had discovered herself possessed of a marvelous voice how she had decided to use it in public how she had coached for a part had appeared had become one of the worlds few hundred great singers all in a single act of an opera
You read nothing about what she went through in developing a hopelessly uncertain and far from strong voice into one which while not nearly so good as thousands of voices that are tried and cast aside yet sufficed with her will and her concentration back of it to carry her to fameand wealth
That birdlike voice
So sweet and spontaneous so true so like the bird that sings of summer in full throated ease
No wonder the audience welcomed it with cheers on cheers
Greater voices they had heard but none more naturaland that was Moldini
He came to her dressingroom at the intermission
He stretched out his arms but emotion overcame him and he dropped to a chair and sobbed and cried and laughed
She came and put her arms round him and kissed him
She was almost calm
The GREAT fear had seized herCan I keep what I have won
I am a fool cried Moldini
I will agitate you
Dont be afraid of that said she
I am nerv ous yes horribly nervous
But you have taught me so that I could sing no matter what was happening
It was true
And her body was like iron to the touch
He looked at her and though he knew her and had seen her train herself and had helped in it he marveled
You are happy
he said eagerly
Surelyyes you MUST be happy
More than that answered she
Youll have to find another word than happinesssomething bigger and stronger and deeper
Now you can have your holiday laughed he
Butwith mock sternnessin moderation
He must be an incident only
With those who win the high places sex is an incidenta charming necessary incident but only an incident
He must not spoil your career
If you allowed that you would be like a mother who deserts her children for a lover
He must not touch your career
Mildred giving the last touches to her costume before the glass glanced merrily at Moldini by way of it
If he did touch it said she how long do you think he would last with me
Moldini paused halfway in his nod of approval was stricken with silence and sadness
It would have been natural and proper for a man thus to put sex beneath the career
It was necessary for anyone who developed the strong character that compels success and holds it
But The Italian could not get away from tradition woman was made for the pleasure of one man not for herself and the world
You dont like that maestro
said she still observing him in the glass
No man would said he with returning cheerfulness
It hurts mans vanity
And no woman would either you rebuke their laziness and their dependence
She laughed and rushed away to fresh triumphs
