Reprinted Pieces by Charles Dickens Scanned and proofed by David Price ccx074coventryacuk Reprinted Pieces THE LONG VOYAGE WHEN the wind is blowing and the sleet or rain is driving against the dark windows I love to sit by the fire thinking of what I have read in books of voyage and travel
Such books have had a strong fascination for my mind from my earliest childhood and I wonder it should have come to pass that I never have been round the world never have been shipwrecked iceenvironed tomahawked or eaten
Sitting on my ruddy hearth in the twilight of New Years Eve I find incidents of travel rise around me from all the latitudes and longitudes of the globe
They observe no order or sequence but appear and vanish as they will  come like shadows so depart
Columbus alone upon the sea with his disaffected crew looks over the waste of waters from his high station on the poop of his ship and sees the first uncertain glimmer of the light rising and falling with the waves like a torch in the bark of some fisherman which is the shining star of a new world
Bruce is caged in Abyssinia surrounded by the gory horrors which shall often startle him out of his sleep at home when years have passed away
Franklin come to the end of his unhappy overland journey  would that it had been his last
 lies perishing of hunger with his brave companions each emaciated figure stretched upon its miserable bed without the power to rise all dividing the weary days between their prayers their remembrances of the dear ones at home and conversation on the pleasures of eating the lastnamed topic being ever present to them likewise in their dreams
All the African travellers wayworn solitary and sad submit themselves again to drunken murderous manselling despots of the lowest order of humanity and Mungo Park fainting under a tree and succoured by a woman gratefully remembers how his Good Samaritan has always come to him in womans shape the wide world over
A shadow on the wall in which my minds eye can discern some traces of a rocky seacoast recalls to me a fearful story of travel derived from that unpromising narrator of such stories a parliamentary bluebook
A convict is its chief figure and this man escapes with other prisoners from a penal settlement
It is an island and they seize a boat and get to the main land
Their way is by a rugged and precipitous seashore and they have no earthly hope of ultimate escape for the party of soldiers despatched by an easier course to cut them off must inevitably arrive at their distant bourne long before them and retake them if by any hazard they survive the horrors of the way
Famine as they all must have foreseen besets them early in their course
Some of the party die and are eaten some are murdered by the rest and eaten
This one awful creature eats his fill and sustains his strength and lives on to be recaptured and taken back
The unrelateable experiences through which he has passed have been so tremendous that he is not hanged as he might be but goes back to his old chainedgang work
A little time and he tempts one other prisoner away seizes another boat and flies once more  necessarily in the old hopeless direction for he can take no other
He is soon cut off and met by the pursuing party face to face upon the beach
He is alone
In his former journey he acquired an inappeasable relish for his dreadful food
He urged the new man away expressly to kill him and eat him
In the pockets on one side of his coarse convict dress are portions of the mans body on which he is regaling in the pockets on the other side is an untouched store of salted pork stolen before he left the island for which he has no appetite
He is taken back and he is hanged
But I shall never see that seabeach on the wall or in the fire without him solitary monster eating as he prowls along while the sea rages and rises at him
Captain Bligh a worse man to be entrusted with arbitrary power there could scarcely be is handed over the side of the Bounty and turned adrift on the wide ocean in an open boat by order of Fletcher Christian one of his officers at this very minute
Another flash of my fire and Thursday October Christian five andtwenty years of age son of the dead and gone Fletcher by a savage mother leaps aboard His Majestys ship Briton hoveto off Pitcairns Island says his simple grace before eating in good English and knows that a pretty little animal on board is called a dog because in his childhood he had heard of such strange creatures from his father and the other mutineers grown grey under the shade of the breadfruit trees speaking of their lost country far away
See the Halsewell East Indiaman outward bound driving madly on a January night towards the rocks near Seacombe on the island of Purbeck
The captains two dear daughters are aboard and five other ladies
The ship has been driving many hours has seven feet water in her hold and her mainmast has been cut away
The description of her loss familiar to me from my early boyhood seems to be read aloud as she rushes to her destiny
About two in the morning of Friday the sixth of January the ship still driving and approaching very fast to the shore Mr Henry Meriton the second mate went again into the cuddy where the captain then was
Another conversation taking place Captain Pierce expressed extreme anxiety for the preservation of his beloved daughters and earnestly asked the officer if he could devise any method of saving them
On his answering with great concern that he feared it would be impossible but that their only chance would be to wait for morning the captain lifted up his hands in silent and distressful ejaculation
At this dreadful moment the ship struck with such violence as to dash the heads of those standing in the cuddy against the deck above them and the shock was accompanied by a shriek of horror that burst at one instant from every quarter of the ship
Many of the seamen who had been remarkably inattentive and remiss in their duty during great part of the storm now poured upon deck where no exertions of the officers could keep them while their assistance might have been useful
They had actually skulked in their hammocks leaving the working of the pumps and other necessary labours to the officers of the ship and the soldiers who had made uncommon exertions
Roused by a sense of their danger the same seamen at this moment in frantic exclamations demanded of heaven and their fellowsufferers that succour which their own efforts timely made might possibly have procured
The ship continued to beat on the rocks and soon bilging fell with her broadside towards the shore
When she struck a number of the men climbed up the ensignstaff under an apprehension of her immediately going to pieces
Mr
Meriton at this crisis offered to these unhappy beings the best advice which could be given he recommended that all should come to the side of the ship lying lowest on the rocks and singly to take the opportunities which might then offer of escaping to the shore
Having thus provided to the utmost of his power for the safety of the desponding crew he returned to the roundhouse where by this time all the passengers and most of the officers had assembled
The latter were employed in offering consolation to the unfortunate ladies and with unparalleled magnanimity suffering their compassion for the fair and amiable companions of their misfortunes to prevail over the sense of their own danger
In this charitable work of comfort Mr Meriton now joined by assurances of his opinion that the ship would hold together till the morning when all would be safe
Captain Pierce observing one of the young gentlemen loud in his exclamations of terror and frequently cry that the ship was parting cheerfully bid him be quiet remarking that though the ship should go to pieces he would not but would be safe enough
It is difficult to convey a correct idea of the scene of this deplorable catastrophe without describing the place where it happened
The Haleswell struck on the rocks at a part of the shore where the cliff is of vast height and rises almost perpendicular from its base
But at this particular spot the foot of the cliff is excavated into a cavern of ten or twelve yards in depth and of breadth equal to the length of a large ship
The sides of the cavern are so nearly upright as to be of extremely difficult access and the bottom is strewed with sharp and uneven rocks which seem by some convulsion of the earth to have been detached from its roof
The ship lay with her broadside opposite to the mouth of this cavern with her whole length stretched almost from side to side of it
But when she struck it was too dark for the unfortunate persons on board to discover the real magnitude of the danger and the extreme horror of such a situation
In addition to the company already in the roundhouse they had admitted three black women and two soldiers wives who with the husband of one of them had been allowed to come in though the seamen who had tumultuously demanded entrance to get the lights had been opposed and kept out by Mr Rogers and Mr Brimer the third and fifth mates
The numbers there were therefore now increased to near fifty
Captain Pierce sat on a chair a cot or some other moveable with a daughter on each side whom he alternately pressed to his affectionate breast
The rest of the melancholy assembly were seated on the deck which was strewed with musical instruments and the wreck of furniture and other articles
Here also Mr Meriton after having cut several waxcandles in pieces and stuck them up in various parts of the roundhouse and lighted up all the glass lanthorns he could find took his seat intending to wait the approach of dawn and then assist the partners of his dangers to escape
But observing that the poor ladies appeared parched and exhausted he brought a basket of oranges and prevailed on some of them to refresh themselves by sucking a little of the juice
At this time they were all tolerably composed except Miss Mansel who was in hysteric fits on the floor of the deck of the roundhouse
But on Mr Meritons return to the company he perceived a considerable alteration in the appearance of the ship the sides were visibly giving way the deck seemed to be lifting and he discovered other strong indications that she could not hold much longer together
On this account he attempted to go forward to look out but immediately saw that the ship had separated in the middle and that the forepart having changed its position lay rather further out towards the sea
In such an emergency when the next moment might plunge him into eternity he determined to seize the present opportunity and follow the example of the crew and the soldiers who were now quitting the ship in numbers and making their way to the shore though quite ignorant of its nature and description
Among other expedients the ensignstaff had been unshipped and attempted to be laid between the ships side and some of the rocks but without success for it snapped asunder before it reached them
However by the light of a lanthorn which a seaman handed through the skylight of the roundhouse to the deck Mr Meriton discovered a spar which appeared to be laid from the ships side to the rocks and on this spar he resolved to attempt his escape
Accordingly lying down upon it he thrust himself forward however he soon found that it had no communication with the rock he reached the end of it and then slipped off receiving a very violent bruise in his fall and before he could recover his legs he was washed off by the surge
He now supported himself by swimming until a returning wave dashed him against the back part of the cavern
Here he laid hold of a small projection in the rock but was so much benumbed that he was on the point of quitting it when a seaman who had already gained a footing extended his hand and assisted him until he could secure himself a little on the rock from which he clambered on a shelf still higher and out of the reach of the surf
Mr
Rogers the third mate remained with the captain and the unfortunate ladies and their companions nearly twenty minutes after Mr Meriton had quitted the ship
Soon after the latter left the roundhouse the captain asked what was become of him to which Mr Rogers replied that he was gone on deck to see what could be done
After this a heavy sea breaking over the ship the ladies exclaimed Oh poor Meriton
he is drowned had he stayed with us he would have been safe
and they all particularly Miss Mary Pierce expressed great concern at the apprehension of his loss
The sea was now breaking in at the fore part of the ship and reached as far as the mainmast
Captain Pierce gave Mr Rogers a nod and they took a lamp and went together into the sterngallery where after viewing the rocks for some time Captain Pierce asked Mr Rogers if he thought there was any possibility of saving the girls to which he replied he feared there was none for they could only discover the black face of the perpendicular rock and not the cavern which afforded shelter to those who escaped
They then returned to the roundhouse where Mr Rogers hung up the lamp and Captain Pierce sat down between his two daughters
The sea continuing to break in very fast Mr Macmanus a midshipman and Mr Schutz a passenger asked Mr Rogers what they could do to escape
Follow me he replied and they all went into the sterngallery and from thence to the upperquarter gallery on the poop
While there a very heavy sea fell on board and the roundhouse gave way Mr Rogers heard the ladies shriek at intervals as if the water reached them the noise of the sea at other times drowning their voices
Mr
Brimer had followed him to the poop where they remained together about five minutes when on the breaking of this heavy sea they jointly seized a hencoop
The same wave which proved fatal to some of those below carried him and his companion to the rock on which they were violently dashed and miserably bruised
Here on the rock were twentyseven men but it now being low water and as they were convinced that on the flowing of the tide all must be washed off many attempted to get to the back or the sides of the cavern beyond the reach of the returning sea
Scarcely more than six besides Mr Rogers and Mr Brimer succeeded
Mr
Rogers on gaining this station was so nearly exhausted that had his exertions been protracted only a few minutes longer he must have sunk under them
He was now prevented from joining Mr Meriton by at least twenty men between them none of whom could move without the imminent peril of his life
They found that a very considerable number of the crew seamen and soldiers and some petty officers were in the same situation as themselves though many who had reached the rocks below perished in attempting to ascend
They could yet discern some part of the ship and in their dreary station solaced themselves with the hopes of its remaining entire until daybreak for in the midst of their own distress the sufferings of the females on board affected them with the most poignant anguish and every sea that broke inspired them with terror for their safety
But alas their apprehensions were too soon realised
Within a very few minutes of the time that Mr Rogers gained the rock an universal shriek which long vibrated in their ears in which the voice of female distress was lamentably distinguished announced the dreadful catastrophe
In a few moments all was hushed except the roaring of the winds and the dashing of the waves the wreck was buried in the deep and not an atom of it was ever afterwards seen
The most beautiful and affecting incident I know associated with a shipwreck succeeds this dismal story for a winter night
The Grosvenor East Indiaman homeward bound goes ashore on the coast of Caffraria
It is resolved that the officers passengers and crew in number one hundred and thirtyfive souls shall endeavour to penetrate on foot across trackless deserts infested by wild beasts and cruel savages to the Dutch settlements at the Cape of Good Hope
With this forlorn object before them they finally separate into two parties  never more to meet on earth
There is a solitary child among the passengers  a little boy of seven years old who has no relation there and when the first party is moving away he cries after some member of it who has been kind to him
The crying of a child might be supposed to be a little thing to men in such great extremity but it touches them and he is immediately taken into that detachment
From which time forth this child is sublimely made a sacred charge
He is pushed on a little raft across broad rivers by the swimming sailors they carry him by turns through the deep sand and long grass he patiently walking at all other times they share with him such putrid fish as they find to eat they lie down and wait for him when the rough carpenter who becomes his especial friend lags behind
Beset by lions and tigers by savages by thirst by hunger by death in a crowd of ghastly shapes they never  O Father of all mankind thy name be blessed for it
 forget this child
The captain stops exhausted and his faithful coxswain goes back and is seen to sit down by his side and neither of the two shall be any more beheld until the great last day but as the rest go on for their lives they take the child with them
The carpenter dies of poisonous berries eaten in starvation and the steward succeeding to the command of the party succeeds to the sacred guardianship of the child
God knows all he does for the poor baby how he cheerfully carries him in his arms when he himself is weak and ill how he feeds him when he himself is griped with want how he folds his ragged jacket round him lays his little worn face with a womans tenderness upon his sunburnt breast soothes him in his sufferings sings to him as he limps along unmindful of his own parched and bleeding feet
Divided for a few days from the rest they dig a grave in the sand and bury their good friend the cooper  these two companions alone in the wilderness  and then the time comes when they both are ill and beg their wretched partners in despair reduced and few in number now to wait by them one day
They wait by them one day they wait by them two days
On the morning of the third they move very softly about in making their preparations for the resumption of their journey for the child is sleeping by the fire and it is agreed with one consent that he shall not be disturbed until the last moment
The moment comes the fire is dying  and the child is dead
His faithful friend the steward lingers but a little while behind him
His grief is great he staggers on for a few days lies down in the desert and dies
But he shall be reunited in his immortal spirit  who can doubt it
 with the child when he and the poor carpenter shall be raised up with the words Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these ye have done it unto Me
As I recall the dispersal and disappearance of nearly all the participators in this once famous shipwreck a mere handful being recovered at last and the legends that were long afterwards revived from time to time among the English officers at the Cape of a white woman with an infant said to have been seen weeping outside a savage hut far in the interior who was whisperingly associated with the remembrance of the missing ladies saved from the wrecked vessel and who was often sought but never found thoughts of another kind of travel came into my mind
Thoughts of a voyager unexpectedly summoned from home who travelled a vast distance and could never return
Thoughts of this unhappy wayfarer in the depths of his sorrow in the bitterness of his anguish in the helplessness of his self reproach in the desperation of his desire to set right what he had left wrong and do what he had left undone
For there were many many things he had neglected
Little matters while he was at home and surrounded by them but things of mighty moment when he was at an immeasurable distance
There were many many blessings that he had inadequately felt there were many trivial injuries that he had not forgiven there was love that he had but poorly returned there was friendship that he had too lightly prized there were a million kind words that he might have spoken a million kind looks that he might have given uncountable slight easy deeds in which he might have been most truly great and good
O for a day he would exclaim for but one day to make amends
But the sun never shone upon that happy day and out of his remote captivity he never came
Why does this travellers fate obscure on New Years Eve the other histories of travellers with which my mind was filled but now and cast a solemn shadow over me
Must I one day make his journey
Even so
Who shall say that I may not then be tortured by such late regrets that I may not then look from my exile on my empty place and undone work
I stand upon a seashore where the waves are years
They break and fall and I may little heed them but with every wave the sea is rising and I know that it will float me on this travellers voyage at last
THE BEGGINGLETTER WRITER THE amount of money he annually diverts from wholesome and useful purposes in the United Kingdom would be a setoff against the Window Tax
He is one of the most shameless frauds and impositions of this time
In his idleness his mendacity and the immeasurable harm he does to the deserving  dirtying the stream of true benevolence and muddling the brains of foolish justices with inability to distinguish between the base coin of distress and the true currency we have always among us  he is more worthy of Norfolk Island than threefourths of the worst characters who are sent there
Under any rational system he would have been sent there long ago
I the writer of this paper have been for some time a chosen receiver of Begging Letters
For fourteen years my house has been made as regular a Receiving House for such communications as any one of the great branch PostOffices is for general correspondence
I ought to know something of the BeggingLetter Writer
He has besieged my door at all hours of the day and night he has fought my servant he has lain in ambush for me going out and coming in he has followed me out of town into the country he has appeared at provincial hotels where I have been staying for only a few hours he has written to me from immense distances when I have been out of England
He has fallen sick he has died and been buried he has come to life again and again departed from this transitory scene he has been his own son his own mother his own baby his idiot brother his uncle his aunt his aged grandfather
He has wanted a greatcoat to go to India in a pound to set him up in life for ever a pair of boots to take him to the coast of China a hat to get him into a permanent situation under Government
He has frequently been exactly sevenandsixpence short of independence
He has had such openings at Liverpool  posts of great trust and confidence in merchants houses which nothing but sevenand sixpence was wanting to him to secure  that I wonder he is not Mayor of that flourishing town at the present moment
The natural phenomena of which he has been the victim are of a most astounding nature
He has had two children who have never grown up who have never had anything to cover them at night who have been continually driving him mad by asking in vain for food who have never come out of fevers and measles which I suppose has accounted for his fuming his letters with tobacco smoke as a disinfectant who have never changed in the least degree through fourteen long revolving years
As to his wife what that suffering woman has undergone nobody knows
She has always been in an interesting situation through the same long period and has never been confined yet
His devotion to her has been unceasing
He has never cared for himself HE could have perished  he would rather in short  but was it not his Christian duty as a man a husband and a father  to write begging letters when he looked at her
He has usually remarked that he would call in the evening for an answer to this question
He has been the sport of the strangest misfortunes
What his brother has done to him would have broken anybody elses heart
His brother went into business with him and ran away with the money his brother got him to be security for an immense sum and left him to pay it his brother would have given him employment to the tune of hundreds ayear if he would have consented to write letters on a Sunday his brother enunciated principles incompatible with his religious views and he could not in consequence permit his brother to provide for him
His landlord has never shown a spark of human feeling
When he put in that execution I dont know but he has never taken it out
The brokers man has grown grey in possession
They will have to bury him some day
He has been attached to every conceivable pursuit
He has been in the army in the navy in the church in the law connected with the press the fine arts public institutions every description and grade of business
He has been brought up as a gentleman he has been at every college in Oxford and Cambridge he can quote Latin in his letters but generally misspells some minor English word he can tell you what Shakespeare says about begging better than you know it
It is to be observed that in the midst of his afflictions he always reads the newspapers and rounds off his appeal with some allusion that may be supposed to be in my way to the popular subject of the hour
His life presents a series of inconsistencies
Sometimes he has never written such a letter before
He blushes with shame
That is the first time that shall be the last
Dont answer it and let it be understood that then he will kill himself quietly
Sometimes and more frequently he HAS written a few such letters
Then he encloses the answers with an intimation that they are of inestimable value to him and a request that they may be carefully returned
He is fond of enclosing something  verses letters pawnbrokers duplicates anything to necessitate an answer
He is very severe upon the pampered minion of fortune who refused him the halfsovereign referred to in the enclosure number two  but he knows me better
He writes in a variety of styles sometimes in low spirits sometimes quite jocosely
When he is in low spirits he writes downhill and repeats words  these little indications being expressive of the perturbation of his mind
When he is more vivacious he is frank with me he is quite the agreeable rattle
I know what human nature is  who better
Well
He had a little money once and he ran through it  as many men have done before him
He finds his old friends turn away from him now  many men have done that before him too
Shall he tell me why he writes to me
Because he has no kind of claim upon me
He puts it on that ground plainly and begs to ask for the loan as I know human nature of two sovereigns to be repaid next Tuesday six weeks before twelve at noon
Sometimes when he is sure that I have found him out and that there is no chance of money he writes to inform me that I have got rid of him at last
He has enlisted into the Companys service and is off directly  but he wants a cheese
He is informed by the serjeant that it is essential to his prospects in the regiment that he should take out a single Gloucester cheese weighing from twelve to fifteen pounds
Eight or nine shillings would buy it
He does not ask for money after what has passed but if he calls at nine tomorrow morning may he hope to find a cheese
And is there anything he can do to show his gratitude in Bengal
Once he wrote me rather a special letter proposing relief in kind
He had got into a little trouble by leaving parcels of mud done up in brown paper at peoples houses on pretence of being a Railway Porter in which character he received carriage money
This sportive fancy he expiated in the House of Correction
Not long after his release and on a Sunday morning he called with a letter having first dusted himself all over in which he gave me to understand that being resolved to earn an honest livelihood he had been travelling about the country with a cart of crockery
That he had been doing pretty well until the day before when his horse had dropped down dead near Chatham in Kent
That this had reduced him to the unpleasant necessity of getting into the shafts himself and drawing the cart of crockery to London  a somewhat exhausting pull of thirty miles
That he did not venture to ask again for money but that if I would have the goodness TO LEAVE HIM OUT A DONKEY he would call for the animal before breakfast
At another time my friend I am describing actual experiences introduced himself as a literary gentleman in the last extremity of distress
He had had a play accepted at a certain Theatre  which was really open its representation was delayed by the indisposition of a leading actor  who was really ill and he and his were in a state of absolute starvation
If he made his necessities known to the Manager of the Theatre he put it to me to say what kind of treatment he might expect
Well
we got over that difficulty to our mutual satisfaction
A little while afterwards he was in some other strait
I think Mrs Southcote his wife was in extremity  and we adjusted that point too
A little while afterwards he had taken a new house and was going headlong to ruin for want of a waterbutt
I had my misgivings about the water butt and did not reply to that epistle
But a little while afterwards I had reason to feel penitent for my neglect
He wrote me a few brokenhearted lines informing me that the dear partner of his sorrows died in his arms last night at nine oclock
I despatched a trusty messenger to comfort the bereaved mourner and his poor children but the messenger went so soon that the play was not ready to be played out my friend was not at home and his wife was in a most delightful state of health
He was taken up by the Mendicity Society informally it afterwards appeared and I presented myself at a London PoliceOffice with my testimony against him
The Magistrate was wonderfully struck by his educational acquirements deeply impressed by the excellence of his letters exceedingly sorry to see a man of his attainments there complimented him highly on his powers of composition and was quite charmed to have the agreeable duty of discharging him
A collection was made for the poor fellow as he was called in the reports and I left the court with a comfortable sense of being universally regarded as a sort of monster
Next day comes to me a friend of mine the governor of a large prison
Why did you ever go to the PoliceOffice against that man says he without coming to me first
I know all about him and his frauds
He lodged in the house of one of my warders at the very time when he first wrote to you and then he was eating springlamb at eighteenpence a pound and early asparagus at I dont know how much a bundle
On that very same day and in that very same hour my injured gentleman wrote a solemn address to me demanding to know what compensation I proposed to make him for his having passed the night in a loathsome dungeon
And next morning an Irish gentleman a member of the same fraternity who had read the case and was very well persuaded I should be chary of going to that PoliceOffice again positively refused to leave my door for less than a sovereign and resolved to besiege me into compliance literally sat down before it for ten mortal hours
The garrison being well provisioned I remained within the walls and he raised the siege at midnight with a prodigious alarum on the bell
The BeggingLetter Writer often has an extensive circle of acquaintance
Whole pages of the Court Guide are ready to be references for him
Noblemen and gentlemen write to say there never was such a man for probity and virtue
They have known him time out of mind and there is nothing they wouldnt do for him
Somehow they dont give him that one pound ten he stands in need of but perhaps it is not enough  they want to do more and his modesty will not allow it
It is to be remarked of his trade that it is a very fascinating one
He never leaves it and those who are near to him become smitten with a love of it too and sooner or later set up for themselves
He employs a messenger  man woman or child
That messenger is certain ultimately to become an independent BeggingLetter Writer
His sons and daughters succeed to his calling and write beggingletters when he is no more
He throws off the infection of beggingletter writing like the contagion of disease
What Sydney Smith so happily called the dangerous luxury of dishonesty is more tempting and more catching it would seem in this instance than in any other
He always belongs to a CorrespondingSociety of BeggingLetter Writers
Any one who will may ascertain this fact
Give money today in recognition of a beggingletter  no matter how unlike a common beggingletter  and for the next fortnight you will have a rush of such communications
Steadily refuse to give and the beggingletters become Angels visits until the Society is from some cause or other in a dull way of business and may as well try you as anybody else
It is of little use inquiring into the BeggingLetter Writers circumstances
He may be sometimes accidentally found out as in the case already mentioned though that was not the first inquiry made but apparent misery is always a part of his trade and real misery very often is in the intervals of springlamb and early asparagus
It is naturally an incident of his dissipated and dishonest life
That the calling is a successful one and that large sums of money are gained by it must be evident to anybody who reads the Police Reports of such cases
But prosecutions are of rare occurrence relatively to the extent to which the trade is carried on
The cause of this is to be found as no one knows better than the BeggingLetter Writer for it is a part of his speculation in the aversion people feel to exhibit themselves as having been imposed upon or as having weakly gratified their consciences with a lazy flimsy substitute for the noblest of all virtues
There is a man at large at the moment when this paper is preparing for the press on the 29th of April 1850 and never once taken up yet who within these twelvemonths has been probably the most audacious and the most successful swindler that even this trade has ever known
There has been something singularly base in this fellows proceedings it has been his business to write to all sorts and conditions of people in the names of persons of high reputation and unblemished honour professing to be in distress  the general admiration and respect for whom has ensured a ready and generous reply
Now in the hope that the results of the real experience of a real person may do something more to induce reflection on this subject than any abstract treatise  and with a personal knowledge of the extent to which the BeggingLetter Trade has been carried on for some time and has been for some time constantly increasing  the writer of this paper entreats the attention of his readers to a few concluding words
His experience is a type of the experience of many some on a smaller some on an infinitely larger scale
All may judge of the soundness or unsoundness of his conclusions from it
Long doubtful of the efficacy of such assistance in any case whatever and able to recall but one within his whole individual knowledge in which he had the least afterreason to suppose that any good was done by it he was led last autumn into some serious considerations
The beggingletters flying about by every post made it perfectly manifest that a set of lazy vagabonds were interposed between the general desire to do something to relieve the sickness and misery under which the poor were suffering and the suffering poor themselves
That many who sought to do some little to repair the social wrongs inflicted in the way of preventible sickness and death upon the poor were strengthening those wrongs however innocently by wasting money on pestilent knaves cumbering society
That imagination  soberly following one of these knaves into his life of punishment in jail and comparing it with the life of one of these poor in a cholera stricken alley or one of the children of one of these poor soothed in its dying hour by the late lamented Mr Drouet  contemplated a grim farce impossible to be presented very much longer before God or man
That the crowning miracle of all the miracles summed up in the New Testament after the miracle of the blind seeing and the lame walking and the restoration of the dead to life was the miracle that the poor had the Gospel preached to them
That while the poor were unnaturally and unnecessarily cut off by the thousand in the prematurity of their age or in the rottenness of their youth  for of flower or blossom such youth has none  the Gospel was NOT preached to them saving in hollow and unmeaning voices
That of all wrongs this was the first mighty wrong the Pestilence warned us to set right
And that no Post Office Order to any amount given to a BeggingLetter Writer for the quieting of an uneasy breast would be presentable on the Last Great Day as anything towards it
The poor never write these letters
Nothing could be more unlike their habits
The writers are public robbers and we who support them are parties to their depredations
They trade upon every circumstance within their knowledge that affects us public or private joyful or sorrowful they pervert the lessons of our lives they change what ought to be our strength and virtue into weakness and encouragement of vice
There is a plain remedy and it is in our own hands
We must resolve at any sacrifice of feeling to be deaf to such appeals and crush the trade
There are degrees in murder
Life must be held sacred among us in more ways than one  sacred not merely from the murderous weapon or the subtle poison or the cruel blow but sacred from preventible diseases distortions and pains
That is the first great end we have to set against this miserable imposition
Physical life respected moral life comes next
What will not content a BeggingLetter Writer for a week would educate a score of children for a year
Let us give all we can let us give more than ever
Let us do all we can let us do more than ever
But let us give and do with a high purpose not to endow the scum of the earth to its own greater corruption with the offals of our duty
A CHILDS DREAM OF A STAR THERE was once a child and he strolled about a good deal and thought of a number of things
He had a sister who was a child too and his constant companion
These two used to wonder all day long
They wondered at the beauty of the flowers they wondered at the height and blueness of the sky they wondered at the depth of the bright water they wondered at the goodness and the power of GOD who made the lovely world
They used to say to one another sometimes Supposing all the children upon earth were to die would the flowers and the water and the sky be sorry
They believed they would be sorry
For said they the buds are the children of the flowers and the little playful streams that gambol down the hillsides are the children of the water and the smallest bright specks playing at hide and seek in the sky all night must surely be the children of the stars and they would all be grieved to see their playmates the children of men no more
There was one clear shining star that used to come out in the sky before the rest near the church spire above the graves
It was larger and more beautiful they thought than all the others and every night they watched for it standing hand in hand at a window
Whoever saw it first cried out I see the star
And often they cried out both together knowing so well when it would rise and where
So they grew to be such friends with it that before lying down in their beds they always looked out once again to bid it good night and when they were turning round to sleep they used to say God bless the star
But while she was still very young oh very very young the sister drooped and came to be so weak that she could no longer stand in the window at night and then the child looked sadly out by himself and when he saw the star turned round and said to the patient pale face on the bed I see the star
and then a smile would come upon the face and a little weak voice used to say God bless my brother and the star
And so the time came all too soon
when the child looked out alone and when there was no face on the bed and when there was a little grave among the graves not there before and when the star made long rays down towards him as he saw it through his tears
Now these rays were so bright and they seemed to make such a shining way from earth to Heaven that when the child went to his solitary bed he dreamed about the star and dreamed that lying where he was he saw a train of people taken up that sparkling road by angels
And the star opening showed him a great world of light where many more such angels waited to receive them
All these angels who were waiting turned their beaming eyes upon the people who were carried up into the star and some came out from the long rows in which they stood and fell upon the peoples necks and kissed them tenderly and went away with them down avenues of light and were so happy in their company that lying in his bed he wept for joy
But there were many angels who did not go with them and among them one he knew
The patient face that once had lain upon the bed was glorified and radiant but his heart found out his sister among all the host
His sisters angel lingered near the entrance of the star and said to the leader among those who had brought the people thither Is my brother come
And he said No
She was turning hopefully away when the child stretched out his arms and cried O sister I am here
Take me
and then she turned her beaming eyes upon him and it was night and the star was shining into the room making long rays down towards him as he saw it through his tears
From that hour forth the child looked out upon the star as on the home he was to go to when his time should come and he thought that he did not belong to the earth alone but to the star too because of his sisters angel gone before
There was a baby born to be a brother to the child and while he was so little that he never yet had spoken word he stretched his tiny form out on his bed and died
Again the child dreamed of the open star and of the company of angels and the train of people and the rows of angels with their beaming eyes all turned upon those peoples faces
Said his sisters angel to the leader Is my brother come
And he said Not that one but another
As the child beheld his brothers angel in her arms he cried O sister I am here
Take me
And she turned and smiled upon him and the star was shining
He grew to be a young man and was busy at his books when an old servant came to him and said Thy mother is no more
I bring her blessing on her darling son
Again at night he saw the star and all that former company
Said his sisters angel to the leader
Is my brother come
And he said Thy mother
A mighty cry of joy went forth through all the star because the mother was reunited to her two children
And he stretched out his arms and cried O mother sister and brother I am here
Take me
And they answered him Not yet and the star was shining
He grew to be a man whose hair was turning grey and he was sitting in his chair by the fireside heavy with grief and with his face bedewed with tears when the star opened once again
Said his sisters angel to the leader Is my brother come
And he said Nay but his maiden daughter
And the man who had been the child saw his daughter newly lost to him a celestial creature among those three and he said My daughters head is on my sisters bosom and her arm is around my mothers neck and at her feet there is the baby of old time and I can bear the parting from her GOD be praised
And the star was shining
Thus the child came to be an old man and his once smooth face was wrinkled and his steps were slow and feeble and his back was bent
And one night as he lay upon his bed his children standing round he cried as he had cried so long ago I see the star
They whispered one another He is dying
And he said I am
My age is falling from me like a garment and I move towards the star as a child
And O my Father now I thank thee that it has so often opened to receive those dear ones who await me
And the star was shining and it shines upon his grave
OUR ENGLISH WATERINGPLACE IN the Autumntime of the year when the great metropolis is so much hotter so much noisier so much more dusty or so much more watercarted so much more crowded so much more disturbing and distracting in all respects than it usually is a quiet seabeach becomes indeed a blessed spot
Half awake and half asleep this idle morning in our sunny window on the edge of a chalkcliff in the oldfashioned wateringplace to which we are a faithful resorter we feel a lazy inclination to sketch its picture
The place seems to respond
Sky sea beach and village lie as still before us as if they were sitting for the picture
It is dead lowwater
A ripple plays among the ripening corn upon the cliff as if it were faintly trying from recollection to imitate the sea and the world of butterflies hovering over the crop of radishseed are as restless in their little way as the gulls are in their larger manner when the wind blows
But the ocean lies winking in the sunlight like a drowsy lion  its glassy waters scarcely curve upon the shore  the fishingboats in the tiny harbour are all stranded in the mud  our two colliers our wateringplace has a maritime trade employing that amount of shipping have not an inch of water within a quarter of a mile of them and turn exhausted on their sides like faint fish of an antediluvian species
Rusty cables and chains ropes and rings undermost parts of posts and piles and confused timberdefences against the waves lie strewn about in a brown litter of tangled seaweed and fallen cliff which looks as if a family of giants had been making tea here for ages and had observed an untidy custom of throwing their tealeaves on the shore
In truth our wateringplace itself has been left somewhat high and dry by the tide of years
Concerned as we are for its honour we must reluctantly admit that the time when this pretty little semicircular sweep of houses tapering off at the end of the wooden pier into a point in the sea was a gay place and when the lighthouse overlooking it shone at daybreak on company dispersing from public balls is but dimly traditional now
There is a bleak chamber in our wateringplace which is yet called the Assembly Rooms and understood to be available on hire for balls or concerts and some few seasons since an ancient little gentleman came down and stayed at the hotel who said that he had danced there in bygone ages with the Honourable Miss Peepy well known to have been the Beauty of her day and the cruel occasion of innumerable duels
But he was so old and shrivelled and so very rheumatic in the legs that it demanded more imagination than our wateringplace can usually muster to believe him therefore except the Master of the Rooms who to this hour wears knee breeches and who confirmed the statement with tears in his eyes nobody did believe in the little lame old gentleman or even in the Honourable Miss Peepy long deceased
As to subscription balls in the Assembly Rooms of our watering place now redhot cannon balls are less improbable
Sometimes a misguided wanderer of a Ventriloquist or an Infant Phenomenon or a juggler or somebody with an Orrery that is several stars behind the time takes the place for a night and issues bills with the name of his last town lined out and the name of ours ignominiously written in but you may be sure this never happens twice to the same unfortunate person
On such occasions the discoloured old Billiard Table that is seldom played at unless the ghost of the Honourable Miss Peepy plays at pool with other ghosts is pushed into a corner and benches are solemnly constituted into front seats back seats and reserved seats  which are much the same after you have paid  and a few dull candles are lighted  wind permitting  and the performer and the scanty audience play out a short match which shall make the other most lowspirited  which is usually a drawn game
After that the performer instantly departs with maledictory expressions and is never heard of more
But the most wonderful feature of our Assembly Rooms is that an annual sale of Fancy and other China is announced here with mysterious constancy and perseverance
Where the china comes from where it goes to why it is annually put up to auction when nobody ever thinks of bidding for it how it comes to pass that it is always the same china whether it would not have been cheaper with the sea at hand to have thrown it away say in eighteen hundred and thirty are standing enigmas
Every year the bills come out every year the Master of the Rooms gets into a little pulpit on a table and offers it for sale every year nobody buys it every year it is put away somewhere till next year when it appears again as if the whole thing were a new idea
We have a faint remembrance of an unearthly collection of clocks purporting to be the work of Parisian and Genevese artists  chiefly biliousfaced clocks supported on sickly white crutches with their pendulums dangling like lame legs  to which a similar course of events occurred for several years until they seemed to lapse away of mere imbecility
Attached to our Assembly Rooms is a library
There is a wheel of fortune in it but it is rusty and dusty and never turns
A large doll with moveable eyes was put up to be raffled for by five andtwenty members at two shillings seven years ago this autumn and the list is not full yet
We are rather sanguine now that the raffle will come off next year
We think so because we only want nine members and should only want eight but for number two having grown up since her name was entered and withdrawn it when she was married
Down the street there is a toyship of considerable burden in the same condition
Two of the boys who were entered for that raffle have gone to India in real ships since and one was shot and died in the arms of his sisters lover by whom he sent his last words home
This is the library for the Minerva Press
If you want that kind of reading come to our wateringplace
The leaves of the romances reduced to a condition very like curlpaper are thickly studded with notes in pencil sometimes complimentary sometimes jocose
Some of these commentators like commentators in a more extensive way quarrel with one another
One young gentleman who sarcastically writes O
after every sentimental passage is pursued through his literary career by another who writes Insulting Beast
Miss Julia Mills has read the whole collection of these books
She has left marginal notes on the pages as Is not this truly touching
J M How thrilling
J M Entranced here by the Magicians potent spell
J M She has also italicised her favourite traits in the description of the hero as his hair which was DARK and WAVY clustered in RICH PROFUSION around a MARBLE BROW whose lofty paleness bespoke the intellect within
It reminds her of another hero
She adds How like B L Can this be mere coincidence
J M You would hardly guess which is the main street of our watering place but you may know it by its being always stopped up with donkeychaises
Whenever you come here and see harnessed donkeys eating clover out of barrows drawn completely across a narrow thoroughfare you may be quite sure you are in our High Street
Our Police you may know by his uniform likewise by his never on any account interfering with anybody  especially the tramps and vagabonds
In our fancy shops we have a capital collection of damaged goods among which the flies of countless summers have been roaming
We are great in obsolete seals and in faded pin cushions and in rickety campstools and in exploded cutlery and in miniature vessels and in stunted little telescopes and in objects made of shells that pretend not to be shells
Diminutive spades barrows and baskets are our principal articles of commerce but even they dont look quite new somehow
They always seem to have been offered and refused somewhere else before they came down to our wateringplace
Yet it must not be supposed that our wateringplace is an empty place deserted by all visitors except a few staunch persons of approved fidelity
On the contrary the chances are that if you came down here in August or September you wouldnt find a house to lay your head in
As to finding either house or lodging of which you could reduce the terms you could scarcely engage in a more hopeless pursuit
For all this you are to observe that every season is the worst season ever known and that the householding population of our wateringplace are ruined regularly every autumn
They are like the farmers in regard that it is surprising how much ruin they will bear
We have an excellent hotel  capital baths warm cold and shower  firstrate bathingmachines  and as good butchers bakers and grocers as heart could desire
They all do business it is to be presumed from motives of philanthropy  but it is quite certain that they are all being ruined
Their interest in strangers and their politeness under ruin bespeak their amiable nature
You would say so if you only saw the baker helping a new comer to find suitable apartments
So far from being at a discount as to company we are in fact what would be popularly called rather a nobby place
Some tiptop Nobbs come down occasionally  even Dukes and Duchesses
We have known such carriages to blaze among the donkeychaises as made beholders wink
Attendant on these equipages come resplendent creatures in plush and powder who are sure to be stricken disgusted with the indifferent accommodation of our wateringplace and who of an evening particularly when it rains may be seen very much out of drawing in rooms far too small for their fine figures looking discontentedly out of little back windows into byestreets
The lords and ladies get on well enough and quite goodhumouredly but if you want to see the gorgeous phenomena who wait upon them at a perfect nonplus you should come and look at the resplendent creatures with little back parlours for servants halls and turnup bedsteads to sleep in at our wateringplace
You have no idea how they take it to heart
We have a pier  a queer old wooden pier fortunately without the slightest pretensions to architecture and very picturesque in consequence
Boats are hauled up upon it ropes are coiled all over it lobsterpots nets masts oars spars sails ballast and rickety capstans make a perfect labyrinth of it
For ever hovering about this pier with their hands in their pockets or leaning over the rough bulwark it opposes to the sea gazing through telescopes which they carry about in the same profound receptacles are the Boatmen of our wateringplace
Looking at them you would say that surely these must be the laziest boatmen in the world
They lounge about in obstinate and inflexible pantaloons that are apparently made of wood the whole season through
Whether talking together about the shipping in the Channel or gruffly unbending over mugs of beer at the public house you would consider them the slowest of men
The chances are a thousand to one that you might stay here for ten seasons and never see a boatman in a hurry
A certain expression about his loose hands when they are not in his pockets as if he were carrying a considerable lump of iron in each without any inconvenience suggests strength but he never seems to use it
He has the appearance of perpetually strolling  running is too inappropriate a word to be thought of  to seed
The only subject on which he seems to feel any approach to enthusiasm is pitch
He pitches everything he can lay hold of  the pier the palings his boat his house  when there is nothing else left he turns to and even pitches his hat or his roughweather clothing
Do not judge him by deceitful appearances
These are among the bravest and most skilful mariners that exist
Let a gale arise and swell into a storm let a sea run that might appal the stoutest heart that ever beat let the Lightboat on these dangerous sands throw up a rocket in the night or let them hear through the angry roar the signal guns of a ship in distress and these men spring up into activity so dauntless so valiant and heroic that the world cannot surpass it
Cavillers may object that they chiefly live upon the salvage of valuable cargoes
So they do and God knows it is no great living that they get out of the deadly risks they run
But put that hope of gain aside
Let these rough fellows be asked in any storm who volunteers for the lifeboat to save some perishing souls as poor and emptyhanded as themselves whose lives the perfection of human reason does not rate at the value of a farthing each and that boat will be manned as surely and as cheerfully as if a thousand pounds were told down on the weatherbeaten pier
For this and for the recollection of their comrades whom we have known whom the raging sea has engulfed before their childrens eyes in such brave efforts whom the secret sand has buried we hold the boatmen of our wateringplace in our love and honour and are tender of the fame they well deserve
So many children are brought down to our wateringplace that when they are not out of doors as they usually are in fine weather it is wonderful where they are put the whole village seeming much too small to hold them under cover
In the afternoons you see no end of salt and sandy little boots drying on upper windowsills
At bathingtime in the morning the little bay reechoes with every shrill variety of shriek and splash  after which if the weather be at all fresh the sands teem with small blue mottled legs
The sands are the childrens great resort
They cluster there like ants so busy burying their particular friends and making castles with infinite labour which the next tide overthrows that it is curious to consider how their play to the music of the sea foreshadows the realities of their after lives
It is curious too to observe a natural ease of approach that there seems to be between the children and the boatmen
They mutually make acquaintance and take individual likings without any help
You will come upon one of those slow heavy fellows sitting down patiently mending a little ship for a mite of a boy whom he could crush to death by throwing his lightest pair of trousers on him
You will be sensible of the oddest contrast between the smooth little creature and the rough man who seems to be carved out of hardgrained wood  between the delicate hand expectantly held out and the immense thumb and finger that can hardly feel the rigging of thread they mend  between the small voice and the gruff growl  and yet there is a natural propriety in the companionship always to be noted in confidence between a child and a person who has any merit of reality and genuineness which is admirably pleasant
We have a preventive station at our wateringplace and much the same thing may be observed  in a lesser degree because of their official character  of the coast blockade a steady trusty well conditioned wellconducted set of men with no misgiving about looking you full in the face and with a quiet thoroughgoing way of passing along to their duty at night carrying huge souwester clothing in reserve that is fraught with all good prepossession
They are handy fellows  neat about their houses  industrious at gardening  would get on with their wives one thinks in a desert island  and people it too soon
As to the naval officer of the station with his hearty fresh face and his blue eye that has pierced all kinds of weather it warms our hearts when he comes into church on a Sunday with that bright mixture of blue coat buff waistcoat black neckkerchief and gold epaulette that is associated in the minds of all Englishmen with brave unpretending cordial national service
We like to look at him in his Sunday state and if we were First Lord really possessing the indispensable qualification for the office of knowing nothing whatever about the sea we would give him a ship tomorrow
We have a church bytheby of course  a hideous temple of flint like a great petrified haystack
Our chief clerical dignitary who to his honour has done much for education both in time and money and has established excellent schools is a sound shrewd healthy gentleman who has got into little occasional difficulties with the neighbouring farmers but has had a pestilent trick of being right
Under a new regulation he has yielded the church of our wateringplace to another clergyman
Upon the whole we get on in church well
We are a little bilious sometimes about these days of fraternisation and about nations arriving at a new and more unprejudiced knowledge of each other which our Christianity dont quite approve but it soon goes off and then we get on very well
There are two dissenting chapels besides in our small watering place being in about the proportion of a hundred and twenty guns to a yacht
But the dissension that has torn us lately has not been a religious one
It has arisen on the novel question of Gas
Our wateringplace has been convulsed by the agitation Gas or No Gas
It was never reasoned why No Gas but there was a great No Gas party
Broadsides were printed and stuck about  a startling circumstance in our wateringplace
The No Gas party rested content with chalking No Gas
and Down with Gas
and other such angry warwhoops on the few back gates and scraps of wall which the limits of our wateringplace afford but the Gas party printed and posted bills wherein they took the high ground of proclaiming against the No Gas party that it was said Let there be light and there was light and that not to have light that is gaslight in our wateringplace was to contravene the great decree
Whether by these thunderbolts or not the No Gas party were defeated and in this present season we have had our handful of shops illuminated for the first time
Such of the No Gas party however as have got shops remain in opposition and burn tallow  exhibiting in their windows the very picture of the sulkiness that punishes itself and a new illustration of the old adage about cutting off your nose to be revenged on your face in cutting off their gas to be revenged on their business
Other population than we have indicated our wateringplace has none
There are a few old usedup boatmen who creep about in the sunlight with the help of sticks and there is a poor imbecile shoemaker who wanders his lonely life away among the rocks as if he were looking for his reason  which he will never find
Sojourners in neighbouring wateringplaces come occasionally in flys to stare at us and drive away again as if they thought us very dull Italian boys come Punch comes the Fantoccini come the Tumblers come the Ethiopians come Gleesingers come at night and hum and vibrate not always melodiously under our windows
But they all go soon and leave us to ourselves again
We once had a travelling Circus and Wombwells Menagerie at the same time
They both know better than ever to try it again and the Menagerie had nearly razed us from the face of the earth in getting the elephant away  his caravan was so large and the wateringplace so small
We have a fine sea wholesome for all people profitable for the body profitable for the mind
The poets words are sometimes on its awful lips And the stately ships go on To their haven under the hill But O for the touch of a vanishd hand
And the sound of a voice that is still
Break break break At the foot of thy crags O sea
But the tender grace of a day that is dead Will never come back to me
Yet it is not always so for the speech of the sea is various and wants not abundant resource of cheerfulness hope and lusty encouragement
And since I have been idling at the window here the tide has risen
The boats are dancing on the bubbling water the colliers are afloat again the whitebordered waves rush in the children Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back the radiant sails are gliding past the shore and shining on the far horizon all the sea is sparkling heaving swelling up with life and beauty this bright morning
OUR FRENCH WATERINGPLACE HAVING earned by many years of fidelity the right to be sometimes inconstant to our English wateringplace we have dallied for two or three seasons with a French wateringplace once solely known to us as a town with a very long street beginning with an abattoir and ending with a steamboat which it seemed our fate to behold only at daybreak on winter mornings when in the days before continental railroads just sufficiently awake to know that we were most uncomfortably asleep it was our destiny always to clatter through it in the coupe of the diligence from Paris with a sea of mud behind us and a sea of tumbling waves before
In relation to which latter monster our minds eye now recalls a worthy Frenchman in a sealskin cap with a braided hood over it once our travelling companion in the coupe aforesaid who waking up with a pale and crumpled visage and looking ruefully out at the grim row of breakers enjoying themselves fanatically on an instrument of torture called the Bar inquired of us whether we were ever sick at sea
Both to prepare his mind for the abject creature we were presently to become and also to afford him consolation we replied Sir your servant is always sick when it is possible to be so
He returned altogether uncheered by the bright example Ah Heaven but I am always sick even when it is IMpossible to be so
The means of communication between the French capital and our French wateringplace are wholly changed since those days but the Channel remains unbridged as yet and the old floundering and knocking about go on there
It must be confessed that saving in reasonable and therefore rare seaweather the act of arrival at our French wateringplace from England is difficult to be achieved with dignity
Several little circumstances combine to render the visitor an object of humiliation
In the first place the steamer no sooner touches the port than all the passengers fall into captivity being boarded by an overpowering force of Customhouse officers and marched into a gloomy dungeon
In the second place the road to this dungeon is fenced off with ropes breasthigh and outside those ropes all the English in the place who have lately been seasick and are now well assemble in their best clothes to enjoy the degradation of their dilapidated fellowcreatures
Oh my gracious
how ill this one has been
Heres a damp one coming next
HERES a pale one
Oh
Aint he green in the face this next one
Even we ourself not deficient in natural dignity have a lively remembrance of staggering up this detested lane one September day in a gale of wind when we were received like an irresistible comic actor with a burst of laughter and applause occasioned by the extreme imbecility of our legs
We were coming to the third place
In the third place the captives being shut up in the gloomy dungeon are strained two or three at a time into an inner cell to be examined as to passports and across the doorway of communication stands a military creature making a bar of his arm
Two ideas are generally present to the British mind during these ceremonies first that it is necessary to make for the cell with violent struggles as if it were a lifeboat and the dungeon a ship going down secondly that the military creatures arm is a national affront which the government at home ought instantly to take up
The British mind and body becoming heated by these fantasies delirious answers are made to inquiries and extravagant actions performed
Thus Johnson persists in giving Johnson as his baptismal name and substituting for his ancestral designation the national Dam
Neither can he by any means be brought to recognise the distinction between a portmanteaukey and a passport but will obstinately persevere in tendering the one when asked for the other
This brings him to the fourth place in a state of mere idiotcy and when he is in the fourth place cast out at a little door into a howling wilderness of touters he becomes a lunatic with wild eyes and floating hair until rescued and soothed
If friendless and unrescued he is generally put into a railway omnibus and taken to Paris
But our French wateringplace when it is once got into is a very enjoyable place
It has a varied and beautiful country around it and many characteristic and agreeable things within it
To be sure it might have fewer bad smells and less decaying refuse and it might be better drained and much cleaner in many parts and therefore infinitely more healthy
Still it is a bright airy pleasant cheerful town and if you were to walk down either of its three wellpaved main streets towards five oclock in the afternoon when delicate odours of cookery fill the air and its hotel windows it is full of hotels give glimpses of long tables set out for dinner and made to look sumptuous by the aid of napkins folded fanwise you would rightly judge it to be an uncommonly good town to eat and drink in
We have an old walled town rich in cool public wells of water on the top of a hill within and above the present businesstown and if it were some hundreds of miles further from England instead of being on a clear day within sight of the grass growing in the crevices of the chalkcliffs of Dover you would long ago have been bored to death about that town
It is more picturesque and quaint than half the innocent places which tourists following their leader like sheep have made impostors of
To say nothing of its houses with grave courtyards its queer bycorners and its many windowed streets white and quiet in the sunlight there is an ancient belfry in it that would have been in all the Annuals and Albums going and gone these hundred years if it had but been more expensive to get at
Happily it has escaped so well being only in our French wateringplace that you may like it of your own accord in a natural manner without being required to go into convulsions about it
We regard it as one of the later blessings of our life that BILKINS the only authority on Taste never took any notice that we can find out of our French wateringplace
Bilkins never wrote about it never pointed out anything to be seen in it never measured anything in it always left it alone
For which relief Heaven bless the town and the memory of the immortal Bilkins likewise
There is a charming walk arched and shaded by trees on the old walls that form the four sides of this High Town whence you get glimpses of the streets below and changing views of the other town and of the river and of the hills and of the sea
It is made more agreeable and peculiar by some of the solemn houses that are rooted in the deep streets below bursting into a fresher existence atop and having doors and windows and even gardens on these ramparts
A child going in at the courtyard gate of one of these houses climbing up the many stairs and coming out at the fourthfloor window might conceive himself another Jack alighting on enchanted ground from another beanstalk
It is a place wonderfully populous in children English children with governesses reading novels as they walk down the shady lanes of trees or nursemaids interchanging gossip on the seats French children with their smiling bonnes in snowwhite caps and themselves  if little boys  in straw headgear like beehives workbaskets and church hassocks
Three years ago there were three weazen old men one bearing a frayed red ribbon in his threadbare buttonhole always to be found walking together among these children before dinner time
If they walked for an appetite they doubtless lived en pension  were contracted for  otherwise their poverty would have made it a rash action
They were stooping bleareyed dull old men slipshod and shabby in longskirted shortwaisted coats and meagre trousers and yet with a ghost of gentility hovering in their company
They spoke little to each other and looked as if they might have been politically discontented if they had had vitality enough
Once we overheard redribbon feebly complain to the other two that somebody or something was a Robber and then they all three set their mouths so that they would have ground their teeth if they had had any
The ensuing winter gathered red ribbon unto the great company of faded ribbons and next year the remaining two were there  getting themselves entangled with hoops and dolls  familiar mysteries to the children  probably in the eyes of most of them harmless creatures who had never been like children and whom children could never be like
Another winter came and another old man went and so this present year the last of the triumvirate left off walking  it was no good now  and sat by himself on a little solitary bench with the hoops and the dolls as lively as ever all about him
In the Place dArmes of this town a little decayed market is held which seems to slip through the old gateway like water and go rippling down the hill to mingle with the murmuring market in the lower town and get lost in its movement and bustle
It is very agreeable on an idle summer morning to pursue this marketstream from the hilltop
It begins dozingly and dully with a few sacks of corn starts into a surprising collection of boots and shoes goes brawling down the hill in a diversified channel of old cordage old iron old crockery old clothes civil and military old rags new cotton goods flaming prints of saints little lookingglasses and incalculable lengths of tape dives into a backway keeping out of sight for a little while as streams will or only sparkling for a moment in the shape of a market drinking shop and suddenly reappears behind the great church shooting itself into a bright confusion of whitecapped women and blue bloused men poultry vegetables fruits flowers pots pans prayingchairs soldiers country butter umbrellas and other sun shades girlporters waiting to be hired with baskets at their backs and one weazen little old man in a cocked hat wearing a cuirass of drinkingglasses and carrying on his shoulder a crimson temple fluttering with flags like a glorified paviors rammer without the handle who rings a little bell in all parts of the scene and cries his cooling drink Hola Hola Hooo
in a shrill cracked voice that somehow makes itself heard above all the chaffering and vending hum
Early in the afternoon the whole course of the stream is dry
The prayingchairs are put back in the church the umbrellas are folded up the unsold goods are carried away the stalls and stands disappear the square is swept the hackney coaches lounge there to be hired and on all the country roads if you walk about as much as we do you will see the peasant women always neatly and comfortably dressed riding home with the pleasantest saddlefurniture of clean milkpails bright butterkegs and the like on the jolliest little donkeys in the world
We have another market in our French wateringplace  that is to say a few wooden hutches in the open street down by the Port  devoted to fish
Our fishingboats are famous everywhere and our fishing people though they love lively colours and taste is neutral see Bilkins are among the most picturesque people we ever encountered
They have not only a quarter of their own in the town itself but they occupy whole villages of their own on the neighbouring cliffs
Their churches and chapels are their own they consort with one another they intermarry among themselves their customs are their own and their costume is their own and never changes
As soon as one of their boys can walk he is provided with a long bright red nightcap and one of their men would as soon think of going afloat without his head as without that indispensable appendage to it
Then they wear the noblest boots with the hugest tops  flapping and bulging over anyhow above which they encase themselves in such wonderful overalls and petticoat trousers made to all appearance of tarry old sails so additionally stiffened with pitch and salt that the wearers have a walk of their own and go straddling and swinging about among the boats and barrels and nets and rigging a sight to see
Then their younger women by dint of going down to the sea barefoot to fling their baskets into the boats as they come in with the tide and bespeak the first fruits of the haul with propitiatory promises to love and marry that dear fisherman who shall fill that basket like an Angel have the finest legs ever carved by Nature in the brightest mahogany and they walk like Juno
Their eyes too are so lustrous that their long gold earrings turn dull beside those brilliant neighbours and when they are dressed what with these beauties and their fine fresh faces and their many petticoats  striped petticoats red petticoats blue petticoats always clean and smart and never too long  and their homemade stockings mulberrycoloured blue brown purple lilac  which the older women taking care of the Dutchlooking children sit in all sorts of places knitting knitting knitting from morning to night  and what with their little saucy bright blue jackets knitted too and fitting close to their handsome figures and what with the natural grace with which they wear the commonest cap or fold the commonest handkerchief round their luxuriant hair  we say in a word and out of breath that taking all these premises into our consideration it has never been a matter of the least surprise to us that we have never once met in the cornfields on the dusty roads by the breezy windmills on the plots of short sweet grass overhanging the sea  anywhere  a young fisherman and fisherwoman of our French wateringplace together but the arm of that fisherman has invariably been as a matter of course and without any absurd attempt to disguise so plain a necessity round the neck or waist of that fisherwoman
And we have had no doubt whatever standing looking at their uphill streets house rising above house and terrace above terrace and bright garments here and there lying sunning on rough stone parapets that the pleasant mist on all such objects caused by their being seen through the brown nets hung across on poles to dry is in the eyes of every true young fisherman a mist of love and beauty setting off the goddess of his heart
Moreover it is to be observed that these are an industrious people and a domestic people and an honest people
And though we are aware that at the bidding of Bilkins it is our duty to fall down and worship the Neapolitans we make bold very much to prefer the fishing people of our French wateringplace  especially since our last visit to Naples within these twelvemonths when we found only four conditions of men remaining in the whole city to wit lazzaroni priests spies and soldiers and all of them beggars the paternal government having banished all its subjects except the rascals
But we can never henceforth separate our French wateringplace from our own landlord of two summers M Loyal Devasseur citizen and towncouncillor
Permit us to have the pleasure of presenting M Loyal Devasseur
His own family name is simply Loyal but as he is married and as in that part of France a husband always adds to his own name the family name of his wife he writes himself Loyal Devasseur
He owns a compact little estate of some twenty or thirty acres on a lofty hillside and on it he has built two country houses which he lets furnished
They are by many degrees the best houses that are so let near our French wateringplace we have had the honour of living in both and can testify
The entrancehall of the first we inhabited was ornamented with a plan of the estate representing it as about twice the size of Ireland insomuch that when we were yet new to the property M Loyal always speaks of it as La propriete we went three miles straight on end in search of the bridge of Austerlitz  which we afterwards found to be immediately outside the window
The Chateau of the Old Guard in another part of the grounds and according to the plan about two leagues from the little diningroom we sought in vain for a week until happening one evening to sit upon a bench in the forest forest in the plan a few yards from the housedoor we observed at our feet in the ignominious circumstances of being upside down and greenly rotten the Old Guard himself that is to say the painted effigy of a member of that distinguished corps seven feet high and in the act of carrying arms who had had the misfortune to be blown down in the previous winter
It will be perceived that M Loyal is a staunch admirer of the great Napoleon
He is an old soldier himself  captain of the National Guard with a handsome gold vase on his chimneypiece presented to him by his company  and his respect for the memory of the illustrious general is enthusiastic
Medallions of him portraits of him busts of him pictures of him are thickly sprinkled all over the property
During the first month of our occupation it was our affliction to be constantly knocking down Napoleon if we touched a shelf in a dark corner he toppled over with a crash and every door we opened shook him to the soul
Yet M Loyal is not a man of mere castles in the air or as he would say in Spain
He has a specially practical contriving clever skilful eye and hand
His houses are delightful
He unites French elegance and English comfort in a happy manner quite his own
He has an extraordinary genius for making tasteful little bedrooms in angles of his roofs which an Englishman would as soon think of turning to any account as he would think of cultivating the Desert
We have ourself reposed deliciously in an elegant chamber of M Loyals construction with our head as nearly in the kitchen chimneypot as we can conceive it likely for the head of any gentleman not by profession a Sweep to be
And into whatsoever strange nook M Loyals genius penetrates it in that nook infallibly constructs a cupboard and a row of pegs
In either of our houses we could have put away the knapsacks and hung up the hats of the whole regiment of Guides
Aforetime M Loyal was a tradesman in the town
You can transact business with no present tradesman in the town and give your card chez M Loyal but a brighter face shines upon you directly
We doubt if there is ever was or ever will be a man so universally pleasant in the minds of people as M Loyal is in the minds of the citizens of our French wateringplace
They rub their hands and laugh when they speak of him
Ah but he is such a good child such a brave boy such a generous spirit that Monsieur Loyal
It is the honest truth
M Loyals nature is the nature of a gentleman
He cultivates his ground with his own hands assisted by one little labourer who falls into a fit now and then and he digs and delves from morn to eve in prodigious perspirations  works always as he says  but cover him with dust mud weeds water any stains you will you never can cover the gentleman in M Loyal
A portly upright broadshouldered brownfaced man whose soldierly bearing gives him the appearance of being taller than he is look into the bright eye of M Loyal standing before you in his workingblouse and cap not particularly well shaved and it may be very earthy and you shall discern in M Loyal a gentleman whose true politeness is ingrain and confirmation of whose word by his bond you would blush to think of
Not without reason is M Loyal when he tells that story in his own vivacious way of his travelling to Fulham near London to buy all these hundreds and hundreds of trees you now see upon the Property then a bare bleak hill and of his sojourning in Fulham three months and of his jovial evenings with the marketgardeners and of the crowning banquet before his departure when the marketgardeners rose as one man clinked their glasses all together as the custom at Fulham is and cried Vive Loyal
M Loyal has an agreeable wife but no family and he loves to drill the children of his tenants or run races with them or do anything with them or for them that is goodnatured
He is of a highly convivial temperament and his hospitality is unbounded
Billet a soldier on him and he is delighted
Fiveandthirty soldiers had M Loyal billeted on him this present summer and they all got fat and redfaced in two days
It became a legend among the troops that whosoever got billeted on M Loyal rolled in clover and so it fell out that the fortunate man who drew the billet M
Loyal Devasseur always leaped into the air though in heavy marching order
M Loyal cannot bear to admit anything that might seem by any implication to disparage the military profession
We hinted to him once that we were conscious of a remote doubt arising in our mind whether a sou a day for pocketmoney tobacco stockings drink washing and social pleasures in general left a very large margin for a soldiers enjoyment
Pardon
said Monsieur Loyal rather wincing
It was not a fortune but  a la bonne heure  it was better than it used to be
What we asked him on another occasion were all those neighbouring peasants each living with his family in one room and each having a soldier perhaps two billeted on him every other night required to provide for those soldiers
Faith
said M Loyal reluctantly a bed monsieur and fire to cook with and a candle
And they share their supper with those soldiers
It is not possible that they could eat alone
 And what allowance do they get for this
said we
Monsieur Loyal drew himself up taller took a step back laid his hand upon his breast and said with majesty as speaking for himself and all France Monsieur it is a contribution to the State
It is never going to rain according to M Loyal
When it is impossible to deny that it is now raining in torrents he says it will be fine  charming  magnificent  tomorrow
It is never hot on the Property he contends
Likewise it is never cold
The flowers he says come out delighting to grow there it is like Paradise this morning it is like the Garden of Eden
He is a little fanciful in his language smilingly observing of Madame Loyal when she is absent at vespers that she is gone to her salvation  allee a son salut
He has a great enjoyment of tobacco but nothing would induce him to continue smoking face to face with a lady
His short black pipe immediately goes into his breast pocket scorches his blouse and nearly sets him on fire
In the Town Council and on occasions of ceremony he appears in a full suit of black with a waistcoat of magnificent breadth across the chest and a shirtcollar of fabulous proportions
Good M Loyal
Under blouse or waistcoat he carries one of the gentlest hearts that beat in a nation teeming with gentle people
He has had losses and has been at his best under them
Not only the loss of his way by night in the Fulham times  when a bad subject of an Englishman under pretence of seeing him home took him into all the night publichouses drank arfanarf in every one at his expense and finally fled leaving him shipwrecked at Cleefeeway which we apprehend to be Ratcliffe Highway  but heavier losses than that
Long ago a family of children and a mother were left in one of his houses without money a whole year
M Loyal  anything but as rich as we wish he had been  had not the heart to say you must go so they stayed on and stayed on and payingtenants who would have come in couldnt come in and at last they managed to get helped home across the water and M Loyal kissed the whole group and said Adieu my poor infants
and sat down in their deserted salon and smoked his pipe of peace
 The rent M
Loyal
Eh
well
The rent
M Loyal shakes his head
Le bon Dieu says M Loyal presently will recompense me and he laughs and smokes his pipe of peace
May he smoke it on the Property and not be recompensed these fifty years
There are public amusements in our French wateringplace or it would not be French
They are very popular and very cheap
The seabathing  which may rank as the most favoured daylight entertainment inasmuch as the French visitors bathe all day long and seldom appear to think of remaining less than an hour at a time in the water  is astoundingly cheap
Omnibuses convey you if you please from a convenient part of the town to the beach and back again you have a clean and comfortable bathingmachine dress linen and all appliances and the charge for the whole is halfa franc or fivepence
On the pier there is usually a guitar which seems presumptuously enough to set its tinkling against the deep hoarseness of the sea and there is always some boy or woman who sings without any voice little songs without any tune the strain we have most frequently heard being an appeal to the sportsman not to bag that choicest of game the swallow
For bathing purposes we have also a subscription establishment with an esplanade where people lounge about with telescopes and seem to get a good deal of weariness for their money and we have also an association of individual machine proprietors combined against this formidable rival
M Feroce our own particular friend in the bathing line is one of these
How he ever came by his name we cannot imagine
He is as gentle and polite a man as M Loyal Devasseur himself immensely stout withal and of a beaming aspect
M Feroce has saved so many people from drowning and has been decorated with so many medals in consequence that his stoutness seems a special dispensation of Providence to enable him to wear them if his girth were the girth of an ordinary man he could never hang them on all at once
It is only on very great occasions that M Feroce displays his shining honours
At other times they lie by with rolls of manuscript testifying to the causes of their presentation in a huge glass case in the red sofad salon of his private residence on the beach where M Feroce also keeps his family pictures his portraits of himself as he appears both in bathing life and in private life his little boats that rock by clockwork and his other ornamental possessions
Then we have a commodious and gay Theatre  or had for it is burned down now  where the opera was always preceded by a vaudeville in which as usual everybody down to the little old man with the large hat and the little cane and tassel who always played either my Uncle or my Papa suddenly broke out of the dialogue into the mildest vocal snatches to the great perplexity of unaccustomed strangers from Great Britain who never could make out when they were singing and when they were talking  and indeed it was pretty much the same
But the caterers in the way of entertainment to whom we are most beholden are the Society of Welldoing who are active all the summer and give the proceeds of their good works to the poor
Some of the most agreeable fetes they contrive are announced as Dedicated to the children and the taste with which they turn a small public enclosure into an elegant garden beautifully illuminated and the thoroughgoing heartiness and energy with which they personally direct the childish pleasures are supremely delightful
For fivepence a head we have on these occasions donkey races with English Jokeis and other rustic sports lotteries for toys roundabouts dancing on the grass to the music of an admirable band fire balloons and fireworks
Further almost every week all through the summer  never mind now on what day of the week  there is a fete in some adjoining village called in that part of the country a Ducasse where the people  really THE PEOPLE  dance on the green turf in the open air round a little orchestra that seems itself to dance there is such an airy motion of flags and streamers all about it
And we do not suppose that between the Torrid Zone and the North Pole there are to be found male dancers with such astonishingly loose legs furnished with so many joints in wrong places utterly unknown to Professor Owen as those who here disport themselves
Sometimes the fete appertains to a particular trade you will see among the cheerful young women at the joint Ducasse of the milliners and tailors a wholesome knowledge of the art of making common and cheap things uncommon and pretty by good sense and good taste that is a practical lesson to any rank of society in a whole island we could mention
The oddest feature of these agreeable scenes is the everlasting Roundabout we preserve an English word wherever we can as we are writing the English language on the wooden horses of which machine grownup people of all ages are wound round and round with the utmost solemnity while the proprietors wife grinds an organ capable of only one tune in the centre
As to the boardinghouses of our French wateringplace they are Legion and would require a distinct treatise
It is not without a sentiment of national pride that we believe them to contain more bores from the shores of Albion than all the clubs in London
As you walk timidly in their neighbourhood the very neckcloths and hats of your elderly compatriots cry to you from the stones of the streets We are Bores  avoid us
We have never overheard at street corners such lunatic scraps of political and social discussion as among these dear countrymen of ours
They believe everything that is impossible and nothing that is true
They carry rumours and ask questions and make corrections and improvements on one another staggering to the human intellect
And they are for ever rushing into the English library propounding such incomprehensible paradoxes to the fair mistress of that establishment that we beg to recommend her to her Majestys gracious consideration as a fit object for a pension
The English form a considerable part of the population of our French wateringplace and are deservedly addressed and respected in many ways
Some of the surfaceaddresses to them are odd enough as when a laundress puts a placard outside her house announcing her possession of that curious British instrument a Mingle or when a tavernkeeper provides accommodation for the celebrated English game of Nokemdon
But to us it is not the least pleasant feature of our French wateringplace that a long and constant fusion of the two great nations there has taught each to like the other and to learn from the other and to rise superior to the absurd prejudices that have lingered among the weak and ignorant in both countries equally
Drumming and trumpeting of course go on for ever in our French wateringplace
Flagflying is at a premium too but we cheerfully avow that we consider a flag a very pretty object and that we take such outward signs of innocent liveliness to our heart of hearts
The people in the town and in the country are a busy people who work hard they are sober temperate goodhumoured lighthearted and generally remarkable for their engaging manners
Few just men not immoderately bilious could see them in their recreations without very much respecting the character that is so easily so harmlessly and so simply pleased
BILLSTICKING IF I had an enemy whom I hated  which Heaven forbid
 and if I knew of something which sat heavy on his conscience I think I would introduce that something into a PostingBill and place a large impression in the hands of an active sticker
I can scarcely imagine a more terrible revenge
I should haunt him by this means night and day
I do not mean to say that I would publish his secret in red letters two feet high for all the town to read I would darkly refer to it
It should be between him and me and the PostingBill
Say for example that at a certain period of his life my enemy had surreptitiously possessed himself of a key
I would then embark my capital in the lock business and conduct that business on the advertising principle
In all my placards and advertisements I would throw up the line SECRET KEYS
Thus if my enemy passed an uninhabited house he would see his conscience glaring down on him from the parapets and peeping up at him from the cellars
If he took a dead wall in his walk it would be alive with reproaches
If he sought refuge in an omnibus the panels thereof would become Belshazzars palace to him
If he took boat in a wild endeavour to escape he would see the fatal words lurking under the arches of the bridges over the Thames
If he walked the streets with downcast eyes he would recoil from the very stones of the pavement made eloquent by lampblack lithograph
If he drove or rode his way would be blocked up by enormous vans each proclaiming the same words over and over again from its whole extent of surface
Until having gradually grown thinner and paler and having at last totally rejected food he would miserably perish and I should be revenged
This conclusion I should no doubt celebrate by laughing a hoarse laugh in three syllables and folding my arms tight upon my chest agreeably to most of the examples of glutted animosity that I have had an opportunity of observing in connexion with the Drama  which bytheby as involving a good deal of noise appears to me to be occasionally confounded with the Drummer
The foregoing reflections presented themselves to my mind the other day as I contemplated being newly come to London from the East Riding of Yorkshire on a househunting expedition for next May an old warehouse which rotting paste and rotting paper had brought down to the condition of an old cheese
It would have been impossible to say on the most conscientious survey how much of its front was brick and mortar and how much decaying and decayed plaster
It was so thickly encrusted with fragments of bills that no ships keel after a long voyage could be half so foul
All traces of the broken windows were billed out the doors were billed across the waterspout was billed over
The building was shored up to prevent its tumbling into the street and the very beams erected against it were less wood than paste and paper they had been so continually posted and reposted
The forlorn dregs of old posters so encumbered this wreck that there was no hold for new posters and the stickers had abandoned the place in despair except one enterprising man who had hoisted the last masquerade to a clear spot near the level of the stack of chimneys where it waved and drooped like a shattered flag
Below the rusty cellargrating crumpled remnants of old bills torn down rotted away in wasting heaps of fallen leaves
Here and there some of the thick rind of the house had peeled off in strips and fluttered heavily down littering the street but still below these rents and gashes layers of decomposing posters showed themselves as if they were interminable
I thought the building could never even be pulled down but in one adhesive heap of rottenness and poster
As to getting in  I dont believe that if the Sleeping Beauty and her Court had been so billed up the young Prince could have done it
Knowing all the posters that were yet legible intimately and pondering on their ubiquitous nature I was led into the reflections with which I began this paper by considering what an awful thing it would be ever to have wronged  say M JULLIEN for example  and to have his avenging name in characters of fire incessantly before my eyes
Or to have injured MADAME TUSSAUD and undergo a similar retribution
Has any man a selfreproachful thought associated with pills or ointment
What an avenging spirit to that man is PROFESSOR HOLLOWAY
Have I sinned in oil
CABBURN pursues me
Have I a dark remembrance associated with any gentlemanly garments bespoke or ready made
MOSES and SON are on my track
Did I ever aim a blow at a defenceless fellowcreatures head
That head eternally being measured for a wig or that worse head which was bald before it used the balsam and hirsute afterwards  enforcing the benevolent moral Better to be bald as a Dutch cheese than come to this  undoes me
Have I no sore places in my mind which MECHI touches  which NICOLL probes  which no registered article whatever lacerates
Does no discordant note within me thrill responsive to mysterious watchwords as Revalenta Arabica or Number One St Pauls Churchyard
Then may I enjoy life and be happy
Lifting up my eyes as I was musing to this effect I beheld advancing towards me I was then on Cornhill near to the Royal Exchange a solemn procession of three advertising vans of first class dimensions each drawn by a very little horse
As the cavalcade approached I was at a loss to reconcile the careless deportment of the drivers of these vehicles with the terrific announcements they conducted through the city which being a summary of the contents of a Sunday newspaper were of the most thrilling kind
Robbery fire murder and the ruin of the United Kingdom  each discharged in a line by itself like a separate broadside of redhot shot  were among the least of the warnings addressed to an unthinking people
Yet the Ministers of Fate who drove the awful cars leaned forward with their arms upon their knees in a state of extreme lassitude for want of any subject of interest
The first man whose hair I might naturally have expected to see standing on end scratched his head  one of the smoothest I ever beheld  with profound indifference
The second whistled
The third yawned
Pausing to dwell upon this apathy it appeared to me as the fatal cars came by me that I descried in the second car through the portal in which the charioteer was seated a figure stretched upon the floor
At the same time I thought I smelt tobacco
The latter impression passed quickly from me the former remained
Curious to know whether this prostrate figure was the one impressible man of the whole capital who had been stricken insensible by the terrors revealed to him and whose form had been placed in the car by the charioteer from motives of humanity I followed the procession
It turned into Leadenhallmarket and halted at a publichouse
Each driver dismounted
I then distinctly heard proceeding from the second car where I had dimly seen the prostrate form the words And a pipe
The driver entering the publichouse with his fellows apparently for purposes of refreshment I could not refrain from mounting on the shaft of the second vehicle and looking in at the portal
I then beheld reclining on his back upon the floor on a kind of mattress or divan a little man in a shootingcoat
The exclamation Dear me which irresistibly escaped my lips caused him to sit upright and survey me
I found him to be a goodlooking little man of about fifty with a shining face a tight head a bright eye a moist wink a quick speech and a ready air
He had something of a sporting way with him
He looked at me and I looked at him until the driver displaced me by handing in a pint of beer a pipe and what I understand is called a screw of tobacco  an object which has the appearance of a curlpaper taken off the barmaids head with the curl in it
I beg your pardon said I when the removed person of the driver again admitted of my presenting my face at the portal
But  excuse my curiosity which I inherit from my mother  do you live here
Thats good too
returned the little man composedly laying aside a pipe he had smoked out and filling the pipe just brought to him
Oh you DONT live here then
said I
He shook his head as he calmly lighted his pipe by means of a German tinderbox and replied This is my carriage
When things are flat I take a ride sometimes and enjoy myself
I am the inventor of these wans
His pipe was now alight
He drank his beer all at once and he smoked and he smiled at me
It was a great idea
said I
Not so bad returned the little man with the modesty of merit
Might I be permitted to inscribe your name upon the tablets of my memory
I asked
Theres not much odds in the name returned the little man   no name particular  I am the King of the BillStickers
Good gracious
said I
The monarch informed me with a smile that he had never been crowned or installed with any public ceremonies but that he was peaceably acknowledged as King of the BillStickers in right of being the oldest and most respected member of the old school of billsticking
He likewise gave me to understand that there was a Lord Mayor of the BillStickers whose genius was chiefly exercised within the limits of the city
He made some allusion also to an inferior potentate called Turkeylegs but I did not understand that this gentleman was invested with much power
I rather inferred that he derived his title from some peculiarity of gait and that it was of an honorary character
My father pursued the King of the BillStickers was Engineer Beadle and BillSticker to the parish of St Andrews Holborn in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty
My father stuck bills at the time of the riots of London
You must be acquainted with the whole subject of billsticking from that time to the present
said I
Pretty well so was the answer
Excuse me said I but I am a sort of collector   Not Incometax
cried His Majesty hastily removing his pipe from his lips
No no said I
Waterrate
said His Majesty
No no I returned
Gas
Assessed
Sewers
said His Majesty
You misunderstand me I replied soothingly
Not that sort of collector at all a collector of facts
Oh if its only facts cried the King of the BillStickers recovering his goodhumour and banishing the great mistrust that had suddenly fallen upon him come in and welcome
If it had been income or winders I think I should have pitched you out of the wan upon my soul
Readily complying with the invitation I squeezed myself in at the small aperture
His Majesty graciously handing me a little three legged stool on which I took my seat in a corner inquired if I smoked
I do  that is I can I answered
Pipe and a screw
said His Majesty to the attendant charioteer
Do you prefer a dry smoke or do you moisten it
As unmitigated tobacco produces most disturbing effects upon my system indeed if I had perfect moral courage I doubt if I should smoke at all under any circumstances I advocated moisture and begged the Sovereign of the BillStickers to name his usual liquor and to concede to me the privilege of paying for it
After some delicate reluctance on his part we were provided through the instrumentality of the attendant charioteer with a can of cold rumandwater flavoured with sugar and lemon
We were also furnished with a tumbler and I was provided with a pipe
His Majesty then observing that we might combine business with conversation gave the word for the car to proceed and to my great delight we jogged away at a foot pace
I say to my great delight because I am very fond of novelty and it was a new sensation to be jolting through the tumult of the city in that secluded Temple partly open to the sky surrounded by the roar without and seeing nothing but the clouds
Occasionally blows from whips fell heavily on the Temples walls when by stopping up the road longer than usual we irritated carters and coachmen to madness but they fell harmless upon us within and disturbed not the serenity of our peaceful retreat
As I looked upward I felt I should imagine like the Astronomer Royal
I was enchanted by the contrast between the freezing nature of our external mission on the blood of the populace and the perfect composure reigning within those sacred precincts where His Majesty reclining easily on his left arm smoked his pipe and drank his rumandwater from his own side of the tumbler which stood impartially between us
As I looked down from the clouds and caught his royal eye he understood my reflections
I have an idea he observed with an upward glance of training scarlet runners across in the season  making a arbour of it  and sometimes taking tea in the same according to the song
I nodded approval
And here you repose and think
said I
And think said he of posters  walls  and hoardings
We were both silent contemplating the vastness of the subject
I remembered a surprising fancy of dear THOMAS HOODS and wondered whether this monarch ever sighed to repair to the great wall of China and stick bills all over it
And so said he rousing himself its facts as you collect
Facts said I
The facts of billsticking pursued His Majesty in a benignant manner as known to myself air as following
When my father was Engineer Beadle and BillSticker to the parish of St Andrews Holborn he employed women to post bills for him
He employed women to post bills at the time of the riots of London
He died at the age of seventyfive year and was buried by the murdered Eliza Grimwood over in the Waterloo Road
As this was somewhat in the nature of a royal speech I listened with deference and silently
His Majesty taking a scroll from his pocket proceeded with great distinctness to pour out the following flood of information The bills being at that period mostly proclamations and declarations and which were only a demy size the manner of posting the bills as they did not use brushes was by means of a piece of wood which they called a dabber
Thus things continued till such time as the State Lottery was passed and then the printers began to print larger bills and men were employed instead of women as the State Lottery Commissioners then began to send men all over England to post bills and would keep them out for six or eight months at a time and they were called by the London bill stickers TRAMPERS their wages at the time being ten shillings per day besides expenses
They used sometimes to be stationed in large towns for five or six months together distributing the schemes to all the houses in the town
And then there were more caricature woodblock engravings for postingbills than there are at the present time the principal printers at that time of postingbills being Messrs Evans and Ruffy of Budge Row Thoroughgood and Whiting of the present day and Messrs Gye and Balne Gracechurch Street City
The largest bills printed at that period were a twosheet double crown and when they commenced printing foursheet bills two billstickers would work together
They had no settled wages per week but had a fixed price for their work and the London billstickers during a lottery week have been known to earn each eight or nine pounds per week till the day of drawing likewise the men who carried boards in the street used to have one pound per week and the billstickers at that time would not allow any one to wilfully cover or destroy their bills as they had a society amongst themselves and very frequently dined together at some publichouse where they used to go of an evening to have their work delivered out untoe em
All this His Majesty delivered in a gallant manner posting it as it were before me in a great proclamation
I took advantage of the pause he now made to inquire what a twosheet double crown might express
A twosheet double crown replied the King is a bill thirty nine inches wide by thirty inches high
Is it possible said I my mind reverting to the gigantic admonitions we were then displaying to the multitude  which were as infants to some of the postingbills on the rotten old warehouse  that some few years ago the largest bill was no larger than that
The fact returned the King is undoubtedly so
Here he instantly rushed again into the scroll
Since the abolishing of the State Lottery all that good feeling has gone and nothing but jealousy exists through the rivalry of each other
Several billsticking companies have started but have failed
The first party that started a company was twelve year ago but what was left of the old school and their dependants joined together and opposed them
And for some time we were quiet again till a printer of Hatton Garden formed a company by hiring the sides of houses but he was not supported by the public and he left his wooden frames fixed up for rent
The last company that started took advantage of the New Police Act and hired of Messrs Grissell and Peto the hoarding of Trafalgar Square and established a billsticking office in Cursitor Street Chancery Lane and engaged some of the new billstickers to do their work and for a time got the half of all our work and with such spirit did they carry on their opposition towards us that they used to give us in charge before the magistrate and get us fined but they found it so expensive that they could not keep it up for they were always employing a lot of ruffians from the Seven Dials to come and fight us and on one occasion the old billstickers went to Trafalgar Square to attempt to post bills when they were given in custody by the watchman in their employ and fined at Queen Square five pounds as they would not allow any of us to speak in the office but when they were gone we had an interview with the magistrate who mitigated the fine to fifteen shillings
During the time the men were waiting for the fine this company started off to a publichouse that we were in the habit of using and waited for us coming back where a fighting scene took place that beggars description
Shortly after this the principal one day came and shook hands with us and acknowledged that he had broken up the company and that he himself had lost five hundred pound in trying to overthrow us
We then took possession of the hoarding in Trafalgar Square but Messrs Grissell and Peto would not allow us to post our bills on the said hoarding without paying them  and from first to last we paid upwards of two hundred pounds for that hoarding and likewise the hoarding of the Reform Clubhouse Pall Mall
His Majesty being now completely out of breath laid down his scroll which he appeared to have finished puffed at his pipe and took some rumandwater
I embraced the opportunity of asking how many divisions the art and mystery of billsticking comprised
He replied three  auctioneers billsticking theatrical bill sticking general billsticking
The auctioneers porters said the King who do their bill sticking are mostly respectable and intelligent and generally well paid for their work whether in town or country
The price paid by the principal auctioneers for country work is nine shillings per day that is seven shillings for days work one shilling for lodging and one for paste
Town work is five shillings a day including paste
Town work must be rather hot work said I if there be many of those fighting scenes that beggar description among the bill stickers
Well replied the King I ant a stranger I assure you to black eyes a billsticker ought to know how to handle his fists a bit
As to that row I have mentioned that grew out of competition conducted in an uncompromising spirit
Besides a man in a horseandshay continually following us about the company had a watchman on duty night and day to prevent us sticking bills upon the hoarding in Trafalgar Square
We went there early one morning to stick bills and to blackwash their bills if we were interfered with
We WERE interfered with and I gave the word for laying on the wash
It WAS laid on  pretty brisk  and we were all taken to Queen Square but they couldnt fine ME
I knew that  with a bright smile  Id only give directions  I was only the General
Charmed with this monarchs affability I inquired if he had ever hired a hoarding himself
Hired a large one he replied opposite the Lyceum Theatre when the buildings was there
Paid thirty pound for it let out places on it and called it The External PaperHanging Station
But it didnt answer
Ah
said His Majesty thoughtfully as he filled the glass Billstickers have a deal to contend with
The bill sticking clause was got into the Police Act by a member of Parliament that employed me at his election
The clause is pretty stiff respecting where bills go but HE didnt mind where HIS bills went
It was all right enough so long as they was HIS bills
Fearful that I observed a shadow of misanthropy on the Kings cheerful face I asked whose ingenious invention that was which I greatly admired of sticking bills under the arches of the bridges
Mine
said His Majesty
I was the first that ever stuck a bill under a bridge
Imitators soon rose up of course
 When dont they
But they stuck em at lowwater and the tide came and swept the bills clean away
I knew that
The King laughed
What may be the name of that instrument like an immense fishing rod I inquired with which bills are posted on high places
The joints returned His Majesty
Now we use the joints where formerly we used ladders  as they do still in country places
Once when Madame Vestris understood was playing in Liverpool another billsticker and me were at it together on the wall outside the Clarence Dock  me with the joints  him on a ladder
Lord
I had my bill up right over his head yards above him ladder and all while he was crawling to his work
The people going in and out of the docks stood and laughed
 Its about thirty years since the joints come in
Are there any billstickers who cant read
I took the liberty of inquiring
Some said the King
But they know which is the right side upards of their work
They keep it as its given out to em
I have seen a bill or so stuck wrong side upards
But its very rare
Our discourse sustained some interruption at this point by the procession of cars occasioning a stoppage of about threequarters of a mile in length as nearly as I could judge
His Majesty however entreating me not to be discomposed by the contingent uproar smoked with great placidity and surveyed the firmament
When we were again in motion I begged to be informed what was the largest poster His Majesty had ever seen
The King replied A thirtysix sheet poster
I gathered also that there were about a hundred and fifty billstickers in London and that His Majesty considered an average hand equal to the posting of one hundred bills single sheets in a day
The King was of opinion that although posters had much increased in size they had not increased in number as the abolition of the State Lotteries had occasioned a great falling off especially in the country
Over and above which change I bethought myself that the custom of advertising in newspapers had greatly increased
The completion of many London improvements as Trafalgar Square I particularly observed the singularity of His Majestys calling THAT an improvement the Royal Exchange c had of late years reduced the number of advantageous postingplaces
BillStickers at present rather confine themselves to districts than to particular descriptions of work
One man would strike over Whitechapel another would take round Houndsditch Shoreditch and the City Road one the King said would stick to the Surrey side another would make a beat of the Westend
His Majesty remarked with some approach to severity on the neglect of delicacy and taste gradually introduced into the trade by the new school a profligate and inferior race of impostors who took jobs at almost any price to the detriment of the old school and the confusion of their own misguided employers
He considered that the trade was overdone with competition and observed speaking of his subjects There are too many of em
He believed still that things were a little better than they had been adducing as a proof the fact that particular posting places were now reserved by common consent for particular posters those places however must be regularly occupied by those posters or they lapsed and fell into other hands
It was of no use giving a man a Drury Lane bill this week and not next
Where was it to go
He was of opinion that going to the expense of putting up your own board on which your sticker could display your own bills was the only complete way of posting yourself at the present time but even to effect this on payment of a shilling a week to the keepers of steamboat piers and other such places you must be able besides to give orders for theatres and public exhibitions or you would be sure to be cut out by somebody
His Majesty regarded the passion for orders as one of the most unappeasable appetites of human nature
If there were a building or if there were repairs going on anywhere you could generally stand something and make it right with the foreman of the works but orders would be expected from you and the man who could give the most orders was the man who would come off best
There was this other objectionable point in orders that workmen sold them for drink and often sold them to persons who were likewise troubled with the weakness of thirst which led His Majesty said to the presentation of your orders at Theatre doors by individuals who were too shakery to derive intellectual profit from the entertainments and who brought a scandal on you
Finally His Majesty said that you could hardly put too little in a poster what you wanted was two or three good catchlines for the eye to rest on  then leave it alone  and there you were
These are the minutes of my conversation with His Majesty as I noted them down shortly afterwards
I am not aware that I have been betrayed into any alteration or suppression
The manner of the King was frank in the extreme and he seemed to me to avoid at once that slight tendency to repetition which may have been observed in the conversation of His Majesty King George the Third and  that slight undercurrent of egotism which the curious observer may perhaps detect in the conversation of Napoleon Bonaparte
I must do the King the justice to say that it was I and not he who closed the dialogue
At this juncture I became the subject of a remarkable optical delusion the legs of my stool appeared to me to double up the car to spin round and round with great violence and a mist to arise between myself and His Majesty
In addition to these sensations I felt extremely unwell
I refer these unpleasant effects either to the paste with which the posters were affixed to the van which may have contained some small portion of arsenic or to the printers ink which may have contained some equally deleterious ingredient
Of this I cannot be sure
I am only sure that I was not affected either by the smoke or the rum andwater
I was assisted out of the vehicle in a state of mind which I have only experienced in two other places  I allude to the Pier at Dover and to the corresponding portion of the town of Calais  and sat upon a doorstep until I recovered
The procession had then disappeared
I have since looked anxiously for the King in several other cars but I have not yet had the happiness of seeing His Majesty
BIRTHS
MRS MEEK OF A SON MY name is Meek
I am in fact Mr Meek
That son is mine and Mrs Meeks
When I saw the announcement in the Times I dropped the paper
I had put it in myself and paid for it but it looked so noble that it overpowered me
As soon as I could compose my feelings I took the paper up to Mrs Meeks bedside
Maria Jane said I I allude to Mrs Meek you are now a public character
We read the review of our child several times with feelings of the strongest emotion and I sent the boy who cleans the boots and shoes to the office for fifteen copies
No reduction was made on taking that quantity
It is scarcely necessary for me to say that our child had been expected
In fact it had been expected with comparative confidence for some months
Mrs Meeks mother who resides with us  of the name of Bigby  had made every preparation for its admission to our circle
I hope and believe I am a quiet man
I will go farther
I KNOW I am a quiet man
My constitution is tremulous my voice was never loud and in point of stature I have been from infancy small
I have the greatest respect for Maria Janes Mama
She is a most remarkable woman
I honour Maria Janes Mama
In my opinion she would storm a town singlehanded with a hearthbroom and carry it
I have never known her to yield any point whatever to mortal man
She is calculated to terrify the stoutest heart
Still  but I will not anticipate
The first intimation I had of any preparations being in progress on the part of Maria Janes Mama was one afternoon several months ago
I came home earlier than usual from the office and proceeding into the diningroom found an obstruction behind the door which prevented it from opening freely
It was an obstruction of a soft nature
On looking in I found it to be a female
The female in question stood in the corner behind the door consuming Sherry Wine
From the nutty smell of that beverage pervading the apartment I have no doubt she was consuming a second glassful
She wore a black bonnet of large dimensions and was copious in figure
The expression of her countenance was severe and discontented
The words to which she gave utterance on seeing me were these Oh git along with you Sir if YOU please me and Mrs Bigby dont want no male parties here
That female was Mrs Prodgit
I immediately withdrew of course
I was rather hurt but I made no remark
Whether it was that I showed a lowness of spirits after dinner in consequence of feeling that I seemed to intrude I cannot say
But Maria Janes Mama said to me on her retiring for the night in a low distinct voice and with a look of reproach that completely subdued me George Meek Mrs Prodgit is your wifes nurse
I bear no illwill towards Mrs Prodgit
Is it likely that I writing this with tears in my eyes should be capable of deliberate animosity towards a female so essential to the welfare of Maria Jane
I am willing to admit that Fate may have been to blame and not Mrs Prodgit but it is undeniably true that the latter female brought desolation and devastation into my lowly dwelling
We were happy after her first appearance we were sometimes exceedingly so
But whenever the parlour door was opened and Mrs
Prodgit
announced and she was very often announced misery ensued
I could not bear Mrs Prodgits look
I felt that I was far from wanted and had no business to exist in Mrs Prodgits presence
Between Maria Janes Mama and Mrs Prodgit there was a dreadful secret understanding  a dark mystery and conspiracy pointing me out as a being to be shunned
I appeared to have done something that was evil
Whenever Mrs Prodgit called after dinner I retired to my dressingroom  where the temperature is very low indeed in the wintry time of the year  and sat looking at my frosty breath as it rose before me and at my rack of boots a serviceable article of furniture but never in my opinion an exhilarating object
The length of the councils that were held with Mrs Prodgit under these circumstances I will not attempt to describe
I will merely remark that Mrs Prodgit always consumed Sherry Wine while the deliberations were in progress that they always ended in Maria Janes being in wretched spirits on the sofa and that Maria Janes Mama always received me when I was recalled with a look of desolate triumph that too plainly said NOW George Meek
You see my child Maria Jane a ruin and I hope you are satisfied
I pass generally over the period that intervened between the day when Mrs Prodgit entered her protest against male parties and the evermemorable midnight when I brought her to my unobtrusive home in a cab with an extremely large box on the roof and a bundle a bandbox and a basket between the drivers legs
I have no objection to Mrs Prodgit aided and abetted by Mrs Bigby who I never can forget is the parent of Maria Jane taking entire possession of my unassuming establishment
In the recesses of my own breast the thought may linger that a man in possession cannot be so dreadful as a woman and that woman Mrs Prodgit but I ought to bear a good deal and I hope I can and do
Huffing and snubbing prey upon my feelings but I can bear them without complaint
They may tell in the long run I may be hustled about from post to pillar beyond my strength nevertheless I wish to avoid giving rise to words in the family
The voice of Nature however cries aloud in behalf of Augustus George my infant son
It is for him that I wish to utter a few plaintive household words
I am not at all angry I am mild  but miserable
I wish to know why when my child Augustus George was expected in our circle a provision of pins was made as if the little stranger were a criminal who was to be put to the torture immediately on his arrival instead of a holy babe
I wish to know why haste was made to stick those pins all over his innocent form in every direction
I wish to be informed why light and air are excluded from Augustus George like poisons
Why I ask is my unoffending infant so hedged into a basketbedstead with dimity and calico with miniature sheets and blankets that I can only hear him snuffle and no wonder
deep down under the pink hood of a little bathingmachine and can never peruse even so much of his lineaments as his nose
Was I expected to be the father of a French Roll that the brushes of All Nations were laid in to rasp Augustus George
Am I to be told that his sensitive skin was ever intended by Nature to have rashes brought out upon it by the premature and incessant use of those formidable little instruments
Is my son a Nutmeg that he is to be grated on the stiff edges of sharp frills
Am I the parent of a Muslin boy that his yielding surface is to be crimped and small plaited
Or is my child composed of Paper or of Linen that impressions of the finer gettingup art practised by the laundress are to be printed off all over his soft arms and legs as I constantly observe them
The starch enters his soul who can wonder that he cries
Was Augustus George intended to have limbs or to be born a Torso
I presume that limbs were the intention as they are the usual practice
Then why are my poor childs limbs fettered and tied up
Am I to be told that there is any analogy between Augustus George Meek and Jack Sheppard
Analyse Castor Oil at any Institution of Chemistry that may be agreed upon and inform me what resemblance in taste it bears to that natural provision which it is at once the pride and duty of Maria Jane to administer to Augustus George
Yet I charge Mrs Prodgit aided and abetted by Mrs Bigby with systematically forcing Castor Oil on my innocent son from the first hour of his birth
When that medicine in its efficient action causes internal disturbance to Augustus George I charge Mrs Prodgit aided and abetted by Mrs Bigby with insanely and inconsistently administering opium to allay the storm she has raised
What is the meaning of this
If the days of Egyptian Mummies are past how dare Mrs Prodgit require for the use of my son an amount of flannel and linen that would carpet my humble roof
Do I wonder that she requires it
No
This morning within an hour I beheld this agonising sight
I beheld my son  Augustus George  in Mrs Prodgits hands and on Mrs Prodgits knee being dressed
He was at the moment comparatively speaking in a state of nature having nothing on but an extremely short shirt remarkably disproportionate to the length of his usual outer garments
Trailing from Mrs Prodgits lap on the floor was a long narrow roller or bandage  I should say of several yards in extent
In this I SAW Mrs Prodgit tightly roll the body of my unoffending infant turning him over and over now presenting his unconscious face upwards now the back of his bald head until the unnatural feat was accomplished and the bandage secured by a pin which I have every reason to believe entered the body of my only child
In this tourniquet he passes the present phase of his existence
Can I know it and smile
I fear I have been betrayed into expressing myself warmly but I feel deeply
Not for myself for Augustus George
I dare not interfere
Will any one
Will any publication
Any doctor
Any parent
Any body
I do not complain that Mrs Prodgit aided and abetted by Mrs Bigby entirely alienates Maria Janes affections from me and interposes an impassable barrier between us
I do not complain of being made of no account
I do not want to be of any account
But Augustus George is a production of Nature I cannot think otherwise and I claim that he should be treated with some remote reference to Nature
In my opinion Mrs Prodgit is from first to last a convention and a superstition
Are all the faculty afraid of Mrs Prodgit
If not why dont they take her in hand and improve her
PS
Maria Janes Mama boasts of her own knowledge of the subject and says she brought up seven children besides Maria Jane
But how do I know that she might not have brought them up much better
Maria Jane herself is far from strong and is subject to headaches and nervous indigestion
Besides which I learn from the statistical tables that one child in five dies within the first year of its life and one child in three within the fifth
That dont look as if we could never improve in these particulars I think
PPS
Augustus George is in convulsions
LYING AWAKE MY uncle lay with his eyes half closed and his nightcap drawn almost down to his nose
His fancy was already wandering and began to mingle up the present scene with the crater of Vesuvius the French Opera the Coliseum at Rome Dollys Chophouse in London and all the farrago of noted places with which the brain of a traveller is crammed in a word he was just falling asleep
Thus that delightful writer WASHINGTON IRVING in his Tales of a Traveller
But it happened to me the other night to be lying not with my eyes half closed but with my eyes wide open not with my nightcap drawn almost down to my nose for on sanitary principles I never wear a nightcap but with my hair pitchforked and touzled all over the pillow not just falling asleep by any means but glaringly persistently and obstinately broad awake
Perhaps with no scientific intention or invention I was illustrating the theory of the Duality of the Brain perhaps one part of my brain being wakeful sat up to watch the other part which was sleepy
Be that as it may something in me was as desirous to go to sleep as it possibly could be but something else in me WOULD NOT go to sleep and was as obstinate as George the Third
Thinking of George the Third  for I devote this paper to my train of thoughts as I lay awake most people lying awake sometimes and having some interest in the subject  put me in mind of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN and so Benjamin Franklins paper on the art of procuring pleasant dreams which would seem necessarily to include the art of going to sleep came into my head
Now as I often used to read that paper when I was a very small boy and as I recollect everything I read then as perfectly as I forget everything I read now I quoted Get out of bed beat up and turn your pillow shake the bedclothes well with at least twenty shakes then throw the bed open and leave it to cool in the meanwhile continuing undrest walk about your chamber
When you begin to feel the cold air unpleasant then return to your bed and you will soon fall asleep and your sleep will be sweet and pleasant
Not a bit of it
I performed the whole ceremony and if it were possible for me to be more saucereyed than I was before that was the only result that came of it
Except Niagara
The two quotations from Washington Irving and Benjamin Franklin may have put it in my head by an American association of ideas but there I was and the Horseshoe Fall was thundering and tumbling in my eyes and ears and the very rainbows that I left upon the spray when I really did last look upon it were beautiful to see
The nightlight being quite as plain however and sleep seeming to be many thousand miles further off than Niagara I made up my mind to think a little about Sleep which I no sooner did than I whirled off in spite of myself to Drury Lane Theatre and there saw a great actor and dear friend of mine whom I had been thinking of in the day playing Macbeth and heard him apostrophising the death of each days life as I have heard him many a time in the days that are gone
But Sleep
I WILL think about Sleep
I am determined to think this is the way I went on about Sleep
I must hold the word Sleep tight and fast or I shall be off at a tangent in half a second
I feel myself unaccountably straying already into Clare Market
Sleep
It would be curious as illustrating the equality of sleep to inquire how many of its phenomena are common to all classes to all degrees of wealth and poverty to every grade of education and ignorance
Here for example is her Majesty Queen Victoria in her palace this present blessed night and here is Winking Charley a sturdy vagrant in one of her Majestys jails
Her Majesty has fallen many thousands of times from that same Tower which I claim a right to tumble off now and then
So has Winking Charley
Her Majesty in her sleep has opened or prorogued Parliament or has held a Drawing Room attired in some very scanty dress the deficiencies and improprieties of which have caused her great uneasiness
I in my degree have suffered unspeakable agitation of mind from taking the chair at a public dinner at the London Tavern in my nightclothes which not all the courtesy of my kind friend and host MR BATHE could persuade me were quite adapted to the occasion
Winking Charley has been repeatedly tried in a worse condition
Her Majesty is no stranger to a vault or firmament of a sort of floorcloth with an indistinct pattern distantly resembling eyes which occasionally obtrudes itself on her repose
Neither am I
Neither is Winking Charley
It is quite common to all three of us to skim along with airy strides a little above the ground also to hold with the deepest interest dialogues with various people all represented by ourselves and to be at our wits end to know what they are going to tell us and to be indescribably astonished by the secrets they disclose
It is probable that we have all three committed murders and hidden bodies
It is pretty certain that we have all desperately wanted to cry out and have had no voice that we have all gone to the play and not been able to get in that we have all dreamed much more of our youth than of our later lives that  I have lost it
The threads broken
And up I go
I lying here with the nightlight before me up I go for no reason on earth that I can find out and drawn by no links that are visible to me up the Great Saint Bernard
I have lived in Switzerland and rambled among the mountains but why I should go there now and why up the Great Saint Bernard in preference to any other mountain I have no idea
As I lie here broad awake and with every sense so sharpened that I can distinctly hear distant noises inaudible to me at another time I make that journey as I really did on the same summer day with the same happy party  ah
two since dead I grieve to think  and there is the same track with the same black wooden arms to point the way and there are the same stormrefuges here and there and there is the same snow falling at the top and there are the same frosty mists and there is the same intensely cold convent with its menagerie smell and the same breed of dogs fast dying out and the same breed of jolly young monks whom I mourn to know as humbugs and the same convent parlour with its piano and the sitting round the fire and the same supper and the same lone night in a cell and the same bright fresh morning when going out into the highly rarefied air was like a plunge into an icy bath
Now see here what comes along and why does this thing stalk into my mind on the top of a Swiss mountain
It is a figure that I once saw just after dark chalked upon a door in a little back lane near a country church  my first church
How young a child I may have been at the time I dont know but it horrified me so intensely  in connexion with the churchyard I suppose for it smokes a pipe and has a big hat with each of its ears sticking out in a horizontal line under the brim and is not in itself more oppressive than a mouth from ear to ear a pair of goggle eyes and hands like two bunches of carrots five in each can make it  that it is still vaguely alarming to me to recall as I have often done before lying awake the running home the looking behind the horror of its following me though whether disconnected from the door or door and all I cant say and perhaps never could
It lays a disagreeable train
I must resolve to think of something on the voluntary principle
The balloon ascents of this last season
They will do to think about while I lie awake as well as anything else
I must hold them tight though for I feel them sliding away and in their stead are the Mannings husband and wife hanging on the top of Horse monger Lane Jail
In connexion with which dismal spectacle I recall this curious fantasy of the mind
That having beheld that execution and having left those two forms dangling on the top of the entrance gateway  the mans a limp loose suit of clothes as if the man had gone out of them the womans a fine shape so elaborately corseted and artfully dressed that it was quite unchanged in its trim appearance as it slowly swung from side to side  I never could by my uttermost efforts for some weeks present the outside of that prison to myself which the terrible impression I had received continually obliged me to do without presenting it with the two figures still hanging in the morning air
Until strolling past the gloomy place one night when the street was deserted and quiet and actually seeing that the bodies were not there my fancy was persuaded as it were to take them down and bury them within the precincts of the jail where they have lain ever since
The balloon ascents of last season
Let me reckon them up
There were the horse the bull the parachute  and the tumbler hanging on  chiefly by his toes I believe  below the car
Very wrong indeed and decidedly to be stopped
But in connexion with these and similar dangerous exhibitions it strikes me that that portion of the public whom they entertain is unjustly reproached
Their pleasure is in the difficulty overcome
They are a public of great faith and are quite confident that the gentleman will not fall off the horse or the lady off the bull or out of the parachute and that the tumbler has a firm hold with his toes
They do not go to see the adventurer vanquished but triumphant
There is no parallel in public combats between men and beasts because nobody can answer for the particular beast  unless it were always the same beast in which case it would be a mere stageshow which the same public would go in the same state of mind to see entirely believing in the brute being beforehand safely subdued by the man
That they are not accustomed to calculate hazards and dangers with any nicety we may know from their rash exposure of themselves in overcrowded steamboats and unsafe conveyances and places of all kinds
And I cannot help thinking that instead of railing and attributing savage motives to a people naturally well disposed and humane it is better to teach them and lead them argumentatively and reasonably  for they are very reasonable if you will discuss a matter with them  to more considerate and wise conclusions
This is a disagreeable intrusion
Here is a man with his throat cut dashing towards me as I lie awake
A recollection of an old story of a kinsman of mine who going home one foggy winter night to Hampstead when London was much smaller and the road lonesome suddenly encountered such a figure rushing past him and presently two keepers from a madhouse in pursuit
A very unpleasant creature indeed to come into my mind unbidden as I lie awake
 The balloon ascents of last season
I must return to the balloons
Why did the bleeding man start out of them
Never mind if I inquire he will be back again
The balloons
This particular public have inherently a great pleasure in the contemplation of physical difficulties overcome mainly as I take it because the lives of a large majority of them are exceedingly monotonous and real and further are a struggle against continual difficulties and further still because anything in the form of accidental injury or any kind of illness or disability is so very serious in their own sphere
I will explain this seeming paradox of mine
Take the case of a Christmas Pantomime
Surely nobody supposes that the young mother in the pit who falls into fits of laughter when the baby is boiled or sat upon would be at all diverted by such an occurrence off the stage
Nor is the decent workman in the gallery who is transported beyond the ignorant present by the delight with which he sees a stout gentleman pushed out of a two pair of stairs window to be slandered by the suspicion that he would be in the least entertained by such a spectacle in any street in London Paris or New York
It always appears to me that the secret of this enjoyment lies in the temporary superiority to the common hazards and mischances of life in seeing casualties attended when they really occur with bodily and mental suffering tears and poverty happen through a very rough sort of poetry without the least harm being done to any one  the pretence of distress in a pantomime being so broadly humorous as to be no pretence at all
Much as in the comic fiction I can understand the mother with a very vulnerable baby at home greatly relishing the invulnerable baby on the stage so in the Cremorne reality I can understand the mason who is always liable to fall off a scaffold in his working jacket and to be carried to the hospital having an infinite admiration of the radiant personage in spangles who goes into the clouds upon a bull or upside down and who he takes it for granted  not reflecting upon the thing  has by uncommon skill and dexterity conquered such mischances as those to which he and his acquaintance are continually exposed
I wish the Morgue in Paris would not come here as I lie awake with its ghastly beds and the swollen saturated clothes hanging up and the water dripping dripping all day long upon that other swollen saturated something in the corner like a heap of crushed overripe figs that I have seen in Italy
And this detestable Morgue comes back again at the head of a procession of forgotten ghost stories
This will never do
I must think of something else as I lie awake or like that sagacious animal in the United States who recognised the colonel who was such a dead shot I am a gone Coon
What shall I think of
The late brutal assaults
Very good subject
The late brutal assaults
Though whether supposing I should see here before me as I lie awake the awful phantom described in one of those ghost stories who with a headdress of shroud was always seen looking in through a certain glass door at a certain dead hour  whether in such a case it would be the least consolation to me to know on philosophical grounds that it was merely my imagination is a question I cant help asking myself by the way
The late brutal assaults
I strongly question the expediency of advocating the revival of whipping for those crimes
It is a natural and generous impulse to be indignant at the perpetration of inconceivable brutality but I doubt the whipping panacea gravely
Not in the least regard or pity for the criminal whom I hold in far lower estimation than a mad wolf but in consideration for the general tone and feeling which is very much improved since the whipping times
It is bad for a people to be familiarised with such punishments
When the whip went out of Bridewell and ceased to be flourished at the carts tail and at the whippingpost it began to fade out of madhouses and workhouses and schools and families and to give place to a better system everywhere than cruel driving
It would be hasty because a few brutes may be inadequately punished to revive in any aspect what in so many aspects society is hardly yet happily rid of
The whip is a very contagious kind of thing and difficult to confine within one set of bounds
Utterly abolish punishment by fine  a barbarous device quite as much out of date as wager by battle but particularly connected in the vulgar mind with this class of offence  at least quadruple the term of imprisonment for aggravated assaults  and above all let us in such cases have no Pet Prisoning vain glorifying strong soup and roasted meats but hard work and one unchanging and uncompromising dietary of bread and water well or ill and we shall do much better than by going down into the dark to grope for the whip among the rusty fragments of the rack and the branding iron and the chains and gibbet from the public roads and the weights that pressed men to death in the cells of Newgate
I had proceeded thus far when I found I had been lying awake so long that the very dead began to wake too and to crowd into my thoughts most sorrowfully
Therefore I resolved to lie awake no more but to get up and go out for a night walk  which resolution was an acceptable relief to me as I dare say it may prove now to a great many more
THE GHOST OF ART I AM a bachelor residing in rather a dreary set of chambers in the Temple
They are situated in a square court of high houses which would be a complete well but for the want of water and the absence of a bucket
I live at the top of the house among the tiles and sparrows
Like the little man in the nurserystory I live by myself and all the bread and cheese I get  which is not much  I put upon a shelf
I need scarcely add perhaps that I am in love and that the father of my charming Julia objects to our union
I mention these little particulars as I might deliver a letter of introduction
The reader is now acquainted with me and perhaps will condescend to listen to my narrative
I am naturally of a dreamy turn of mind and my abundant leisure  for I am called to the Bar  coupled with much lonely listening to the twittering of sparrows and the pattering of rain has encouraged that disposition
In my top set I hear the wind howl on a winter night when the man on the ground floor believes it is perfectly still weather
The dim lamps with which our Honourable Society supposed to be as yet unconscious of the new discovery called Gas make the horrors of the staircase visible deepen the gloom which generally settles on my soul when I go home at night
I am in the Law but not of it
I cant exactly make out what it means
I sit in Westminster Hall sometimes in character from ten to four and when I go out of Court I dont know whether I am standing on my wig or my boots
It appears to me I mention this in confidence as if there were too much talk and too much law  as if some grains of truth were started overboard into a tempestuous sea of chaff
All this may make me mystical
Still I am confident that what I am going to describe myself as having seen and heard I actually did see and hear
It is necessary that I should observe that I have a great delight in pictures
I am no painter myself but I have studied pictures and written about them
I have seen all the most famous pictures in the world my education and reading have been sufficiently general to possess me beforehand with a knowledge of most of the subjects to which a Painter is likely to have recourse and although I might be in some doubt as to the rightful fashion of the scabbard of King Lears sword for instance I think I should know King Lear tolerably well if I happened to meet with him
I go to all the Modern Exhibitions every season and of course I revere the Royal Academy
I stand by its forty Academical articles almost as firmly as I stand by the thirtynine Articles of the Church of England
I am convinced that in neither case could there be by any rightful possibility one article more or less
It is now exactly three years  three years ago this very month  since I went from Westminster to the Temple one Thursday afternoon in a cheap steamboat
The sky was black when I imprudently walked on board
It began to thunder and lighten immediately afterwards and the rain poured down in torrents
The deck seeming to smoke with the wet I went below but so many passengers were there smoking too that I came up again and buttoning my peacoat and standing in the shadow of the paddle box stood as upright as I could and made the best of it
It was at this moment that I first beheld the terrible Being who is the subject of my present recollections
Standing against the funnel apparently with the intention of drying himself by the heat as fast as he got wet was a shabby man in threadbare black and with his hands in his pockets who fascinated me from the memorable instant when I caught his eye
Where had I caught that eye before
Who was he
Why did I connect him all at once with the Vicar of Wakefield Alfred the Great Gil Blas Charles the Second Joseph and his Brethren the Fairy Queen Tom Jones the Decameron of Boccaccio Tam OShanter the Marriage of the Doge of Venice with the Adriatic and the Great Plague of London
Why when he bent one leg and placed one hand upon the back of the seat near him did my mind associate him wildly with the words Number one hundred and fortytwo Portrait of a gentleman
Could it be that I was going mad
I looked at him again and now I could have taken my affidavit that he belonged to the Vicar of Wakefields family
Whether he was the Vicar or Moses or Mr Burchill or the Squire or a conglomeration of all four I knew not but I was impelled to seize him by the throat and charge him with being in some fell way connected with the Primrose blood
He looked up at the rain and then  oh Heaven
 he became Saint John
He folded his arms resigning himself to the weather and I was frantically inclined to address him as the Spectator and firmly demand to know what he had done with Sir Roger de Coverley
The frightful suspicion that I was becoming deranged returned upon me with redoubled force
Meantime this awful stranger inexplicably linked to my distress stood drying himself at the funnel and ever as the steam rose from his clothes diffusing a mist around him I saw through the ghostly medium all the people I have mentioned and a score more sacred and profane
I am conscious of a dreadful inclination that stole upon me as it thundered and lightened to grapple with this man or demon and plunge him over the side
But I constrained myself  I know not how  to speak to him and in a pause of the storm I crossed the deck and said What are you
He replied hoarsely A Model
A what
said I
A Model he replied
I sets to the profession for a bob a hour
All through this narrative I give his own words which are indelibly imprinted on my memory
The relief which this disclosure gave me the exquisite delight of the restoration of my confidence in my own sanity I cannot describe
I should have fallen on his neck but for the consciousness of being observed by the man at the wheel
You then said I shaking him so warmly by the hand that I wrung the rain out of his coatcuff are the gentleman whom I have so frequently contemplated in connection with a highbacked chair with a red cushion and a table with twisted legs
I am that Model he rejoined moodily and I wish I was anything else
Say not so I returned
I have seen you in the society of many beautiful young women as in truth I had and always I now remember in the act of making the most of his legs
No doubt said he
And youve seen me along with warses of flowers and any number of tablekivers and antique cabinets and warious gammon
Sir
said I
And warious gammon he repeated in a louder voice
You might have seen me in armour too if you had looked sharp
Blessed if I hant stood in half the suits of armour as ever came out of Pratts shop and sat for weeks together aeating nothing out of half the gold and silver dishes as has ever been lent for the purpose out of Storrses and Mortimerses or Garrardses and Davenportseseses
Excited as it appeared by a sense of injury I thought he would never have found an end for the last word
But at length it rolled sullenly away with the thunder
Pardon me said I you are a wellfavoured wellmade man and yet  forgive me  I find on examining my mind that I associate you with  that my recollection indistinctly makes you in short  excuse me  a kind of powerful monster
It would be a wonder if it didnt he said
Do you know what my points are
No said I
My throat and my legs said he
When I dont set for a head I mostly sets for a throat and a pair of legs
Now granted you was a painter and was to work at my throat for a week together I suppose youd see a lot of lumps and bumps there that would never be there at all if you looked at me complete instead of only my throat
Wouldnt you
Probably said I surveying him
Why it stands to reason said the Model
Work another week at my legs and itll be the same thing
Youll make em out as knotty and as knobby at last as if they was the trunks of two old trees
Then take and stick my legs and throat on to another mans body and youll make a reglar monster
And thats the way the public gets their reglar monsters every first Monday in May when the Royal Academy Exhibition opens
You are a critic said I with an air of deference
Im in an uncommon ill humour if thats it rejoined the Model with great indignation
As if it warnt bad enough for a bob a hour for a man to be mixing himself up with that there jolly old furniter that one ud think the public knowd the wery nails in by this time  or to be putting on greasy old ats and cloaks and playing tambourines in the Bay o Naples with Wesuvius a smokin according to pattern in the background and the wines a bearing wonderful in the middle distance  or to be unpolitely kicking up his legs among a lot o gals with no reason whatever in his mind but to show em  as if this warnt bad enough Im to go and be thrown out of employment too
Surely no
said I
Surely yes said the indignant Model
BUT ILL GROW ONE
The gloomy and threatening manner in which he muttered the last words can never be effaced from my remembrance
My blood ran cold
I asked of myself what was it that this desperate Being was resolved to grow
My breast made no response
I ventured to implore him to explain his meaning
With a scornful laugh he uttered this dark prophecy ILL GROW ONE
AND MARK MY WORDS IT SHALL HAUNT YOU
We parted in the storm after I had forced halfacrown on his acceptance with a trembling hand
I conclude that something supernatural happened to the steamboat as it bore his reeking figure down the river but it never got into the papers
Two years elapsed during which I followed my profession without any vicissitudes never holding so much as a motion of course
At the expiration of that period I found myself making my way home to the Temple one night in precisely such another storm of thunder and lightning as that by which I had been overtaken on board the steamboat  except that this storm bursting over the town at midnight was rendered much more awful by the darkness and the hour
As I turned into my court I really thought a thunderbolt would fall and plough the pavement up
Every brick and stone in the place seemed to have an echo of its own for the thunder
The waterspouts were overcharged and the rain came tearing down from the housetops as if they had been mountaintops
Mrs Parkins my laundress  wife of Parkins the porter then newly dead of a dropsy  had particular instructions to place a bedroom candle and a match under the staircase lamp on my landing in order that I might light my candle there whenever I came home
Mrs Parkins invariably disregarding all instructions they were never there
Thus it happened that on this occasion I groped my way into my sittingroom to find the candle and came out to light it
What were my emotions when underneath the staircase lamp shining with wet as if he had never been dry since our last meeting stood the mysterious Being whom I had encountered on the steamboat in a thunderstorm two years before
His prediction rushed upon my mind and I turned faint
I said Id do it he observed in a hollow voice and I have done it
May I come in
Misguided creature what have you done
I returned
Ill let you know was his reply if youll let me in
Could it be murder that he had done
And had he been so successful that he wanted to do it again at my expense
I hesitated
May I come in
said he
I inclined my head with as much presence of mind as I could command and he followed me into my chambers
There I saw that the lower part of his face was tied up in what is commonly called a Belcher handkerchief
He slowly removed this bandage and exposed to view a long dark beard curling over his upper lip twisting about the corners of his mouth and hanging down upon his breast
What is this
I exclaimed involuntarily and what have you become
I am the Ghost of Art
said he
The effect of these words slowly uttered in the thunderstorm at midnight was appalling in the last degree
More dead than alive I surveyed him in silence
The German taste came up said he and threw me out of bread
I am ready for the taste now
He made his beard a little jagged with his hands folded his arms and said Severity
I shuddered
It was so severe
He made his beard flowing on his breast and leaning both hands on the staff of a carpetbroom which Mrs Parkins had left among my books said Benevolence
I stood transfixed
The change of sentiment was entirely in the beard
The man might have left his face alone or had no face
The beard did everything
He lay down on his back on my table and with that action of his head threw up his beard at the chin
Thats death
said he
He got off my table and looking up at the ceiling cocked his beard a little awry at the same time making it stick out before him
Adoration or a vow of vengeance he observed
He turned his profile to me making his upper lip very bulky with the upper part of his beard
Romantic character said he
He looked sideways out of his beard as if it were an ivybush
Jealousy said he
He gave it an ingenious twist in the air and informed me that he was carousing
He made it shaggy with his fingers  and it was Despair lank  and it was avarice tossed it all kinds of ways  and it was rage
The beard did everything
I am the Ghost of Art said he
Two bob aday now and more when its longer
Hairs the true expression
There is no other
I SAID ID GROW IT AND IVE GROWN IT AND IT SHALL HAUNT YOU
He may have tumbled downstairs in the dark but he never walked down or ran down
I looked over the banisters and I was alone with the thunder
Need I add more of my terrific fate
IT HAS haunted me ever since
It glares upon me from the walls of the Royal Academy except when MACLISE subdues it to his genius it fills my soul with terror at the British Institution it lures young artists on to their destruction
Go where I will the Ghost of Art eternally working the passions in hair and expressing everything by beard pursues me
The prediction is accomplished and the victim has no rest
OUT OF TOWN SITTING on a bright September morning among my books and papers at my open window on the cliff overhanging the seabeach I have the sky and ocean framed before me like a beautiful picture
A beautiful picture but with such movement in it such changes of light upon the sails of ships and wake of steamboats such dazzling gleams of silver far out at sea such fresh touches on the crisp wavetops as they break and roll towards me  a picture with such music in the billowy rush upon the shingle the blowing of morning wind through the cornsheaves where the farmers waggons are busy the singing of the larks and the distant voices of children at play  such charms of sight and sound as all the Galleries on earth can but poorly suggest
So dreamy is the murmur of the sea below my window that I may have been here for anything I know one hundred years
Not that I have grown old for daily on the neighbouring downs and grassy hill sides I find that I can still in reason walk any distance jump over anything and climb up anywhere but that the sound of the ocean seems to have become so customary to my musings and other realities seem so to have gone aboard ship and floated away over the horizon that for aught I will undertake to the contrary I am the enchanted son of the King my father shut up in a tower on the seashore for protection against an old shegoblin who insisted on being my godmother and who foresaw at the font  wonderful creature
 that I should get into a scrape before I was twenty one
I remember to have been in a City my Royal parents dominions I suppose and apparently not long ago either that was in the dreariest condition
The principal inhabitants had all been changed into old newspapers and in that form were preserving their windowblinds from dust and wrapping all their smaller household gods in curlpapers
I walked through gloomy streets where every house was shut up and newspapered and where my solitary footsteps echoed on the deserted pavements
In the public rides there were no carriages no horses no animated existence but a few sleepy policemen and a few adventurous boys taking advantage of the devastation to swarm up the lampposts
In the Westward streets there was no traffic in the Westward shops no business
The waterpatterns which the Prentices had trickled out on the pavements early in the morning remained uneffaced by human feet
At the corners of mews CochinChina fowls stalked gaunt and savage nobody being left in the deserted city as it appeared to me to feed them
Public Houses where splendid footmen swinging their legs over gorgeous hammercloths beside wigged coachmen were wont to regale were silent and the unused pewter pots shone too bright for business on the shelves
I beheld a Punchs Show leaning against a wall near Park Lane as if it had fainted
It was deserted and there were none to heed its desolation
In Belgrave Square I met the last man  an ostler  sitting on a post in a ragged red waistcoat eating straw and mildewing away
If I recollect the name of the little town on whose shore this sea is murmuring  but I am not just now as I have premised to be relied upon for anything  it is Pavilionstone
Within a quarter of a century it was a little fishing town and they do say that the time was when it was a little smuggling town
I have heard that it was rather famous in the hollands and brandy way and that coevally with that reputation the lamplighters was considered a bad life at the Assurance Offices
It was observed that if he were not particular about lighting up he lived in peace but that if he made the best of the oillamps in the steep and narrow streets he usually fell over the cliff at an early age
Now gas and electricity run to the very waters edge and the SouthEastern Railway Company screech at us in the dead of night
But the old little fishing and smuggling town remains and is so tempting a place for the latter purpose that I think of going out some night next week in a fur cap and a pair of petticoat trousers and running an empty tub as a kind of archaeological pursuit
Let nobody with corns come to Pavilionstone for there are breakneck flights of ragged steps connecting the principal streets by backways which will cripple that visitor in half an hour
These are the ways by which when I run that tub I shall escape
I shall make a Thermopylae of the corner of one of them defend it with my cutlass against the coastguard until my brave companions have sheered off then dive into the darkness and regain my Susans arms
In connection with these breakneck steps I observe some wooden cottages with tumbledown outhouses and backyards three feet square adorned with garlands of dried fish in one of which though the General Board of Health might object my Susan dwells
The SouthEastern Company have brought Pavilionstone into such vogue with their tidal trains and splendid steampackets that a new Pavilionstone is rising up
I am myself of New Pavilionstone
We are a little mortary and limey at present but we are getting on capitally
Indeed we were getting on so fast at one time that we rather overdid it and built a street of shops the business of which may be expected to arrive in about ten years
We are sensibly laid out in general and with a little care and pains by no means wanting so far shall become a very pretty place
We ought to be for our situation is delightful our air is delicious and our breezy hills and downs carpeted with wild thyme and decorated with millions of wild flowers are on the faith of a pedestrian perfect
In New Pavilionstone we are a little too much addicted to small windows with more bricks in them than glass and we are not overfanciful in the way of decorative architecture and we get unexpected seaviews through cracks in the street doors on the whole however we are very snug and comfortable and well accommodated
But the Home Secretary if there be such an officer cannot too soon shut up the burialground of the old parish church
It is in the midst of us and Pavilionstone will get no good of it if it be too long left alone
The lion of Pavilionstone is its Great Hotel
A dozen years ago going over to Paris by SouthEastern Tidal Steamer you used to be dropped upon the platform of the main line Pavilionstone Station not a junction then at eleven oclock on a dark winters night in a roaring wind and in the howling wilderness outside the station was a short omnibus which brought you up by the forehead the instant you got in at the door and nobody cared about you and you were alone in the world
You bumped over infinite chalk until you were turned out at a strange building which had just left off being a barn without having quite begun to be a house where nobody expected your coming or knew what to do with you when you were come and where you were usually blown about until you happened to be blown against the cold beef and finally into bed
At five in the morning you were blown out of bed and after a dreary breakfast with crumpled company in the midst of confusion were hustled on board a steamboat and lay wretched on deck until you saw France lunging and surging at you with great vehemence over the bowsprit
Now you come down to Pavilionstone in a free and easy manner an irresponsible agent made over in trust to the SouthEastern Company until you get out of the railwaycarriage at highwater mark
If you are crossing by the boat at once you have nothing to do but walk on board and be happy there if you can  I cant
If you are going to our Great Pavilionstone Hotel the sprightliest porters under the sun whose cheerful looks are a pleasant welcome shoulder your luggage drive it off in vans bowl it away in trucks and enjoy themselves in playing athletic games with it
If you are for public life at our great Pavilionstone Hotel you walk into that establishment as if it were your club and find ready for you your newsroom diningroom smokingroom billiardroom musicroom public breakfast public dinner twice aday one plain one gorgeous hot baths and cold baths
If you want to be bored there are plenty of bores always ready for you and from Saturday to Monday in particular you can be bored if you like it through and through
Should you want to be private at our Great Pavilionstone Hotel say but the word look at the list of charges choose your floor name your figure  there you are established in your castle by the day week month or year innocent of all comers or goers unless you have my fancy for walking early in the morning down the groves of boots and shoes which so regularly flourish at all the chamberdoors before breakfast that it seems to me as if nobody ever got up or took them in
Are you going across the Alps and would you like to air your Italian at our Great Pavilionstone Hotel
Talk to the Manager  always conversational accomplished and polite
Do you want to be aided abetted comforted or advised at our Great Pavilionstone Hotel
Send for the good landlord and he is your friend
Should you or any one belonging to you ever be taken ill at our Great Pavilionstone Hotel you will not soon forget him or his kind wife
And when you pay your bill at our Great Pavilionstone Hotel you will not be put out of humour by anything you find in it
A thoroughly good inn in the days of coaching and posting was a noble place
But no such inn would have been equal to the reception of four or five hundred people all of them wet through and half of them dead sick every day in the year
This is where we shine in our Pavilionstone Hotel
Again  who coming and going pitching and tossing boating and training hurrying in and flying out could ever have calculated the fees to be paid at an oldfashioned house
In our Pavilionstone Hotel vocabulary there is no such word as fee
Everything is done for you every service is provided at a fixed and reasonable charge all the prices are hung up in all the rooms and you can make out your own bill beforehand as well as the bookkeeper
In the case of your being a pictorial artist desirous of studying at small expense the physiognomies and beards of different nations come on receipt of this to Pavilionstone
You shall find all the nations of the earth and all the styles of shaving and not shaving hair cutting and hair letting alone for ever flowing through our hotel
Couriers you shall see by hundreds fat leathern bags for fivefranc pieces closing with violent snaps like discharges of firearms by thousands more luggage in a morning than fifty years ago all Europe saw in a week
Looking at trains steamboats sick travellers and luggage is our great Pavilionstone recreation
We are not strong in other public amusements
We have a Literary and Scientific Institution and we have a Working Mens Institution  may it hold many gipsy holidays in summer fields with the kettle boiling the band of music playing and the people dancing and may I be on the hillside looking on with pleasure at a wholesome sight too rare in England
 and we have two or three churches and more chapels than I have yet added up
But public amusements are scarce with us
If a poor theatrical manager comes with his company to give us in a loft Mary Bax or the Murder on the Sand Hills we dont care much for him  starve him out in fact
We take more kindly to waxwork especially if it moves in which case it keeps much clearer of the second commandment than when it is still
Cookes Circus Mr Cooke is my friend and always leaves a good name behind him gives us only a night in passing through
Nor does the travelling menagerie think us worth a longer visit
It gave us a lookin the other day bringing with it the residentiary van with the stained glass windows which Her Majesty kept readymade at Windsor Castle until she found a suitable opportunity of submitting it for the proprietors acceptance
I brought away five wonderments from this exhibition
I have wondered ever since Whether the beasts ever do get used to those small places of confinement Whether the monkeys have that very horrible flavour in their free state Whether wild animals have a natural ear for time and tune and therefore every fourfooted creature began to howl in despair when the band began to play What the giraffe does with his neck when his cart is shut up and Whether the elephant feels ashamed of himself when he is brought out of his den to stand on his head in the presence of the whole Collection
We are a tidal harbour at Pavilionstone as indeed I have implied already in my mention of tidal trains
At low water we are a heap of mud with an empty channel in it where a couple of men in big boots always shovel and scoop with what exact object I am unable to say
At that time all the stranded fishingboats turn over on their sides as if they were dead marine monsters the colliers and other shipping stick disconsolate in the mud the steamers look as if their white chimneys would never smoke more and their red paddles never turn again the green seaslime and weed upon the rough stones at the entrance seem records of obsolete high tides never more to flow the flagstaffhalyards droop the very little wooden lighthouse shrinks in the idle glare of the sun
And here I may observe of the very little wooden lighthouse that when it is lighted at night  red and green  it looks so like a medical mans that several distracted husbands have at various times been found on occasions of premature domestic anxiety going round and round it trying to find the Nightbell
But the moment the tide begins to make the Pavilionstone Harbour begins to revive
It feels the breeze of the rising water before the water comes and begins to flutter and stir
When the little shallow waves creep in barely overlapping one another the vanes at the mastheads wake and become agitated
As the tide rises the fishingboats get into good spirits and dance the flagstaff hoists a bright red flag the steamboat smokes cranes creak horses and carriages dangle in the air stray passengers and luggage appear
Now the shipping is afloat and comes up buoyantly to look at the wharf
Now the carts that have come down for coals load away as hard as they can load
Now the steamer smokes immensely and occasionally blows at the paddleboxes like a vaporous whale greatly disturbing nervous loungers
Now both the tide and the breeze have risen and you are holding your hat on if you want to see how the ladies hold THEIR hats on with a stay passing over the broad brim and down the nose come to Pavilionstone
Now everything in the harbour splashes dashes and bobs
Now the Down Tidal Train is telegraphed and you know without knowing how you know that two hundred and eightyseven people are coming
Now the fishingboats that have been out sail in at the top of the tide
Now the bell goes and the locomotive hisses and shrieks and the train comes gliding in and the two hundred and eightyseven come scuffling out
Now there is not only a tide of water but a tide of people and a tide of luggage  all tumbling and flowing and bouncing about together
Now after infinite bustle the steamer steams out and we on the Pier are all delighted when she rolls as if she would roll her funnel out and all are disappointed when she dont
Now the other steamer is coming in and the Custom House prepares and the wharflabourers assemble and the hawsers are made ready and the Hotel Porters come rattling down with van and truck eager to begin more Olympic games with more luggage
And this is the way in which we go on down at Pavilionstone every tide
And if you want to live a life of luggage or to see it lived or to breathe sweet air which will send you to sleep at a moments notice at any period of the day or night or to disport yourself upon or in the sea or to scamper about Kent or to come out of town for the enjoyment of all or any of these pleasures come to Pavilionstone
OUT OF THE SEASON IT fell to my lot this last bleak Spring to find myself in a wateringplace out of the Season
A vicious northeast squall blew me into it from foreign parts and I tarried in it alone for three days resolved to be exceedingly busy
On the first day I began business by looking for two hours at the sea and staring the Foreign Militia out of countenance
Having disposed of these important engagements I sat down at one of the two windows of my room intent on doing something desperate in the way of literary composition and writing a chapter of unheardof excellence  with which the present essay has no connexion
It is a remarkable quality in a wateringplace out of the season that everything in it will and must be looked at
I had no previous suspicion of this fatal truth but the moment I sat down to write I began to perceive it
I had scarcely fallen into my most promising attitude and dipped my pen in the ink when I found the clock upon the pier  a redfaced clock with a white rim  importuning me in a highly vexatious manner to consult my watch and see how I was off for Greenwich time
Having no intention of making a voyage or taking an observation I had not the least need of Greenwich time and could have put up with wateringplace time as a sufficiently accurate article
The pierclock however persisting I felt it necessary to lay down my pen compare my watch with him and fall into a grave solicitude about half seconds
I had taken up my pen again and was about to commence that valuable chapter when a Customhouse cutter under the window requested that I would hold a naval review of her immediately
It was impossible under the circumstances for any mental resolution merely human to dismiss the Customhouse cutter because the shadow of her topmast fell upon my paper and the vane played on the masterly blank chapter
I was therefore under the necessity of going to the other window sitting astride of the chair there like Napoleon bivouacking in the print and inspecting the cutter as she lay all that day in the way of my chapter O
She was rigged to carry a quantity of canvas but her hull was so very small that four giants aboard of her three men and a boy who were vigilantly scraping at her all together inspired me with a terror lest they should scrape her away
A fifth giant who appeared to consider himself below  as indeed he was from the waist downwards  meditated in such close proximity with the little gusty chimneypipe that he seemed to be smoking it
Several boys looked on from the wharf and when the gigantic attention appeared to be fully occupied one or other of these would furtively swing himself in midair over the Customhouse cutter by means of a line pendant from her rigging like a young spirit of the storm
Presently a sixth hand brought down two little watercasks presently afterwards a truck came and delivered a hamper
I was now under an obligation to consider that the cutter was going on a cruise and to wonder where she was going and when she was going and why she was going and at what date she might be expected back and who commanded her
With these pressing questions I was fully occupied when the Packet making ready to go across and blowing off her spare steam roared Look at me
It became a positive duty to look at the Packet preparing to go across aboard of which the people newly come down by the rail road were hurrying in a great fluster
The crew had got their tarry overalls on  and one knew what THAT meant  not to mention the white basins ranged in neat little piles of a dozen each behind the door of the aftercabin
One lady as I looked one resigning and farseeing woman took her basin from the store of crockery as she might have taken a refreshmentticket laid herself down on deck with that utensil at her ear muffled her feet in one shawl solemnly covered her countenance after the antique manner with another and on the completion of these preparations appeared by the strength of her volition to become insensible
The mailbags O that I myself had the sealegs of a mailbag
were tumbled aboard the Packet left off roaring warped out and made at the white line upon the bar
One dip one roll one break of the sea over her bows and Moores Almanack or the sage Raphael could not have told me more of the state of things aboard than I knew
The famous chapter was all but begun now and would have been quite begun but for the wind
It was blowing stiffly from the east and it rumbled in the chimney and shook the house
That was not much but looking out into the winds grey eye for inspiration I laid down my pen again to make the remark to myself how emphatically everything by the sea declares that it has a great concern in the state of the wind
The trees blown all one way the defences of the harbour reared highest and strongest against the raging point the shingle flung up on the beach from the same direction the number of arrows pointed at the common enemy the sea tumbling in and rushing towards them as if it were inflamed by the sight
This put it in my head that I really ought to go out and take a walk in the wind so I gave up the magnificent chapter for that day entirely persuading myself that I was under a moral obligation to have a blow
I had a good one and that on the high road  the very high road  on the top of the cliffs where I met the stagecoach with all the outsides holding their hats on and themselves too and overtook a flock of sheep with the wool about their necks blown into such great ruffs that they looked like fleecy owls
The wind played upon the lighthouse as if it were a great whistle the spray was driven over the sea in a cloud of haze the ships rolled and pitched heavily and at intervals long slants and flaws of light made mountainsteeps of communication between the ocean and the sky
A walk of ten miles brought me to a seaside town without a cliff which like the town I had come from was out of the season too
Half of the houses were shut up half of the other half were to let the town might have done as much business as it was doing then if it had been at the bottom of the sea
Nobody seemed to flourish save the attorney his clerks pen was going in the bow window of his wooden house his brass doorplate alone was free from salt and had been polished up that morning
On the beach among the rough buggers and capstans groups of stormbeaten boatmen like a sort of marine monsters watched under the lee of those objects or stood leaning forward against the wind looking out through battered spyglasses
The parlour bell in the Admiral Benbow had grown so flat with being out of the season that neither could I hear it ring when I pulled the handle for lunch nor could the young woman in black stockings and strong shoes who acted as waiter out of the season until it had been tinkled three times
Admiral Benbows cheese was out of the season but his homemade bread was good and his beer was perfect
Deluded by some earlier spring day which had been warm and sunny the Admiral had cleared the firing out of his parlour stove and had put some flowerpots in  which was amiable and hopeful in the Admiral but not judicious the room being at that present visiting transcendantly cold
I therefore took the liberty of peeping out across a little stone passage into the Admirals kitchen and seeing a high settle with its back towards me drawn out in front of the Admirals kitchen fire I strolled in bread and cheese in hand munching and looking about
One landsman and two boatmen were seated on the settle smoking pipes and drinking beer out of thick pint crockery mugs  mugs peculiar to such places with particoloured rings round them and ornaments between the rings like frayedout roots
The landsman was relating his experience as yet only three nights old of a fearful runningdown case in the Channel and therein presented to my imagination a sound of music that it will not soon forget
At that identical moment of time said he he was a prosy man by nature who rose with his subject the night being light and calm but with a grey mist upon the water that didnt seem to spread for more than two or three mile I was walking up and down the wooden causeway next the pier off where it happened along with a friend of mine which his name is Mr Clocker
Mr Clocker is a grocer over yonder
From the direction in which he pointed the bowl of his pipe I might have judged Mr Clocker to be a merman established in the grocery trade in fiveandtwenty fathoms of water
We were smoking our pipes and walking up and down the causeway talking of one thing and talking of another
We were quite alone there except that a few hovellers the Kentish name for longshore boatmen like his companions were hanging about their lugs waiting while the tide made as hovellers will
One of the two boatmen thoughtfully regarding me shut up one eye this I understood to mean first that he took me into the conversation secondly that he confirmed the proposition thirdly that he announced himself as a hoveller
All of a sudden Mr Clocker and me stood rooted to the spot by hearing a sound come through the stillness right over the sea LIKE A GREAT SORROWFUL FLUTE OR AEOLIAN HARP
We didnt in the least know what it was and judge of our surprise when we saw the hovellers to a man leap into the boats and tear about to hoist sail and get off as if they had every one of em gone in a moment raving mad
But THEY knew it was the cry of distress from the sinking emigrant ship
When I got back to my wateringplace out of the season and had done my twenty miles in good style I found that the celebrated Black Mesmerist intended favouring the public that evening in the Hall of the Muses which he had engaged for the purpose
After a good dinner seated by the fire in an easy chair I began to waver in a design I had formed of waiting on the Black Mesmerist and to incline towards the expediency of remaining where I was
Indeed a point of gallantry was involved in my doing so inasmuch as I had not left France alone but had come from the prisons of St Pelagie with my distinguished and unfortunate friend Madame Roland in two volumes which I bought for two francs each at the bookstall in the Place de la Concorde Paris at the corner of the Rue Royale
Deciding to pass the evening teteatete with Madame Roland I derived as I always do great pleasure from that spiritual womans society and the charms of her brave soul and engaging conversation
I must confess that if she had only some more faults only a few more passionate failings of any kind I might love her better but I am content to believe that the deficiency is in me and not in her
We spent some sadly interesting hours together on this occasion and she told me again of her cruel discharge from the Abbaye and of her being rearrested before her free feet had sprung lightly up halfadozen steps of her own staircase and carried off to the prison which she only left for the guillotine
Madame Roland and I took leave of one another before midnight and I went to bed full of vast intentions for next day in connexion with the unparalleled chapter
To hear the foreign mailsteamers coming in at dawn of day and to know that I was not aboard or obliged to get up was very comfortable so I rose for the chapter in great force
I had advanced so far as to sit down at my window again on my second morning and to write the first halfline of the chapter and strike it out not liking it when my conscience reproached me with not having surveyed the wateringplace out of the season after all yesterday but with having gone straight out of it at the rate of four miles and a half an hour
Obviously the best amends that I could make for this remissness was to go and look at it without another moments delay
So  altogether as a matter of duty  I gave up the magnificent chapter for another day and sauntered out with my hands in my pockets
All the houses and lodgings ever let to visitors were to let that morning
It seemed to have snowed bills with To Let upon them
This put me upon thinking what the owners of all those apartments did out of the season how they employed their time and occupied their minds
They could not be always going to the Methodist chapels of which I passed one every other minute
They must have some other recreation
Whether they pretended to take one anothers lodgings and opened one anothers teacaddies in fun
Whether they cut slices off their own beef and mutton and made believe that it belonged to somebody else
Whether they played little dramas of life as children do and said I ought to come and look at your apartments and you ought to ask two guineas a week too much and then I ought to say I must have the rest of the day to think of it and then you ought to say that another lady and gentleman with no children in family had made an offer very close to your own terms and you had passed your word to give them a positive answer in half an hour and indeed were just going to take the bill down when you heard the knock and then I ought to take them you know
Twenty such speculations engaged my thoughts
Then after passing still clinging to the walls defaced rags of the bills of last years Circus I came to a back field near a timberyard where the Circus itself had been and where there was yet a sort of monkish tonsure on the grass indicating the spot where the young lady had gone round upon her pet steed Firefly in her daring flight
Turning into the town again I came among the shops and they were emphatically out of the season
The chemist had no boxes of gingerbeer powders no beautifying seaside soaps and washes no attractive scents nothing but his great goggleeyed red bottles looking as if the winds of winter and the drift of the saltsea had inflamed them
The grocers hot pickles Harveys Sauce Doctor Kitcheners Zest Anchovy Paste Dundee Marmalade and the whole stock of luxurious helps to appetite were hybernating somewhere underground
The chinashop had no trifles from anywhere
The Bazaar had given in altogether and presented a notice on the shutters that this establishment would reopen at Whitsuntide and that the proprietor in the meantime might be heard of at Wild Lodge East Cliff
At the Seabathing Establishment a row of neat little wooden houses seven or eight feet high I SAW the proprietor in bed in the showerbath
As to the bathing machines they were how they got there is not for me to say at the top of a hill at least a mile and a half off
The library which I had never seen otherwise than wide open was tight shut and two peevish bald old gentlemen seemed to be hermetically sealed up inside eternally reading the paper
That wonderful mystery the musicshop carried it off as usual except that it had more cabinet pianos in stock as if season or no season were all one to it
It made the same prodigious display of bright brazen wind instruments horribly twisted worth as I should conceive some thousands of pounds and which it is utterly impossible that anybody in any season can ever play or want to play
It had five triangles in the window six pairs of castanets and three harps likewise every polka with a coloured frontispiece that ever was published from the original one where a smooth male and female Pole of high rank are coming at the observer with their arms a kimbo to the Ratcatchers Daughter
Astonishing establishment amazing enigma
Three other shops were pretty much out of the season what they were used to be in it
First the shop where they sell the sailors watches which had still the old collection of enormous timekeepers apparently designed to break a fall from the masthead with places to wind them up like fireplugs
Secondly the shop where they sell the sailors clothing which displayed the old souwesters and the old oily suits and the old peajackets and the old one seachest with its handles like a pair of rope earrings
Thirdly the unchangeable shop for the sale of literature that has been left behind
Here Dr Faustus was still going down to very red and yellow perdition under the superintendence of three green personages of a scaly humour with excrescential serpents growing out of their bladebones
Here the Golden Dreamer and the Norwood Fortune Teller were still on sale at sixpence each with instructions for making the dumb cake and reading destinies in teacups and with a picture of a young woman with a high waist lying on a sofa in an attitude so uncomfortable as almost to account for her dreaming at one and the same time of a conflagration a shipwreck an earthquake a skeleton a church porch lightning funerals performed and a young man in a bright blue coat and canary pantaloons
Here were Little Warblers and Fairburns Comic Songsters
Here too were ballads on the old ballad paper and in the old confusion of types with an old man in a cocked hat and an armchair for the illustration to Will Watch the bold Smuggler and the Friar of Orders Grey represented by a little girl in a hoop with a ship in the distance
All these as of yore when they were infinite delights to me
It took me so long fully to relish these many enjoyments that I had not more than an hour before bedtime to devote to Madame Roland
We got on admirably together on the subject of her convent education and I rose next morning with the full conviction that the day for the great chapter was at last arrived
It had fallen calm however in the night and as I sat at breakfast I blushed to remember that I had not yet been on the Downs
I a walker and not yet on the Downs
Really on so quiet and bright a morning this must be set right
As an essential part of the Whole Duty of Man therefore I left the chapter to itself  for the present  and went on the Downs
They were wonderfully green and beautiful and gave me a good deal to do
When I had done with the free air and the view I had to go down into the valley and look after the hops which I know nothing about and to be equally solicitous as to the cherry orchards
Then I took it on myself to crossexamine a tramping family in black mother alleged I have no doubt by herself in person to have died last week and to accompany eighteenpence which produced a great effect with moral admonitions which produced none at all
Finally it was late in the afternoon before I got back to the unprecedented chapter and then I determined that it was out of the season as the place was and put it away
I went at night to the benefit of Mrs B Wedgington at the Theatre who had placarded the town with the admonition DONT FORGET IT
I made the house according to my calculation four and ninepence to begin with and it may have warmed up in the course of the evening to half a sovereign
There was nothing to offend any one  the good Mr Baines of Leeds excepted
Mrs B Wedgington sang to a grand piano
Mr B Wedgington did the like and also took off his coat tucked up his trousers and danced in clogs
Master B Wedgington aged ten months was nursed by a shivering young person in the boxes and the eye of Mrs B Wedgington wandered that way more than once
Peace be with all the Wedgingtons from A to Z
May they find themselves in the Season somewhere
A POOR MANS TALE OF A PATENT I AM not used to writing for print
What workingman that never labours less some Mondays and Christmas Time and Easter Time excepted than twelve or fourteen hours a day is
But I have been asked to put down plain what I have got to say and so I take penandink and do it to the best of my power hoping defects will find excuse
I was born nigh London but have worked in a shop at Birmingham what you would call Manufactories we call Shops almost ever since I was out of my time
I served my apprenticeship at Deptford nigh where I was born and I am a smith by trade
My name is John
I have been called Old John ever since I was nineteen year of age on account of not having much hair
I am fiftysix year of age at the present time and I dont find myself with more hair nor yet with less to signify than at nineteen year of age aforesaid
I have been married five and thirty year come next April
I was married on All Fools Day
Let them laugh that will
I won a good wife that day and it was as sensible a day to me as ever I had
We have had a matter of ten children six whereof are living
My eldest son is engineer in the Italian steampacket Mezzo Giorno plying between Marseilles and Naples and calling at Genoa Leghorn and Civita Vecchia
He was a good workman
He invented a many useful little things that brought him in  nothing
I have two sons doing well at Sydney New South Wales  single when last heard from
One of my sons James went wild and for a soldier where he was shot in India living six weeks in hospital with a musketball lodged in his shoulderblade which he wrote with his own hand
He was the best looking
One of my two daughters Mary is comfortable in her circumstances but water on the chest
The other Charlotte her husband run away from her in the basest manner and she and her three children live with us
The youngest six year old has a turn for mechanics
I am not a Chartist and I never was
I dont mean to say but what I see a good many public points to complain of still I dont think thats the way to set them right
If I did think so I should be a Chartist
But I dont think so and I am not a Chartist
I read the paper and hear discussion at what we call a parlour in Birmingham and I know many good men and workmen who are Chartists
Note
Not Physical force
It wont be took as boastful in me if I make the remark for I cant put down what I have got to say without putting that down before going any further that I have always been of an ingenious turn
I once got twenty pound by a screw and its in use now
I have been twenty year off and on completing an Invention and perfecting it
I perfected of it last Christmas Eve at ten oclock at night
Me and my wife stood and let some tears fall over the Model when it was done and I brought her in to take a look at it
A friend of mine by the name of William Butcher is a Chartist
Moderate
He is a good speaker
He is very animated
I have often heard him deliver that what is at every turn in the way of us workingmen is that too many places have been made in the course of time to provide for people that never ought to have been provided for and that we have to obey forms and to pay fees to support those places when we shouldnt ought
True delivers William Butcher all the public has to do this but it falls heaviest on the workingman because he has least to spare and likewise because impediments shouldnt be put in his way when he wants redress of wrong or furtherance of right
Note
I have wrote down those words from William Butchers own mouth
W B delivering them fresh for the aforesaid purpose
Now to my Model again
There it was perfected of on Christmas Eve gone nigh a year at ten oclock at night
All the money I could spare I had laid out upon the Model and when times was bad or my daughter Charlottes children sickly or both it had stood still months at a spell
I had pulled it to pieces and made it over again with improvements I dont know how often
There it stood at last a perfected Model as aforesaid
William Butcher and me had a long talk Christmas Day respecting of the Model
William is very sensible
But sometimes cranky
William said What will you do with it John
I said Patent it
William said How patent it John
I said By taking out a Patent
William then delivered that the law of Patent was a cruel wrong
William said John if you make your invention public before you get a Patent any one may rob you of the fruits of your hard work
You are put in a cleft stick John
Either you must drive a bargain very much against yourself by getting a party to come forward beforehand with the great expenses of the Patent or you must be put about from post to pillar among so many parties trying to make a better bargain for yourself and showing your invention that your invention will be took from you over your head
I said William Butcher are you cranky
You are sometimes cranky
William said No John I tell you the truth which he then delivered more at length
I said to W B I would Patent the invention myself
My wifes brother George Bury of West Bromwich his wife unfortunately took to drinking made away with everything and seventeen times committed to Birmingham Jail before happy release in every point of view left my wife his sister when he died a legacy of one hundred and twentyeight pound ten Bank of England Stocks
Me and my wife never broke into that money yet
Note
We might come to be old and past our work
We now agreed to Patent the invention
We said we would make a hole in it  I mean in the aforesaid money  and Patent the invention
William Butcher wrote me a letter to Thomas Joy in London
T J is a carpenter six foot four in height and plays quoits well
He lives in Chelsea London by the church
I got leave from the shop to be took on again when I come back
I am a good workman
Not a Teetotaller but never drunk
When the Christmas holidays were over I went up to London by the Parliamentary Train and hired a lodging for a week with Thomas Joy
He is married
He has one son gone to sea
Thomas Joy delivered from a book he had that the first step to be took in Patenting the invention was to prepare a petition unto Queen Victoria
William Butcher had delivered similar and drawn it up
Note
William is a ready writer
A declaration before a Master in Chancery was to be added to it
That we likewise drew up
After a deal of trouble I found out a Master in Southampton Buildings Chancery Lane nigh Temple Bar where I made the declaration and paid eighteenpence
I was told to take the declaration and petition to the Home Office in Whitehall where I left it to be signed by the Home Secretary after I had found the office out and where I paid two pound two and sixpence
In six days he signed it and I was told to take it to the Attorney Generals chambers and leave it there for a report
I did so and paid four pound four
Note
Nobody all through ever thankful for their money but all uncivil
My lodging at Thomas Joys was now hired for another week whereof five days were gone
The AttorneyGeneral made what they called a Reportofcourse my invention being as William Butcher had delivered before starting unopposed and I was sent back with it to the Home Office
They made a Copy of it which was called a Warrant
For this warrant I paid seven pound thirteen and six
It was sent to the Queen to sign
The Queen sent it back signed
The Home Secretary signed it again
The gentleman throwed it at me when I called and said Now take it to the Patent Office in Lincolns Inn
I was then in my third week at Thomas Joys living very sparing on account of fees
I found myself losing heart
At the Patent Office in Lincolns Inn they made a draft of the Queens bill of my invention and a docket of the bill
I paid five pound ten and six for this
They engrossed two copies of the bill one for the Signet Office and one for the PrivySeal Office
I paid one pound seven and six for this
Stamp duty over and above three pound
The Engrossing Clerk of the same office engrossed the Queens bill for signature
I paid him one pound one
Stampduty again one pound ten
I was next to take the Queens bill to the AttorneyGeneral again and get it signed again
I took it and paid five pound more
I fetched it away and took it to the Home Secretary again
He sent it to the Queen again
She signed it again
I paid seven pound thirteen and six more for this
I had been over a month at Thomas Joys
I was quite wore out patience and pocket
Thomas Joy delivered all this as it went on to William Butcher
William Butcher delivered it again to three Birmingham Parlours from which it got to all the other Parlours and was took as I have been told since right through all the shops in the North of England
Note
William Butcher delivered at his Parlour in a speech that it was a Patent way of making Chartists
But I hadnt nigh done yet
The Queens bill was to be took to the Signet Office in Somerset House Strand  where the stamp shop is
The Clerk of the Signet made a Signet bill for the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal
I paid him four pound seven
The Clerk of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal made a PrivySeal bill for the Lord Chancellor
I paid him four pound two
The PrivySeal bill was handed over to the Clerk of the Patents who engrossed the aforesaid
I paid him five pound seventeen and eight at the same time I paid Stampduty for the Patent in one lump thirty pound
I next paid for boxes for the Patent nine and sixpence
Note
Thomas Joy would have made the same at a profit for eighteenpence
I next paid fees to the Deputy the Lord Chancellors Pursebearer two pound two
I next paid fees to the Clerk of the Hanapar seven pound thirteen
I next paid fees to the Deputy Clerk of the Hanaper ten shillings
I next paid to the Lord Chancellor again one pound eleven and six
Last of all I paid fees to the Deputy Sealer and Deputy Chaff wax ten shillings and sixpence
I had lodged at Thomas Joys over six weeks and the unopposed Patent for my invention for England only had cost me ninetysix pound seven and eightpence
If I had taken it out for the United Kingdom it would have cost me more than three hundred pound
Now teaching had not come up but very limited when I was young
So much the worse for me youll say
I say the same
William Butcher is twenty year younger than me
He knows a hundred year more
If William Butcher had wanted to Patent an invention he might have been sharper than myself when hustled backwards and forwards among all those offices though I doubt if so patient
Note
William being sometimes cranky and consider porters messengers and clerks
Thereby I say nothing of my being tired of my life while I was Patenting my invention
But I put this Is it reasonable to make a man feel as if in inventing an ingenious improvement meant to do good he had done something wrong
How else can a man feel when he is met by such difficulties at every turn
All inventors taking out a Patent MUST feel so
And look at the expense
How hard on me and how hard on the country if theres any merit in me and my invention is took up now I am thankful to say and doing well to put me to all that expense before I can move a finger
Make the addition yourself and itll come to ninetysix pound seven and eightpence
No more and no less
What can I say against William Butcher about places
Look at the Home Secretary the AttorneyGeneral the Patent Office the Engrossing Clerk the Lord Chancellor the Privy Seal the Clerk of the Patents the Lord Chancellors Pursebearer the Clerk of the Hanaper the Deputy Clerk of the Hanaper the Deputy Sealer and the Deputy Chaffwax
No man in England could get a Patent for an Indianrubber band or an ironhoop without feeing all of them
Some of them over and over again
I went through thirtyfive stages
I began with the Queen upon the Throne
I ended with the Deputy Chaffwax
Note
I should like to see the Deputy Chaff wax
Is it a man or what is it
What I had to tell I have told
I have wrote it down
I hope its plain
Not so much in the handwriting though nothing to boast of there as in the sense of it
I will now conclude with Thomas Joy
Thomas said to me when we parted John if the laws of this country were as honest as they ought to be you would have come to London  registered an exact description and drawing of your invention  paid halfacrown or so for doing of it  and therein and thereby have got your Patent
My opinion is the same as Thomas Joy
Further
In William Butchers delivering that the whole gang of Hanapers and Chaff waxes must be done away with and that England has been chaffed and waxed sufficient I agree
THE NOBLE SAVAGE TO come to the point at once I beg to say that I have not the least belief in the Noble Savage
I consider him a prodigious nuisance and an enormous superstition
His calling rum fire water and me a pale face wholly fail to reconcile me to him
I dont care what he calls me
I call him a savage and I call a savage a something highly desirable to be civilised off the face of the earth
I think a mere gent which I take to be the lowest form of civilisation better than a howling whistling clucking stamping jumping tearing savage
It is all one to me whether he sticks a fishbone through his visage or bits of trees through the lobes of his ears or birds feathers in his head whether he flattens his hair between two boards or spreads his nose over the breadth of his face or drags his lower lip down by great weights or blackens his teeth or knocks them out or paints one cheek red and the other blue or tattoos himself or oils himself or rubs his body with fat or crimps it with knives
Yielding to whichsoever of these agreeable eccentricities he is a savage  cruel false thievish murderous addicted more or less to grease entrails and beastly customs a wild animal with the questionable gift of boasting a conceited tiresome bloodthirsty monotonous humbug
Yet it is extraordinary to observe how some people will talk about him as they talk about the good old times how they will regret his disappearance in the course of this worlds development from such and such lands where his absence is a blessed relief and an indispensable preparation for the sowing of the very first seeds of any influence that can exalt humanity how even with the evidence of himself before them they will either be determined to believe or will suffer themselves to be persuaded into believing that he is something which their five senses tell them he is not
There was Mr Catlin some few years ago with his Ojibbeway Indians
Mr Catlin was an energetic earnest man who had lived among more tribes of Indians than I need reckon up here and who had written a picturesque and glowing book about them
With his party of Indians squatting and spitting on the table before him or dancing their miserable jigs after their own dreary manner he called in all good faith upon his civilised audience to take notice of their symmetry and grace their perfect limbs and the exquisite expression of their pantomime and his civilised audience in all good faith complied and admired
Whereas as mere animals they were wretched creatures very low in the scale and very poorly formed and as men and women possessing any power of truthful dramatic expression by means of action they were no better than the chorus at an Italian Opera in England  and would have been worse if such a thing were possible
Mine are no new views of the noble savage
The greatest writers on natural history found him out long ago
BUFFON knew what he was and showed why he is the sulky tyrant that he is to his women and how it happens Heaven be praised
that his race is spare in numbers
For evidence of the quality of his moral nature pass himself for a moment and refer to his faithful dog
Has he ever improved a dog or attached a dog since his nobility first ran wild in woods and was brought down at a very long shot by POPE
Or does the animal that is the friend of man always degenerate in his low society
It is not the miserable nature of the noble savage that is the new thing it is the whimpering over him with maudlin admiration and the affecting to regret him and the drawing of any comparison of advantage between the blemishes of civilisation and the tenor of his swinish life
There may have been a change now and then in those diseased absurdities but there is none in him
Think of the Bushmen
Think of the two men and the two women who have been exhibited about England for some years
Are the majority of persons  who remember the horrid little leader of that party in his festering bundle of hides with his filth and his antipathy to water and his straddled legs and his odious eyes shaded by his brutal hand and his cry of Quuuuaaa
Bosjesman for something desperately insulting I have no doubt  conscious of an affectionate yearning towards that noble savage or is it idiosyncratic in me to abhor detest abominate and abjure him
I have no reserve on this subject and will frankly state that setting aside that stage of the entertainment when he counterfeited the death of some creature he had shot by laying his head on his hand and shaking his left leg  at which time I think it would have been justifiable homicide to slay him  I have never seen that group sleeping smoking and expectorating round their brazier but I have sincerely desired that something might happen to the charcoal smouldering therein which would cause the immediate suffocation of the whole of the noble strangers
There is at present a party of Zulu Kaffirs exhibiting at the St Georges Gallery Hyde Park Corner London
These noble savages are represented in a most agreeable manner they are seen in an elegant theatre fitted with appropriate scenery of great beauty and they are described in a very sensible and unpretending lecture delivered with a modesty which is quite a pattern to all similar exponents
Though extremely ugly they are much better shaped than such of their predecessors as I have referred to and they are rather picturesque to the eye though far from odoriferous to the nose
What a visitor left to his own interpretings and imaginings might suppose these noblemen to be about when they give vent to that pantomimic expression which is quite settled to be the natural gift of the noble savage I cannot possibly conceive for it is so much too luminous for my personal civilisation that it conveys no idea to my mind beyond a general stamping ramping and raving remarkable as everything in savage life is for its dire uniformity
But let us  with the interpreters assistance of which I for one stand so much in need  see what the noble savage does in Zulu Kaffirland
The noble savage sets a king to reign over him to whom he submits his life and limbs without a murmur or question and whose whole life is passed chin deep in a lake of blood but who after killing incessantly is in his turn killed by his relations and friends the moment a grey hair appears on his head
All the noble savages wars with his fellowsavages and he takes no pleasure in anything else are wars of extermination  which is the best thing I know of him and the most comfortable to my mind when I look at him
He has no moral feelings of any kind sort or description and his mission may be summed up as simply diabolical
The ceremonies with which he faintly diversifies his life are of course of a kindred nature
If he wants a wife he appears before the kennel of the gentleman whom he has selected for his fatherin law attended by a party of male friends of a very strong flavour who screech and whistle and stamp an offer of so many cows for the young ladys hand
The chosen fatherinlaw  also supported by a highflavoured party of male friends  screeches whistles and yells being seated on the ground he cant stamp that there never was such a daughter in the market as his daughter and that he must have six more cows
The soninlaw and his select circle of backers screech whistle stamp and yell in reply that they will give three more cows
The fatherinlaw an old deluder overpaid at the beginning accepts four and rises to bind the bargain
The whole party the young lady included then falling into epileptic convulsions and screeching whistling stamping and yelling together  and nobody taking any notice of the young lady whose charms are not to be thought of without a shudder  the noble savage is considered married and his friends make demoniacal leaps at him by way of congratulation
When the noble savage finds himself a little unwell and mentions the circumstance to his friends it is immediately perceived that he is under the influence of witchcraft
A learned personage called an Imyanger or Witch Doctor is immediately sent for to Nooker the Umtargartie or smell out the witch
The male inhabitants of the kraal being seated on the ground the learned doctor got up like a grizzly bear appears and administers a dance of a most terrific nature during the exhibition of which remedy he incessantly gnashes his teeth and howls I am the original physician to Nooker the Umtargartie
Yow yow yow
No connexion with any other establishment
Till till till
All other Umtargarties are feigned Umtargarties Boroo Boroo
but I perceive here a genuine and real Umtargartie Hoosh Hoosh Hoosh
in whose blood I the original Imyanger and Nookerer Blizzerum Boo
will wash these bears claws of mine
O yow yow yow
All this time the learned physician is looking out among the attentive faces for some unfortunate man who owes him a cow or who has given him any small offence or against whom without offence he has conceived a spite
Him he never fails to Nooker as the Umtargartie and he is instantly killed
In the absence of such an individual the usual practice is to Nooker the quietest and most gentlemanly person in company
But the nookering is invariably followed on the spot by the butchering
Some of the noble savages in whom Mr Catlin was so strongly interested and the diminution of whose numbers by rum and smallpox greatly affected him had a custom not unlike this though much more appalling and disgusting in its odious details
The women being at work in the fields hoeing the Indian corn and the noble savage being asleep in the shade the chief has sometimes the condescension to come forth and lighten the labour by looking at it
On these occasions he seats himself in his own savage chair and is attended by his shieldbearer who holds over his head a shield of cowhide  in shape like an immense mussel shell  fearfully and wonderfully after the manner of a theatrical supernumerary
But lest the great man should forget his greatness in the contemplation of the humble works of agriculture there suddenly rushes in a poet retained for the purpose called a Praiser
This literary gentleman wears a leopards head over his own and a dress of tigers tails he has the appearance of having come express on his hind legs from the Zoological Gardens and he incontinently strikes up the chiefs praises plunging and tearing all the while
There is a frantic wickedness in this brutes manner of worrying the air and gnashing out O what a delightful chief he is
O what a delicious quantity of blood he sheds
O how majestically he laps it up
O how charmingly cruel he is
O how he tears the flesh of his enemies and crunches the bones
O how like the tiger and the leopard and the wolf and the bear he is
O row row row row how fond I am of him
which might tempt the Society of Friends to charge at a handgallop into the SwartzKop location and exterminate the whole kraal
When war is afoot among the noble savages  which is always  the chief holds a council to ascertain whether it is the opinion of his brothers and friends in general that the enemy shall be exterminated
On this occasion after the performance of an Umsebeuza or war song  which is exactly like all the other songs  the chief makes a speech to his brothers and friends arranged in single file
No particular order is observed during the delivery of this address but every gentleman who finds himself excited by the subject instead of crying Hear hear
as is the custom with us darts from the rank and tramples out the life or crushes the skull or mashes the face or scoops out the eyes or breaks the limbs or performs a whirlwind of atrocities on the body of an imaginary enemy
Several gentlemen becoming thus excited at once and pounding away without the least regard to the orator that illustrious person is rather in the position of an orator in an Irish House of Commons
But several of these scenes of savage life bear a strong generic resemblance to an Irish election and I think would be extremely well received and understood at Cork
In all these ceremonies the noble savage holds forth to the utmost possible extent about himself from which to turn him to some civilised account we may learn I think that as egotism is one of the most offensive and contemptible littlenesses a civilised man can exhibit so it is really incompatible with the interchange of ideas inasmuch as if we all talked about ourselves we should soon have no listeners and must be all yelling and screeching at once on our own separate accounts making society hideous
It is my opinion that if we retained in us anything of the noble savage we could not get rid of it too soon
But the fact is clearly otherwise
Upon the wife and dowry question substituting coin for cows we have assuredly nothing of the Zulu Kaffir left
The endurance of despotism is one great distinguishing mark of a savage always
The improving world has quite got the better of that too
In like manner Paris is a civilised city and the Theatre Francais a highly civilised theatre and we shall never hear and never have heard in these later days of course of the Praiser THERE
No no civilised poets have better work to do
As to Nookering Umtargarties there are no pretended Umtargarties in Europe and no European powers to Nooker them that would be mere spydom subordination small malice superstition and false pretence
And as to private Umtargarties are we not in the year eighteen hundred and fiftythree with spirits rapping at our doors
To conclude as I began
My position is that if we have anything to learn from the Noble Savage it is what to avoid
His virtues are a fable his happiness is a delusion his nobility nonsense
We have no greater justification for being cruel to the miserable object than for being cruel to a WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE or an ISAAC NEWTON but he passes away before an immeasurably better and higher power than ever ran wild in any earthly woods and the world will be all the better when his place knows him no more
A FLIGHT WHEN Don Diego de  I forget his name  the inventor of the last new Flying Machines price so many francs for ladies so many more for gentlemen  when Don Diego by permission of Deputy Chaffwax and his noble band shall have taken out a Patent for the Queens dominions and shall have opened a commodious Warehouse in an airy situation and when all persons of any gentility will keep at least a pair of wings and be seen skimming about in every direction I shall take a flight to Paris as I soar round the world in a cheap and independent manner
At present my reliance is on the South Eastern Railway Company in whose Express Train here I sit at eight of the clock on a very hot morning under the very hot roof of the Terminus at London Bridge in danger of being forced like a cucumber or a melon or a pineapple
And talking of pine apples I suppose there never were so many pineapples in a Train as there appear to be in this Train
Whew
The hothouse air is faint with pineapples
Every French citizen or citizeness is carrying pineapples home
The compact little Enchantress in the corner of my carriage French actress to whom I yielded up my heart under the auspices of that brave child MEATCHELL at the St Jamess Theatre the night before last has a pineapple in her lap
Compact Enchantresss friend confidante mother mystery Heaven knows what has two pineapples in her lap and a bundle of them under the seat
Tobaccosmoky Frenchman in Algerine wrapper with peaked hood behind who might be Abdel Kader dyed riflegreen and who seems to be dressed entirely in dirt and braid carries pineapples in a covered basket
Tall grave melancholy Frenchman with black Vandyke beard and hair closecropped with expansive chest to waistcoat and compressive waist to coat saturnine as to his pantaloons calm as to his feminine boots precious as to his jewellery smooth and white as to his linen darkeyed highforeheaded hawknosed  got up one thinks like Lucifer or Mephistopheles or Zamiel transformed into a highly genteel Parisian  has the green end of a pineapple sticking out of his neat valise
Whew
If I were to be kept here long under this forcingframe I wonder what would become of me  whether I should be forced into a giant or should sprout or blow into some other phenomenon
Compact Enchantress is not ruffled by the heat  she is always composed always compact
O look at her little ribbons frills and edges at her shawl at her gloves at her hair at her bracelets at her bonnet at everything about her
How is it accomplished
What does she do to be so neat
How is it that every trifle she wears belongs to her and cannot choose but be a part of her
And even Mystery look at HER
A model
Mystery is not young not pretty though still of an average candlelight passability but she does such miracles in her own behalf that one of these days when she dies theyll be amazed to find an old woman in her bed distantly like her
She was an actress once I shouldnt wonder and had a Mystery attendant on herself
Perhaps Compact Enchantress will live to be a Mystery and to wait with a shawl at the sidescenes and to sit opposite to Mademoiselle in railway carriages and smile and talk subserviently as Mystery does now
Thats hard to believe
Two Englishmen and now our carriage is full
First Englishman in the monied interest  flushed highly respectable  Stock Exchange perhaps  City certainly
Faculties of second Englishman entirely absorbed in hurry
Plunges into the carriage blind
Calls out of window concerning his luggage deaf
Suffocates himself under pillows of greatcoats for no reason and in a demented manner
Will receive no assurance from any porter whatsoever
Is stout and hot and wipes his head and makes himself hotter by breathing so hard
Is totally incredulous respecting assurance of Collected Guard that theres no hurry
No hurry
And a flight to Paris in eleven hours
It is all one to me in this drowsy corner hurry or no hurry
Until Don Diego shall send home my wings my flight is with the SouthEastern Company
I can fly with the SouthEastern more lazily at all events than in the upper air
I have but to sit here thinking as idly as I please and be whisked away
I am not accountable to anybody for the idleness of my thoughts in such an idle summer flight my flight is provided for by the SouthEastern and is no business of mine
The bell
With all my heart
It does not require me to do so much as even to flap my wings
Something snorts for me something shrieks for me something proclaims to everything else that it had better keep out of my way  and away I go
Ah
The fresh air is pleasant after the forcingframe though it does blow over these interminable streets and scatter the smoke of this vast wilderness of chimneys
Here we are  no I mean there we were for it has darted far into the rear  in Bermondsey where the tanners live
Flash
The distant shipping in the Thames is gone
Whirr
The little streets of new brick and red tile with here and there a flagstaff growing like a tall weed out of the scarlet beans and everywhere plenty of open sewer and ditch for the promotion of the public health have been fired off in a volley
Whizz
Dustheaps marketgardens and waste grounds
Rattle
New Cross Station
Shock
There we were at Croydon
Burrrr
The tunnel
I wonder why it is that when I shut my eyes in a tunnel I begin to feel as if I were going at an Express pace the other way
I am clearly going back to London now
Compact Enchantress must have forgotten something and reversed the engine
No
After long darkness pale fitful streaks of light appear
I am still flying on for Folkestone
The streaks grow stronger  become continuous  become the ghost of day  become the living day  became I mean  the tunnel is miles and miles away and here I fly through sunlight all among the harvest and the Kentish hops
There is a dreamy pleasure in this flying
I wonder where it was and when it was that we exploded blew into space somehow a Parliamentary Train with a crowd of heads and faces looking at us out of cages and some hats waving
Monied Interest says it was at Reigate Station
Expounds to Mystery how Reigate Station is so many miles from London which Mystery again develops to Compact Enchantress
There might be neither a Reigate nor a London for me as I fly away among the Kentish hops and harvest
What do I care
Bang
We have let another Station off and fly away regardless
Everything is flying
The hopgardens turn gracefully towards me presenting regular avenues of hops in rapid flight then whirl away
So do the pools and rushes haystacks sheep clover in full bloom delicious to the sight and smell cornsheaves cherry orchards appleorchards reapers gleaners hedges gates fields that taper off into little angular corners cottages gardens now and then a church
Bang bang
A doublebarrelled Station
Now a wood now a bridge now a landscape now a cutting now a  Bang
a singlebarrelled Station  there was a cricketmatch somewhere with two white tents and then four flying cows then turnips  now the wires of the electric telegraph are all alive and spin and blurr their edges and go up and down and make the intervals between each other most irregular contracting and expanding in the strangest manner
Now we slacken
With a screwing and a grinding and a smell of water thrown on ashes now we stop
Demented Traveller who has been for two or three minutes watchful clutches his greatcoats plunges at the door rattles it cries Hi
eager to embark on board of impossible packets far inland
Collected Guard appears
Are you for Tunbridge sir
Tunbridge
No
Paris
Plenty of time sir
No hurry
Five minutes here sir for refreshment
I am so blest anticipating Zamiel by half a second as to procure a glass of water for Compact Enchantress
Who would suppose we had been flying at such a rate and shall take wing again directly
Refreshmentroom full platform full porter with wateringpot deliberately cooling a hot wheel another porter with equal deliberation helping the rest of the wheels bountifully to ice cream
Monied Interest and I reentering the carriage first and being there alone he intimates to me that the French are no go as a Nation
I ask why
He says that Reign of Terror of theirs was quite enough
I ventured to inquire whether he remembers anything that preceded said Reign of Terror
He says not particularly
Because I remark the harvest that is reaped has sometimes been sown
Monied Interest repeats as quite enough for him that the French are revolutionary  and always at it
Bell
Compact Enchantress helped in by Zamiel whom the stars confound
 gives us her charming little sidebox look and smites me to the core
Mystery eating spongecake
Pineapple atmosphere faintly tinged with suspicions of sherry
Demented Traveller flits past the carriage looking for it
Is blind with agitation and cant see it
Seems singled out by Destiny to be the only unhappy creature in the flight who has any cause to hurry himself
Is nearly left behind
Is seized by Collected Guard after the Train is in motion and bundled in
Still has lingering suspicions that there must be a boat in the neighbourhood and WILL look wildly out of window for it
Flight resumed
Cornsheaves hopgardens reapers gleaners appleorchards cherryorchards Stations single and double barrelled Ashford
Compact Enchantress constantly talking to Mystery in an exquisite manner gives a little scream a sound that seems to come from high up in her precious little head from behind her bright little eyebrows
Great Heaven my pineapple
My Angel
It is lost
Mystery is desolated
A search made
It is not lost
Zamiel finds it
I curse him flying in the Persian manner
May his face be turned upside down and jackasses sit upon his uncles grave
Now fresher air now glimpses of unenclosed Downland with flapping crows flying over it whom we soon outfly now the Sea now Folkestone at a quarter after ten
Tickets ready gentlemen
Demented dashes at the door
For Paris sir
No hurry
Not the least
We are dropped slowly down to the Port and sidle to and fro the whole Train before the insensible Royal George Hotel for some ten minutes
The Royal George takes no more heed of us than its namesake under water at Spithead or under earth at Windsor does
The Royal Georges dog lies winking and blinking at us without taking the trouble to sit up and the Royal Georges wedding party at the open window who seem I must say rather tired of bliss dont bestow a solitary glance upon us flying thus to Paris in eleven hours
The first gentleman in Folkestone is evidently used up on this subject
Meanwhile Demented chafes
Conceives that every mans hand is against him and exerting itself to prevent his getting to Paris
Refuses consolation
Rattles door
Sees smoke on the horizon and knows its the boat gone without him
Monied Interest resentfully explains that HE is going to Paris too
Demented signifies that if Monied Interest chooses to be left behind HE dont
Refreshments in the WaitingRoom ladies and gentlemen
No hurry ladies and gentlemen for Paris
No hurry whatever
Twenty minutes pause by Folkestone clock for looking at Enchantress while she eats a sandwich and at Mystery while she eats of everything there that is eatable from porkpie sausage jam and gooseberries to lumps of sugar
All this time there is a very waterfall of luggage with a spray of dust tumbling slantwise from the pier into the steamboat
All this time Demented who has no business with it watches it with starting eyes fiercely requiring to be shown HIS luggage
When it at last concludes the cataract he rushes hotly to refresh  is shouted after pursued jostled brought back pitched into the departing steamer upside down and caught by mariners disgracefully
A lovely harvestday a cloudless sky a tranquil sea
The piston rods of the engines so regularly coming up from below to look as well they may at the bright weather and so regularly almost knocking their iron heads against the cross beam of the skylight and never doing it
Another Parisian actress is on board attended by another Mystery
Compact Enchantress greets her sister artist  Oh the Compact Ones pretty teeth
 and Mystery greets Mystery
My Mystery soon ceases to be conversational  is taken poorly in a word having lunched too miscellaneously  and goes below
The remaining Mystery then smiles upon the sister artists who I am afraid wouldnt greatly mind stabbing each other and is upon the whole ravished
And now I find that all the French people on board begin to grow and all the English people to shrink
The French are nearing home and shaking off a disadvantage whereas we are shaking it on
Zamiel is the same man and AbdelKader is the same man but each seems to come into possession of an indescribable confidence that departs from us  from Monied Interest for instance and from me
Just what they gain we lose
Certain British Gents about the steersman intellectually nurtured at home on parody of everything and truth of nothing become subdued and in a manner forlorn and when the steersman tells them not exultingly how he has been upon this station now eight year and never see the old town of Bullum yet one of them with an imbecile reliance on a reed asks him what he considers to be the best hotel in Paris
Now I tread upon French ground and am greeted by the three charming words Liberty Equality Fraternity painted up in letters a little too thin for their height on the Customhouse wall  also by the sight of large cocked hats without which demonstrative headgear nothing of a public nature can be done upon this soil
All the rabid Hotel population of Boulogne howl and shriek outside a distant barrier frantic to get at us
Demented by some unlucky means peculiar to himself is delivered over to their fury and is presently seen struggling in a whirlpool of Touters  is somehow understood to be going to Paris  is with infinite noise rescued by two cocked hats and brought into Customhouse bondage with the rest of us
Here I resign the active duties of life to an eager being of preternatural sharpness with a shelving forehead and a shabby snuffcoloured coat who from the wharf brought me down with his eye before the boat came into port
He darts upon my luggage on the floor where all the luggage is strewn like a wreck at the bottom of the great deep gets it proclaimed and weighed as the property of Monsieur a traveller unknown pays certain francs for it to a certain functionary behind a Pigeon Hole like a paybox at a Theatre the arrangements in general are on a wholesale scale half military and half theatrical and I suppose I shall find it when I come to Paris  he says I shall
I know nothing about it except that I pay him his small fee and pocket the ticket he gives me and sit upon a counter involved in the general distraction
Railway station
Lunch or dinner ladies and gentlemen
Plenty of time for Paris
Plenty of time
Large hall long counter long strips of diningtable bottles of wine plates of meat roast chickens little loaves of bread basins of soup little caraffes of brandy cakes and fruit
Comfortably restored from these resources I begin to fly again
I saw Zamiel before I took wing presented to Compact Enchantress and Sister Artist by an officer in uniform with a waist like a wasps and pantaloons like two balloons
They all got into the next carriage together accompanied by the two Mysteries
They laughed
I am alone in the carriage for I dont consider Demented anybody and alone in the world
Fields windmills low grounds pollardtrees windmills fields fortifications Abbeville soldiering and drumming
I wonder where England is and when I was there last  about two years ago I should say
Flying in and out among these trenches and batteries skimming the clattering drawbridges looking down into the stagnant ditches I become a prisoner of state escaping
I am confined with a comrade in a fortress
Our room is in an upper story
We have tried to get up the chimney but theres an iron grating across it imbedded in the masonry
After months of labour we have worked the grating loose with the poker and can lift it up
We have also made a hook and twisted our rugs and blankets into ropes
Our plan is to go up the chimney hook our ropes to the top descend hand over hand upon the roof of the guardhouse far below shake the hook loose watch the opportunity of the sentinels pacing away hook again drop into the ditch swim across it creep into the shelter of the wood
The time is come  a wild and stormy night
We are up the chimney we are on the guardhouse roof we are swimming in the murky ditch when lo
Qui vla
a bugle the alarm a crash
What is it
Death
No Amiens
More fortifications more soldiering and drumming more basins of soup more little loaves of bread more bottles of wine more caraffes of brandy more time for refreshment
Everything good and everything ready
Bright unsubstantiallooking scenic sort of station
People waiting
Houses uniforms beards moustaches some sabots plenty of neat women and a few oldvisaged children
Unless it be a delusion born of my giddy flight the grownup people and the children seem to change places in France
In general the boys and girls are little old men and women and the men and women lively boys and girls
Bugle shriek flight resumed
Monied Interest has come into my carriage
Says the manner of refreshing is not bad but considers it French
Admits great dexterity and politeness in the attendants
Thinks a decimal currency may have something to do with their despatch in settling accounts and dont know but what its sensible and convenient
Adds however as a general protest that theyre a revolutionary people  and always at it
Ramparts canals cathedral river soldiering and drumming open country river earthenware manufactures Creil
Again ten minutes
Not even Demented in a hurry
Station a drawingroom with a verandah like a planters house
Monied Interest considers it a bandbox and not made to last
Little round tables in it at one of which the Sister Artists and attendant Mysteries are established with Wasp and Zamiel as if they were going to stay a week
Anon with no more trouble than before I am flying again and lazily wondering as I fly
What has the SouthEastern done with all the horrible little villages we used to pass through in the DILIGENCE
What have they done with all the summer dust with all the winter mud with all the dreary avenues of little trees with all the ramshackle postyards with all the beggars who used to turn out at night with bits of lighted candle to look in at the coach windows with all the longtailed horses who were always biting one another with all the big postilions in jackboots  with all the mouldy cafes that we used to stop at where a long mildewed tablecloth set forth with jovial bottles of vinegar and oil and with a Siamese arrangement of pepper and salt was never wanting
Where are the grassgrown little towns the wonderful little marketplaces all unconscious of markets the shops that nobody kept the streets that nobody trod the churches that nobody went to the bells that nobody rang the tumbledown old buildings plastered with manycoloured bills that nobody read
Where are the twoandtwenty weary hours of long long day and night journey sure to be either insupportably hot or insupportably cold
Where are the pains in my bones where are the fidgets in my legs where is the Frenchman with the nightcap who never WOULD have the little coupewindow down and who always fell upon me when he went to sleep and always slept all night snoring onions
A voice breaks in with Paris
Here we are
I have overflown myself perhaps but I cant believe it
I feel as if I were enchanted or bewitched
It is barely eight oclock yet  it is nothing like halfpast  when I have had my luggage examined at that briskest of Customhouses attached to the station and am rattling over the pavement in a hackneycabriolet
Surely not the pavement of Paris
Yes I think it is too
I dont know any other place where there are all these high houses all these haggardlooking wine shops all these billiard tables all these stockingmakers with flat red or yellow legs of wood for signboard all these fuel shops with stacks of billets painted outside and real billets sawing in the gutter all these dirty corners of streets all these cabinet pictures over dark doorways representing discreet matrons nursing babies
And yet this morning  Ill think of it in a warmbath
Very like a small room that I remember in the Chinese baths upon the Boulevard certainly and though I see it through the steam I think that I might swear to that peculiar hotlinen basket like a large wicker hourglass
When can it have been that I left home
When was it that I paid through to Paris at London Bridge and discharged myself of all responsibility except the preservation of a voucher ruled into three divisions of which the first was snipped off at Folkestone the second aboard the boat and the third taken at my journeys end
It seems to have been ages ago
Calculation is useless
I will go out for a walk
The crowds in the streets the lights in the shops and balconies the elegance variety and beauty of their decorations the number of the theatres the brilliant cafes with their windows thrown up high and their vivacious groups at little tables on the pavement the light and glitter of the houses turned as it were inside out soon convince me that it is no dream that I am in Paris howsoever I got there
I stroll down to the sparkling Palais Royal up the Rue de Rivoli to the Place Vendome
As I glance into a printshop window Monied Interest my late travelling companion comes upon me laughing with the highest relish of disdain
Heres a people
he says pointing to Napoleon in the window and Napoleon on the column
Only one idea all over Paris
A monomania
Humph
I THINK I have seen Napoleons match
There was a statue when I came away at Hyde Park Corner and another in the City and a print or two in the shops
I walk up to the Barriere de lEtoile sufficiently dazed by my flight to have a pleasant doubt of the reality of everything about me of the lively crowd the overhanging trees the performing dogs the hobbyhorses the beautiful perspectives of shining lamps the hundred and one enclosures where the singing is in gleaming orchestras of azure and gold and where a stareyed Houri comes round with a box for voluntary offerings
So I pass to my hotel enchanted sup enchanted go to bed enchanted pushing back this morning if it really were this morning into the remoteness of time blessing the SouthEastern Company for realising the Arabian Nights in these prose days murmuring as I wing my idle flight into the land of dreams No hurry ladies and gentlemen going to Paris in eleven hours
It is so well done that there really is no hurry
THE DETECTIVE POLICE WE are not by any means devout believers in the old Bow Street Police
To say the truth we think there was a vast amount of humbug about those worthies
Apart from many of them being men of very indifferent character and far too much in the habit of consorting with thieves and the like they never lost a public occasion of jobbing and trading in mystery and making the most of themselves
Continually puffed besides by incompetent magistrates anxious to conceal their own deficiencies and handinglove with the pennyaliners of that time they became a sort of superstition
Although as a Preventive Police they were utterly ineffective and as a Detective Police were very loose and uncertain in their operations they remain with some people a superstition to the present day
On the other hand the Detective Force organised since the establishment of the existing Police is so well chosen and trained proceeds so systematically and quietly does its business in such a workmanlike manner and is always so calmly and steadily engaged in the service of the public that the public really do not know enough of it to know a tithe of its usefulness
Impressed with this conviction and interested in the men themselves we represented to the authorities at Scotland Yard that we should be glad if there were no official objection to have some talk with the Detectives
A most obliging and ready permission being given a certain evening was appointed with a certain Inspector for a social conference between ourselves and the Detectives at The Household Words Office in Wellington Street Strand London
In consequence of which appointment the party came off which we are about to describe
And we beg to repeat that avoiding such topics as it might for obvious reasons be injurious to the public or disagreeable to respectable individuals to touch upon in print our description is as exact as we can make it
The reader will have the goodness to imagine the Sanctum Sanctorum of Household Words
Anything that best suits the readers fancy will best represent that magnificent chamber
We merely stipulate for a round table in the middle with some glasses and cigars arranged upon it and the editorial sofa elegantly hemmed in between that stately piece of furniture and the wall
It is a sultry evening at dusk
The stones of Wellington Street are hot and gritty and the watermen and hackneycoachmen at the Theatre opposite are much flushed and aggravated
Carriages are constantly setting down the people who have come to FairyLand and there is a mighty shouting and bellowing every now and then deafening us for the moment through the open windows
Just at dusk Inspectors Wield and Stalker are announced but we do not undertake to warrant the orthography of any of the names here mentioned
Inspector Wield presents Inspector Stalker
Inspector Wield is a middleaged man of a portly presence with a large moist knowing eye a husky voice and a habit of emphasising his conversation by the aid of a corpulent forefinger which is constantly in juxtaposition with his eyes or nose
Inspector Stalker is a shrewd hardheaded Scotchman  in appearance not at all unlike a very acute thoroughlytrained schoolmaster from the Normal Establishment at Glasgow
Inspector Wield one might have known perhaps for what he is  Inspector Stalker never
The ceremonies of reception over Inspectors Wield and Stalker observe that they have brought some sergeants with them
The sergeants are presented  five in number Sergeant Dornton Sergeant Witchem Sergeant Mith Sergeant Fendall and Sergeant Straw
We have the whole Detective Force from Scotland Yard with one exception
They sit down in a semicircle the two Inspectors at the two ends at a little distance from the round table facing the editorial sofa
Every man of them in a glance immediately takes an inventory of the furniture and an accurate sketch of the editorial presence
The Editor feels that any gentleman in company could take him up if need should be without the smallest hesitation twenty years hence
The whole party are in plain clothes
Sergeant Dornton about fifty years of age with a ruddy face and a high sunburnt forehead has the air of one who has been a Sergeant in the army  he might have sat to Wilkie for the Soldier in the Reading of the Will
He is famous for steadily pursuing the inductive process and from small beginnings working on from clue to clue until he bags his man
Sergeant Witchem shorter and thickerset and marked with the smallpox has something of a reserved and thoughtful air as if he were engaged in deep arithmetical calculations
He is renowned for his acquaintance with the swell mob
Sergeant Mith a smoothfaced man with a fresh bright complexion and a strange air of simplicity is a dab at housebreakers
Sergeant Fendall a light haired wellspoken polite person is a prodigious hand at pursuing private inquiries of a delicate nature
Straw a little wiry Sergeant of meek demeanour and strong sense would knock at a door and ask a series of questions in any mild character you choose to prescribe to him from a charityboy upwards and seem as innocent as an infant
They are one and all respectablelooking men of perfectly good deportment and unusual intelligence with nothing lounging or slinking in their manners with an air of keen observation and quick perception when addressed and generally presenting in their faces traces more or less marked of habitually leading lives of strong mental excitement
They have all good eyes and they all can and they all do look full at whomsoever they speak to
We light the cigars and hand round the glasses which are very temperately used indeed and the conversation begins by a modest amateur reference on the Editorial part to the swell mob
Inspector Wield immediately removes his cigar from his lips waves his right hand and says Regarding the swell mob sir I cant do better than call upon Sergeant Witchem
Because the reason why
Ill tell you
Sergeant Witchem is better acquainted with the swell mob than any officer in London
Our heart leaping up when we beheld this rainbow in the sky we turn to Sergeant Witchem who very concisely and in wellchosen language goes into the subject forthwith
Meantime the whole of his brother officers are closely interested in attending to what he says and observing its effect
Presently they begin to strike in one or two together when an opportunity offers and the conversation becomes general
But these brother officers only come in to the assistance of each other  not to the contradiction  and a more amicable brotherhood there could not be
From the swell mob we diverge to the kindred topics of cracksmen fences public house dancers areasneaks designing young people who go out gonophing and other schools
It is observable throughout these revelations that Inspector Stalker the Scotchman is always exact and statistical and that when any question of figures arises everybody as by one consent pauses and looks to him
When we have exhausted the various schools of Art  during which discussion the whole body have remained profoundly attentive except when some unusual noise at the Theatre over the way has induced some gentleman to glance inquiringly towards the window in that direction behind his next neighbours back  we burrow for information on such points as the following
Whether there really are any highway robberies in London or whether some circumstances not convenient to be mentioned by the aggrieved party usually precede the robberies complained of under that head which quite change their character
Certainly the latter almost always
Whether in the case of robberies in houses where servants are necessarily exposed to doubt innocence under suspicion ever becomes so like guilt in appearance that a good officer need be cautious how he judges it
Undoubtedly
Nothing is so common or deceptive as such appearances at first
Whether in a place of public amusement a thief knows an officer and an officer knows a thief  supposing them beforehand strangers to each other  because each recognises in the other under all disguise an inattention to what is going on and a purpose that is not the purpose of being entertained
Yes
Thats the way exactly
Whether it is reasonable or ridiculous to trust to the alleged experiences of thieves as narrated by themselves in prisons or penitentiaries or anywhere
In general nothing more absurd
Lying is their habit and their trade and they would rather lie  even if they hadnt an interest in it and didnt want to make themselves agreeable  than tell the truth
From these topics we glide into a review of the most celebrated and horrible of the great crimes that have been committed within the last fifteen or twenty years
The men engaged in the discovery of almost all of them and in the pursuit or apprehension of the murderers are here down to the very last instance
One of our guests gave chase to and boarded the emigrant ship in which the murderess last hanged in London was supposed to have embarked
We learn from him that his errand was not announced to the passengers who may have no idea of it to this hour
That he went below with the captain lamp in hand  it being dark and the whole steerage abed and seasick  and engaged the Mrs Manning who WAS on board in a conversation about her luggage until she was with no small pains induced to raise her head and turn her face towards the light
Satisfied that she was not the object of his search he quietly reembarked in the Government steamer alongside and steamed home again with the intelligence
When we have exhausted these subjects too which occupy a considerable time in the discussion two or three leave their chairs whisper Sergeant Witchem and resume their seat
Sergeant Witchem leaning forward a little and placing a hand on each of his legs then modestly speaks as follows My brotherofficers wish me to relate a little account of my taking Tallyho Thompson
A man oughtnt to tell what he has done himself but still as nobody was with me and consequently as nobody but myself can tell it Ill do it in the best way I can if it should meet your approval
We assure Sergeant Witchem that he will oblige us very much and we all compose ourselves to listen with great interest and attention
Tallyho Thompson says Sergeant Witchem after merely wetting his lips with his brandyandwater Tallyho Thompson was a famous horsestealer couper and magsman
Thompson in conjunction with a pal that occasionally worked with him gammoned a countryman out of a good round sum of money under pretence of getting him a situation  the regular old dodge  and was afterwards in the Hue and Cry for a horse  a horse that he stole down in Hertfordshire
I had to look after Thompson and I applied myself of course in the first instance to discovering where he was
Now Thompsons wife lived along with a little daughter at Chelsea
Knowing that Thompson was somewhere in the country I watched the house  especially at posttime in the morning  thinking Thompson was pretty likely to write to her
Sure enough one morning the postman comes up and delivers a letter at Mrs Thompsons door
Little girl opens the door and takes it in
Were not always sure of postmen though the people at the postoffices are always very obliging
A postman may help us or he may not  just as it happens
However I go across the road and I say to the postman after he has left the letter Good morning
how are you
How are YOU
says he
Youve just delivered a letter for Mrs
Thompson
Yes I have
You didnt happen to remark what the postmark was perhaps
No says he I didnt
Come says I Ill be plain with you
Im in a small way of business and I have given Thompson credit and I cant afford to lose what he owes me
I know hes got money and I know hes in the country and if you could tell me what the postmark was I should be very much obliged to you and youd do a service to a tradesman in a small way of business that cant afford a loss
Well he said I do assure you that I did not observe what the postmark was all I know is that there was money in the letter  I should say a sovereign
This was enough for me because of course I knew that Thompson having sent his wife money it was probable shed write to Thompson by return of post to acknowledge the receipt
So I said Thankee to the postman and I kept on the watch
In the afternoon I saw the little girl come out
Of course I followed her
She went into a stationers shop and I neednt say to you that I looked in at the window
She bought some writingpaper and envelopes and a pen
I think to myself Thatll do
 watch her home again  and dont go away you may be sure knowing that Mrs Thompson was writing her letter to Tallyho and that the letter would be posted presently
In about an hour or so out came the little girl again with the letter in her hand
I went up and said something to the child whatever it might have been but I couldnt see the direction of the letter because she held it with the seal upwards
However I observed that on the back of the letter there was what we call a kiss  a drop of wax by the side of the seal  and again you understand that was enough for me
I saw her post the letter waited till she was gone then went into the shop and asked to see the Master
When he came out I told him Now Im an Officer in the Detective Force theres a letter with a kiss been posted here just now for a man that Im in search of and what I have to ask of you is that you will let me look at the direction of that letter
He was very civil  took a lot of letters from the box in the window  shook em out on the counter with the faces downwards  and there among em was the identical letter with the kiss
It was directed Mr Thomas Pigeon Post Office B to be left till called for
Down I went to B a hundred and twenty miles or so that night
Early next morning I went to the Post Office saw the gentleman in charge of that department told him who I was and that my object was to see and track the party that should come for the letter for Mr Thomas Pigeon
He was very polite and said You shall have every assistance we can give you you can wait inside the office and well take care to let you know when anybody comes for the letter
Well I waited there three days and began to think that nobody ever WOULD come
At last the clerk whispered to me Here
Detective
Somebodys come for the letter
Keep him a minute said I and I ran round to the outside of the office
There I saw a young chap with the appearance of an Ostler holding a horse by the bridle  stretching the bridle across the pavement while he waited at the Post Office Window for the letter
I began to pat the horse and that and I said to the boy Why this is Mr Joness Mare
No
It ant
No
said I
Shes very like Mr Joness Mare
She ant Mr Joness Mare anyhow says he
Its Mr
So and Sos of the Warwick Arms
And up he jumped and off he went  letter and all
I got a cab followed on the box and was so quick after him that I came into the stableyard of the Warwick Arms by one gate just as he came in by another
I went into the bar where there was a young woman serving and called for a glass of brandyandwater
He came in directly and handed her the letter
She casually looked at it without saying anything and stuck it up behind the glass over the chimneypiece
What was to be done next
I turned it over in my mind while I drank my brandyandwater looking pretty sharp at the letter the while but I couldnt see my way out of it at all
I tried to get lodgings in the house but there had been a horsefair or something of that sort and it was full
I was obliged to put up somewhere else but I came backwards and forwards to the bar for a couple of days and there was the letter always behind the glass
At last I thought Id write a letter to Mr Pigeon myself and see what that would do
So I wrote one and posted it but I purposely addressed it Mr John Pigeon instead of Mr Thomas Pigeon to see what THAT would do
In the morning a very wet morning it was I watched the postman down the street and cut into the bar just before he reached the Warwick Arms
In he came presently with my letter
Is there a Mr John Pigeon staying here
No
 stop a bit though says the barmaid and she took down the letter behind the glass
No says she its Thomas and HE is not staying here
Would you do me a favour and post this for me as it is so wet
The postman said Yes she folded it in another envelope directed it and gave it him
He put it in his hat and away he went
I had no difficulty in finding out the direction of that letter
It was addressed Mr Thomas Pigeon Post Office R Northamptonshire to be left till called for
Off I started directly for R I said the same at the Post Office there as I had said at B and again I waited three days before anybody came
At last another chap on horseback came
Any letters for Mr Thomas Pigeon
Where do you come from
New Inn near R
He got the letter and away HE went at a canter
I made my inquiries about the New Inn near R and hearing it was a solitary sort of house a little in the horse line about a couple of miles from the station I thought Id go and have a look at it
I found it what it had been described and sauntered in to look about me
The landlady was in the bar and I was trying to get into conversation with her asked her how business was and spoke about the wet weather and so on when I saw through an open door three men sitting by the fire in a sort of parlour or kitchen and one of those men according to the description I had of him was Tallyho Thompson
I went and sat down among em and tried to make things agreeable but they were very shy  wouldnt talk at all  looked at me and at one another in a way quite the reverse of sociable
I reckoned em up and finding that they were all three bigger men than me and considering that their looks were ugly  that it was a lonely place  railroad station two miles off  and night coming on  thought I couldnt do better than have a drop of brandyandwater to keep my courage up
So I called for my brandyandwater and as I was sitting drinking it by the fire Thompson got up and went out
Now the difficulty of it was that I wasnt sure it WAS Thompson because I had never set eyes on him before and what I had wanted was to be quite certain of him
However there was nothing for it now but to follow and put a bold face upon it
I found him talking outside in the yard with the landlady
It turned out afterwards that he was wanted by a Northampton officer for something else and that knowing that officer to be pockmarked as I am myself he mistook me for him
As I have observed I found him talking to the landlady outside
I put my hand upon his shoulder  this way  and said Tallyho Thompson its no use
I know you
Im an officer from London and I take you into custody for felony
That be dd
says Tallyho Thompson
We went back into the house and the two friends began to cut up rough and their looks didnt please me at all I assure you
Let the man go
What are you going to do with him
Ill tell you what Im going to do with him
Im going to take him to London to night as sure as Im alive
Im not alone here whatever you may think
You mind your own business and keep yourselves to yourselves
Itll be better for you for I know you both very well
ID never seen or heard of em in all my life but my bouncing cowed em a bit and they kept off while Thompson was making ready to go
I thought to myself however that they might be coming after me on the dark road to rescue Thompson so I said to the landlady What men have you got in the house Missis
We havent got no men here she says sulkily
You have got an ostler I suppose
Yes weve got an ostler
Let me see him
Presently he came and a shaggyheaded young fellow he was
Now attend to me young man says I Im a Detective Officer from London
This mans name is Thompson
I have taken him into custody for felony
I am going to take him to the railroad station
I call upon you in the Queens name to assist me and mind you my friend youll get yourself into more trouble than you know of if you dont
You never saw a person open his eyes so wide
Now Thompson come along
says I
But when I took out the handcuffs Thompson cries No
None of that
I wont stand THEM
Ill go along with you quiet but I wont bear none of that
Tallyho Thompson I said Im willing to behave as a man to you if you are willing to behave as a man to me
Give me your word that youll come peaceably along and I dont want to handcuff you
I will says Thompson but Ill have a glass of brandy first
I dont care if Ive another said I
Well have two more Missis said the friends and confound you Constable youll give your man a drop wont you
I was agreeable to that so we had it all round and then my man and I took Tallyho Thompson safe to the railroad and I carried him to London that night
He was afterwards acquitted on account of a defect in the evidence and I understand he always praises me up to the skies and says Im one of the best of men
This story coming to a termination amidst general applause Inspector Wield after a little grave smoking fixes his eye on his host and thus delivers himself It wasnt a bad plant that of mine on Fikey the man accused of forging the SouWestern Railway debentures  it was only tother day  because the reason why
Ill tell you
I had information that Fikey and his brother kept a factory over yonder there  indicating any region on the Surrey side of the river  where he bought secondhand carriages so after Id tried in vain to get hold of him by other means I wrote him a letter in an assumed name saying that Id got a horse and shay to dispose of and would drive down next day that he might view the lot and make an offer  very reasonable it was I said  a reglar bargain
Straw and me then went off to a friend of mine thats in the livery and job business and hired a turnout for the day a precious smart turnout it was  quite a slapup thing
Down we drove accordingly with a friend whos not in the Force himself and leaving my friend in the shay near a publichouse to take care of the horse we went to the factory which was some little way off
In the factory there was a number of strong fellows at work and after reckoning em up it was clear to me that it wouldnt do to try it on there
They were too many for us
We must get our man out of doors
Mr Fikey at home
No he aint
Expected home soon
Why no not soon
Ah
Is his brother here
IM his brother
Oh
well this is an illconwenience this is
I wrote him a letter yesterday saying Id got a little turnout to dispose of and Ive took the trouble to bring the turnout down a purpose and now he aint in the way
No he aint in the way
You couldnt make it convenient to call again could you
Why no I couldnt
I want to sell thats the fact and I cant put it off
Could you find him anywheres
At first he said No he couldnt and then he wasnt sure about it and then hed go and try
So at last he went upstairs where there was a sort of loft and presently down comes my man himself in his shirtsleeves
Well he says this seems to be rayther a pressing matter of yours
Yes I says it IS rayther a pressing matter and youll find it a bargain  dirt cheap
I aint in partickler want of a bargain just now he says but where is it
Why I says the turnouts just outside
Come and look at it
He hasnt any suspicions and away we go
And the first thing that happens is that the horse runs away with my friend who knows no more of driving than a child when he takes a little trot along the road to show his paces
You never saw such a game in your life
When the bolt is over and the turnout has come to a standstill again Fikey walks round and round it as grave as a judge  me too
There sir
I says
Theres a neat thing
It aint a bad style of thing he says
I believe you says I
And theres a horse
 for I saw him looking at it
Rising eight
I says rubbing his forelegs
Bless you there aint a man in the world knows less of horses than I do but Id heard my friend at the Livery Stables say he was eight year old so I says as knowing as possible Rising eight
Rising eight is he
says he
Rising eight says I
Well he says what do you want for it
Why the first and last figure for the whole concern is fiveandtwenty pound
Thats very cheap
he says looking at me
Aint it
I says
I told you it was a bargain
Now without any higgling and haggling about it what I want is to sell and thats my price
Further Ill make it easy to you and take half the money down and you can do a bit of stiff 1 for the balance
 Well he says again thats very cheap
I believe you says I get in and try it and youll buy it
Come
take a trial
Ecod he gets in and we get in and we drive along the road to show him to one of the railway clerks that was hid in the public house window to identify him
But the clerk was bothered and didnt know whether it was him or wasnt  because the reason why
Ill tell you  on account of his having shaved his whiskers
Its a clever little horse he says and trots well and the shay runs light
Not a doubt about it I says
And now Mr Fikey I may as well make it all right without wasting any more of your time
The fact is Im Inspector Wield and youre my prisoner
You dont mean that
he says
I do indeed
Then burn my body says Fikey if this aint TOO bad
Perhaps you never saw a man so knocked over with surprise
I hope youll let me have my coat
he says
By all means
Well then lets drive to the factory
Why not exactly that I think said I Ive been there once before today
Suppose we send for it
He saw it was no go so he sent for it and put it on and we drove him up to London comfortable
This reminiscence is in the height of its success when a general proposal is made to the freshcomplexioned smoothfaced officer with the strange air of simplicity to tell the Butchers Story
The freshcomplexioned smoothfaced officer with the strange air of simplicity began with a rustic smile and in a soft wheedling tone of voice to relate the Butchers Story thus Its just about six years ago now since information was given at Scotland Yard of there being extensive robberies of lawns and silks going on at some wholesale houses in the City
Directions were given for the business being looked into and Straw and Fendall and me we were all in it
When you received your instructions said we you went away and held a sort of Cabinet Council together
The smoothfaced officer coaxingly replied Yees
Just so
We turned it over among ourselves a good deal
It appeared when we went into it that the goods were sold by the receivers extraordinarily cheap  much cheaper than they could have been if they had been honestly come by
The receivers were in the trade and kept capital shops  establishments of the first respectability  one of em at the West End one down in Westminster
After a lot of watching and inquiry and this and that among ourselves we found that the job was managed and the purchases of the stolen goods made at a little publichouse near Smithfield down by Saint Bartholomews where the Warehouse Porters who were the thieves took em for that purpose dont you see
and made appointments to meet the people that went between themselves and the receivers
This publichouse was principally used by journeymen butchers from the country out of place and in want of situations so what did we do but  ha ha ha
 we agreed that I should be dressed up like a butcher myself and go and live there
Never surely was a faculty of observation better brought to bear upon a purpose than that which picked out this officer for the part
Nothing in all creation could have suited him better
Even while he spoke he became a greasy sleepy shy goodnatured chuckleheaded unsuspicious and confiding young butcher
His very hair seemed to have suet in it as he made it smooth upon his head and his fresh complexion to be lubricated by large quantities of animal food 
 So I  ha ha ha
always with the confiding snigger of the foolish young butcher so I dressed myself in the regular way made up a little bundle of clothes and went to the publichouse and asked if I could have a lodging there
They says yes you can have a lodging here and I got a bedroom and settled myself down in the tap
There was a number of people about the place and coming backwards and forwards to the house and first one says and then another says Are you from the country young man
Yes I says I am
Im come out of Northamptonshire and Im quite lonely here for I dont know London at all and its such a mighty big town
It IS a big town they says
Oh its a VERY big town
I says
Really and truly I never was in such a town
It quite confuses of me
and all that you know
When some of the journeymen Butchers that used the house found that I wanted a place they says Oh well get you a place
And they actually took me to a sight of places in Newgate Market Newport Market Clare Carnaby  I dont know where all
But the wages was  ha ha ha
 was not sufficient and I never could suit myself dont you see
Some of the queer frequenters of the house were a little suspicious of me at first and I was obliged to be very cautious indeed how I communicated with Straw or Fendall
Sometimes when I went out pretending to stop and look into the shop windows and just casting my eye round I used to see some of em following me but being perhaps better accustomed than they thought for to that sort of thing I used to lead em on as far as I thought necessary or convenient  sometimes a long way  and then turn sharp round and meet em and say Oh dear how glad I am to come upon you so fortunate
This Londons such a place Im blowed if I aint lost again
And then wed go back all together to the publichouse and  ha ha ha
and smoke our pipes dont you see
They were very attentive to me I am sure
It was a common thing while I was living there for some of em to take me out and show me London
They showed me the Prisons  showed me Newgate  and when they showed me Newgate I stops at the place where the Porters pitch their loads and says Oh dear is this where they hang the men
Oh Lor
That
they says what a simple cove he is
THAT aint it
And then they pointed out which WAS it and I says Lor
and they says Now youll know it agen wont you
And I said I thought I should if I tried hard  and I assure you I kept a sharp look out for the City Police when we were out in this way for if any of em had happened to know me and had spoke to me it would have been all up in a minute
However by good luck such a thing never happened and all went on quiet though the difficulties I had in communicating with my brother officers were quite extraordinary
The stolen goods that were brought to the publichouse by the Warehouse Porters were always disposed of in a back parlour
For a long time I never could get into this parlour or see what was done there
As I sat smoking my pipe like an innocent young chap by the taproom fire Id hear some of the parties to the robbery as they came in and out say softly to the landlord Whos that
What does HE do here
Bless your soul says the landlord hes only a  ha ha ha
 hes only a green young fellow from the country as is looking for a butchers sitiwation
Dont mind HIM
So in course of time they were so convinced of my being green and got to be so accustomed to me that I was as free of the parlour as any of em and I have seen as much as Seventy Pounds Worth of fine lawn sold there in one night that was stolen from a warehouse in Friday Street
After the sale the buyers always stood treat  hot supper or dinner or what not  and theyd say on those occasions Come on Butcher
Put your best leg foremost young un and walk into it
Which I used to do  and hear at table all manner of particulars that it was very important for us Detectives to know
This went on for ten weeks
I lived in the publichouse all the time and never was out of the Butchers dress  except in bed
At last when I had followed seven of the thieves and set em to rights  thats an expression of ours dont you see by which I mean to say that I traced em and found out where the robberies were done and all about em  Straw and Fendall and I gave one another the office and at a time agreed upon a descent was made upon the publichouse and the apprehensions effected
One of the first things the officers did was to collar me  for the parties to the robbery werent to suppose yet that I was anything but a Butcher  on which the landlord cries out Dont take HIM he says whatever you do
Hes only a poor young chap from the country and butter wouldnt melt in his mouth
However they  ha ha ha
 they took me and pretended to search my bedroom where nothing was found but an old fiddle belonging to the landlord that had got there somehow or another
But it entirely changed the landlords opinion for when it was produced he says My fiddle
The Butchers a purloiner
I give him into custody for the robbery of a musical instrument
The man that had stolen the goods in Friday Street was not taken yet
He had told me in confidence that he had his suspicions there was something wrong on account of the City Police having captured one of the party and that he was going to make himself scarce
I asked him Where do you mean to go Mr
Shepherdson
Why Butcher says he the Setting Moon in the Commercial Road is a snug house and I shall bang out there for a time
I shall call myself Simpson which appears to me to be a modest sort of a name
Perhaps youll give us a look in Butcher
Well says I I think I WILL give you a call  which I fully intended dont you see because of course he was to be taken
I went over to the Setting Moon next day with a brother officer and asked at the bar for Simpson
They pointed out his room upstairs
As we were going up he looks down over the banister and calls out Halloa Butcher
is that you
Yes its me
How do you find yourself
Bobbish he says but whos that with you
Its only a young man thats a friend of mine I says
Come along then says he any friend of the Butchers is as welcome as the Butcher
So I made my friend acquainted with him and we took him into custody
You have no idea sir what a sight it was in Court when they first knew that I wasnt a Butcher after all
I wasnt produced at the first examination when there was a remand but I was at the second
And when I stepped into the box in full police uniform and the whole party saw how they had been done actually a groan of horror and dismay proceeded from em in the dock
At the Old Bailey when their trials came on Mr Clarkson was engaged for the defence and he COULDNT make out how it was about the Butcher
He thought all along it was a real Butcher
When the counsel for the prosecution said I will now call before you gentlemen the Policeofficer meaning myself Mr Clarkson says Why Policeofficer
Why more Policeofficers
I dont want Police
We have had a great deal too much of the Police
I want the Butcher
However sir he had the Butcher and the Police officer both in one
Out of seven prisoners committed for trial five were found guilty and some of em were transported
The respectable firm at the West End got a term of imprisonment and thats the Butchers Story
The story done the chuckleheaded Butcher again resolved himself into the smoothfaced Detective
But he was so extremely tickled by their having taken him about when he was that Dragon in disguise to show him London that he could not help reverting to that point in his narrative and gently repeating with the Butcher snigger Oh dear I says is that where they hang the men
Oh Lor
THAT
says they
What a simple cove he is
It being now late and the party very modest in their fear of being too diffuse there were some tokens of separation when Sergeant Dornton the soldierlylooking man said looking round him with a smile Before we break up sir perhaps you might have some amusement in hearing of the Adventures of a Carpet Bag
They are very short and I think curious
We welcomed the Carpet Bag as cordially as Mr Shepherdson welcomed the false Butcher at the Setting Moon
Sergeant Dornton proceeded
In 1847 I was despatched to Chatham in search of one Mesheck a Jew
He had been carrying on pretty heavily in the billstealing way getting acceptances from young men of good connexions in the army chiefly on pretence of discount and bolting with the same
Mesheck was off before I got to Chatham
All I could learn about him was that he had gone probably to London and had with him  a Carpet Bag
I came back to town by the last train from Blackwall and made inquiries concerning a Jew passenger with  a Carpet Bag
The office was shut up it being the last train
There were only two or three porters left
Looking after a Jew with a Carpet Bag on the Blackwall Railway which was then the high road to a great Military Depot was worse than looking after a needle in a hayrick
But it happened that one of these porters had carried for a certain Jew to a certain publichouse a certain  Carpet Bag
I went to the publichouse but the Jew had only left his luggage there for a few hours and had called for it in a cab and taken it away
I put such questions there and to the porter as I thought prudent and got at this description of  the Carpet Bag
It was a bag which had on one side of it worked in worsted a green parrot on a stand
A green parrot on a stand was the means by which to identify that  Carpet Bag
I traced Mesheck by means of this green parrot on a stand to Cheltenham to Birmingham to Liverpool to the Atlantic Ocean
At Liverpool he was too many for me
He had gone to the United States and I gave up all thoughts of Mesheck and likewise of his  Carpet Bag
Many months afterwards  near a year afterwards  there was a bank in Ireland robbed of seven thousand pounds by a person of the name of Doctor Dundey who escaped to America from which country some of the stolen notes came home
He was supposed to have bought a farm in New Jersey
Under proper management that estate could be seized and sold for the benefit of the parties he had defrauded
I was sent off to America for this purpose
I landed at Boston
I went on to New York
I found that he had lately changed New York papermoney for New Jersey paper money and had banked cash in New Brunswick
To take this Doctor Dundey it was necessary to entrap him into the State of New York which required a deal of artifice and trouble
At one time he couldnt be drawn into an appointment
At another time he appointed to come to meet me and a New York officer on a pretext I made and then his children had the measles
At last he came per steamboat and I took him and lodged him in a New York prison called the Tombs which I dare say you know sir
Editorial acknowledgment to that effect
I went to the Tombs on the morning after his capture to attend the examination before the magistrate
I was passing through the magistrates private room when happening to look round me to take notice of the place as we generally have a habit of doing I clapped my eyes in one corner on a  Carpet Bag
What did I see upon that Carpet Bag if youll believe me but a green parrot on a stand as large as life
That Carpet Bag with the representation of a green parrot on a stand said I belongs to an English Jew named Aaron Mesheck and to no other man alive or dead
I give you my word the New York Police Officers were doubled up with surprise
How did you ever come to know that
said they
I think I ought to know that green parrot by this time said I for I have had as pretty a dance after that bird at home as ever I had in all my life
And was it Meshecks
we submissively inquired
Was it sir
Of course it was
He was in custody for another offence in that very identical Tombs at that very identical time
And more than that
Some memoranda relating to the fraud for which I had vainly endeavoured to take him were found to be at that moment lying in that very same individual  Carpet Bag
Such are the curious coincidences and such is the peculiar ability always sharpening and being improved by practice and always adapting itself to every variety of circumstances and opposing itself to every new device that perverted ingenuity can invent for which this important social branch of the public service is remarkable
For ever on the watch with their wits stretched to the utmost these officers have from day to day and year to year to set themselves against every novelty of trickery and dexterity that the combined imaginations of all the lawless rascals in England can devise and to keep pace with every such invention that comes out
In the Courts of Justice the materials of thousands of such stories as we have narrated  often elevated into the marvellous and romantic by the circumstances of the case  are dryly compressed into the set phrase in consequence of information I received I did so and so
Suspicion was to be directed by careful inference and deduction upon the right person the right person was to be taken wherever he had gone or whatever he was doing to avoid detection he is taken there he is at the bar that is enough
From information I the officer received I did it and according to the custom in these cases I say no more
These games of chess played with live pieces are played before small audiences and are chronicled nowhere
The interest of the game supports the player
Its results are enough for justice
To compare great things with small suppose LEVERRIER or ADAMS informing the public that from information he had received he had discovered a new planet or COLUMBUS informing the public of his day that from information he had received he had discovered a new continent so the Detectives inform it that they have discovered a new fraud or an old offender and the process is unknown
Thus at midnight closed the proceedings of our curious and interesting party
But one other circumstance finally wound up the evening after our Detective guests had left us
One of the sharpest among them and the officer best acquainted with the Swell Mob had his pocket picked going home
THREE DETECTIVE ANECDOTES I
 THE PAIR OF GLOVES ITS a singler story sir said Inspector Wield of the Detective Police who in company with Sergeants Dornton and Mith paid us another twilight visit one July evening and Ive been thinking you might like to know it
Its concerning the murder of the young woman Eliza Grimwood some years ago over in the Waterloo Road
She was commonly called The Countess because of her handsome appearance and her proud way of carrying of herself and when I saw the poor Countess I had known her well to speak to lying dead with her throat cut on the floor of her bedroom youll believe me that a variety of reflections calculated to make a man rather low in his spirits came into my head
Thats neither here nor there
I went to the house the morning after the murder and examined the body and made a general observation of the bedroom where it was
Turning down the pillow of the bed with my hand I found underneath it a pair of gloves
A pair of gentlemans dress gloves very dirty and inside the lining the letters TR and a cross
Well sir I took them gloves away and I showed em to the magistrate over at Union Hall before whom the case was
He says Wield he says theres no doubt this is a discovery that may lead to something very important and what you have got to do Wield is to find out the owner of these gloves
I was of the same opinion of course and I went at it immediately
I looked at the gloves pretty narrowly and it was my opinion that they had been cleaned
There was a smell of sulphur and rosin about em you know which cleaned gloves usually have more or less
I took em over to a friend of mine at Kennington who was in that line and I put it to him
What do you say now
Have these gloves been cleaned
These gloves have been cleaned says he
Have you any idea who cleaned them
says I
Not at all says he Ive a very distinct idea who DIDNT clean em and thats myself
But Ill tell you what Wield there aint above eight or nine reglar glovecleaners in London  there were not at that time it seems  and I think I can give you their addresses and you may find out by that means who did clean em
Accordingly he gave me the directions and I went here and I went there and I looked up this man and I looked up that man but though they all agreed that the gloves had been cleaned I couldnt find the man woman or child that had cleaned that aforesaid pair of gloves
What with this person not being at home and that person being expected home in the afternoon and so forth the inquiry took me three days
On the evening of the third day coming over Waterloo Bridge from the Surrey side of the river quite beat and very much vexed and disappointed I thought Id have a shillings worth of entertainment at the Lyceum Theatre to freshen myself up
So I went into the Pit at halfprice and I sat myself down next to a very quiet modest sort of young man
Seeing I was a stranger which I thought it just as well to appear to be he told me the names of the actors on the stage and we got into conversation
When the play was over we came out together and I said Weve been very companionable and agreeable and perhaps you wouldnt object to a drain
Well youre very good says he I SHOULDNT object to a drain
Accordingly we went to a public house near the Theatre sat ourselves down in a quiet room up stairs on the first floor and called for a pint of halfandhalf apiece and a pipe
Well sir we put our pipes aboard and we drank our halfand half and sat atalking very sociably when the young man says You must excuse me stopping very long he says because Im forced to go home in good time
I must be at work all night
At work all night
says I
You aint a baker
No he says laughing I aint a baker
I thought not says I you havent the looks of a baker
No says he Im a glovecleaner
I never was more astonished in my life than when I heard them words come out of his lips
Youre a glovecleaner are you
says I
Yes he says I am
Then perhaps says I taking the gloves out of my pocket you can tell me who cleaned this pair of gloves
Its a rum story I says
I was dining over at Lambeth the other day at a freeandeasy  quite promiscuous  with a public company  when some gentleman he left these gloves behind him
Another gentleman and me you see we laid a wager of a sovereign that I wouldnt find out who they belonged to
Ive spent as much as seven shillings already in trying to discover but if you could help me Id stand another seven and welcome
You see theres TR and a cross inside
I see he says
Bless you I know these gloves very well
Ive seen dozens of pairs belonging to the same party
No
says I
Yes says he
Then you know who cleaned em
says I
Rather so says he
My father cleaned em
Where does your father live
says I
Just round the corner says the young man near Exeter Street here
Hell tell you who they belong to directly
Would you come round with me now
says I
Certainly says he but you neednt tell my father that you found me at the play you know because he mightnt like it
All right
We went round to the place and there we found an old man in a white apron with two or three daughters all rubbing and cleaning away at lots of gloves in a front parlour
Oh Father
says the young man heres a person been and made a bet about the ownership of a pair of gloves and Ive told him you can settle it
Good evening sir says I to the old gentleman
Heres the gloves your son speaks of
Letters TR you see and a cross
Oh yes he says I know these gloves very well Ive cleaned dozens of pairs of em
They belong to Mr Trinkle the great upholsterer in Cheapside
Did you get em from Mr Trinkle direct says I if youll excuse my asking the question
No says he Mr Trinkle always sends em to Mr Phibbss the haberdashers opposite his shop and the haberdasher sends em to me
Perhaps YOU wouldnt object to a drain
says I
Not in the least
says he
So I took the old gentleman out and had a little more talk with him and his son over a glass and we parted excellent friends
This was late on a Saturday night
First thing on the Monday morning I went to the haberdashers shop opposite Mr Trinkles the great upholsterers in Cheapside
Mr Phibbs in the way
My name is Phibbs
Oh
I believe you sent this pair of gloves to be cleaned
Yes I did for young Mr Trinkle over the way
There he is in the shop
Oh
thats him in the shop is it
Him in the green coat
The same individual
Well Mr Phibbs this is an unpleasant affair but the fact is I am Inspector Wield of the Detective Police and I found these gloves under the pillow of the young woman that was murdered the other day over in the Waterloo Road
Good Heaven
says he
Hes a most respectable young man and if his father was to hear of it it would be the ruin of him
Im very sorry for it says I but I must take him into custody
Good Heaven
says Mr Phibbs again can nothing be done
Nothing says I
Will you allow me to call him over here says he that his father may not see it done
I dont object to that says I but unfortunately Mr Phibbs I cant allow of any communication between you
If any was attempted I should have to interfere directly
Perhaps youll beckon him over here
Mr Phibbs went to the door and beckoned and the young fellow came across the street directly a smart brisk young fellow
Good morning sir says I
Good morning sir says he
Would you allow me to inquire sir says I if you ever had any acquaintance with a party of the name of Grimwood
Grimwood
Grimwood
says he
No
You know the Waterloo Road
Oh
of course I know the Waterloo Road
Happen to have heard of a young woman being murdered there
Yes I read it in the paper and very sorry I was to read it
Heres a pair of gloves belonging to you that I found under her pillow the morning afterwards
He was in a dreadful state sir a dreadful state I Mr Wield he says upon my solemn oath I never was there
I never so much as saw her to my knowledge in my life
I am very sorry says I
To tell you the truth I dont think you ARE the murderer but I must take you to Union Hall in a cab
However I think its a case of that sort that at present at all events the magistrate will hear it in private
A private examination took place and then it came out that this young man was acquainted with a cousin of the unfortunate Eliza Grimwood and that calling to see this cousin a day or two before the murder he left these gloves upon the table
Who should come in shortly afterwards but Eliza Grimwood
Whose gloves are these
she says taking em up
Those are Mr Trinkles gloves says her cousin
Oh
says she they are very dirty and of no use to him I am sure
I shall take em away for my girl to clean the stoves with
And she put em in her pocket
The girl had used em to clean the stoves and I have no doubt had left em lying on the bedroom mantelpiece or on the drawers or somewhere and her mistress looking round to see that the room was tidy had caught em up and put em under the pillow where I found em
Thats the story sir
II
 THE ARTFUL TOUCH One of the most BEAUTIFUL things that ever was done perhaps said Inspector Wield emphasising the adjective as preparing us to expect dexterity or ingenuity rather than strong interest was a move of Sergeant Witchems
It was a lovely idea
Witchem and me were down at Epsom one Derby Day waiting at the station for the Swell Mob
As I mentioned when we were talking about these things before we are ready at the station when theres races or an Agricultural Show or a Chancellor sworn in for an university or Jenny Lind or anything of that sort and as the Swell Mob come down we send em back again by the next train
But some of the Swell Mob on the occasion of this Derby that I refer to so far kidded us as to hire a horse and shay start away from London by Whitechapel and miles round come into Epsom from the opposite direction and go to work right and left on the course while we were waiting for em at the Rail
That however aint the point of what Im going to tell you
While Witchem and me were waiting at the station there comes up one Mr Tatt a gentleman formerly in the public line quite an amateur Detective in his way and very much respected
Halloa Charley Wield he says
What are you doing here
On the look out for some of your old friends
Yes the old move Mr
Tatt
Come along he says you and Witchem and have a glass of sherry
We cant stir from the place says I till the next train comes in but after that we will with pleasure
Mr Tatt waits and the train comes in and then Witchem and me go off with him to the Hotel
Mr Tatt hes got up quite regardless of expense for the occasion and in his shirtfront theres a beautiful diamond prop cost him fifteen or twenty pound  a very handsome pin indeed
We drink our sherry at the bar and have had our three or four glasses when Witchem cries suddenly Look out Mr Wield
stand fast
and a dash is made into the place by the Swell Mob  four of em  that have come down as I tell you and in a moment Mr Tatts prop is gone
Witchem he cuts em off at the door I lay about me as hard as I can Mr Tatt shows fight like a good un and there we are all down together heads and heels knocking about on the floor of the bar  perhaps you never see such a scene of confusion
However we stick to our men Mr Tatt being as good as any officer and we take em all and carry em off to the station
The stations full of people who have been took on the course and its a precious piece of work to get em secured
However we do it at last and we search em but nothings found upon em and theyre locked up and a pretty state of heat we are in by that time I assure you
I was very blank over it myself to think that the prop had been passed away and I said to Witchem when we had set em to rights and were cooling ourselves along with Mr Tatt we dont take much by THIS move anyway for nothings found upon em and its only the braggadocia 2 after all
What do you mean Mr
Wield
says Witchem
Heres the diamond pin
and in the palm of his hand there it was safe and sound
Why in the name of wonder says me and Mr Tatt in astonishment how did you come by that
Ill tell you how I come by it says he
I saw which of em took it and when we were all down on the floor together knocking about I just gave him a little touch on the back of his hand as I knew his pal would and he thought it WAS his pal and gave it me
It was beautiful beautiful
Even that was hardly the best of the case for that chap was tried at the Quarter Sessions at Guildford
You know what Quarter Sessions are sir
Well if youll believe me while them slow justices were looking over the Acts of Parliament to see what they could do to him Im blowed if he didnt cut out of the dock before their faces
He cut out of the dock sir then and there swam across a river and got up into a tree to dry himself
In the tree he was took  an old woman having seen him climb up  and Witchems artful touch transported him
III
 THE SOFA What young men will do sometimes to ruin themselves and break their friends hearts said Sergeant Dornton its surprising
I had a case at Saint Blanks Hospital which was of this sort
A bad case indeed with a bad end
The Secretary and the HouseSurgeon and the Treasurer of Saint Blanks Hospital came to Scotland Yard to give information of numerous robberies having been committed on the students
The students could leave nothing in the pockets of their greatcoats while the greatcoats were hanging at the hospital but it was almost certain to be stolen
Property of various descriptions was constantly being lost and the gentlemen were naturally uneasy about it and anxious for the credit of the institution that the thief or thieves should be discovered
The case was entrusted to me and I went to the hospital
Now gentlemen said I after we had talked it over I understand this property is usually lost from one room
Yes they said
It was
I should wish if you please said I to see the room
It was a goodsized bare room downstairs with a few tables and forms in it and a row of pegs all round for hats and coats
Next gentlemen said I do you suspect anybody
Yes they said
They did suspect somebody
They were sorry to say they suspected one of the porters
I should like said I to have that man pointed out to me and to have a little time to look after him
He was pointed out and I looked after him and then I went back to the hospital and said Now gentlemen its not the porter
Hes unfortunately for himself a little too fond of drink but hes nothing worse
My suspicion is that these robberies are committed by one of the students and if youll put me a sofa into that room where the pegs are  as theres no closet  I think I shall be able to detect the thief
I wish the sofa if you please to be covered with chintz or something of that sort so that I may lie on my chest underneath it without being seen
The sofa was provided and next day at eleven oclock before any of the students came I went there with those gentlemen to get underneath it
It turned out to be one of those oldfashioned sofas with a great crossbeam at the bottom that would have broken my back in no time if I could ever have got below it
We had quite a job to break all this away in the time however I fell to work and they fell to work and we broke it out and made a clear place for me
I got under the sofa lay down on my chest took out my knife and made a convenient hole in the chintz to look through
It was then settled between me and the gentlemen that when the students were all up in the wards one of the gentlemen should come in and hang up a greatcoat on one of the pegs
And that that greatcoat should have in one of the pockets a pocketbook containing marked money
After I had been there some time the students began to drop into the room by ones and twos and threes and to talk about all sorts of things little thinking there was anybody under the sofa  and then to go upstairs
At last there came in one who remained until he was alone in the room by himself
A tallish goodlooking young man of one or two and twenty with a light whisker
He went to a particular hatpeg took off a good hat that was hanging there tried it on hung his own hat in its place and hung that hat on another peg nearly opposite to me
I then felt quite certain that he was the thief and would come back byandby
When they were all upstairs the gentleman came in with the greatcoat
I showed him where to hang it so that I might have a good view of it and he went away and I lay under the sofa on my chest for a couple of hours or so waiting
At last the same young man came down
He walked across the room whistling  stopped and listened  took another walk and whistled  stopped again and listened  then began to go regularly round the pegs feeling in the pockets of all the coats
When he came to the greatcoat and felt the pocketbook he was so eager and so hurried that he broke the strap in tearing it open
As he began to put the money in his pocket I crawled out from under the sofa and his eyes met mine
My face as you may perceive is brown now but it was pale at that time my health not being good and looked as long as a horses
Besides which there was a great draught of air from the door underneath the sofa and I had tied a handkerchief round my head so what I looked like altogether I dont know
He turned blue  literally blue  when he saw me crawling out and I couldnt feel surprised at it
I am an officer of the Detective Police said I and have been lying here since you first came in this morning
I regret for the sake of yourself and your friends that you should have done what you have but this case is complete
You have the pocketbook in your hand and the money upon you and I must take you into custody
It was impossible to make out any case in his behalf and on his trial he pleaded guilty
How or when he got the means I dont know but while he was awaiting his sentence he poisoned himself in Newgate
We inquired of this officer on the conclusion of the foregoing anecdote whether the time appeared long or short when he lay in that constrained position under the sofa
Why you see sir he replied if he hadnt come in the first time and I had not been quite sure he was the thief and would return the time would have seemed long
But as it was I being dead certain of my man the time seemed pretty short
ON DUTY WITH INSPECTOR FIELD HOW goes the night
Saint Giless clock is striking nine
The weather is dull and wet and the long lines of street lamps are blurred as if we saw them through tears
A damp wind blows and rakes the piemans fire out when he opens the door of his little furnace carrying away an eddy of sparks
Saint Giless clock strikes nine
We are punctual
Where is Inspector Field
Assistant Commissioner of Police is already here enwrapped in oilskin cloak and standing in the shadow of Saint Giless steeple
Detective Sergeant weary of speaking French all day to foreigners unpacking at the Great Exhibition is already here
Where is Inspector Field
Inspector Field is tonight the guardian genius of the British Museum
He is bringing his shrewd eye to bear on every corner of its solitary galleries before he reports all right
Suspicious of the Elgin marbles and not to be done by catfaced Egyptian giants with their hands upon their knees Inspector Field sagacious vigilant lamp in hand throwing monstrous shadows on the walls and ceilings passes through the spacious rooms
If a mummy trembled in an atom of its dusty covering Inspector Field would say Come out of that Tom Green
I know you
If the smallest Gonoph about town were crouching at the bottom of a classic bath Inspector Field would nose him with a finer scent than the ogres when adventurous Jack lay trembling in his kitchen copper
But all is quiet and Inspector Field goes warily on making little outward show of attending to anything in particular just recognising the Ichthyosaurus as a familiar acquaintance and wondering perhaps how the detectives did it in the days before the Flood
Will Inspector Field be long about this work
He may be halfan hour longer
He sends his compliments by Police Constable and proposes that we meet at St Giless Station House across the road
Good
It were as well to stand by the fire there as in the shadow of Saint Giless steeple
Anything doing here tonight
Not much
We are very quiet
A lost boy extremely calm and small sitting by the fire whom we now confide to a constable to take home for the child says that if you show him Newgate Street he can show you where he lives  a raving drunken woman in the cells who has screeched her voice away and has hardly power enough left to declare even with the passionate help of her feet and arms that she is the daughter of a British officer and strike her blind and dead but shell write a letter to the Queen
but who is soothed with a drink of water  in another cell a quiet woman with a child at her breast for begging  in another her husband in a smockfrock with a basket of watercresses  in another a pickpocket  in another a meek tremulous old pauper man who has been out for a holiday and has took but a little drop but it has overcome him after so many months in the house  and thats all as yet
Presently a sensation at the Station House door
Mr Field gentlemen
Inspector Field comes in wiping his forehead for he is of a burly figure and has come fast from the ores and metals of the deep mines of the earth and from the Parrot Gods of the South Sea Islands and from the birds and beetles of the tropics and from the Arts of Greece and Rome and from the Sculptures of Nineveh and from the traces of an elder world when these were not
Is Rogers ready
Rogers is ready strapped and greatcoated with a flaming eye in the middle of his waist like a deformed Cyclops
Lead on Rogers to Rats Castle
How many people may there be in London who if we had brought them deviously and blindfold to this street fifty paces from the Station House and within call of Saint Giless church would know it for a not remote part of the city in which their lives are passed
How many who amidst this compound of sickening smells these heaps of filth these tumbling houses with all their vile contents animate and inanimate slimily overflowing into the black road would believe that they breathe THIS air
How much Red Tape may there be that could look round on the faces which now hem us in  for our appearance here has caused a rush from all points to a common centre  the lowering foreheads the sallow cheeks the brutal eyes the matted hair the infected verminhaunted heaps of rags  and say I have thought of this
I have not dismissed the thing
I have neither blustered it away nor frozen it away nor tied it up and put it away nor smoothly said pooh pooh
to it when it has been shown to me
This is not what Rogers wants to know however
What Rogers wants to know is whether you WILL clear the way here some of you or whether you wont because if you dont do it right on end hell lock you up
What
YOU are there are you Bob Miles
You havent had enough of it yet havent you
You want three months more do you
Come away from that gentleman
What are you creeping round there for
What am I a doing thinn Mr
Rogers
says Bob Miles appearing villainous at the end of a lane of light made by the lantern
Ill let you know pretty quick if you dont hook it
WILL you hook it
A sycophantic murmur rises from the crowd
Hook it Bob when Mr Rogers and Mr Field tells you
Why dont you hook it when you are told to
The most importunate of the voices strikes familiarly on Mr Rogerss ear
He suddenly turns his lantern on the owner
What
YOU are there are you Mister Click
You hook it too  come
What for
says Mr Click discomfited
You hook it will you
says Mr Rogers with stern emphasis
Both Click and Miles DO hook it without another word or in plainer English sneak away
Close up there my men
says Inspector Field to two constables on duty who have followed
Keep together gentlemen we are going down here
Heads
Saint Giless church strikes halfpast ten
We stoop low and creep down a precipitous flight of steps into a dark close cellar
There is a fire
There is a long deal table
There are benches
The cellar is full of company chiefly very young men in various conditions of dirt and raggedness
Some are eating supper
There are no girls or women present
Welcome to Rats Castle gentlemen and to this company of noted thieves
Well my lads
How are you my lads
What have you been doing today
Heres some company come to see you my lads
 THERES a plate of beefsteak sir for the supper of a fine young man
And theres a mouth for a steak sir
Why I should be too proud of such a mouth as that if I had it myself
Stand up and show it sir
Take off your cap
Theres a fine young man for a nice little party sir
Ant he
Inspector Field is the bustling speaker
Inspector Fields eye is the roving eye that searches every corner of the cellar as he talks
Inspector Fields hand is the wellknown hand that has collared half the people here and motioned their brothers sisters fathers mothers male and female friends inexorably to New South Wales
Yet Inspector Field stands in this den the Sultan of the place
Every thief here cowers before him like a schoolboy before his schoolmaster
All watch him all answer when addressed all laugh at his jokes all seek to propitiate him
This cellar company alone  to say nothing of the crowd surrounding the entrance from the street above and making the steps shine with eyes  is strong enough to murder us all and willing enough to do it but let Inspector Field have a mind to pick out one thief here and take him let him produce that ghostly truncheon from his pocket and say with his businessair My lad I want you
and all Rats Castle shall be stricken with paralysis and not a finger move against him as he fits the handcuffs on
Wheres the Earl of Warwick
 Here he is Mr Field
Heres the Earl of Warwick Mr Field
 O there you are my Lord
Come forard
Theres a chest sir not to have a clean shirt on
Ant it
Take your hat off my Lord
Why I should be ashamed if I was you  and an Earl too  to show myself to a gentleman with my hat on
 The Earl of Warwick laughs and uncovers
All the company laugh
One pickpocket especially laughs with great enthusiasm
O what a jolly game it is when Mr Field comes down  and dont want nobody
So YOU are here too are you you tall grey soldierlylooking grave man standing by the fire
 Yes sir
Good evening Mr Field
 Let us see
You lived servant to a nobleman once
 Yes Mr Field
 And what is it you do now I forget
 Well Mr Field I job about as well as I can
I left my employment on account of delicate health
The family is still kind to me
Mr Wix of Piccadilly is also very kind to me when I am hard up
Likewise Mr Nix of Oxford Street
I get a trifle from them occasionally and rub on as well as I can Mr Field
Mr Fields eye rolls enjoyingly for this man is a notorious beggingletter writer
 Good night my lads
 Good night Mr Field and thankee sir
Clear the street here half a thousand of you
Cut it Mrs Stalker  none of that  we dont want you
Rogers of the flaming eye lead on to the tramps lodginghouse
A dream of baleful faces attends to the door
Now stand back all of you
In the rear Detective Sergeant plants himself composedly whistling with his strong right arm across the narrow passage
Mrs Stalker I am somethingd that need not be written here if you wont get yourself into trouble in about half a minute if I see that face of yours again
Saint Giless church clock striking eleven hums through our hand from the dilapidated door of a dark outhouse as we open it and are stricken back by the pestilent breath that issues from within
Rogers to the front with the light and let us look
Ten twenty thirty  who can count them
Men women children for the most part naked heaped upon the floor like maggots in a cheese
Ho
In that dark corner yonder
Does anybody lie there
Me sir Irish me a widder with six children
And yonder
Me sir Irish me with me wife and eight poor babes
And to the left there
Me sir Irish me along with two more Irish boys as is me friends
And to the right there
Me sir and the Murphy famly numbering five blessed souls
And whats this coiling now about my foot
Another Irish me pitifully in want of shaving whom I have awakened from sleep  and across my other foot lies his wife  and by the shoes of Inspector Field lie their three eldest  and their three youngest are at present squeezed between the open door and the wall
And why is there no one on that little mat before the sullen fire
Because ODonovan with his wife and daughter is not come in from selling Lucifers
Nor on the bit of sacking in the nearest corner
Bad luck
Because that Irish family is late tonight acadging in the streets
They are all awake now the children excepted and most of them sit up to stare
Wheresoever Mr Rogers turns the flaming eye there is a spectral figure rising unshrouded from a grave of rags
Who is the landlord here
 I am Mr Field
says a bundle of ribs and parchment against the wall scratching itself
 Will you spend this money fairly in the morning to buy coffee for em all
 Yes sir I will
 O hell do it sir hell do it fair
Hes honest
cry the spectres
And with thanks and Good Night sink into their graves again
Thus we make our New Oxford Streets and our other new streets never heeding never asking where the wretches whom we clear out crowd
With such scenes at our doors with all the plagues of Egypt tied up with bits of cobweb in kennels so near our homes we timorously make our Nuisance Bills and Boards of Health nonentities and think to keep away the Wolves of Crime and Filth by our electioneering ducking to little vestrymen and our gentlemanly handling of Red Tape
Intelligence of the coffeemoney has got abroad
The yard is full and Rogers of the flaming eye is beleaguered with entreaties to show other Lodging Houses
Mine next
Mine
Mine
Rogers military obdurate stiffnecked immovable replies not but leads away all falling back before him
Inspector Field follows
Detective Sergeant with his barrier of arm across the little passage deliberately waits to close the procession
He sees behind him without any effort and exceedingly disturbs one individual far in the rear by coolly calling out It wont do Mr Michael
Dont try it
After council holden in the street we enter other lodginghouses publichouses many lairs and holes all noisome and offensive none so filthy and so crowded as where Irish are
In one The Ethiopian party are expected home presently  were in Oxford Street when last heard of  shall be fetched for our delight within ten minutes
In another one of the two or three Professors who drew Napoleon Buonaparte and a couple of mackerel on the pavement and then let the work of art out to a speculator is refreshing after his labours
In another the vested interest of the profitable nuisance has been in one family for a hundred years and the landlord drives in comfortably from the country to his snug little stew in town
In all Inspector Field is received with warmth
Coiners and smashers droop before him pickpockets defer to him the gentle sex not very gentle here smile upon him
Halfdrunken hags check themselves in the midst of pots of beer or pints of gin to drink to Mr Field and pressingly to ask the honour of his finishing the draught
One beldame in rusty black has such admiration for him that she runs a whole streets length to shake him by the hand tumbling into a heap of mud by the way and still pressing her attentions when her very form has ceased to be distinguishable through it
Before the power of the law the power of superior sense  for common thieves are fools beside these men  and the power of a perfect mastery of their character the garrison of Rats Castle and the adjacent Fortresses make but a skulking show indeed when reviewed by Inspector Field
Saint Giless clock says it will be midnight in halfanhour and Inspector Field says we must hurry to the Old Mint in the Borough
The cabdriver is lowspirited and has a solemn sense of his responsibility
Now whats your fare my lad
 O YOU know Inspector Field whats the good of asking ME
Say Parker strapped and greatcoated and waiting in dim Borough doorway by appointment to replace the trusty Rogers whom we left deep in Saint Giless are you ready
Ready Inspector Field and at a motion of my wrist behold my flaming eye
This narrow street sir is the chief part of the Old Mint full of low lodginghouses as you see by the transparent canvaslamps and blinds announcing beds for travellers
But it is greatly changed friend Field from my former knowledge of it it is infinitely quieter and more subdued than when I was here last some seven years ago
O yes
Inspector Haynes a firstrate man is on this station now and plays the Devil with them
Well my lads
How are you tonight my lads
Playing cards here eh
Who wins
 Why Mr Field I the sulky gentleman with the damp flat sidecurls rubbing my bleared eye with the end of my neckerchief which is like a dirty eelskin am losing just at present but I suppose I must take my pipe out of my mouth and be submissive to YOU  I hope I see you well Mr Field
 Aye all right my lad
Deputy who have you got upstairs
Be pleased to show the rooms
Why Deputy Inspector Field cant say
He only knows that the man who takes care of the beds and lodgers is always called so
Steady O Deputy with the flaring candle in the blackingbottle for this is a slushy backyard and the wooden staircase outside the house creaks and has holes in it
Again in these confined intolerable rooms burrowed out like the holes of rats or the nests of insectvermin but fuller of intolerable smells are crowds of sleepers each on his foul trucklebed coiled up beneath a rug
Holloa here
Come
Let us see you
Show your face
Pilot Parker goes from bed to bed and turns their slumbering heads towards us as a salesman might turn sheep
Some wake up with an execration and a threat
 What
who spoke
O
If its the accursed glaring eye that fixes me go where I will I am helpless
Here
I sit up to be looked at
Is it me you want
Not you lie down again
and I lie down with a woful growl
Whenever the turning lane of light becomes stationary for a moment some sleeper appears at the end of it submits himself to be scrutinised and fades away into the darkness
There should be strange dreams here Deputy
They sleep sound enough says Deputy taking the candle out of the blackingbottle snuffing it with his fingers throwing the snuff into the bottle and corking it up with the candle thats all I know
What is the inscription Deputy on all the discoloured sheets
A precaution against loss of linen
Deputy turns down the rug of an unoccupied bed and discloses it
STOP THIEF
To lie at night wrapped in the legend of my slinking life to take the cry that pursues me waking to my breast in sleep to have it staring at me and clamouring for me as soon as consciousness returns to have it for my firstfoot on NewYears day my Valentine my Birthday salute my Christmas greeting my parting with the old year
STOP THIEF
And to know that I MUST be stopped come what will
To know that I am no match for this individual energy and keenness or this organised and steady system
Come across the street here and entering by a little shop and yard examine these intricate passages and doors contrived for escape flapping and counter flapping like the lids of the conjurers boxes
But what avail they
Who gets in by a nod and shows their secret working to us
Inspector Field
Dont forget the old Farm House Parker
Parker is not the man to forget it
We are going there now
It is the old ManorHouse of these parts and stood in the country once
Then perhaps there was something which was not the beastly street to see from the shattered low fronts of the overhanging wooden houses we are passing under  shut up now pasted over with bills about the literature and drama of the Mint and mouldering away
This long paved yard was a paddock or a garden once or a court in front of the Farm House
Perchance with a dovecot in the centre and fowls peeking about  with fair elm trees then where discoloured chimneystacks and gables are now  noisy then with rooks which have yielded to a different sort of rookery
Its likelier than not Inspector Field thinks as we turn into the common kitchen which is in the yard and many paces from the house
Well my lads and lasses how are you all
Wheres Blackey who has stood near London Bridge these fiveandtwenty years with a painted skin to represent disease
 Here he is Mr Field
 How are you Blackey
 Jolly sa
Not playing the fiddle tonight Blackey
 Not a night sa
A sharp smiling youth the wit of the kitchen interposes
He ant musical tonight sir
Ive been giving him a moral lecture Ive been a talking to him about his latter end you see
A good many of these are my pupils sir
This here young man smoothing down the hair of one near him reading a Sunday paper is a pupil of mine
Im a teaching of him to read sir
Hes a promising cove sir
Hes a smith he is and gets his living by the sweat of the brow sir
So do I myself sir
This young woman is my sister Mr Field
SHES getting on very well too
Ive a deal of trouble with em sir but Im richly rewarded now I see em all a doing so well and growing up so creditable
Thats a great comfort that is ant it sir
 In the midst of the kitchen the whole kitchen is in ecstasies with this impromptu chaff sits a young modest gentlelooking creature with a beautiful child in her lap
She seems to belong to the company but is so strangely unlike it
She has such a pretty quiet face and voice and is so proud to hear the child admired  thinks you would hardly believe that he is only nine months old
Is she as bad as the rest I wonder
Inspectorial experience does not engender a belief contrariwise but prompts the answer Not a haporth of difference
There is a piano going in the old Farm House as we approach
It stops
Landlady appears
Has no objections Mr Field to gentlemen being brought but wishes it were at earlier hours the lodgers complaining of illconwenience
Inspector Field is polite and soothing  knows his woman and the sex
Deputy a girl in this case shows the way up a heavy broad old staircase kept very clean into clean rooms where many sleepers are and where painted panels of an older time look strangely on the truckle beds
The sight of whitewash and the smell of soap  two things we seem by this time to have parted from in infancy  make the old Farm House a phenomenon and connect themselves with the so curiously misplaced picture of the pretty mother and child long after we have left it  long after we have left besides the neighbouring nook with something of a rustic flavour in it yet where once beneath a low wooden colonnade still standing as of yore the eminent Jack Sheppard condescended to regale himself and where now two old bachelor brothers in broad hats who are whispered in the Mint to have made a compact long ago that if either should ever marry he must forfeit his share of the joint property still keep a sequestered tavern and sit o nights smoking pipes in the bar among ancient bottles and glasses as our eyes behold them
How goes the night now
Saint George of Southwark answers with twelve blows upon his bell
Parker good night for Williams is already waiting over in the region of Ratcliffe Highway to show the houses where the sailors dance
I should like to know where Inspector Field was born
In Ratcliffe Highway I would have answered with confidence but for his being equally at home wherever we go
HE does not trouble his head as I do about the river at night
HE does not care for its creeping black and silent on our right there rushing through sluicegates lapping at piles and posts and iron rings hiding strange things in its mud running away with suicides and accidentally drowned bodies faster than midnight funeral should and acquiring such various experience between its cradle and its grave
It has no mystery for HIM
Is there not the Thames Police
Accordingly Williams leads the way
We are a little late for some of the houses are already closing
No matter
You show us plenty
All the landlords know Inspector Field
All pass him freely and goodhumouredly wheresoever he wants to go
So thoroughly are all these houses open to him and our local guide that granting that sailors must be entertained in their own way  as I suppose they must and have a right to be  I hardly know how such places could be better regulated
Not that I call the company very select or the dancing very graceful  even so graceful as that of the German Sugar Bakers whose assembly by the Minories we stopped to visit  but there is watchful maintenance of order in every house and swift expulsion where need is
Even in the midst of drunkenness both of the lethargic kind and the lively there is sharp landlord supervision and pockets are in less peril than out of doors
These houses show singularly how much of the picturesque and romantic there truly is in the sailor requiring to be especially addressed
All the songs sung in a hailstorm of halfpence which are pitched at the singer without the least tenderness for the time or tune  mostly from great rolls of copper carried for the purpose  and which he occasionally dodges like shot as they fly near his head are of the sentimental sea sort
All the rooms are decorated with nautical subjects
Wrecks engagements ships on fire ships passing lighthouses on ironbound coasts ships blowing up ships going down ships running ashore men lying out upon the mainyard in a gale of wind sailors and ships in every variety of peril constitute the illustrations of fact
Nothing can be done in the fanciful way without a thumping boy upon a scaly dolphin
How goes the night now
Past one
Black and Green are waiting in Whitechapel to unveil the mysteries of Wentworth Street
Williams the best of friends must part
Adieu
Are not Black and Green ready at the appointed place
O yes
They glide out of shadow as we stop
Imperturbable Black opens the cab door Imperturbable Green takes a mental note of the driver
Both Green and Black then open each his flaming eye and marshal us the way that we are going
The lodginghouse we want is hidden in a maze of streets and courts
It is fast shut
We knock at the door and stand hushed looking up for a light at one or other of the begrimed old lattice windows in its ugly front when another constable comes up  supposes that we want to see the school
Detective Sergeant meanwhile has got over a rail opened a gate dropped down an area overcome some other little obstacles and tapped at a window
Now returns
The landlord will send a deputy immediately
Deputy is heard to stumble out of bed
Deputy lights a candle draws back a bolt or two and appears at the door
Deputy is a shivering shirt and trousers by no means clean a yawning face a shock head much confused externally and internally
We want to look for some one
You may go up with the light and take em all if you like says Deputy resigning it and sitting down upon a bench in the kitchen with his ten fingers sleepily twisting in his hair
Halloa here
Now then
Show yourselves
Thatll do
Its not you
Dont disturb yourself any more
So on through a labyrinth of airless rooms each man responding like a wild beast to the keeper who has tamed him and who goes into his cage
What you havent found him then
says Deputy when we came down
A woman mysteriously sitting up all night in the dark by the smouldering ashes of the kitchen fire says its only tramps and cadgers here its gonophs over the way
A man mysteriously walking about the kitchen all night in the dark bids her hold her tongue
We come out
Deputy fastens the door and goes to bed again
Black and Green you know Bark lodginghouse keeper and receiver of stolen goods
 O yes Inspector Field
 Go to Barks next
Bark sleeps in an inner wooden hutch near his street door
As we parley on the step with Barks Deputy Bark growls in his bed
We enter and Bark flies out of bed
Bark is a red villain and a wrathful with a sanguine throat that looks very much as if it were expressly made for hanging as he stretches it out in pale defiance over the halfdoor of his hutch
Barks parts of speech are of an awful sort  principally adjectives
I wont says Bark have no adjective police and adjective strangers in my adjective premises
I wont by adjective and substantive
Give me my trousers and Ill send the whole adjective police to adjective and substantive
Give me says Bark my adjective trousers
Ill put an adjective knife in the whole bileing of em
Ill punch their adjective heads
Ill rip up their adjective substantives
Give me my adjective trousers
says Bark and Ill spile the bileing of em
Now Bark whats the use of this
Heres Black and Green Detective Sergeant and Inspector Field
You know we will come in
 I know you wont
says Bark
Somebody give me my adjective trousers
Barks trousers seem difficult to find
He calls for them as Hercules might for his club
Give me my adjective trousers
says Bark and Ill spile the bileing of em
Inspector Field holds that its all one whether Bark likes the visit or dont like it
He Inspector Field is an Inspector of the Detective Police Detective Sergeant IS Detective Sergeant Black and Green are constables in uniform
Dont you be a fool Bark or you know it will be the worse for you
 I dont care says Bark
Give me my adjective trousers
At two oclock in the morning we descend into Barks low kitchen leaving Bark to foam at the mouth above and Imperturbable Black and Green to look at him
Barks kitchen is crammed full of thieves holding a CONVERSAZIONE there by lamplight
It is by far the most dangerous assembly we have seen yet
Stimulated by the ravings of Bark above their looks are sullen but not a man speaks
We ascend again
Bark has got his trousers and is in a state of madness in the passage with his back against a door that shuts off the upper staircase
We observe in other respects a ferocious individuality in Bark
Instead of STOP THIEF
on his linen he prints STOLEN FROM Barks
Now Bark we are going upstairs
 No you aint
 YOU refuse admission to the Police do you Bark
 Yes I do
I refuse it to all the adjective police and to all the adjective substantives
If the adjective coves in the kitchen was men theyd come up now and do for you
Shut me that there door
says Bark and suddenly we are enclosed in the passage
Theyd come up and do for you
cries Bark and waits
Not a sound in the kitchen
Theyd come up and do for you
cries Bark again and waits
Not a sound in the kitchen
We are shut up halfadozen of us in Barks house in the innermost recesses of the worst part of London in the dead of the night  the house is crammed with notorious robbers and ruffians  and not a man stirs
No Bark
They know the weight of the law and they know Inspector Field and Co too well
We leave bully Bark to subside at leisure out of his passion and his trousers and I dare say to be inconveniently reminded of this little brush before long
Black and Green do ordinary duty here and look serious
As to White who waits on Holborn Hill to show the courts that are eaten out of Rotten Grays Inn Lane where other lodginghouses are and where in one blind alley the Thieves Kitchen and Seminary for the teaching of the art to children is the night has so worn away being now almost at odds with morning which is which that they are quiet and no light shines through the chinks in the shutters
As undistinctive Death will come here one day sleep comes now
The wicked cease from troubling sometimes even in this life
DOWN WITH THE TIDE A VERY dark night it was and bitter cold the east wind blowing bleak and bringing with it stinging particles from marsh and moor and fen  from the Great Desert and Old Egypt may be
Some of the component parts of the sharpedged vapour that came flying up the Thames at London might be mummydust dry atoms from the Temple at Jerusalem camels footprints crocodiles hatching places loosened grains of expression from the visages of blunt nosed sphynxes waifs and strays from caravans of turbaned merchants vegetation from jungles frozen snow from the Himalayas
O
It was very very dark upon the Thames and it was bitter bitter cold
And yet said the voice within the great peacoat at my side youll have seen a good many rivers too I dare say
Truly said I when I come to think of it not a few
From the Niagara downward to the mountain rivers of Italy which are like the national spirit  very tame or chafing suddenly and bursting bounds only to dwindle away again
The Moselle and the Rhine and the Rhone and the Seine and the Saone and the St Lawrence Mississippi and Ohio and the Tiber the Po and the Arno and the   Peacoat coughing as if he had had enough of that I said no more
I could have carried the catalogue on to a teasing length though if I had been in the cruel mind
And after all said he this looks so dismal
So awful I returned at night
The Seine at Paris is very gloomy too at such a time and is probably the scene of far more crime and greater wickedness but this river looks so broad and vast so murky and silent seems such an image of death in the midst of the great citys life that   That Peacoat coughed again
He COULD NOT stand my holding forth
We were in a fouroared Thames Police Galley lying on our oars in the deep shadow of Southwark Bridge  under the corner arch on the Surrey side  having come down with the tide from Vauxhall
We were fain to hold on pretty tight though close in shore for the river was swollen and the tide running down very strong
We were watching certain waterrats of human growth and lay in the deep shade as quiet as mice our light hidden and our scraps of conversation carried on in whispers
Above us the massive iron girders of the arch were faintly visible and below us its ponderous shadow seemed to sink down to the bottom of the stream
We had been lying here some half an hour
With our backs to the wind it is true but the wind being in a determined temper blew straight through us and would not take the trouble to go round
I would have boarded a fireship to get into action and mildly suggested as much to my friend Pea
No doubt says he as patiently as possible but shoregoing tactics wouldnt do with us
Riverthieves can always get rid of stolen property in a moment by dropping it overboard
We want to take them WITH the property so we lurk about and come out upon em sharp
If they see us or hear us over it goes
Peas wisdom being indisputable there was nothing for it but to sit there and be blown through for another halfhour
The water rats thinking it wise to abscond at the end of that time without commission of felony we shot out disappointed with the tide
Grim they look dont they
said Pea seeing me glance over my shoulder at the lights upon the bridge and downward at their long crooked reflections in the river
Very said I and make one think with a shudder of Suicides
What a night for a dreadful leap from that parapet
Aye but Waterloos the favourite bridge for making holes in the water from returned Pea
By the bye  avast pulling lads
 would you like to speak to Waterloo on the subject
My face confessing a surprised desire to have some friendly conversation with Waterloo Bridge and my friend Pea being the most obliging of men we put about pulled out of the force of the stream and in place of going at great speed with the tide began to strive against it close in shore again
Every colour but black seemed to have departed from the world
The air was black the water was black the barges and hulks were black the piles were black the buildings were black the shadows were only a deeper shade of black upon a black ground
Here and there a coal fire in an iron cresset blazed upon a wharf but one knew that it too had been black a little while ago and would be black again soon
Uncomfortable rushes of water suggestive of gurgling and drowning ghostly rattlings of iron chains dismal clankings of discordant engines formed the music that accompanied the dip of our oars and their rattling in the rowlocks
Even the noises had a black sound to me  as the trumpet sounded red to the blind man
Our dexterous boats crew made nothing of the tide and pulled us gallantly up to Waterloo Bridge
Here Pea and I disembarked passed under the black stone archway and climbed the steep stone steps
Within a few feet of their summit Pea presented me to Waterloo or an eminent tolltaker representing that structure muffled up to the eyes in a thick shawl and amply greatcoated and furcapped
Waterloo received us with cordiality and observed of the night that it was a Searcher
He had been originally called the Strand Bridge he informed us but had received his present name at the suggestion of the proprietors when Parliament had resolved to vote three hundred thousand pound for the erection of a monument in honour of the victory
Parliament took the hint said Waterloo with the least flavour of misanthropy and saved the money
Of course the late Duke of Wellington was the first passenger and of course he paid his penny and of course a noble lord preserved it evermore
The treadle and index at the tollhouse a most ingenious contrivance for rendering fraud impossible were invented by Mr Lethbridge then propertyman at Drury Lane Theatre
Was it suicide we wanted to know about
said Waterloo
Ha
Well he had seen a good deal of that work he did assure us
He had prevented some
Why one day a woman poorish looking came in between the hatch slapped down a penny and wanted to go on without the change
Waterloo suspected this and says to his mate give an eye to the gate and bolted after her
She had got to the third seat between the piers and was on the parapet just a going over when he caught her and gave her in charge
At the police office next morning she said it was along of trouble and a bad husband
Likely enough observed Waterloo to Pea and myself as he adjusted his chin in his shawl
Theres a deal of trouble about you see  and bad husbands too
Another time a young woman at twelve oclock in the open day got through darted along and before Waterloo could come near her jumped upon the parapet and shot herself over sideways
Alarm given watermen put off lucky escape
 Clothes buoyed her up
This is where it is said Waterloo
If people jump off straight forwards from the middle of the parapet of the bays of the bridge they are seldom killed by drowning but are smashed poor things thats what THEY are they dash themselves upon the buttress of the bridge
But you jump off said Waterloo to me putting his fore finger in a buttonhole of my greatcoat you jump off from the side of the bay and youll tumble true into the stream under the arch
What you have got to do is to mind how you jump in
There was poor Tom Steele from Dublin
Didnt dive
Bless you didnt dive at all
Fell down so flat into the water that he broke his breastbone and lived two days
I asked Waterloo if there were a favourite side of his bridge for this dreadful purpose
He reflected and thought yes there was
He should say the Surrey side
Three decentlooking men went through one day soberly and quietly and went on abreast for about a dozen yards when the middle one he sung out all of a sudden Here goes Jack
and was over in a minute
Body found
Well
Waterloo didnt rightly recollect about that
They were compositors THEY were
He considered it astonishing how quick people were
Why there was a cab came up one Boxingnight with a young woman in it who looked according to Waterloos opinion of her a little the worse for liquor very handsome she was too  very handsome
She stopped the cab at the gate and said shed pay the cabman then which she did though there was a little hankering about the fare because at first she didnt seem quite to know where she wanted to be drove to
However she paid the man and the toll too and looking Waterloo in the face he thought she knew him dont you see
said Ill finish it somehow
Well the cab went off leaving Waterloo a little doubtful in his mind and while it was going on at full speed the young woman jumped out never fell hardly staggered ran along the bridge pavement a little way passing several people and jumped over from the second opening
At the inquest it was giv in evidence that she had been quarrelling at the Hero of Waterloo and it was brought in jealousy
One of the results of Waterloos experience was that there was a deal of jealousy about
Do we ever get madmen
said Waterloo in answer to an inquiry of mine
Well we DO get madmen
Yes we have had one or two escaped from Sylums I suppose
One hadnt a halfpenny and because I wouldnt let him through he went back a little way stooped down took a run and butted at the hatch like a ram
He smashed his hat rarely but his head didnt seem no worse  in my opinion on account of his being wrong in it afore
Sometimes people havent got a halfpenny
If they are really tired and poor we give em one and let em through
Other people will leave things  pockethandkerchiefs mostly
I HAVE taken cravats and gloves pocketknives toothpicks studs shirtpins rings generally from young gents early in the morning but handkerchiefs is the general thing
Regular customers
said Waterloo
Lord yes
We have regular customers
One such a wornout usedup old file as you can scarcely picter comes from the Surrey side as regular as ten oclock at night comes and goes over I think to some flash house on the Middlesex side
He comes back he does as reglar as the clock strikes three in the morning and then can hardly drag one of his old legs after the other
He always turns down the water stairs comes up again and then goes on down the Waterloo Road
He always does the same thing and never varies a minute
Does it every night  even Sundays
I asked Waterloo if he had given his mind to the possibility of this particular customer going down the waterstairs at three oclock some morning and never coming up again
He didnt think THAT of him he replied
In fact it was Waterloos opinion founded on his observation of that file that he knowd a trick worth two of it
Theres another queer old customer said Waterloo comes over as punctual as the almanack at eleven oclock on the sixth of January at eleven oclock on the fifth of April at eleven oclock on the sixth of July at eleven oclock on the tenth of October
Drives a shaggy little rough pony in a sort of a rattletrap arm chair sort of a thing
White hair he has and white whiskers and muffles himself up with all manner of shawls
He comes back again the same afternoon and we never see more of him for three months
He is a captain in the navy  retired  wery old  wery odd  and served with Lord Nelson
He is particular about drawing his pension at Somerset House afore the clock strikes twelve every quarter
I HAVE heerd say that he thinks it wouldnt be according to the Act of Parliament if he didnt draw it afore twelve
Having related these anecdotes in a natural manner which was the best warranty in the world for their genuine nature our friend Waterloo was sinking deep into his shawl again as having exhausted his communicative powers and taken in enough east wind when my other friend Pea in a moment brought him to the surface by asking whether he had not been occasionally the subject of assault and battery in the execution of his duty
Waterloo recovering his spirits instantly dashed into a new branch of his subject
We learnt how both these teeth  here he pointed to the places where two front teeth were not  were knocked out by an ugly customer who one night made a dash at him Waterloo while his the ugly customers pal and coadjutor made a dash at the tolltaking apron where the moneypockets were how Waterloo letting the teeth go to Blazes he observed indefinitely grappled with the apron seizer permitting the ugly one to run away and how he saved the bank and captured his man and consigned him to fine and imprisonment
Also how on another night a Cove laid hold of Waterloo then presiding at the horsegate of his bridge and threw him unceremoniously over his knee having first cut his head open with his whip
How Waterloo got right and started after the Cove all down the Waterloo Road through Stamford Street and round to the foot of Blackfriars Bridge where the Cove cut into a publichouse
How Waterloo cut in too but how an aider and abettor of the Coves who happened to be taking a promiscuous drain at the bar stopped Waterloo and the Cove cut out again ran across the road down Holland Street and where not and into a beershop
How Waterloo breaking away from his detainer was close upon the Coves heels attended by no end of people who seeing him running with the blood streaming down his face thought something worse was up and roared Fire
and Murder
on the hopeful chance of the matter in hand being one or both
How the Cove was ignominiously taken in a shed where he had run to hide and how at the Police Court they at first wanted to make a sessions job of it but eventually Waterloo was allowed to be spoke to and the Cove made it square with Waterloo by paying his doctors bill W was laid up for a week and giving him Three ten
Likewise we learnt what we had faintly suspected before that your sporting amateur on the Derby day albeit a captain can be  if he be as Captain Bobadil observes so generously minded  anything but a man of honour and a gentleman not sufficiently gratifying his nice sense of humour by the witty scattering of flour and rotten eggs on obtuse civilians but requiring the further excitement of bilking the toll and Pitching into Waterloo and cutting him about the head with his whip finally being when called upon to answer for the assault what Waterloo described as Minus or as I humbly conceived it not to be found
Likewise did Waterloo inform us in reply to my inquiries admiringly and deferentially preferred through my friend Pea that the takings at the Bridge had more than doubled in amount since the reduction of the toll one half
And being asked if the aforesaid takings included much bad money Waterloo responded with a look far deeper than the deepest part of the river HE should think not
 and so retired into his shawl for the rest of the night
Then did Pea and I once more embark in our fouroared galley and glide swiftly down the river with the tide
And while the shrewd East rasped and notched us as with jagged razors did my friend Pea impart to me confidences of interest relating to the Thames Police we between whiles finding duty boats hanging in dark corners under banks like weeds  our own was a supervision boat  and they as they reported all right
flashing their hidden light on us and we flashing ours on them
These duty boats had one sitter in each an Inspector and were rowed Randan which  for the information of those who never graduated as I was once proud to do under a firemanwaterman and winner of Keans Prize Wherry who in the course of his tuition took hundreds of gallons of rum and egg at my expense at the various houses of note above and below bridge not by any means because he liked it but to cure a weakness in his liver for which the faculty had particularly recommended it  may be explained as rowed by three men two pulling an oar each and one a pair of sculls
Thus floating down our black highway sullenly frowned upon by the knitted brows of Blackfriars Southwark and London each in his lowering turn I was shown by my friend Pea that there are in the Thames Police Force whose district extends from Battersea to Barking Creek ninetyeight men eight duty boats and two supervision boats and that these go about so silently and lie in wait in such dark places and so seem to be nowhere and so may be anywhere that they have gradually become a police of prevention keeping the river almost clear of any great crimes even while the increased vigilance on shore has made it much harder than of yore to live by thieving in the streets
And as to the various kinds of waterthieves said my friend Pea there were the Tierrangers who silently dropped alongside the tiers of shipping in the Pool by night and who going to the companionhead listened for two snores  snore number one the skippers snore number two the mates  mates and skippers always snoring great guns and being dead sure to be hard at it if they had turned in and were asleep
Hearing the double fire down went the Rangers into the skippers cabins groped for the skippers inexpressibles which it was the custom of those gentlemen to shake off watch money braces boots and all together on the floor and therewith made off as silently as might be
Then there were the Lumpers or labourers employed to unload vessels
They wore loose canvas jackets with a broad hem in the bottom turned inside so as to form a large circular pocket in which they could conceal like clowns in pantomimes packages of surprising sizes
A great deal of property was stolen in this manner Pea confided to me from steamers first because steamers carry a larger number of small packages than other ships next because of the extreme rapidity with which they are obliged to be unladen for their return voyages
The Lumpers dispose of their booty easily to marine store dealers and the only remedy to be suggested is that marine store shops should be licensed and thus brought under the eye of the police as rigidly as publichouses
Lumpers also smuggle goods ashore for the crews of vessels
The smuggling of tobacco is so considerable that it is well worth the while of the sellers of smuggled tobacco to use hydraulic presses to squeeze a single pound into a package small enough to be contained in an ordinary pocket
Next said my friend Pea there were the Truckers  less thieves than smugglers whose business it was to land more considerable parcels of goods than the Lumpers could manage
They sometimes sold articles of grocery and so forth to the crews in order to cloak their real calling and get aboard without suspicion
Many of them had boats of their own and made money
Besides these there were the Dredgermen who under pretence of dredging up coals and such like from the bottom of the river hung about barges and other undecked craft and when they saw an opportunity threw any property they could lay their hands on overboard in order slyly to dredge it up when the vessel was gone
Sometimes they dexterously used their dredges to whip away anything that might lie within reach
Some of them were mighty neat at this and the accomplishment was called dry dredging
Then there was a vast deal of property such as copper nails sheathing hardwood c habitually brought away by shipwrights and other workmen from their employers yards and disposed of to marine store dealers many of whom escaped detection through hard swearing and their extraordinary artful ways of accounting for the possession of stolen property
Likewise there were specialpleading practitioners for whom barges drifted away of their own selves  they having no hand in it except first cutting them loose and afterwards plundering them  innocents meaning no harm who had the misfortune to observe those foundlings wandering about the Thames
We were now going in and out with little noise and great nicety among the tiers of shipping whose many hulls lying close together rose out of the water like black streets
Here and there a Scotch an Irish or a foreign steamer getting up her steam as the tide made looked with her great chimney and high sides like a quiet factory among the common buildings
Now the streets opened into clearer spaces now contracted into alleys but the tiers were so like houses in the dark that I could almost have believed myself in the narrower byeways of Venice
Everything was wonderfully still for it wanted full three hours of flood and nothing seemed awake but a dog here and there
So we took no Tierrangers captive nor any Lumpers nor Truckers nor Dredgermen nor other evildisposed person or persons but went ashore at Wapping where the old Thames Police office is now a stationhouse and where the old Court with its cabin windows looking on the river is a quaint charge room with nothing worse in it usually than a stuffed cat in a glass case and a portrait pleasant to behold of a rare old Thames Police officer Mr
Superintendent Evans now succeeded by his son
We looked over the charge books admirably kept and found the prevention so good that there were not five hundred entries including drunken and disorderly in a whole year
Then we looked into the storeroom where there was an oakum smell and a nautical seasoning of dreadnought clothing rope yarn boathooks sculls and oars spare stretchers rudders pistols cutlasses and the like
Then into the cell aired high up in the wooden wall through an opening like a kitchen platerack wherein there was a drunken man not at all warm and very wishful to know if it were morning yet
Then into a better sort of watch and ward room where there was a squadron of stone bottles drawn up ready to be filled with hot water and applied to any unfortunate creature who might be brought in apparently drowned
Finally we shook hands with our worthy friend Pea and ran all the way to Tower Hill under strong Police suspicion occasionally before we got warm
A WALK IN A WORKHOUSE ON a certain Sunday I formed one of the congregation assembled in the chapel of a large metropolitan Workhouse
With the exception of the clergyman and clerk and a very few officials there were none but paupers present
The children sat in the galleries the women in the body of the chapel and in one of the side aisles the men in the remaining aisle
The service was decorously performed though the sermon might have been much better adapted to the comprehension and to the circumstances of the hearers
The usual supplications were offered with more than the usual significancy in such a place for the fatherless children and widows for all sick persons and young children for all that were desolate and oppressed for the comforting and helping of the weakhearted for the raisingup of them that had fallen for all that were in danger necessity and tribulation
The prayers of the congregation were desired for several persons in the various wards dangerously ill and others who were recovering returned their thanks to Heaven
Among this congregation were some evillooking young women and beetlebrowed young men but not many  perhaps that kind of characters kept away
Generally the faces those of the children excepted were depressed and subdued and wanted colour
Aged people were there in every variety
Mumbling bleareyed spectacled stupid deaf lame vacantly winking in the gleams of sun that now and then crept in through the open doors from the paved yard shading their listening ears or blinking eyes with their withered hands poring over their books leering at nothing going to sleep crouching and drooping in corners
There were weird old women all skeleton within all bonnet and cloak without continually wiping their eyes with dirty dusters of pocket handkerchiefs and there were ugly old crones both male and female with a ghastly kind of contentment upon them which was not at all comforting to see
Upon the whole it was the dragon Pauperism in a very weak and impotent condition toothless fangless drawing his breath heavily enough and hardly worth chaining up
When the service was over I walked with the humane and conscientious gentleman whose duty it was to take that walk that Sunday morning through the little world of poverty enclosed within the workhouse walls
It was inhabited by a population of some fifteen hundred or two thousand paupers ranging from the infant newly born or not yet come into the pauper world to the old man dying on his bed
In a room opening from a squalid yard where a number of listless women were lounging to and fro trying to get warm in the ineffectual sunshine of the tardy May morning  in the Itch Ward not to compromise the truth  a woman such as HOGARTH has often drawn was hurriedly getting on her gown before a dusty fire
She was the nurse or wardswoman of that insalubrious department  herself a pauper  flabby rawboned untidy  unpromising and coarse of aspect as need be
But on being spoken to about the patients whom she had in charge she turned round with her shabby gown half on half off and fell a crying with all her might
Not for show not querulously not in any mawkish sentiment but in the deep grief and affliction of her heart turning away her dishevelled head sobbing most bitterly wringing her hands and letting fall abundance of great tears that choked her utterance
What was the matter with the nurse of the itchward
Oh the dropped child was dead
Oh the child that was found in the street and she had brought up ever since had died an hour ago and see where the little creature lay beneath this cloth
The dear the pretty dear
The dropped child seemed too small and poor a thing for Death to be in earnest with but Death had taken it and already its diminutive form was neatly washed composed and stretched as if in sleep upon a box
I thought I heard a voice from Heaven saying It shall be well for thee O nurse of the itchward when some less gentle pauper does those offices to thy cold form that such as the dropped child are the angels who behold my Fathers face
In another room were several ugly old women crouching witchlike round a hearth and chattering and nodding after the manner of the monkeys
All well here
And enough to eat
A general chattering and chuckling at last an answer from a volunteer
Oh yes gentleman
Bless you gentleman
Lord bless the Parish of St SoandSo
It feed the hungry sir and give drink to the thusty and it warm them which is cold so it do and good luck to the parish of St SoandSo and thankee gentleman
Elsewhere a party of pauper nurses were at dinner
How do YOU get on
Oh pretty well sir
We works hard and we lives hard  like the sodgers
In another room a kind of purgatory or place of transition six or eight noisy madwomen were gathered together under the superintendence of one sane attendant
Among them was a girl of two or three and twenty very prettily dressed of most respectable appearance and good manners who had been brought in from the house where she had lived as domestic servant having I suppose no friends on account of being subject to epileptic fits and requiring to be removed under the influence of a very bad one
She was by no means of the same stuff or the same breeding or the same experience or in the same state of mind as those by whom she was surrounded and she pathetically complained that the daily association and the nightly noise made her worse and was driving her mad  which was perfectly evident
The case was noted for inquiry and redress but she said she had already been there for some weeks
If this girl had stolen her mistresss watch I do not hesitate to say she would have been infinitely better off
We have come to this absurd this dangerous this monstrous pass that the dishonest felon is in respect of cleanliness order diet and accommodation better provided for and taken care of than the honest pauper
And this conveys no special imputation on the workhouse of the parish of St SoandSo where on the contrary I saw many things to commend
It was very agreeable recollecting that most infamous and atrocious enormity committed at Tooting  an enormity which a hundred years hence will still be vividly remembered in the bye ways of English life and which has done more to engender a gloomy discontent and suspicion among many thousands of the people than all the Chartist leaders could have done in all their lives  to find the pauper children in this workhouse looking robust and well and apparently the objects of very great care
In the Infant School  a large light airy room at the top of the building  the little creatures being at dinner and eating their potatoes heartily were not cowed by the presence of strange visitors but stretched out their small hands to be shaken with a very pleasant confidence
And it was comfortable to see two mangy pauper rockinghorses rampant in a corner
In the girls school where the dinner was also in progress everything bore a cheerful and healthy aspect
The meal was over in the boys school by the time of our arrival there and the room was not yet quite rearranged but the boys were roaming unrestrained about a large and airy yard as any other schoolboys might have done
Some of them had been drawing large ships upon the schoolroom wall and if they had a mast with shrouds and stays set up for practice as they have in the Middlesex House of Correction it would be so much the better
At present if a boy should feel a strong impulse upon him to learn the art of going aloft he could only gratify it I presume as the men and women paupers gratify their aspirations after better board and lodging by smashing as many workhouse windows as possible and being promoted to prison
In one place the Newgate of the Workhouse a company of boys and youths were locked up in a yard alone their dayroom being a kind of kennel where the casual poor used formerly to be littered down at night
Divers of them had been there some long time
Are they never going away
was the natural inquiry
Most of them are crippled in some form or other said the Wardsman and not fit for anything
They slunk about like dispirited wolves or hyaenas and made a pounce at their food when it was served out much as those animals do
The bigheaded idiot shuffling his feet along the pavement in the sunlight outside was a more agreeable object everyway
Groves of babies in arms groves of mothers and other sick women in bed groves of lunatics jungles of men in stonepaved downstairs dayrooms waiting for their dinners longer and longer groves of old people in upstairs Infirmary wards wearing out life God knows how  this was the scenery through which the walk lay for two hours
In some of these latter chambers there were pictures stuck against the wall and a neat display of crockery and pewter on a kind of sideboard now and then it was a treat to see a plant or two in almost every ward there was a cat
In all of these Long Walks of aged and infirm some old people were bedridden and had been for a long time some were sitting on their beds halfnaked some dying in their beds some out of bed and sitting at a table near the fire
A sullen or lethargic indifference to what was asked a blunted sensibility to everything but warmth and food a moody absence of complaint as being of no use a dogged silence and resentful desire to be left alone again I thought were generally apparent
On our walking into the midst of one of these dreary perspectives of old men nearly the following little dialogue took place the nurse not being immediately at hand All well here
No answer
An old man in a Scotch cap sitting among others on a form at the table eating out of a tin porringer pushes back his cap a little to look at us claps it down on his forehead again with the palm of his hand and goes on eating
All well here
repeated
No answer
Another old man sitting on his bed paralytically peeling a boiled potato lifts his head and stares
Enough to eat
No answer
Another old man in bed turns himself and coughs
How are YOU today
To the last old man
That old man says nothing but another old man a tall old man of very good address speaking with perfect correctness comes forward from somewhere and volunteers an answer
The reply almost always proceeds from a volunteer and not from the person looked at or spoken to
We are very old sir in a mild distinct voice
We cant expect to be well most of us
Are you comfortable
I have no complaint to make sir
With a half shake of his head a half shrug of his shoulders and a kind of apologetic smile
Enough to eat
Why sir I have but a poor appetite with the same air as before and yet I get through my allowance very easily
But showing a porringer with a Sunday dinner in it here is a portion of mutton and three potatoes
You cant starve on that
Oh dear no sir with the same apologetic air
Not starve
What do you want
We have very little bread sir
Its an exceedingly small quantity of bread
The nurse who is now rubbing her hands at the questioners elbow interferes with It aint much raly sir
You see theyve only six ounces a day and when theyve took their breakfast there CAN only be a little left for night sir
Another old man hitherto invisible rises out of his bedclothes as out of a grave and looks on
You have tea at night
The questioner is still addressing the wellspoken old man
Yes sir we have tea at night
And you save what bread you can from the morning to eat with it
Yes sir  if we can save any
And you want more to eat with it
Yes sir
With a very anxious face
The questioner in the kindness of his heart appears a little discomposed and changes the subject
What has become of the old man who used to lie in that bed in the corner
The nurse dont remember what old man is referred to
There has been such a many old men
The wellspoken old man is doubtful
The spectral old man who has come to life in bed says Billy Stevens
Another old man who has previously had his head in the fireplace pipes out Charley Walters
Something like a feeble interest is awakened
I suppose Charley Walters had conversation in him
Hes dead says the piping old man
Another old man with one eye screwed up hastily displaces the piping old man and says
Yes
Charley Walters died in that bed and  and   Billy Stevens persists the spectral old man
No no
and Johnny Rogers died in that bed and  and  theyre both on em dead  and Saml Bowyer this seems very extraordinary to him he went out
With this he subsides and all the old men having had quite enough of it subside and the spectral old man goes into his grave again and takes the shade of Billy Stevens with him
As we turn to go out at the door another previously invisible old man a hoarse old man in a flannel gown is standing there as if he had just come up through the floor
I beg your pardon sir could I take the liberty of saying a word
Yes what is it
I am greatly better in my health sir but what I want to get me quite round with his hand on his throat is a little fresh air sir
It has always done my complaint so much good sir
The regular leave for going out comes round so seldom that if the gentlemen next Friday would give me leave to go out walking now and then  for only an hour or so sir
  Who could wonder looking through those weary vistas of bed and infirmity that it should do him good to meet with some other scenes and assure himself that there was something else on earth
Who could help wondering why the old men lived on as they did what grasp they had on life what crumbs of interest or occupation they could pick up from its bare board whether Charley Walters had ever described to them the days when he kept company with some old pauper woman in the bud or Billy Stevens ever told them of the time when he was a dweller in the faroff foreign land called Home
The morsel of burnt child lying in another room so patiently in bed wrapped in lint and looking steadfastly at us with his bright quiet eyes when we spoke to him kindly looked as if the knowledge of these things and of all the tender things there are to think about might have been in his mind  as if he thought with us that there was a fellowfeeling in the pauper nurses which appeared to make them more kind to their charges than the race of common nurses in the hospitals  as if he mused upon the Future of some older children lying around him in the same place and thought it best perhaps all things considered that he should die  as if he knew without fear of those many coffins made and unmade piled up in the store below  and of his unknown friend the dropped child calm upon the boxlid covered with a cloth
But there was something wistful and appealing too in his tiny face as if in the midst of all the hard necessities and incongruities he pondered on he pleaded in behalf of the helpless and the aged poor for a little more liberty  and a little more bread
PRINCE BULL
A FAIRY TALE ONCE upon a time and of course it was in the Golden Age and I hope you may know when that was for I am sure I dont though I have tried hard to find out there lived in a rich and fertile country a powerful Prince whose name was BULL
He had gone through a great deal of fighting in his time about all sorts of things including nothing but had gradually settled down to be a steady peaceable goodnatured corpulent rather sleepy Prince
This Puissant Prince was married to a lovely Princess whose name was Fair Freedom
She had brought him a large fortune and had borne him an immense number of children and had set them to spinning and farming and engineering and soldiering and sailoring and doctoring and lawyering and preaching and all kinds of trades
The coffers of Prince Bull were full of treasure his cellars were crammed with delicious wines from all parts of the world the richest gold and silver plate that ever was seen adorned his sideboards his sons were strong his daughters were handsome and in short you might have supposed that if there ever lived upon earth a fortunate and happy Prince the name of that Prince take him for all in all was assuredly Prince Bull
But appearances as we all know are not always to be trusted  far from it and if they had led you to this conclusion respecting Prince Bull they would have led you wrong as they often have led me
For this good Prince had two sharp thorns in his pillow two hard knobs in his crown two heavy loads on his mind two unbridled nightmares in his sleep two rocks ahead in his course
He could not by any means get servants to suit him and he had a tyrannical old godmother whose name was Tape
She was a Fairy this Tape and was a bright red all over
She was disgustingly prim and formal and could never bend herself a hairs breadth this way or that way out of her naturally crooked shape
But she was very potent in her wicked art
She could stop the fastest thing in the world change the strongest thing into the weakest and the most useful into the most useless
To do this she had only to put her cold hand upon it and repeat her own name Tape
Then it withered away
At the Court of Prince Bull  at least I dont mean literally at his court because he was a very genteel Prince and readily yielded to his godmother when she always reserved that for his hereditary Lords and Ladies  in the dominions of Prince Bull among the great mass of the community who were called in the language of that polite country the Mobs and the Snobs were a number of very ingenious men who were always busy with some invention or other for promoting the prosperity of the Princes subjects and augmenting the Princes power
But whenever they submitted their models for the Princes approval his godmother stepped forward laid her hand upon them and said Tape
Hence it came to pass that when any particularly good discovery was made the discoverer usually carried it off to some other Prince in foreign parts who had no old godmother who said Tape
This was not on the whole an advantageous state of things for Prince Bull to the best of my understanding
The worst of it was that Prince Bull had in course of years lapsed into such a state of subjection to this unlucky godmother that he never made any serious effort to rid himself of her tyranny
I have said this was the worst of it but there I was wrong because there is a worse consequence still behind
The Princes numerous family became so downright sick and tired of Tape that when they should have helped the Prince out of the difficulties into which that evil creature led him they fell into a dangerous habit of moodily keeping away from him in an impassive and indifferent manner as though they had quite forgotten that no harm could happen to the Prince their father without its inevitably affecting themselves
Such was the aspect of affairs at the court of Prince Bull when this great Prince found it necessary to go to war with Prince Bear
He had been for some time very doubtful of his servants who besides being indolent and addicted to enriching their families at his expense domineered over him dreadfully threatening to discharge themselves if they were found the least fault with pretending that they had done a wonderful amount of work when they had done nothing making the most unmeaning speeches that ever were heard in the Princes name and uniformly showing themselves to be very inefficient indeed
Though that some of them had excellent characters from previous situations is not to be denied
Well Prince Bull called his servants together and said to them one and all Send out my army against Prince Bear
Clothe it arm it feed it provide it with all necessaries and contingencies and I will pay the piper
Do your duty by my brave troops said the Prince and do it well and I will pour my treasure out like water to defray the cost
Who ever heard ME complain of money well laid out
Which indeed he had reason for saying inasmuch as he was well known to be a truly generous and munificent Prince
When the servants heard those words they sent out the army against Prince Bear and they set the army tailors to work and the army provision merchants and the makers of guns both great and small and the gunpowder makers and the makers of ball shell and shot and they bought up all manner of stores and ships without troubling their heads about the price and appeared to be so busy that the good Prince rubbed his hands and using a favourite expression of his said Its all right I But while they were thus employed the Princes godmother who was a great favourite with those servants looked in upon them continually all day long and whenever she popped in her head at the door said How do you do my children
What are you doing here
Official business godmother
Oho
says this wicked Fairy
 Tape
And then the business all went wrong whatever it was and the servants heads became so addled and muddled that they thought they were doing wonders
Now this was very bad conduct on the part of the vicious old nuisance and she ought to have been strangled even if she had stopped here but she didnt stop here as you shall learn
For a number of the Princes subjects being very fond of the Princes army who were the bravest of men assembled together and provided all manner of eatables and drinkables and books to read and clothes to wear and tobacco to smoke and candies to burn and nailed them up in great packingcases and put them aboard a great many ships to be carried out to that brave army in the cold and inclement country where they were fighting Prince Bear
Then up comes this wicked Fairy as the ships were weighing anchor and says How do you do my children
What are you doing here
 We are going with all these comforts to the army godmother
 Oho
says she
A pleasant voyage my darlings
 Tape
And from that time forth those enchanting ships went sailing against wind and tide and rhyme and reason round and round the world and whenever they touched at any port were ordered off immediately and could never deliver their cargoes anywhere
This again was very bad conduct on the part of the vicious old nuisance and she ought to have been strangled for it if she had done nothing worse but she did something worse still as you shall learn
For she got astride of an official broomstick and muttered as a spell these two sentences On Her Majestys service and I have the honour to be sir your most obedient servant and presently alighted in the cold and inclement country where the army of Prince Bull were encamped to fight the army of Prince Bear
On the seashore of that country she found piled together a number of houses for the army to live in and a quantity of provisions for the army to live upon and a quantity of clothes for the army to wear while sitting in the mud gazing at them were a group of officers as red to look at as the wicked old woman herself
So she said to one of them Who are you my darling and how do you do
 I am the Quartermaster Generals Department godmother and I am pretty well
Then she said to another Who are YOU my darling and how do YOU do
 I am the Commissariat Department godmother and I am pretty well
Then she said to another Who are YOU my darling and how do YOU do
 I am the Head of the Medical Department godmother and I am pretty well
Then she said to some gentlemen scented with lavender who kept themselves at a great distance from the rest And who are YOU my pretty pets and how do YOU do
And they answered We awaretheawStaffawDepartment godmother and we are very well indeed
 I am delighted to see you all my beauties says this wicked old Fairy   Tape
Upon that the houses clothes and provisions all mouldered away and the soldiers who were sound fell sick and the soldiers who were sick died miserably and the noble army of Prince Bull perished
When the dismal news of his great loss was carried to the Prince he suspected his godmother very much indeed but he knew that his servants must have kept company with the malicious beldame and must have given way to her and therefore he resolved to turn those servants out of their places
So he called to him a Roebuck who had the gift of speech and he said Good Roebuck tell them they must go
So the good Roebuck delivered his message so like a man that you might have supposed him to be nothing but a man and they were turned out  but not without warning for that they had had a long time
And now comes the most extraordinary part of the history of this Prince
When he had turned out those servants of course he wanted others
What was his astonishment to find that in all his dominions which contained no less than twentyseven millions of people there were not above fiveandtwenty servants altogether
They were so lofty about it too that instead of discussing whether they should hire themselves as servants to Prince Bull they turned things topsyturvy and considered whether as a favour they should hire Prince Bull to be their master
While they were arguing this point among themselves quite at their leisure the wicked old red Fairy was incessantly going up and down knocking at the doors of twelve of the oldest of the fiveandtwenty who were the oldest inhabitants in all that country and whose united ages amounted to one thousand saying Will YOU hire Prince Bull for your master
 Will YOU hire Prince Bull for your master
To which one answered I will if next door will and another I wont if over the way does and another I cant if he she or they might could would or should
And all this time Prince Bulls affairs were going to rack and ruin
At last Prince Bull in the height of his perplexity assumed a thoughtful face as if he were struck by an entirely new idea
The wicked old Fairy seeing this was at his elbow directly and said How do you do my Prince and what are you thinking of
 I am thinking godmother says he that among all the sevenandtwenty millions of my subjects who have never been in service there are men of intellect and business who have made me very famous both among my friends and enemies
 Aye truly
says the Fairy
 Aye truly says the Prince
 And what then
says the Fairy
 Why then says he since the regular old class of servants do so ill are so hard to get and carry it with so high a hand perhaps I might try to make good servants of some of these
The words had no sooner passed his lips than she returned chuckling You think so do you
Indeed my Prince
 Tape
Thereupon he directly forgot what he was thinking of and cried out lamentably to the old servants O do come and hire your poor old master
Pray do
On any terms
And this for the present finishes the story of Prince Bull
I wish I could wind it up by saying that he lived happy ever afterwards but I cannot in my conscience do so for with Tape at his elbow and his estranged children fatally repelled by her from coming near him I do not to tell you the plain truth believe in the possibility of such an end to it
A PLATED ARTICLE PUTTING up for the night in one of the chiefest towns of Staffordshire I find it to be by no means a lively town
In fact it is as dull and dead a town as any one could desire not to see
It seems as if its whole population might be imprisoned in its Railway Station
The Refreshment Room at that Station is a vortex of dissipation compared with the extinct towninn the Dodo in the dull High Street
Why High Street
Why not rather Low Street Flat Street Low Spirited Street Usedup Street
Where are the people who belong to the High Street
Can they all be dispersed over the face of the country seeking the unfortunate Strolling Manager who decamped from the mouldy little Theatre last week in the beginning of his season as his playbills testify repentantly resolved to bring him back and feed him and be entertained
Or can they all be gathered to their fathers in the two old churchyards near to the High Street  retirement into which churchyards appears to be a mere ceremony there is so very little life outside their confines and such small discernible difference between being buried alive in the town and buried dead in the town tombs
Over the way opposite to the staring blank bow windows of the Dodo are a little ironmongers shop a little tailors shop with a picture of the Fashions in the small window and a bandylegged baby on the pavement staring at it  a watchmakers shop where all the clocks and watches must be stopped I am sure for they could never have the courage to go with the town in general and the Dodo in particular looking at them
Shade of Miss Linwood erst of Leicester Square London thou art welcome here and thy retreat is fitly chosen
I myself was one of the last visitors to that awful storehouse of thy lifes work where an anchorite old man and woman took my shilling with a solemn wonder and conducting me to a gloomy sepulchre of needlework dropping to pieces with dust and age and shrouded in twilight at high noon left me there chilled frightened and alone
And now in ghostly letters on all the dead walls of this dead town I read thy honoured name and find that thy Last Supper worked in Berlin Wool invites inspection as a powerful excitement
Where are the people who are bidden with so much cry to this feast of little wool
Where are they
Who are they
They are not the bandylegged baby studying the fashions in the tailors window
They are not the two earthy ploughmen lounging outside the saddlers shop in the stiff square where the Town Hall stands like a brick and mortar private on parade
They are not the landlady of the Dodo in the empty bar whose eye had trouble in it and no welcome when I asked for dinner
They are not the turnkeys of the Town Jail looking out of the gateway in their uniforms as if they had locked up all the balance as my American friends would say of the inhabitants and could now rest a little
They are not the two dusty millers in the white mill down by the river where the great waterwheel goes heavily round and round like the monotonous days and nights in this forgotten place
Then who are they for there is no one else
No this deponent maketh oath and saith that there is no one else save and except the waiter at the Dodo now laying the cloth
I have paced the streets and stared at the houses and am come back to the blank bow window of the Dodo and the town clocks strike seven and the reluctant echoes seem to cry Dont wake us
and the bandylegged baby has gone home to bed
If the Dodo were only a gregarious bird  if he had only some confused idea of making a comfortable nest  I could hope to get through the hours between this and bedtime without being consumed by devouring melancholy
But the Dodos habits are all wrong
It provides me with a trackless desert of sittingroom with a chair for every day in the year a table for every month and a waste of sideboard where a lonely China vase pines in a corner for its mate long departed and will never make a match with the candlestick in the opposite corner if it live till Doomsday
The Dodo has nothing in the larder
Even now I behold the Boots returning with my sole in a piece of paper and with that portion of my dinner the Boots perceiving me at the blank bow window slaps his leg as he comes across the road pretending it is something else
The Dodo excludes the outer air
When I mount up to my bedroom a smell of closeness and flue gets lazily up my nose like sleepy snuff
The loose little bits of carpet writhe under my tread and take wormy shapes
I dont know the ridiculous man in the lookingglass beyond having met him once or twice in a dishcover  and I can never shave HIM tomorrow morning
The Dodo is narrowminded as to towels expects me to wash on a freemasons apron without the trimming when I asked for soap gives me a stonyhearted something white with no more lather in it than the Elgin marbles
The Dodo has seen better days and possesses interminable stables at the back  silent grassgrown brokenwindowed horseless
This mournful bird can fry a sole however which is much
Can cook a steak too which is more
I wonder where it gets its Sherry
If I were to send my pint of wine to some famous chemist to be analysed what would it turn out to be made of
It tastes of pepper sugar bitteralmonds vinegar warm knives any flat drinks and a little brandy
Would it unman a Spanish exile by reminding him of his native land at all
I think not
If there really be any townspeople out of the churchyards and if a caravan of them ever do dine with a bottle of wine per man in this desert of the Dodo it must make good for the doctor next day
Where was the waiter born
How did he come here
Has he any hope of getting away from here
Does he ever receive a letter or take a ride upon the railway or see anything but the Dodo
Perhaps he has seen the Berlin Wool
He appears to have a silent sorrow on him and it may be that
He clears the table draws the dingy curtains of the great bow window which so unwillingly consent to meet that they must be pinned together leaves me by the fire with my pint decanter and a little thin funnelshaped wineglass and a plate of pale biscuits  in themselves engendering desperation
No book no newspaper
I left the Arabian Nights in the railway carriage and have nothing to read but Bradshaw and that way madness lies
Remembering what prisoners and shipwrecked mariners have done to exercise their minds in solitude I repeat the multiplication table the pence table and the shilling table which are all the tables I happen to know
What if I write something
The Dodo keeps no pens but steel pens and those I always stick through the paper and can turn to no other account
What am I to do
Even if I could have the bandylegged baby knocked up and brought here I could offer him nothing but sherry and that would be the death of him
He would never hold up his head again if he touched it
I cant go to bed because I have conceived a mortal hatred for my bedroom and I cant go away because there is no train for my place of destination until morning
To burn the biscuits will be but a fleeting joy still it is a temporary relief and here they go on the fire
Shall I break the plate
First let me look at the back and see who made it
COPELAND
Copeland
Stop a moment
Was it yesterday I visited Copelands works and saw them making plates
In the confusion of travelling about it might be yesterday or it might be yesterday month but I think it was yesterday
I appeal to the plate
The plate says decidedly yesterday
I find the plate as I look at it growing into a companion
Dont you remember says the plate how you steamed away yesterday morning in the bright sun and the east wind along the valley of the sparkling Trent
Dont you recollect how many kilns you flew past looking like the bowls of gigantic tobaccopipes cut short off from the stem and turned upside down
And the fires  and the smoke  and the roads made with bits of crockery as if all the plates and dishes in the civilised world had been Macadamised expressly for the laming of all the horses
Of course I do
And dont you remember says the plate how you alighted at Stoke  a picturesque heap of houses kilns smoke wharfs canals and river lying as was most appropriate in a basin  and how after climbing up the sides of the basin to look at the prospect you trundled down again at a walkingmatch pace and straight proceeded to my fathers Copelands where the whole of my family high and low rich and poor are turned out upon the world from our nursery and seminary covering some fourteen acres of ground
And dont you remember what we spring from heaps of lumps of clay partially prepared and cleaned in Devonshire and Dorsetshire whence said clay principally comes  and hills of flint without which we should want our ringing sound and should never be musical
And as to the flint dont you recollect that it is first burnt in kilns and is then laid under the four iron feet of a demon slave subject to violent stamping fits who when they come on stamps away insanely with his four iron legs and would crush all the flint in the Isle of Thanet to powder without leaving off
And as to the clay dont you recollect how it is put into mills or teazers and is sliced and dug and cut at by endless knives clogged and sticky but persistent  and is pressed out of that machine through a square trough whose form it takes  and is cut off in square lumps and thrown into a vat and there mixed with water and beaten to a pulp by paddlewheels  and is then run into a rough house all rugged beams and ladders splashed with white  superintended by Grindoff the Miller in his working clothes all splashed with white  where it passes through no end of machinery moved sieves all splashed with white arranged in an ascending scale of fineness some so fine that three hundred silk threads cross each other in a single square inch of their surface and all in a violent state of ague with their teeth for ever chattering and their bodies for ever shivering
And as to the flint again isnt it mashed and mollified and troubled and soothed exactly as rags are in a papermill until it is reduced to a pap so fine that it contains no atom of grit perceptible to the nicest taste
And as to the flint and the clay together are they not after all this mixed in the proportion of five of clay to one of flint and isnt the compound  known as slip  run into oblong troughs where its superfluous moisture may evaporate and finally isnt it slapped and banged and beaten and patted and kneaded and wedged and knocked about like butter until it becomes a beautiful grey dough ready for the potters use
In regard of the potter popularly so called says the plate you dont mean to say you have forgotten that a workman called a Thrower is the man under whose hand this grey dough takes the shapes of the simpler household vessels as quickly as the eye can follow
You dont mean to say you cannot call him up before you sitting with his attendant woman at his potters wheel  a disc about the size of a dinnerplate revolving on two drums slowly or quickly as he wills  who made you a complete breakfastset for a bachelor as a goodhumoured little offhand joke
You remember how he took up as much dough as he wanted and throwing it on his wheel in a moment fashioned it into a teacup  caught up more clay and made a saucer  a larger dab and whirled it into a teapot  winked at a smaller dab and converted it into the lid of the teapot accurately fitting by the measurement of his eye alone  coaxed a middlesized dab for two seconds broke it turned it over at the rim and made a milkpot  laughed and turned out a slop basin  coughed and provided for the sugar
Neither I think are you oblivious of the newer mode of making various articles but especially basins according to which improvement a mould revolves instead of a disc
For you MUST remember says the plate how you saw the mould of a little basin spinning round and round and how the workmen smoothed and pressed a handful of dough upon it and how with an instrument called a profile a piece of wood representing the profile of a basins foot he cleverly scraped and carved the ring which makes the base of any such basin and then took the basin off the lathe like a doughy skullcap to be dried and afterwards in what is called a green state to be put into a second lathe there to be finished and burnished with a steel burnisher
And as to moulding in general says the plate it cant be necessary for me to remind you that all ornamental articles and indeed all articles not quite circular are made in moulds
For you must remember how you saw the vegetable dishes for example being made in moulds and how the handles of teacups and the spouts of teapots and the feet of tureens and so forth are all made in little separate moulds and are each stuck on to the body corporate of which it is destined to form a part with a stuff called slag as quickly as you can recollect it
Further you learnt  you know you did  in the same visit how the beautiful sculptures in the delicate new material called Parian are all constructed in moulds how into that material animal bones are ground up because the phosphate of lime contained in bones makes it translucent how everything is moulded before going into the fire onefourth larger than it is intended to come out of the fire because it shrinks in that proportion in the intense heat how when a figure shrinks unequally it is spoiled  emerging from the furnace a misshapen birth a big head and a little body or a little head and a big body or a Quasimodo with long arms and short legs or a Miss Biffin with neither legs nor arms worth mentioning
And as to the Kilns in which the firing takes place and in which some of the more precious articles are burnt repeatedly in various stages of their process towards completion  as to the Kilns says the plate warming with the recollection if you dont remember THEM with a horrible interest what did you ever go to Copelands for
When you stood inside of one of those inverted bowls of a PreAdamite tobaccopipe looking up at the blue sky through the open top far off as you might have looked up from a well sunk under the centre of the pavement of the Pantheon at Rome had you the least idea where you were
And when you found yourself surrounded in that domeshaped cavern by innumerable columns of an unearthly order of architecture supporting nothing and squeezed close together as if a PreAdamite Samson had taken a vast Hall in his arms and crushed it into the smallest possible space had you the least idea what they were
No says the plate of course not
And when you found that each of those pillars was a pile of ingeniously made vessels of coarse clay  called Saggers  looking when separate like raisedpies for the table of the mighty Giant Blunderbore and now all full of various articles of pottery ranged in them in baking order the bottom of each vessel serving for the cover of the one below and the whole Kiln rapidly filling with these tier upon tier until the last workman should have barely room to crawl out before the closing of the jagged aperture in the wall and the kindling of the gradual fire did you not stand amazed to think that all the year round these dread chambers are heating white hot  and cooling  and filling  and emptying  and being bricked up  and broken open  humanly speaking for ever and ever
To be sure you did
And standing in one of those Kilns nearly full and seeing a free crow shoot across the aperture atop and learning how the fire would wax hotter and hotter by slow degrees and would cool similarly through a space of from forty to sixty hours did no remembrance of the days when human clay was burnt oppress you
Yes
I think so
I suspect that some fancy of a fiery haze and a shortening breath and a growing heat and a gasping prayer and a figure in black interposing between you and the sky as figures in black are very apt to do and looking down before it grew too hot to look and live upon the Heretic in his edifying agony  I say I suspect says the plate that some such fancy was pretty strong upon you when you went out into the air and blessed God for the bright spring day and the degenerate times
After that I neednt remind you what a relief it was to see the simplest process of ornamenting this biscuit as it is called when baked with brown circles and blue trees  converting it into the common crockeryware that is exported to Africa and used in cottages at home
For says the plate I am well persuaded that you bear in mind how those particular jugs and mugs were once more set upon a lathe and put in motion and how a man blew the brown colour having a strong natural affinity with the material in that condition on them from a blowpipe as they twirled and how his daughter with a common brush dropped blotches of blue upon them in the right places and how tilting the blotches upside down she made them run into rude images of trees and there an end
And didnt you see says the plate planted upon my own brother that astounding blue willow with knobbed and gnarled trunk and foliage of blue ostrich feathers which gives our family the title of willow pattern
And didnt you observe transferred upon him at the same time that blue bridge which spans nothing growing out from the roots of the willow and the three blue Chinese going over it into a blue temple which has a fine crop of blue bushes sprouting out of the roof and a blue boat sailing above them the mast of which is burglariously sticking itself into the foundations of a blue villa suspended skyhigh surmounted by a lump of blue rock skyhigher and a couple of billing blue birds skyhighest  together with the rest of that amusing blue landscape which has in deference to our revered ancestors of the Cerulean Empire and in defiance of every known law of perspective adorned millions of our family ever since the days of platters
Didnt you inspect the copperplate on which my pattern was deeply engraved
Didnt you perceive an impression of it taken in cobalt colour at a cylindrical press upon a leaf of thin paper streaming from a plungebath of soap and water
Wasnt the paper impression daintily spread by a lightfingered damsel you KNOW you admired her
 over the surface of the plate and the back of the paper rubbed prodigiously hard  with a long tight roll of flannel tied up like a round of hung beef  without so much as ruffling the paper wet as it was
Then says the plate was not the paper washed away with a sponge and didnt there appear set off upon the plate THIS identical piece of PreRaphaelite blue distemper which you now behold
Not to be denied
I had seen all this  and more
I had been shown at Copelands patterns of beautiful design in faultless perspective which are causing the ugly old willow to wither out of public favour and which being quite as cheap insinuate good wholesome natural art into the humblest households
When Mr and Mrs Sprat have satisfied their material tastes by that equal division of fat and lean which has made their MENAGE immortal and have after the elegant tradition licked the platter clean they can  thanks to modern artists in clay  feast their intellectual tastes upon excellent delineations of natural objects
This reflection prompts me to transfer my attention from the blue plate to the forlorn but cheerfully painted vase on the sideboard
And surely says the plate you have not forgotten how the outlines of such groups of flowers as you see there are printed just as I was printed and are afterwards shaded and filled in with metallic colours by women and girls
As to the aristocracy of our order made of the finer clayporcelain peers and peeresses  the slabs and panels and tabletops and tazze the endless nobility and gentry of dessert breakfast and tea services the gemmed perfume bottles and scarlet and gold salvers you saw that they were painted by artists with metallic colours laid on with camelhair pencils and afterwards burnt in
And talking of burning in says the plate didnt you find that every subject from the willow pattern to the landscape after Turner  having been framed upon clay or porcelain biscuit  has to be glazed
Of course you saw the glaze  composed of various vitreous materials  laid over every article and of course you witnessed the close imprisonment of each piece in saggers upon the separate system rigidly enforced by means of finepointed earthenware stilts placed between the articles to prevent the slightest communication or contact
We had in my time  and I suppose it is the same now  fourteen hours firing to fix the glaze and to make it run all over us equally so as to put a good shiny and unscratchable surface upon us
Doubtless you observed that one sort of glaze  called printingbody  is burnt into the better sort of ware BEFORE it is printed
Upon this you saw some of the finest steel engravings transferred to be fixed by an after glazing  didnt you
Why of course you did
Of course I did
I had seen and enjoyed everything that the plate recalled to me and had beheld with admiration how the rotatory motion which keeps this ball of ours in its place in the great scheme with all its busy mites upon it was necessary throughout the process and could only be dispensed with in the fire
So listening to the plates reminders and musing upon them I got through the evening after all and went to bed
I made but one sleep of it  for which I have no doubt I am also indebted to the plate  and left the lonely Dodo in the morning quite at peace with it before the bandylegged baby was up
OUR HONOURABLE FRIEND WE are delighted to find that he has got in
Our honourable friend is triumphantly returned to serve in the next Parliament
He is the honourable member for Verbosity  the best represented place in England
Our honourable friend has issued an address of congratulation to the Electors which is worthy of that noble constituency and is a very pretty piece of composition
In electing him he says they have covered themselves with glory and England has been true to herself
In his preliminary address he had remarked in a poetical quotation of great rarity that nought could make us rue if England to herself did prove but true
Our honourable friend delivers a prediction in the same document that the feeble minions of a faction will never hold up their heads any more and that the finger of scorn will point at them in their dejected state through countless ages of time
Further that the hireling tools that would destroy the sacred bulwarks of our nationality are unworthy of the name of Englishman and that so long as the sea shall roll around our oceangirded isle so long his motto shall be No surrender
Certain dogged persons of low principles and no intellect have disputed whether anybody knows who the minions are or what the faction is or which are the hireling tools and which the sacred bulwarks or what it is that is never to be surrendered and if not why not
But our honourable friend the member for Verbosity knows all about it
Our honourable friend has sat in several parliaments and given bushels of votes
He is a man of that profundity in the matter of votegiving that you never know what he means
When he seems to be voting pure white he may be in reality voting jet black
When he says Yes it is just as likely as not  or rather more so  that he means No
This is the statesmanship of our honourable friend
It is in this that he differs from mere unparliamentary men
YOU may not know what he meant then or what he means now but our honourable friend knows and did from the first know both what he meant then and what he means now and when he said he didnt mean it then he did in fact say that he means it now
And if you mean to say that you did not then and do not now know what he did mean then or does mean now our honourable friend will be glad to receive an explicit declaration from you whether you are prepared to destroy the sacred bulwarks of our nationality
Our honourable friend the member for Verbosity has this great attribute that he always means something and always means the same thing
When he came down to that House and mournfully boasted in his place as an individual member of the assembled Commons of this great and happy country that he could lay his hand upon his heart and solemnly declare that no consideration on earth should induce him at any time or under any circumstances to go as far north as BerwickuponTweed and when he nevertheless next year did go to BerwickuponTweed and even beyond it to Edinburgh he had one single meaning one and indivisible
And God forbid our honourable friend says that he should waste another argument upon the man who professes that he cannot understand it
I do NOT gentlemen said our honourable friend with indignant emphasis and amid great cheering on one such public occasion
I do NOT gentlemen I am free to confess envy the feelings of that man whose mind is so constituted as that he can hold such language to me and yet lay his head upon his pillow claiming to be a native of that land Whose march is oer the mountainwave Whose home is on the deep
Vehement cheering and man expelled
When our honourable friend issued his preliminary address to the constituent body of Verbosity on the occasion of one particular glorious triumph it was supposed by some of his enemies that even he would be placed in a situation of difficulty by the following comparatively trifling conjunction of circumstances
The dozen noblemen and gentlemen whom our honourable friend supported had come in expressly to do a certain thing
Now four of the dozen said at a certain place that they didnt mean to do that thing and had never meant to do it another four of the dozen said at another certain place that they did mean to do that thing and had always meant to do it two of the remaining four said at two other certain places that they meant to do half of that thing but differed about which half and to do a variety of nameless wonders instead of the other half and one of the remaining two declared that the thing itself was dead and buried while the other as strenuously protested that it was alive and kicking
It was admitted that the parliamentary genius of our honourable friend would be quite able to reconcile such small discrepancies as these but there remained the additional difficulty that each of the twelve made entirely different statements at different places and that all the twelve called everything visible and invisible sacred and profane to witness that they were a perfectly impregnable phalanx of unanimity
This it was apprehended would be a stumblingblock to our honourable friend
The difficulty came before our honourable friend in this way
He went down to Verbosity to meet his free and independent constituents and to render an account as he informed them in the local papers of the trust they had confided to his hands  that trust which it was one of the proudest privileges of an Englishman to possess  that trust which it was the proudest privilege of an Englishman to hold
It may be mentioned as a proof of the great general interest attaching to the contest that a Lunatic whom nobody employed or knew went down to Verbosity with several thousand pounds in gold determined to give the whole away  which he actually did and that all the publicans opened their houses for nothing
Likewise several fighting men and a patriotic group of burglars sportively armed with lifepreservers proceeded in barouches and very drunk to the scene of action at their own expense these children of nature having conceived a warm attachment to our honourable friend and intending in their artless manner to testify it by knocking the voters in the opposite interest on the head
Our honourable friend being come into the presence of his constituents and having professed with great suavity that he was delighted to see his good friend Tipkisson there in his working dress  his good friend Tipkisson being an inveterate saddler who always opposes him and for whom he has a mortal hatred  made them a brisk gingerbeery sort of speech in which he showed them how the dozen noblemen and gentlemen had in exactly ten days from their coming in exercised a surprisingly beneficial effect on the whole financial condition of Europe had altered the state of the exports and imports for the current halfyear had prevented the drain of gold had made all that matter right about the glut of the raw material and had restored all sorts of balances with which the superseded noblemen and gentlemen had played the deuce  and all this with wheat at so much a quarter gold at so much an ounce and the Bank of England discounting good bills at so much per cent
He might be asked he observed in a peroration of great power what were his principles
His principles were what they always had been
His principles were written in the countenances of the lion and unicorn were stamped indelibly upon the royal shield which those grand animals supported and upon the free words of fire which that shield bore
His principles were Britannia and her seaking trident
His principles were commercial prosperity coexistently with perfect and profound agricultural contentment but short of this he would never stop
His principles were these  with the addition of his colours nailed to the mast every mans heart in the right place every mans eye open every mans hand ready every mans mind on the alert
His principles were these concurrently with a general revision of something  speaking generally  and a possible readjustment of something else not to be mentioned more particularly
His principles to sum up all in a word were Hearths and Altars Labour and Capital Crown and Sceptre Elephant and Castle
And now if his good friend Tipkisson required any further explanation from him he our honourable friend was there willing and ready to give it
Tipkisson who all this time had stood conspicuous in the crowd with his arms folded and his eyes intently fastened on our honourable friend Tipkisson who throughout our honourable friends address had not relaxed a muscle of his visage but had stood there wholly unaffected by the torrent of eloquence an object of contempt and scorn to mankind by which we mean of course to the supporters of our honourable friend Tipkisson now said that he was a plain man Cries of You are indeed
 and that what he wanted to know was what our honourable friend and the dozen noblemen and gentlemen were driving at
Our honourable friend immediately replied At the illimitable perspective
It was considered by the whole assembly that this happy statement of our honourable friends political views ought immediately to have settled Tipkissons business and covered him with confusion but that implacable person regardless of the execrations that were heaped upon him from all sides by which we mean of course from our honourable friends side persisted in retaining an unmoved countenance and obstinately retorted that if our honourable friend meant that he wished to know what THAT meant
It was in repelling this most objectionable and indecent opposition that our honourable friend displayed his highest qualifications for the representation of Verbosity
His warmest supporters present and those who were best acquainted with his generalship supposed that the moment was come when he would fall back upon the sacred bulwarks of our nationality
No such thing
He replied thus My good friend Tipkisson gentlemen wishes to know what I mean when he asks me what we are driving at and when I candidly tell him at the illimitable perspective he wishes if I understand him to know what I mean
 I do
says Tipkisson amid cries of Shame and Down with him
Gentlemen says our honourable friend I will indulge my good friend Tipkisson by telling him both what I mean and what I dont mean
Cheers and cries of Give it him
Be it known to him then and to all whom it may concern that I do mean altars hearths and homes and that I dont mean mosques and Mohammedanism
The effect of this home thrust was terrific
Tipkisson who is a Baptist was hooted down and hustled out and has ever since been regarded as a Turkish Renegade who contemplates an early pilgrimage to Mecca
Nor was he the only discomfited man
The charge while it stuck to him was magically transferred to our honourable friends opponent who was represented in an immense variety of placards as a firm believer in Mahomet and the men of Verbosity were asked to choose between our honourable friend and the Bible and our honourable friends opponent and the Koran
They decided for our honourable friend and rallied round the illimitable perspective
It has been claimed for our honourable friend with much appearance of reason that he was the first to bend sacred matters to electioneering tactics
However this may be the fine precedent was undoubtedly set in a Verbosity election and it is certain that our honourable friend who was a disciple of Brahma in his youth and was a Buddhist when we had the honour of travelling with him a few years ago always professes in public more anxiety than the whole Bench of Bishops regarding the theological and doxological opinions of every man woman and child in the United Kingdom
As we began by saying that our honourable friend has got in again at this last election and that we are delighted to find that he has got in so we will conclude
Our honourable friend cannot come in for Verbosity too often
It is a good sign it is a great example
It is to men like our honourable friend and to contests like those from which he comes triumphant that we are mainly indebted for that ready interest in politics that fresh enthusiasm in the discharge of the duties of citizenship that ardent desire to rush to the poll at present so manifest throughout England
When the contest lies as it sometimes does between two such men as our honourable friend it stimulates the finest emotions of our nature and awakens the highest admiration of which our heads and hearts are capable
It is not too much to predict that our honourable friend will be always at his post in the ensuing session
Whatever the question be or whatever the form of its discussion address to the crown election petition expenditure of the public money extension of the public suffrage education crime in the whole house in committee of the whole house in select committee in every parliamentary discussion of every subject everywhere the Honourable Member for Verbosity will most certainly be found
OUR SCHOOL WE went to look at it only this last Midsummer and found that the Railway had cut it up root and branch
A great trunkline had swallowed the playground sliced away the schoolroom and pared off the corner of the house which thus curtailed of its proportions presented itself in a green stage of stucco profilewise towards the road like a forlorn flatiron without a handle standing on end
It seems as if our schools were doomed to be the sport of change
We have faint recollections of a Preparatory DaySchool which we have sought in vain and which must have been pulled down to make a new street ages ago
We have dim impressions scarcely amounting to a belief that it was over a dyers shop
We know that you went up steps to it that you frequently grazed your knees in doing so that you generally got your leg over the scraper in trying to scrape the mud off a very unsteady little shoe
The mistress of the Establishment holds no place in our memory but rampant on one eternal doormat in an eternal entry long and narrow is a puffy pugdog with a personal animosity towards us who triumphs over Time
The bark of that baleful Pug a certain radiating way he had of snapping at our undefended legs the ghastly grinning of his moist black muzzle and white teeth and the insolence of his crisp tail curled like a pastoral crook all live and flourish
From an otherwise unaccountable association of him with a fiddle we conclude that he was of French extraction and his name FIDELE
He belonged to some female chiefly inhabiting a backparlour whose life appears to us to have been consumed in sniffing and in wearing a brown beaver bonnet
For her he would sit up and balance cake upon his nose and not eat it until twenty had been counted
To the best of our belief we were once called in to witness this performance when unable even in his milder moments to endure our presence he instantly made at us cake and all
Why a something in mourning called Miss Frost should still connect itself with our preparatory school we are unable to say
We retain no impression of the beauty of Miss Frost  if she were beautiful or of the mental fascinations of Miss Frost  if she were accomplished yet her name and her black dress hold an enduring place in our remembrance
An equally impersonal boy whose name has long since shaped itself unalterably into Master Mawls is not to be dislodged from our brain
Retaining no vindictive feeling towards Mawls  no feeling whatever indeed  we infer that neither he nor we can have loved Miss Frost
Our first impression of Death and Burial is associated with this formless pair
We all three nestled awfully in a corner one wintry day when the wind was blowing shrill with Miss Frosts pinafore over our heads and Miss Frost told us in a whisper about somebody being screwed down
It is the only distinct recollection we preserve of these impalpable creatures except a suspicion that the manners of Master Mawls were susceptible of much improvement
Generally speaking we may observe that whenever we see a child intently occupied with its nose to the exclusion of all other subjects of interest our mind reverts in a flash to Master Mawls
But the School that was Our School before the Railroad came and overthrew it was quite another sort of place
We were old enough to be put into Virgil when we went there and to get Prizes for a variety of polishing on which the rust has long accumulated
It was a School of some celebrity in its neighbourhood  nobody could have said why  and we had the honour to attain and hold the eminent position of first boy
The master was supposed among us to know nothing and one of the ushers was supposed to know everything
We are still inclined to think the firstnamed supposition perfectly correct
We have a general idea that its subject had been in the leather trade and had bought us  meaning Our School  of another proprietor who was immensely learned
Whether this belief had any real foundation we are not likely ever to know now
The only branches of education with which he showed the least acquaintance were ruling and corporally punishing
He was always ruling cipheringbooks with a bloated mahogany ruler or smiting the palms of offenders with the same diabolical instrument or viciously drawing a pair of pantaloons tight with one of his large hands and caning the wearer with the other
We have no doubt whatever that this occupation was the principal solace of his existence
A profound respect for money pervaded Our School which was of course derived from its Chief
We remember an idiotic goggleeyed boy with a big head and halfcrowns without end who suddenly appeared as a parlourboarder and was rumoured to have come by sea from some mysterious part of the earth where his parents rolled in gold
He was usually called Mr
by the Chief and was said to feed in the parlour on steaks and gravy likewise to drink currant wine
And he openly stated that if rolls and coffee were ever denied him at breakfast he would write home to that unknown part of the globe from which he had come and cause himself to be recalled to the regions of gold
He was put into no form or class but learnt alone as little as he liked  and he liked very little  and there was a belief among us that this was because he was too wealthy to be taken down
His special treatment and our vague association of him with the sea and with storms and sharks and Coral Reefs occasioned the wildest legends to be circulated as his history
A tragedy in blank verse was written on the subject  if our memory does not deceive us by the hand that now chronicles these recollections  in which his father figured as a Pirate and was shot for a voluminous catalogue of atrocities first imparting to his wife the secret of the cave in which his wealth was stored and from which his only sons halfcrowns now issued
Dumbledon the boys name was represented as yet unborn when his brave father met his fate and the despair and grief of Mrs Dumbledon at that calamity was movingly shadowed forth as having weakened the parlourboarders mind
This production was received with great favour and was twice performed with closed doors in the dining room
But it got wind and was seized as libellous and brought the unlucky poet into severe affliction
Some two years afterwards all of a sudden one day Dumbledon vanished
It was whispered that the Chief himself had taken him down to the Docks and reshipped him for the Spanish Main but nothing certain was ever known about his disappearance
At this hour we cannot thoroughly disconnect him from California
Our School was rather famous for mysterious pupils
There was another  a heavy young man with a large doublecased silver watch and a fat knife the handle of which was a perfect toolbox  who unaccountably appeared one day at a special desk of his own erected close to that of the Chief with whom he held familiar converse
He lived in the parlour and went out for his walks and never took the least notice of us  even of us the first boy  unless to give us a deprecatory kick or grimly to take our hat off and throw it away when he encountered us out of doors which unpleasant ceremony he always performed as he passed  not even condescending to stop for the purpose
Some of us believed that the classical attainments of this phenomenon were terrific but that his penmanship and arithmetic were defective and he had come there to mend them others that he was going to set up a school and had paid the Chief twentyfive pound down for leave to see Our School at work
The gloomier spirits even said that he was going to buy us against which contingency conspiracies were set on foot for a general defection and running away
However he never did that
After staying for a quarter during which period though closely observed he was never seen to do anything but make pens out of quills write small hand in a secret portfolio and punch the point of the sharpest blade in his knife into his desk all over it he too disappeared and his place knew him no more
There was another boy a fair meek boy with a delicate complexion and rich curling hair who we found out or thought we found out we have no idea now and probably had none then on what grounds but it was confidentially revealed from mouth to mouth was the son of a Viscount who had deserted his lovely mother
It was understood that if he had his rights he would be worth twenty thousand a year
And that if his mother ever met his father she would shoot him with a silver pistol which she carried always loaded to the muzzle for that purpose
He was a very suggestive topic
So was a young Mulatto who was always believed though very amiable to have a dagger about him somewhere
But we think they were both outshone upon the whole by another boy who claimed to have been born on the twentyninth of February and to have only one birthday in five years
We suspect this to have been a fiction  but he lived upon it all the time he was at Our School
The principal currency of Our School was slate pencil
It had some inexplicable value that was never ascertained never reduced to a standard
To have a great hoard of it was somehow to be rich
We used to bestow it in charity and confer it as a precious boon upon our chosen friends
When the holidays were coming contributions were solicited for certain boys whose relatives were in India and who were appealed for under the generic name of Holidaystoppers  appropriate marks of remembrance that should enliven and cheer them in their homeless state
Personally we always contributed these tokens of sympathy in the form of slate pencil and always felt that it would be a comfort and a treasure to them
Our School was remarkable for white mice
Redpolls linnets and even canaries were kept in desks drawers hatboxes and other strange refuges for birds but white mice were the favourite stock
The boys trained the mice much better than the masters trained the boys
We recall one white mouse who lived in the cover of a Latin dictionary who ran up ladders drew Roman chariots shouldered muskets turned wheels and even made a very creditable appearance on the stage as the Dog of Montargis
He might have achieved greater things but for having the misfortune to mistake his way in a triumphal procession to the Capitol when he fell into a deep inkstand and was dyed black and drowned
The mice were the occasion of some most ingenious engineering in the construction of their houses and instruments of performance
The famous one belonged to a company of proprietors some of whom have since made Railroads Engines and Telegraphs the chairman has erected mills and bridges in New Zealand
The usher at Our School who was considered to know everything as opposed to the Chief who was considered to know nothing was a bony gentlefaced clericallooking young man in rusty black
It was whispered that he was sweet upon one of Maxbys sisters Maxby lived close by and was a day pupil and further that he favoured Maxby
As we remember he taught Italian to Maxbys sisters on halfholidays
He once went to the play with them and wore a white waistcoat and a rose which was considered among us equivalent to a declaration
We were of opinion on that occasion that to the last moment he expected Maxbys father to ask him to dinner at five oclock and therefore neglected his own dinner at halfpast one and finally got none
We exaggerated in our imaginations the extent to which he punished Maxbys fathers cold meat at supper and we agreed to believe that he was elevated with wine and water when he came home
But we all liked him for he had a good knowledge of boys and would have made it a much better school if he had had more power
He was writing master mathematical master English master made out the bills mended the pens and did all sorts of things
He divided the little boys with the Latin master they were smuggled through their rudimentary books at odd times when there was nothing else to do and he always called at parents houses to inquire after sick boys because he had gentlemanly manners
He was rather musical and on some remote quarterday had bought an old trombone but a bit of it was lost and it made the most extraordinary sounds when he sometimes tried to play it of an evening
His holidays never began on account of the bills until long after ours but in the summer vacations he used to take pedestrian excursions with a knapsack and at Christmas time he went to see his father at Chipping Norton who we all said on no authority was a dairyfed pork butcher
Poor fellow
He was very low all day on Maxbys sisters weddingday and afterwards was thought to favour Maxby more than ever though he had been expected to spite him
He has been dead these twenty years
Poor fellow
Our remembrance of Our School presents the Latin master as a colourless doubledup nearsighted man with a crutch who was always cold and always putting onions into his ears for deafness and always disclosing ends of flannel under all his garments and almost always applying a ball of pockethandkerchief to some part of his face with a screwing action round and round
He was a very good scholar and took great pains where he saw intelligence and a desire to learn otherwise perhaps not
Our memory presents him unless teased into a passion with as little energy as colour  as having been worried and tormented into monotonous feebleness  as having had the best part of his life ground out of him in a Mill of boys
We remember with terror how he fell asleep one sultry afternoon with the little smuggled class before him and awoke not when the footstep of the Chief fell heavy on the floor how the Chief aroused him in the midst of a dread silence and said Mr
Blinkins are you ill sir
how he blushingly replied Sir rather so how the Chief retorted with severity Mr
Blinkins this is no place to be ill in which was very very true and walked back solemn as the ghost in Hamlet until catching a wandering eye he called that boy for inattention and happily expressed his feelings towards the Latin master through the medium of a substitute
There was a fat little dancingmaster who used to come in a gig and taught the more advanced among us hornpipes as an accomplishment in great social demand in after life and there was a brisk little French master who used to come in the sunniest weather with a handleless umbrella and to whom the Chief was always polite because as we believed if the Chief offended him he would instantly address the Chief in French and for ever confound him before the boys with his inability to understand or reply
There was besides a serving man whose name was Phil
Our retrospective glance presents Phil as a shipwrecked carpenter cast away upon the desert island of a school and carrying into practice an ingenious inkling of many trades
He mended whatever was broken and made whatever was wanted
He was general glazier among other things and mended all the broken windows  at the prime cost as was darkly rumoured among us of ninepence for every square charged threeandsix to parents
We had a high opinion of his mechanical genius and generally held that the Chief knew something bad of him and on pain of divulgence enforced Phil to be his bondsman
We particularly remember that Phil had a sovereign contempt for learning which engenders in us a respect for his sagacity as it implies his accurate observation of the relative positions of the Chief and the ushers
He was an impenetrable man who waited at table between whiles and throughout the half kept the boxes in severe custody
He was morose even to the Chief and never smiled except at breakingup when in acknowledgment of the toast Success to Phil
Hooray
he would slowly carve a grin out of his wooden face where it would remain until we were all gone
Nevertheless one time when we had the scarlet fever in the school Phil nursed all the sick boys of his own accord and was like a mother to them
There was another school not far off and of course Our School could have nothing to say to that school
It is mostly the way with schools whether of boys or men
Well
the railway has swallowed up ours and the locomotives now run smoothly over its ashes
So fades and languishes grows dim and dies All that this world is proud of  and is not proud of too
It had little reason to be proud of Our School and has done much better since in that way and will do far better yet
OUR VESTRY WE have the glorious privilege of being always in hot water if we like
We are a shareholder in a Great Parochial British Joint Stock Bank of Balderdash
We have a Vestry in our borough and can vote for a vestryman  might even BE a vestryman mayhap if we were inspired by a lofty and noble ambition
Which we are not
Our Vestry is a deliberative assembly of the utmost dignity and importance
Like the Senate of ancient Rome its awful gravity overpowers or ought to overpower barbarian visitors
It sits in the Capitol we mean in the capital building erected for it chiefly on Saturdays and shakes the earth to its centre with the echoes of its thundering eloquence in a Sunday paper
To get into this Vestry in the eminent capacity of Vestryman gigantic efforts are made and Herculean exertions used
It is made manifest to the dullest capacity at every election that if we reject Snozzle we are done for and that if we fail to bring in Blunderbooze at the top of the poll we are unworthy of the dearest rights of Britons
Flaming placards are rife on all the dead walls in the borough publichouses hang out banners hackneycabs burst into fullgrown flowers of type and everybody is or should be in a paroxysm of anxiety
At these momentous crises of the national fate we are much assisted in our deliberations by two eminent volunteers one of whom subscribes himself A Fellow Parishioner the other A Rate Payer
Who they are or what they are or where they are nobody knows but whatever one asserts the other contradicts
They are both voluminous writers indicting more epistles than Lord Chesterfield in a single week and the greater part of their feelings are too big for utterance in anything less than capital letters
They require the additional aid of whole rows of notes of admiration like balloons to point their generous indignation and they sometimes communicate a crushing severity to stars
As thus MEN OF MOONEYMOUNT
Is it or is it not a    to saddle the parish with a debt of 2745 pounds 6S
9D yet claim to be a RIGID ECONOMIST
Is it or is it not a    to state as a fact what is proved to be BOTH A MORAL AND A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
Is it or is it not a    to call 2745 pounds 6S
9D
nothing and nothing something
Do you or do you NOT want a    TO REPRESENT YOU IN THE VESTRY
Your consideration of these questions is recommended to you by A FELLOW PARISHIONER
It was to this important public document that one of our first orators MR MAGG of Little Winkling Street adverted when he opened the great debate of the fourteenth of November by saying Sir I hold in my hand an anonymous slander  and when the interruption with which he was at that point assailed by the opposite faction gave rise to that memorable discussion on a point of order which will ever be remembered with interest by constitutional assemblies
In the animated debate to which we refer no fewer than thirtyseven gentlemen many of them of great eminence including MR WIGSBY of Chumbledon Square were seen upon their legs at one time and it was on the same great occasion that DOGGINSON  regarded in our Vestry as a regular John Bull we believe in consequence of his having always made up his mind on every subject without knowing anything about it  informed another gentleman of similar principles on the opposite side that if he cheekd him he would resort to the extreme measure of knocking his blessed head off
This was a great occasion
But our Vestry shines habitually
In asserting its own preeminence for instance it is very strong
On the least provocation or on none it will be clamorous to know whether it is to be dictated to or trampled on or ridden over roughshod
Its great watchword is Selfgovernment
That is to say supposing our Vestry to favour any little harmless disorder like Typhus Fever and supposing the Government of the country to be by any accident in such ridiculous hands as that any of its authorities should consider it a duty to object to Typhus Fever  obviously an unconstitutional objection  then our Vestry cuts in with a terrible manifesto about Selfgovernment and claims its independent right to have as much Typhus Fever as pleases itself
Some absurd and dangerous persons have represented on the other hand that though our Vestry may be able to beat the bounds of its own parish it may not be able to beat the bounds of its own diseases which say they spread over the whole land in an ever expanding circle of waste and misery and death and widowhood and orphanage and desolation
But our Vestry makes short work of any such fellows as these
It was our Vestry  pink of Vestries as it is  that in support of its favourite principle took the celebrated ground of denying the existence of the last pestilence that raged in England when the pestilence was raging at the Vestry doors
Dogginson said it was plums Mr Wigsby of Chumbledon Square said it was oysters Mr Magg of Little Winkling Street said amid great cheering it was the newspapers
The noble indignation of our Vestry with that un English institution the Board of Health under those circumstances yields one of the finest passages in its history
It wouldnt hear of rescue
Like Mr Joseph Millers Frenchman it would be drowned and nobody should save it
Transported beyond grammar by its kindled ire it spoke in unknown tongues and vented unintelligible bellowings more like an ancient oracle than the modern oracle it is admitted on all hands to be
Rare exigencies produce rare things and even our Vestry new hatched to the woful time came forth a greater goose than ever
But this again was a special occasion
Our Vestry at more ordinary periods demands its meed of praise
Our Vestry is eminently parliamentary
Playing at Parliament is its favourite game
It is even regarded by some of its members as a chapel of ease to the House of Commons a Little Go to be passed first
It has its strangers gallery and its reported debates see the Sunday paper before mentioned and our Vestrymen are in and out of order and on and off their legs and above all are transcendently quarrelsome after the pattern of the real original
Our Vestry being assembled Mr Magg never begs to trouble Mr Wigsby with a simple inquiry
He knows better than that
Seeing the honourable gentleman associated in their minds with Chumbledon Square in his place he wishes to ask that honourable gentleman what the intentions of himself and those with whom he acts may be on the subject of the paving of the district known as Piggleum Buildings
Mr Wigsby replies with his eye on next Sundays paper that in reference to the question which has been put to him by the honourable gentleman opposite he must take leave to say that if that honourable gentleman had had the courtesy to give him notice of that question he Mr Wigsby would have consulted with his colleagues in reference to the advisability in the present state of the discussions on the new pavingrate of answering that question
But as the honourable gentleman has NOT had the courtesy to give him notice of that question great cheering from the Wigsby interest he must decline to give the honourable gentleman the satisfaction he requires
Mr Magg instantly rising to retort is received with loud cries of Spoke
from the Wigsby interest and with cheers from the Magg side of the house
Moreover five gentlemen rise to order and one of them in revenge for being taken no notice of petrifies the assembly by moving that this Vestry do now adjourn but is persuaded to withdraw that awful proposal in consideration of its tremendous consequences if persevered in
Mr Magg for the purpose of being heard then begs to move that you sir do now pass to the order of the day and takes that opportunity of saying that if an honourable gentleman whom he has in his eye and will not demean himself by more particularly naming oh oh and cheers supposes that he is to be put down by clamour that honourable gentleman  however supported he may be through thick and thin by a Fellow Parishioner with whom he is well acquainted cheers and countercheers Mr Magg being invariably backed by the RatePayer  will find himself mistaken
Upon this twenty members of our Vestry speak in succession concerning what the two great men have meant until it appears after an hour and twenty minutes that neither of them meant anything
Then our Vestry begins business
We have said that after the pattern of the real original our Vestry in playing at Parliament is transcendently quarrelsome
It enjoys a personal altercation above all things
Perhaps the most redoubtable case of this kind we have ever had  though we have had so many that it is difficult to decide  was that on which the last extreme solemnities passed between Mr Tiddypot of Gumption House and Captain Banger of Wilderness Walk
In an adjourned debate on the question whether water could be regarded in the light of a necessary of life respecting which there were great differences of opinion and many shades of sentiment Mr Tiddypot in a powerful burst of eloquence against that hypothesis frequently made use of the expression that such and such a rumour had reached his ears
Captain Banger following him and holding that for purposes of ablution and refreshment a pint of water per diem was necessary for every adult of the lower classes and half a pint for every child cast ridicule upon his address in a sparkling speech and concluded by saying that instead of those rumours having reached the ears of the honourable gentleman he rather thought the honourable gentlemans ears must have reached the rumours in consequence of their well known length
Mr Tiddypot immediately rose looked the honourable and gallant gentleman full in the face and left the Vestry
The excitement at this moment painfully intense was heightened to an acute degree when Captain Banger rose and also left the Vestry
After a few moments of profound silence  one of those breathless pauses never to be forgotten  Mr Chib of Tuckets Terrace and the father of the Vestry rose
He said that words and looks had passed in that assembly replete with consequences which every feeling mind must deplore
Time pressed
The sword was drawn and while he spoke the scabbard might be thrown away
He moved that those honourable gentlemen who had left the Vestry be recalled and required to pledge themselves upon their honour that this affair should go no farther
The motion being by a general union of parties unanimously agreed to for everybody wanted to have the belligerents there instead of out of sight which was no fun at all Mr Magg was deputed to recover Captain Banger and Mr Chib himself to go in search of Mr Tiddypot
The Captain was found in a conspicuous position surveying the passing omnibuses from the top step of the frontdoor immediately adjoining the beadles box Mr Tiddypot made a desperate attempt at resistance but was overpowered by Mr Chib a remarkably hale old gentleman of eighty two and brought back in safety
Mr Tiddypot and the Captain being restored to their places and glaring on each other were called upon by the chair to abandon all homicidal intentions and give the Vestry an assurance that they did so
Mr Tiddypot remained profoundly silent
The Captain likewise remained profoundly silent saying that he was observed by those around him to fold his arms like Napoleon Buonaparte and to snort in his breathing  actions but too expressive of gunpowder
The most intense emotion now prevailed
Several members clustered in remonstrance round the Captain and several round Mr Tiddypot but both were obdurate
Mr Chib then presented himself amid tremendous cheering and said that not to shrink from the discharge of his painful duty he must now move that both honourable gentlemen be taken into custody by the beadle and conveyed to the nearest policeoffice there to be held to bail
The union of parties still continuing the motion was seconded by Mr Wigsby  on all usual occasions Mr Chibs opponent  and rapturously carried with only one dissentient voice
This was Dogginsons who said from his place Let em fight it out with fistes but whose coarse remark was received as it merited
The beadle now advanced along the floor of the Vestry and beckoned with his cocked hat to both members
Every breath was suspended
To say that a pin might have been heard to fall would be feebly to express the allabsorbing interest and silence
Suddenly enthusiastic cheering broke out from every side of the Vestry
Captain Banger had risen  being in fact pulled up by a friend on either side and poked up by a friend behind
The Captain said in a deep determined voice that he had every respect for that Vestry and every respect for that chair that he also respected the honourable gentleman of Gumpton House but that he respected his honour more
Hereupon the Captain sat down leaving the whole Vestry much affected
Mr Tiddypot instantly rose and was received with the same encouragement
He likewise said  and the exquisite art of this orator communicated to the observation an air of freshness and novelty  that he too had every respect for that Vestry that he too had every respect for that chair
That he too respected the honourable and gallant gentleman of Wilderness Walk but that he too respected his honour more
Howsever added the distinguished Vestryman if the honourable and gallant gentlemans honour is never more doubted and damaged than it is by me hes all right
Captain Banger immediately started up again and said that after those observations involving as they did ample concession to his honour without compromising the honour of the honourable gentleman he would be wanting in honour as well as in generosity if he did not at once repudiate all intention of wounding the honour of the honourable gentleman or saying anything dishonourable to his honourable feelings
These observations were repeatedly interrupted by bursts of cheers
Mr Tiddypot retorted that he well knew the spirit of honour by which the honourable and gallant gentleman was so honourably animated and that he accepted an honourable explanation offered in a way that did him honour but he trusted that the Vestry would consider that his Mr Tiddypots honour had imperatively demanded of him that painful course which he had felt it due to his honour to adopt
The Captain and Mr Tiddypot then touched their hats to one another across the Vestry a great many times and it is thought that these proceedings reported to the extent of several columns in next Sundays paper will bring them in as churchwardens next year
All this was strictly after the pattern of the real original and so are the whole of our Vestrys proceedings
In all their debates they are laudably imitative of the windy and wordy slang of the real original and of nothing that is better in it
They have headstrong party animosities without any reference to the merits of questions they tack a surprising amount of debate to a very little business they set more store by forms than they do by substances  all very like the real original
It has been doubted in our borough whether our Vestry is of any utility but our own conclusion is that it is of the use to the Borough that a diminishing mirror is to a painter as enabling it to perceive in a small focus of absurdity all the surface defects of the real original
OUR BORE IT is unnecessary to say that we keep a bore
Everybody does
But the bore whom we have the pleasure and honour of enumerating among our particular friends is such a generic bore and has so many traits as it appears to us in common with the great bore family that we are tempted to make him the subject of the present notes
May he be generally accepted
Our bore is admitted on all hands to be a goodhearted man
He may put fifty people out of temper but he keeps his own
He preserves a sickly solid smile upon his face when other faces are ruffled by the perfection he has attained in his art and has an equable voice which never travels out of one key or rises above one pitch
His manner is a manner of tranquil interest
None of his opinions are startling
Among his deepestrooted convictions it may be mentioned that he considers the air of England damp and holds that our lively neighbours  he always calls the French our lively neighbours  have the advantage of us in that particular
Nevertheless he is unable to forget that John Bull is John Bull all the world over and that England with all her faults is England still
Our bore has travelled
He could not possibly be a complete bore without having travelled
He rarely speaks of his travels without introducing sometimes on his own plan of construction morsels of the language of the country  which he always translates
You cannot name to him any little remote town in France Italy Germany or Switzerland but he knows it well stayed there a fortnight under peculiar circumstances
And talking of that little place perhaps you know a statue over an old fountain up a little court which is the second  no the third  stay  yes the third turning on the right after you come out of the Posthouse going up the hill towards the market
You DONT know that statue
Nor that fountain
You surprise him
They are not usually seen by travellers most extraordinary he has never yet met with a single traveller who knew them except one German the most intelligent man he ever met in his life
but he thought that YOU would have been the man to find them out
And then he describes them in a circumstantial lecture half an hour long generally delivered behind a door which is constantly being opened from the other side and implores you if you ever revisit that place now do go and look at that statue and fountain
Our bore in a similar manner being in Italy made a discovery of a dreadful picture which has been the terror of a large portion of the civilized world ever since
We have seen the liveliest men paralysed by it across a broad diningtable
He was lounging among the mountains sir basking in the mellow influences of the climate when he came to UNA PICCOLA CHIESA  a little church  or perhaps it would be more correct to say UNA PICCOLISSIMA CAPPELLA  the smallest chapel you can possibly imagine  and walked in
There was nobody inside but a CIECO  a blind man  saying his prayers and a VECCHIO PADRE  old friarrattling a moneybox
But above the head of that friar and immediately to the right of the altar as you enter  to the right of the altar
No
To the left of the altar as you enter  or say near the centre  there hung a painting subject Virgin and Child so divine in its expression so pure and yet so warm and rich in its tone so fresh in its touch at once so glowing in its colour and so statuesque in its repose that our bore cried out in ecstasy Thats the finest picture in Italy
And so it is sir
There is no doubt of it
It is astonishing that that picture is so little known
Even the painter is uncertain
He afterwards took Blumb of the Royal Academy it is to be observed that our bore takes none but eminent people to see sights and that none but eminent people take our bore and you never saw a man so affected in your life as Blumb was
He cried like a child
And then our bore begins his description in detail  for all this is introductory  and strangles his hearers with the folds of the purple drapery
By an equally fortunate conjunction of accidental circumstances it happened that when our bore was in Switzerland he discovered a Valley of that superb character that Chamouni is not to be mentioned in the same breath with it
This is how it was sir
He was travelling on a mule  had been in the saddle some days  when as he and the guide Pierre Blanquo whom you may know perhaps
 our bore is sorry you dont because hes the only guide deserving of the name  as he and Pierre were descending towards evening among those everlasting snows to the little village of La Croix our bore observed a mountain track turning off sharply to the right
At first he was uncertain whether it WAS a track at all and in fact he said to Pierre QUEST QUE CEST DONC MON AMI
 What is that my friend
Ou MONSIEUR
said Pierre  Where sir
 La
 there
said our bore
MONSIEUR CE NEST RIEN DE TOUT  sir its nothing at all said Pierre
ALLONS
 Make haste
IL VA NEIGET  its going to snow
But our bore was not to be done in that way and he firmly replied I wish to go in that direction  JE VEUX Y ALLER
I am bent upon it  JE SUIS DETERMINE
EN AVANT
 go ahead
In consequence of which firmness on our bores part they proceeded sir during two hours of evening and three of moonlight they waited in a cavern till the moon was up along the slenderest track overhanging perpendicularly the most awful gulfs until they arrived by a winding descent in a valley that possibly and he may say probably was never visited by any stranger before
What a valley
Mountains piled on mountains avalanches stemmed by pine forests waterfalls chalets mountaintorrents wooden bridges every conceivable picture of Swiss scenery
The whole village turned out to receive our bore
The peasant girls kissed him the men shook hands with him one old lady of benevolent appearance wept upon his breast
He was conducted in a primitive triumph to the little inn where he was taken ill next morning and lay for six weeks attended by the amiable hostess the same benevolent old lady who had wept over night and her charming daughter Fanchette
It is nothing to say that they were attentive to him they doted on him
They called him in their simple way LANGE ANGLAIS  the English Angel
When our bore left the valley there was not a dry eye in the place some of the people attended him for miles
He begs and entreats of you as a personal favour that if you ever go to Switzerland again you have mentioned that your last visit was your twentythird you will go to that valley and see Swiss scenery for the first time
And if you want really to know the pastoral people of Switzerland and to understand them mention in that valley our bores name
Our bore has a crushing brother in the East who somehow or other was admitted to smoke pipes with Mehemet Ali and instantly became an authority on the whole range of Eastern matters from Haroun Alraschid to the present Sultan
He is in the habit of expressing mysterious opinions on this wide range of subjects but on questions of foreign policy more particularly to our bore in letters and our bore is continually sending bits of these letters to the newspapers which they never insert and carrying other bits about in his pocketbook
It is even whispered that he has been seen at the Foreign Office receiving great consideration from the messengers and having his card promptly borne into the sanctuary of the temple
The havoc committed in society by this Eastern brother is beyond belief
Our bore is always ready with him
We have known our bore to fall upon an intelligent young sojourner in the wilderness in the first sentence of a narrative and beat all confidence out of him with one blow of his brother
He became omniscient as to foreign policy in the smoking of those pipes with Mehemet Ali
The balance of power in Europe the machinations of the Jesuits the gentle and humanising influence of Austria the position and prospects of that hero of the noble soul who is worshipped by happy France are all easy reading to our bores brother
And our bore is so provokingly selfdenying about him
I dont pretend to more than a very general knowledge of these subjects myself says he after enervating the intellects of several strong men but these are my brothers opinions and I believe he is known to be wellinformed
The commonest incidents and places would appear to have been made special expressly for our bore
Ask him whether he ever chanced to walk between seven and eight in the morning down St Jamess Street London and he will tell you never in his life but once
But its curious that that once was in eighteen thirty and that as our bore was walking down the street you have just mentioned at the hour you have just mentioned  halfpast seven  or twenty minutes to eight
No
Let him be correct
 exactly a quarter before eight by the palace clock  he met a freshcoloured grey haired goodhumoured looking gentleman with a brown umbrella who as he passed him touched his hat and said Fine morning sir fine morning
 William the Fourth
Ask our bore whether he has seen Mr Barrys new Houses of Parliament and he will reply that he has not yet inspected them minutely but that you remind him that it was his singular fortune to be the last man to see the old Houses of Parliament before the fire broke out
It happened in this way
Poor John Spine the celebrated novelist had taken him over to South Lambeth to read to him the last few chapters of what was certainly his best book  as our bore told him at the time adding Now my dear John touch it and youll spoil it
 and our bore was going back to the club by way of Millbank and Parliament Street when he stopped to think of Canning and look at the Houses of Parliament
Now you know far more of the philosophy of Mind than our bore does and are much better able to explain to him than he is to explain to you why or wherefore at that particular time the thought of fire should come into his head
But it did
It did
He thought What a national calamity if an edifice connected with so many associations should be consumed by fire
At that time there was not a single soul in the street but himself
All was quiet dark and solitary
After contemplating the building for a minute  or say a minute and a half not more  our bore proceeded on his way mechanically repeating What a national calamity if such an edifice connected with such associations should be destroyed by  A man coming towards him in a violent state of agitation completed the sentence with the exclamation Fire
Our bore looked round and the whole structure was in a blaze
In harmony and union with these experiences our bore never went anywhere in a steamboat but he made either the best or the worst voyage ever known on that station
Either he overheard the captain say to himself with his hands clasped We are all lost
or the captain openly declared to him that he had never made such a run before and never should be able to do it again
Our bore was in that express train on that railway when they made unknown to the passengers the experiment of going at the rate of a hundred to miles an hour
Our bore remarked on that occasion to the other people in the carriage This is too fast but sit still
He was at the Norwich musical festival when the extraordinary echo for which science has been wholly unable to account was heard for the first and last time
He and the bishop heard it at the same moment and caught each others eye
He was present at that illumination of St Peters of which the Pope is known to have remarked as he looked at it out of his window in the Vatican O CIELO
QUESTA COSA NON SARA FATTA MAI ANCORA COME QUESTA  O Heaven
this thing will never be done again like this
He has seen every lion he ever saw under some remarkably propitious circumstances
He knows there is no fancy in it because in every case the showman mentioned the fact at the time and congratulated him upon it
At one period of his life our bore had an illness
It was an illness of a dangerous character for society at large
Innocently remark that you are very well or that somebody else is very well and our bore with a preface that one never knows what a blessing health is until one has lost it is reminded of that illness and drags you through the whole of its symptoms progress and treatment
Innocently remark that you are not well or that somebody else is not well and the same inevitable result ensues
You will learn how our bore felt a tightness about here sir for which he couldnt account accompanied with a constant sensation as if he were being stabbed  or rather jobbed  that expresses it more correctly  jobbed  with a blunt knife
Well sir
This went on until sparks began to flit before his eyes waterwheels to turn round in his head and hammers to beat incessantly thump thump thump all down his back  along the whole of the spinal vertebrae
Our bore when his sensations had come to this thought it a duty he owed to himself to take advice and he said Now whom shall I consult
He naturally thought of Callow at that time one of the most eminent physicians in London and he went to Callow
Callow said Liver
and prescribed rhubarb and calomel low diet and moderate exercise
Our bore went on with this treatment getting worse every day until he lost confidence in Callow and went to Moon whom half the town was then mad about
Moon was interested in the case to do him justice he was very much interested in the case and he said Kidneys
He altered the whole treatment sir  gave strong acids cupped and blistered
This went on our bore still getting worse every day until he openly told Moon it would be a satisfaction to him if he would have a consultation with Clatter
The moment Clatter saw our bore he said Accumulation of fat about the heart
Snugglewood who was called in with him differed and said Brain
But what they all agreed upon was to lay our bore upon his back to shave his head to leech him to administer enormous quantities of medicine and to keep him low so that he was reduced to a mere shadow you wouldnt have known him and nobody considered it possible that he could ever recover
This was his condition sir when he heard of Jilkins  at that period in a very small practice and living in the upper part of a house in Great Portland Street but still you understand with a rising reputation among the few people to whom he was known
Being in that condition in which a drowning man catches at a straw our bore sent for Jilkins
Jilkins came
Our bore liked his eye and said Mr
Jilkins I have a presentiment that you will do me good
Jilkinss reply was characteristic of the man
It was Sir I mean to do you good
This confirmed our bores opinion of his eye and they went into the case together  went completely into it
Jilkins then got up walked across the room came back and sat down
His words were these
You have been humbugged
This is a case of indigestion occasioned by deficiency of power in the Stomach
Take a mutton chop in halfan hour with a glass of the finest old sherry that can be got for money
Take two mutton chops tomorrow and two glasses of the finest old sherry
Next day Ill come again
In a week our bore was on his legs and Jilkinss success dates from that period
Our bore is great in secret information
He happens to know many things that nobody else knows
He can generally tell you where the split is in the Ministry he knows a great deal about the Queen and has little anecdotes to relate of the royal nursery
He gives you the judges private opinion of Sludge the murderer and his thoughts when he tried him
He happens to know what such a man got by such a transaction and it was fifteen thousand five hundred pounds and his income is twelve thousand a year
Our bore is also great in mystery
He believes with an exasperating appearance of profound meaning that you saw Parkins last Sunday
 Yes you did
 Did he say anything particular
 No nothing particular
 Our bore is surprised at that
 Why
 Nothing
Only he understood that Parkins had come to tell you something
 What about
 Well
our bore is not at liberty to mention what about
But he believes you will hear that from Parkins himself soon and he hopes it may not surprise you as it did him
Perhaps however you never heard about Parkinss wifes sister
 No
 Ah
says our bore that explains it
Our bore is also great in argument
He infinitely enjoys a long humdrum drowsy interchange of words of dispute about nothing
He considers that it strengthens the mind consequently he dont see that very often
Or he would be glad to know what you mean by that
Or he doubts that
Or he has always understood exactly the reverse of that
Or he cant admit that
Or he begs to deny that
Or surely you dont mean that
And so on
He once advised us offered us a piece of advice after the fact totally impracticable and wholly impossible of acceptance because it supposed the fact then eternally disposed of to be yet in abeyance
It was a dozen years ago and to this hour our bore benevolently wishes in a mild voice on certain regular occasions that we had thought better of his opinion
The instinct with which our bore finds out another bore and closes with him is amazing
We have seen him pick his man out of fifty men in a couple of minutes
They love to go which they do naturally into a slow argument on a previously exhausted subject and to contradict each other and to wear the hearers out without impairing their own perennial freshness as bores
It improves the good understanding between them and they get together afterwards and bore each other amicably
Whenever we see our bore behind a door with another bore we know that when he comes forth he will praise the other bore as one of the most intelligent men he ever met
And this bringing us to the close of what we had to say about our bore we are anxious to have it understood that he never bestowed this praise on us
A MONUMENT OF FRENCH FOLLY IT was profoundly observed by a witty member of the Court of Common Council in Council assembled in the City of London in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty that the French are a frogeating people who wear wooden shoes
We are credibly informed in reference to the nation whom this choice spirit so happily disposed of that the caricatures and stage representations which were current in England some half a century ago exactly depict their present condition
For example we understand that every Frenchman without exception wears a pigtail and curlpapers
That he is extremely sallow thin long faced and lanternjawed
That the calves of his legs are invariably undeveloped that his legs fail at the knees and that his shoulders are always higher than his ears
We are likewise assured that he rarely tastes any food but soup maigre and an onion that he always says By Gar
Aha
Vat you tell me sare
at the end of every sentence he utters and that the true generic name of his race is the Mounseers or the Parlyvoos
If he be not a dancingmaster or a barber he must be a cook since no other trades but those three are congenial to the tastes of the people or permitted by the Institutions of the country
He is a slave of course
The ladies of France who are also slaves invariably have their heads tied up in Belcher handkerchiefs wear long earrings carry tambourines and beguile the weariness of their yoke by singing in head voices through their noses  principally to barrel organs
It may be generally summed up of this inferior people that they have no idea of anything
Of a great Institution like Smithfield they are unable to form the least conception
A Beast Market in the heart of Paris would be regarded an impossible nuisance
Nor have they any notion of slaughterhouses in the midst of a city
One of these benighted frogeaters would scarcely understand your meaning if you told him of the existence of such a British bulwark
It is agreeable and perhaps pardonable to indulge in a little selfcomplacency when our right to it is thoroughly established
At the present time to be rendered memorable by a final attack on that good old market which is the rotten apple of the Corporations eye let us compare ourselves to our national delight and pride as to these two subjects of slaughterhouse and beastmarket with the outlandish foreigner
The blessings of Smithfield are too well understood to need recapitulation all who run away from mad bulls and pursuing oxen may read
Any marketday they may be beheld in glorious action
Possibly the merits of our slaughterhouses are not yet quite so generally appreciated
Slaughterhouses in the large towns of England are always with the exception of one or two enterprising towns most numerous in the most densely crowded places where there is the least circulation of air
They are often underground in cellars they are sometimes in close back yards sometimes as in Spitalfields in the very shops where the meat is sold
Occasionally under good private management they are ventilated and clean
For the most part they are unventilated and dirty and to the reeking walls putrid fat and other offensive animal matter clings with a tenacious hold
The busiest slaughterhouses in London are in the neighbourhood of Smithfield in Newgate Market in Whitechapel in Newport Market in Leadenhall Market in Clare Market
All these places are surrounded by houses of a poor description swarming with inhabitants
Some of them are close to the worst burial grounds in London
When the slaughterhouse is below the ground it is a common practice to throw the sheep down areas neck and crop  which is exciting but not at all cruel
When it is on the level surface it is often extremely difficult of approach
Then the beasts have to be worried and goaded and pronged and tail twisted for a long time before they can be got in  which is entirely owing to their natural obstinacy
When it is not difficult of approach but is in a foul condition what they see and scent makes them still more reluctant to enter  which is their natural obstinacy again
When they do get in at last after no trouble and suffering to speak of for there is nothing in the previous journey into the heart of London the nights endurance in Smithfield the struggle out again among the crowded multitude the coaches carts waggons omnibuses gigs chaises phaetons cabs trucks dogs boys whoopings roarings and ten thousand other distractions they are represented to be in a most unfit state to be killed according to microscopic examinations made of their fevered blood by one of the most distinguished physiologists in the world PROFESSOR OWEN  but thats humbug
When they ARE killed at last their reeking carcases are hung in impure air to become as the same Professor will explain to you less nutritious and more unwholesome  but he is only an UNcommon counsellor so dont mind HIM
In half a quarter of a miles length of Whitechapel at one time there shall be six hundred newly slaughtered oxen hanging up and seven hundred sheep  but the more the merrier  proof of prosperity
Hard by Snow Hill and Warwick Lane you shall see the little children inured to sights of brutality from their birth trotting along the alleys mingled with troops of horribly busy pigs up to their ankles in blood  but it makes the young rascals hardy
Into the imperfect sewers of this overgrown city you shall have the immense mass of corruption engendered by these practices lazily thrown out of sight to rise in poisonous gases into your house at night when your sleeping children will most readily absorb them and to find its languid way at last into the river that you drink  but the French are a frogeating people who wear wooden shoes and its O the roast beef of England my boy the jolly old English roast beef
It is quite a mistake  a newfangled notion altogether  to suppose that there is any natural antagonism between putrefaction and health
They know better than that in the Common Council
You may talk about Nature in her wisdom always warning man through his sense of smell when he draws near to something dangerous but that wont go down in the City
Nature very often dont mean anything
Mrs Quickly says that prunes are ill for a green wound but whosoever says that putrid animal substances are ill for a green wound or for robust vigour or for anything or for anybody is a humanitymonger and a humbug
Britons never never never c therefore
And prosperity to cattledriving cattle slaughtering bonecrushing bloodboiling trotterscraping tripedressing paunchcleaning gutspinning hidepreparing tallowmelting and other salubrious proceedings in the midst of hospitals churchyards workhouses schools infirmaries refuges dwellings provisionshops nurseries sickbeds every stage and baitingplace in the journey from birth to death
These UNcommon counsellors your Professor Owens and fellows will contend that to tolerate these things in a civilised city is to reduce it to a worse condition than BRUCE found to prevail in ABYSSINIA
For there say they the jackals and wild dogs came at night to devour the offal whereas here there are no such natural scavengers and quite as savage customs
Further they will demonstrate that nothing in Nature is intended to be wasted and that besides the waste which such abuses occasion in the articles of health and life  main sources of the riches of any community  they lead to a prodigious waste of changing matters which might with proper preparation and under scientific direction be safely applied to the increase of the fertility of the land
Thus they argue does Nature ever avenge infractions of her beneficent laws and so surely as Man is determined to warp any of her blessings into curses shall they become curses and shall he suffer heavily
But this is cant
Just as it is cant of the worst description to say to the London Corporation How can you exhibit to the people so plain a spectacle of dishonest equivocation as to claim the right of holding a market in the midst of the great city for one of your vested privileges when you know that when your last market holding charter was granted to you by King Charles the First Smithfield stood IN THE SUBURBS OF LONDON and is in that very charter so described in those five words
 which is certainly true but has nothing to do with the question
Now to the comparison in these particulars of civilisation between the capital of England and the capital of that frogeating and woodenshoe wearing country which the illustrious Common Councilman so sarcastically settled
In Paris there is no Cattle Market
Cows and calves are sold within the city but the Cattle Markets are at Poissy about thirteen miles off on a line of railway and at Sceaux about five miles off
The Poissy market is held every Thursday the Sceaux market every Monday
In Paris there are no slaughterhouses in our acceptation of the term
There are five public Abattoirs  within the walls though in the suburbs  and in these all the slaughtering for the city must be performed
They are managed by a Syndicat or Guild of Butchers who confer with the Minister of the Interior on all matters affecting the trade and who are consulted when any new regulations are contemplated for its government
They are likewise under the vigilant superintendence of the police
Every butcher must be licensed which proves him at once to be a slave for we dont license butchers in England  we only license apothecaries attorneys postmasters publicans hawkers retailers of tobacco snuff pepper and vinegar  and one or two other little trades not worth mentioning
Every arrangement in connexion with the slaughtering and sale of meat is matter of strict police regulation
Slavery again though we certainly have a general sort of Police Act here
But in order that the reader may understand what a monument of folly these frogeaters have raised in their abattoirs and cattle markets and may compare it with what common counselling has done for us all these years and would still do but for the innovating spirit of the times here follows a short account of a recent visit to these places It was as sharp a February morning as you would desire to feel at your fingers ends when I turned out  tumbling over a chiffonier with his little basket and rake who was picking up the bits of coloured paper that had been swept out overnight from a BonBon shop  to take the Butchers Train to Poissy
A cold dim light just touched the high roofs of the Tuileries which have seen such changes such distracted crowds such riot and bloodshed and they looked as calm and as old all covered with white frost as the very Pyramids
There was not light enough yet to strike upon the towers of Notre Dame across the water but I thought of the dark pavement of the old Cathedral as just beginning to be streaked with grey and of the lamps in the House of God the Hospital close to it burning low and being quenched and of the keeper of the Morgue going about with a fading lantern busy in the arrangement of his terrible waxwork for another sunny day
The sun was up and shining merrily when the butchers and I announcing our departure with an engine shriek to sleepy Paris rattled away for the Cattle Market
Across the country over the Seine among a forest of scrubby trees  the hoar frost lying cold in shady places and glittering in the light  and here we are  at Poissy
Out leap the butchers who have been chattering all the way like madmen and off they straggle for the Cattle Market still chattering of course incessantly in hats and caps of all shapes in coats and blouses in calfskins cowskins horse skins furs shaggy mantles hairy coats sacking baize oilskin anything you please that will keep a man and a butcher warm upon a frosty morning
Many a French town have I seen between this spot of ground and Strasburg or Marseilles that might sit for your picture little Poissy
Barring the details of your old church I know you well albeit we make acquaintance now for the first time
I know your narrow straggling winding streets with a kennel in the midst and lamps slung across
I know your picturesque streetcorners winding uphill Heaven knows why or where
I know your tradesmens inscriptions in letters not quite fat enough your barbers brazen basins dangling over little shops your Cafes and Estaminets with cloudy bottles of stale syrup in the windows and pictures of crossed billiard cues outside
I know this identical grey horse with his tail rolled up in a knot like the back hair of an untidy woman who wont be shod and who makes himself heraldic by clattering across the street on his hindlegs while twenty voices shriek and growl at him as a Brigand an accursed Robber and an everlastinglydoomed Pig
I know your sparkling townfountain too my Poissy and am glad to see it near a cattlemarket gushing so freshly under the auspices of a gallant little sublimated Frenchman wrought in metal perched upon the top
Through all the land of France I know this unswept room at The Glory with its peculiar smell of beans and coffee where the butchers crowd about the stove drinking the thinnest of wine from the smallest of tumblers where the thickest of coffeecups mingle with the longest of loaves and the weakest of lump sugar where Madame at the counter easily acknowledges the homage of all entering and departing butchers where the billiardtable is covered up in the midst like a great birdcake  but the bird may sing byandby
A bell
The Calf Market
Polite departure of butchers
Hasty payment and departure on the part of amateur Visitor
Madame reproaches Maamselle for too fine a susceptibility in reference to the devotion of a Butcher in a bearskin
Monsieur the landlord of The Glory counts a double handful of sous without an unobliterated inscription or an undamaged crowned head among them
There is little noise without abundant space and no confusion
The open area devoted to the market is divided into three portions the Calf Market the Cattle Market the Sheep Market
Calves at eight cattle at ten sheep at midday
All is very clean
The Calf Market is a raised platform of stone some three or four feet high open on all sides with a lofty overspreading roof supported on stone columns which give it the appearance of a sort of vineyard from Northern Italy
Here on the raised pavement lie innumerable calves all bound hindlegs and forelegs together and all trembling violently  perhaps with cold perhaps with fear perhaps with pain for this mode of tying which seems to be an absolute superstition with the peasantry can hardly fail to cause great suffering
Here they lie patiently in rows among the straw with their stolid faces and inexpressive eyes superintended by men and women boys and girls here they are inspected by our friends the butchers bargained for and bought
Plenty of time plenty of room plenty of good humour
Monsieur Francois in the bearskin how do you do my friend
You come from Paris by the train
The fresh air does you good
If you are in want of three or four fine calves this market morning my angel I Madame Doche shall be happy to deal with you
Behold these calves Monsieur Francois
Great Heaven you are doubtful
Well sir walk round and look about you
If you find better for the money buy them
If not come to me
Monsieur Francois goes his way leisurely and keeps a wary eye upon the stock
No other butcher jostles Monsieur Francois Monsieur Francois jostles no other butcher
Nobody is flustered and aggravated
Nobody is savage
In the midst of the country blue frocks and red handkerchiefs and the butchers coats shaggy furry and hairy of calfskin cowskin horseskin and bearskin towers a cocked hat and a blue cloak
Slavery
For OUR Police wear greatcoats and glazed hats
But now the bartering is over and the calves are sold
Ho
Gregoire Antoine Jean Louis
Bring up the carts my children
Quick brave infants
Hola
Hi
The carts well littered with straw are backed up to the edge of the raised pavement and various hot infants carry calves upon their heads and dexterously pitch them in while other hot infants standing in the carts arrange the calves and pack them carefully in straw
Here is a promising young calf not sold whom Madame Doche unbinds
Pardon me Madame Doche but I fear this mode of tying the four legs of a quadruped together though strictly a la mode is not quite right
You observe Madame Doche that the cord leaves deep indentations in the skin and that the animal is so cramped at first as not to know or even remotely suspect that HE is unbound until you are so obliging as to kick him in your delicate little way and pull his tail like a bell rope
Then he staggers to his knees not being able to stand and stumbles about like a drunken calf or the horse at Franconis whom you may have seen Madame Doche who is supposed to have been mortally wounded in battle
But what is this rubbing against me as I apostrophise Madame Doche
It is another heated infant with a calf upon his head
Pardon Monsieur but will you have the politeness to allow me to pass
Ah sir willingly
I am vexed to obstruct the way
On he staggers calf and all and makes no allusion whatever either to my eyes or limbs
Now the carts are all full
More straw my Antoine to shake over these top rows then off we will clatter rumble jolt and rattle a long row of us out of the first towngate and out at the second towngate and past the empty sentrybox and the little thin square bandbox of a guardhouse where nobody seems to live and away for Paris by the paved road lying a straight straight line in the long long avenue of trees
We can neither choose our road nor our pace for that is all prescribed to us
The public convenience demands that our carts should get to Paris by such a route and no other Napoleon had leisure to find that out while he had a little war with the world upon his hands and woe betide us if we infringe orders
Drovers of oxen stand in the Cattle Market tied to iron bars fixed into posts of granite
Other droves advance slowly down the long avenue past the second towngate and the first towngate and the sentrybox and the bandbox thawing the morning with their smoky breath as they come along
Plenty of room plenty of time
Neither man nor beast is driven out of his wits by coaches carts waggons omnibuses gigs chaises phaetons cabs trucks boys whoopings roarings and multitudes
No tailtwisting is necessary  no iron pronging is necessary
There are no iron prongs here
The market for cattle is held as quietly as the market for calves
In due time off the cattle go to Paris the drovers can no more choose their road nor their time nor the numbers they shall drive than they can choose their hour for dying in the course of nature
Sheep next
The sheeppens are up here past the Branch Bank of Paris established for the convenience of the butchers and behind the two pretty fountains they are making in the Market
My name is Bull yet I think I should like to see as good twin fountains  not to say in Smithfield but in England anywhere
Plenty of room plenty of time
And here are sheepdogs sensible as ever but with a certain French air about them  not without a suspicion of dominoes  with a kind of flavour of moustache and beard  demonstrative dogs shaggy and loose where an English dog would be tight and close  not so troubled with business calculations as our English drovers dogs who have always got their sheep upon their minds and think about their work even resting as you may see by their faces but dashing showy rather unreliable dogs who might worry me instead of their legitimate charges if they saw occasion  and might see it somewhat suddenly
The market for sheep passes off like the other two and away they go by THEIR allotted road to Paris
My way being the Railway I make the best of it at twenty miles an hour whirling through the now highlighted landscape thinking that the inexperienced green buds will be wishing before long they had not been tempted to come out so soon and wondering who lives in this or that chateau all window and lattice and what the family may have for breakfast this sharp morning
After the Market comes the Abattoir
What abattoir shall I visit first
Montmartre is the largest
So I will go there
The abattoirs are all within the walls of Paris with an eye to the receipt of the octroi duty but they stand in open places in the suburbs removed from the press and bustle of the city
They are managed by the Syndicat or Guild of Butchers under the inspection of the Police
Certain smaller items of the revenue derived from them are in part retained by the Guild for the payment of their expenses and in part devoted by it to charitable purposes in connexion with the trade
They cost six hundred and eighty thousand pounds and they return to the city of Paris an interest on that outlay amounting to nearly six and ahalf per cent
Here in a sufficiently dismantled space is the Abattoir of Montmartre covering nearly nine acres of ground surrounded by a high wall and looking from the outside like a cavalry barrack
At the iron gates is a small functionary in a large cocked hat
Monsieur desires to see the abattoir
Most certainly
State being inconvenient in private transactions and Monsieur being already aware of the cocked hat the functionary puts it into a little official bureau which it almost fills and accompanies me in the modest attire  as to his head  of ordinary life
Many of the animals from Poissy have come here
On the arrival of each drove it was turned into yonder ample space where each butcher who had bought selected his own purchases
Some we see now in these long perspectives of stalls with a high overhanging roof of wood and open tiles rising above the walls
While they rest here before being slaughtered they are required to be fed and watered and the stalls must be kept clean
A stated amount of fodder must always be ready in the loft above and the supervision is of the strictest kind
The same regulations apply to sheep and calves for which portions of these perspectives are strongly railed off
All the buildings are of the strongest and most solid description
After traversing these lairs through which besides the upper provision for ventilation just mentioned there may be a thorough current of air from opposite windows in the side walls and from doors at either end we traverse the broad paved courtyard until we come to the slaughterhouses
They are all exactly alike and adjoin each other to the number of eight or nine together in blocks of solid building
Let us walk into the first
It is firmly built and paved with stone
It is well lighted thoroughly aired and lavishly provided with fresh water
It has two doors opposite each other the first the door by which I entered from the main yard the second which is opposite opening on another smaller yard where the sheep and calves are killed on benches
The pavement of that yard I see slopes downward to a gutter for its being more easily cleansed
The slaughterhouse is fifteen feet high sixteen feet and ahalf wide and thirtythree feet long
It is fitted with a powerful windlass by which one man at the handle can bring the head of an ox down to the ground to receive the blow from the poleaxe that is to fell him  with the means of raising the carcass and keeping it suspended during the afteroperation of dressing  and with hooks on which carcasses can hang when completely prepared without touching the walls
Upon the pavement of this first stone chamber lies an ox scarcely dead
If I except the blood draining from him into a little stone well in a corner of the pavement the place is free from offence as the Place de la Concorde
It is infinitely purer and cleaner I know my friend the functionary than the Cathedral of Notre Dame
Ha ha
Monsieur is pleasant but truly there is reason too in what he says
I look into another of these slaughterhouses
Pray enter says a gentleman in bloody boots
This is a calf I have killed this morning
Having a little time upon my hands I have cut and punctured this lace pattern in the coats of his stomach
It is pretty enough
I did it to divert myself
 It is beautiful Monsieur the slaughterer
He tells me I have the gentility to say so
I look into rows of slaughterhouses
In many retail dealers who have come here for the purpose are making bargains for meat
There is killing enough certainly to satiate an unused eye and there are steaming carcasses enough to suggest the expediency of a fowl and salad for dinner but everywhere there is an orderly clean wellsystematised routine of work in progress  horrible work at the best if you please but so much the greater reason why it should be made the best of
I dont know I think I have observed my name is Bull that a Parisian of the lowest order is particularly delicate or that his nature is remarkable for an infinitesimal infusion of ferocity but I do know my potent grave and common counselling Signors that he is forced when at this work to submit himself to a thoroughly good system and to make an Englishman very heartily ashamed of you
Here within the walls of the same abattoir in other roomy and commodious buildings are a place for converting the fat into tallow and packing it for market  a place for cleansing and scalding calves heads and sheeps feet  a place for preparing tripe  stables and coachhouses for the butchers  innumerable conveniences aiding in the diminution of offensiveness to its lowest possible point and the raising of cleanliness and supervision to their highest
Hence all the meat that goes out of the gate is sent away in clean covered carts
And if every trade connected with the slaughtering of animals were obliged by law to be carried on in the same place I doubt my friend now reinstated in the cocked hat whose civility these two francs imperfectly acknowledge but appear munificently to repay whether there could be better regulations than those which are carried out at the Abattoir of Montmartre
Adieu my friend for I am away to the other side of Paris to the Abattoir of Grenelle
And there I find exactly the same thing on a smaller scale with the addition of a magnificent Artesian well and a different sort of conductor in the person of a neat little woman with neat little eyes and a neat little voice who picks her neat little way among the bullocks in a very neat little pair of shoes and stockings
Such is the Monument of French Folly which a foreigneering people have erected in a national hatred and antipathy for common counselling wisdom
That wisdom assembled in the City of London having distinctly refused after a debate of three days long and by a majority of nearly seven to one to associate itself with any Metropolitan Cattle Market unless it be held in the midst of the City it follows that we shall lose the inestimable advantages of common counselling protection and be thrown for a market on our own wretched resources
In all human probability we shall thus come at last to erect a monument of folly very like this French monument
If that be done the consequences are obvious
The leather trade will be ruined by the introduction of American timber to be manufactured into shoes for the fallen English the Lord Mayor will be required by the popular voice to live entirely on frogs and both these changes will how is not at present quite clear but certainly somehow or other fall on that unhappy landed interest which is always being killed yet is always found to be alive  and kicking
