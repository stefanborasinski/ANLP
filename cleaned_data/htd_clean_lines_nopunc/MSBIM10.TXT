BY A BABYS HAND Miss BillyMarried  CHAPTER I SOME OPINIONS AND A WEDDING I Bertram take thee Billy chanted the whiterobed clergyman
 I Bertram take thee Billy  echoed the tall young bridegroom his eyes gravely tender
To my wedded wife
 To my wedded wife
 The bridegrooms voice shook a little
To have and to hold from this day forward
 To have and to hold from this day forward
 Now the young voice rang with triumph
It had grown strong and steady
For better for worse
 For better for worse
 For richer for poorer droned the clergyman with the weariness of uncounted repetitions
 For richer for poorer  avowed the bridegroom with the decisive emphasis of one to whom the words are new and significant
In sickness and in health
 In sickness and in health
 To love and to cherish
 To love and to cherish
 The younger voice carried infinite tenderness now
Till death us do part
 Till death us do part  repeated the bridegrooms lips but everybody knew that what his heart said was Now and through all eternity
According to Gods holy ordinance
 According to Gods holy ordinance
 And thereto I plight thee my troth
 And thereto I plight thee my troth
 There was a faint stir in the room
In one corner a whitehaired woman blinked tearwet eyes and pulled a fleecy white shawl more closely about her shoulders
Then the ministers voice sounded again
I Billy take thee Bertram
 I Billy take thee Bertram
 This time the echoing voice was a feminine one low and sweet but clearly distinct and vibrant with joyous confidence on through one after another of the ever familiar but ever impressive phrases of the service that gives into the hands of one man and of one woman the future happiness each of the other
The wedding was at noon
That evening Mrs Kate Hartwell sister of the bridegroom wrote the following letter BOSTON July 15th
MY DEAR HUSBANDWell its all over with and theyre married
I couldnt do one thing to prevent it
Much as ever as they would even listen to what I had to sayand when they knew how I had hurried East to say it too with only two hours notice
But then what can you expect
From time immemorial lovers never did have any sense and when those lovers are such irresponsible flutterbudgets as Billy and Bertram
And such a wedding
I couldnt do anything with that either though I tried hard
They had it in Billys livingroom at noon with nothing but the sun for light
There was no maid of honor no bridesmaids no wedding cake no wedding veil no presents except from the family and from that ridiculous Chinese cook of brother Williams Ding Dong or whatever his name is
He tore in just before the wedding ceremony and insisted upon seeing Billy to give her a wretched little green stone idol which he declared would bring her heap plenty velly good luckee if she received it before she got married
I wouldnt have the hideous grinning thing around but William says its real jade and very valuable and of course Billy was crazy over itor pretended to be
There was no trousseau either and no reception
There was no anything but the bridegroom and when I tell you that Billy actually declared that was all she wanted you will understand how absurdly in love she isin spite of all those weeks and weeks of broken engagement when I at least supposed she had come to her senses until I got that crazy note from Bertram a week ago saying they were to be married today
I cant say that Ive got any really satisfactory explanation of the matter
Everything has been in such a hubbub and those two ridiculous children have been so afraid they wouldnt be together every minute possible that any really rational conversation with either of them was out of the question
When Billy broke the engagement last spring none of us knew why she had done it as you know and I fancy we shall be almost as much in the dark as to why she hasermended it now as you might say
As near as I can make out however she thought he didnt want her and he thought she didnt want him
I believe matters were still further complicated by a girl Bertram was painting and a young fellow that used to sing with Billya Mr Arkwright
Anyhow things came to a head last spring Billy broke the engagement and fled to parts unknown with Aunt Hannah leaving Bertram here in Boston to alternate between stony despair and reckless gayety according to William and it was while he was in the latter mood that he had that awful automobile accident and broke his arm and almost his neck
He was wildly delirious and called continually for Billy
Well it seems Billy didnt know all this but a week ago she came home and in some way found out about it I think through PeteWilliams old butler you know
Just exactly what happened I cant say but I do know that she dragged poor old Aunt Hannah down to Bertrams at some unearthly hour and in the rain and Aunt Hannah couldnt do a thing with her
All Billy would say was Bertram wants me
And Aunt Hannah told me that if I could have seen Billys face Id have known that shed have gone to Bertram then if hed been at the top of the Himalaya Mountains or at the bottom of the China Sea
So perhaps its just as wellfor Aunt Hannahs sake at leastthat he was in no worse place than on his own couch at home
Anyhow she went and in half an hour they blandly informed Aunt Hannah that they were going to be married today
Aunt Hannah said she tried to stop that and get them to put it off till October the original date you know but Bertram was obdurate
And when he declared hed marry her the next day if it wasnt for the new license law Aunt Hannah said she gave up for fear hed get a special dispensation or go to the Governor or the President or do some other dreadful thing
What a funny old soul Aunt Hannah is
Bertram told me that he should never feel safe till Billy was really his that shed read something or hear something or think something or get a letter from me as if anything I could say would do any goodor harm
 and so break the engagement again
Well shes his now so I suppose hes satisfied though for my part I havent changed my mind at all
I still say that they are not one bit suited to each other and that matrimony will simply ruin his career
Bertram never has loved and never will love any girl longexcept to paint
But if he simply would get married why couldnt he have taken a nice sensible domestic girl that would have kept him fed and mended
Not but that Im very fond of Billy as you know dear but imagine Billy as a wifeworse yet a mother
Billys a dear girl but she knows about as much of real life and its problems as as our little Kate
A more impulsive irresponsible regardlessofconsequences young woman I never saw
She can play divinely and write delightful songs Ill acknowledge but what is that when a man is hungry or has lost a button
Billy has had her own way and had everything she wanted for years nowa rather dangerous preparation for marriage especially marriage to a fellow like Bertram who has had his own way and everything hes wanted for years
Pray whats going to happen when those ways conflict and neither one gets the thing wanted
And think of her ignorance of cookingbut there
Whats the use
Theyre married now and it cant be helped
Mercy what a letter Ive written
But I had to talk to some one besides Id promised I to let you know how matters stood as soon as I could
As you see though my trip East has been practically useless
I saw the wedding to be sure but I didnt prevent it or even postpone itthough I meant to do one or the other else I should never have made that tiresome journey half across the continent at two hours notice
However we shall see what we shall see
As for me Im dead tired
Good night
Affectionately yours KATE
Quite naturally Mrs Kate Hartwell was not the only one who was thinking that evening of the wedding
In the home of Bertrams brother Cyril Cyril himself was at the piano but where his thoughts were was plain to be seenor rather heard for from under his fingers there came the Lohengrin wedding march until all the room seemed filled with the scent of orange blossoms the mistiness of floating veils and the echoing peals of faraway organs heralding the Fair Bride and Groom
Over by the table in the glowing circle of the shaded lamp sat Marie Cyrils wife a dainty sewingbasket by her side
Her hands however lay idly across the stocking in her lap
As the music ceased she drew a long sigh
What a perfectly beautiful wedding that was
she breathed
Cyril whirled about on the piano stool
It was a very sensible wedding he said with emphasis
They looked so happyboth of them went on Marie dreamily soso sort of above and beyond everything about them as if nothing ever ever could trouble themnow
Cyril lifted his eyebrows
Humph
Well as I said before it was a very sensible wedding he declared
This time Marie noticed the emphasis
She laughed though her eyes looked a little troubled
I know dear of course what you mean
I thought our wedding was beautiful but I would have made it simpler if Id realized in time how youyou How I abhorred pink teas and purple pageants he finished for her with a frowning smile
Oh well I stood itfor the sake of what it brought me
His face showed now only the smile the frown had vanished
For a man known for years to his friends as a hater of women and all other confusion Cyril Henshaw was looking remarkably wellpleased with himself
His wife of less than a year colored as she met his gaze
Hurriedly she picked up her needle
The man laughed happily at her confusion
What are you doing
Is that my stocking
he demanded
A look half pain half reproach crossed her face
Why Cyril of course not
Youyou told me not to long ago
You said my darns made bunches
Ho
I meant I didnt want to wear them retorted the man upon whom the tragic wretchedness of that halfsobbed bunches had been quite lost
I love to see you mending them he finished with an approving glance at the pretty little picture of domesticity before him
A peculiar expression came to Maries eyes
Why Cyril you mean you like to have me mend them just forfor the sake of seeing me do it when you know you wont ever wear them
Sure
nodded the man imperturbably
Then with a sudden laugh he asked I wonder now does Billy love to mend socks
Marie smiled but she sighed too and shook her head
Im afraid not Cyril
Nor cook
Marie laughed outright this time
The vaguely troubled look had fled from her eyes Oh Billys helped me beat eggs and butter sometimes but I never knew her to cook a thing or want to cook a thing but once then she spent nearly two weeks trying to learn to make puddingsfor you
For me Marie puckered her lips queerly
Well I supposed they were for you at the time
At all events she was trying to make them for some one of you boys probably it was really for Bertram though
Humph
grunted Cyril
Then after a minute he observed I judge Kate thinks Billyll never make themfor anybody
Im afraid Sister Kate isnt pleased
Oh but Mrs Hartwell waswas disappointed in the wedding apologized Marie quickly
You know she wanted it put off anyway and she didnt like such a simple one
Hmm as usual Sister Kate forgot it wasnt her funeralI mean her wedding retorted Cyril dryly
Kate is never happy you know unless shes managing things
Yes I know nodded Marie with a frowning smile of recollection at certain features of her own wedding
She doesnt approve of Billys taste in guests either remarked Cyril after a moments silence
I thought her guests were lovely spoke up Marie in quick defense
Of course most of her social friends are awayin July but Billy is never a society girl you know in spite of the way Society is always trying to lionize her and Bertram
Oh of course Kate knows that but she says it seems as if Billy neednt have gone out and gathered in the lame and the halt and the blind
Nonsense
cried Marie with unusual sharpness for her
I suppose she said that just because of Mrs Greggorys and Tommy Dunns crutches
Well they didnt make a real festivelooking wedding party you must admit laughed Cyril what with the bridegrooms own arm in a sling too
But who were they all anyway
Why you knew Mrs Greggory and Alice of courseand Pete smiled Marie
And wasnt Pete happy
Billy says shed have had Pete if she had no one else that there wouldnt have been any wedding anyway if it hadnt been for his telephoning Aunt Hannah that night
Yes Will told me
As for Tommy and the othersmost of them were those people that Billy had at her home last summer for a two weeks vacation people you know too poor to give themselves one and too proud to accept one from ordinary charity
Billys been following them up and doing little things for them ever sincesugarplums and frosting on their cake she calls it and they adore her of course
I think it was lovely of her to have them and they did have such a good time
You should have seen Tommy when you played that wedding march for Billy to enter the room
His poor little face was so transfigured with joy that I almost cried just to look at him
Billy says he loves musicpoor little fellow
Well I hope theyll be happy in spite of Kates doleful prophecies
Certainly they looked happy enough today declared Cyril patting a yawn as he rose to his feet
I fancy Will and Aunt Hannah are lonesome though about now he added
Yes smiled Marie mistily as she gathered up her work
I know what Aunt Hannahs doing
Shes helping Rosa put the house to rights and shes stopping to cry over every slipper and handkerchief of Billys she finds
And shell do that until that funny clock of hers strikes twelve then shell say Oh my grief and consciencemidnight
But the next minute shell remember that its only halfpast eleven after all and shell send Rosa to bed and sit patting Billys slipper in her lap till it really is midnight by all the other clocks
Cyril laughed appreciatively
Well I know what Will is doing he declared
Will is in Bertrams den dozing before the fireplace with Spunkie curled up in his lap
As it happened both these surmises were not far from right
In the Strata the Henshaws old Beacon Street home William was sitting before the fireplace with the cat in his lap but he was not dozing
He was talking
Spunkie he was saying your master Bertram got married todayand to Miss Billy
Hell be bringing her home one of these daysyour new mistress
And such a mistress
Never did cat or house have a better
Just think for the first time in years this old place is to know the touch of a womans hand and thats what it hasnt known for almost twenty years except for those few short months six years ago when a darkeyed girl and a little gray kitten that was Spunk your predecessor you know blew in and blew out again before we scarcely knew they were here
That girl was Miss Billy and she was a dear then just as she is now only now shes coming here to stay
Shes coming home Spunkie and shell make it a home for you for me and for all of us
Up to now you know it hasnt really been a home for yearsjust us men so
Itll be very different Spunkie as youll soon find out
Now mind madam
We must show that we appreciate all this no tempers no tantrums no showing of claws no leaving our coatseither yours or mineon the drawingroom chairs no tracking in of mud on clean rugs and floors
For were going to have a home Spunkiea home
At Hillside Aunt Hannah was indeed helping Rosa to put the house to rights as Marie had said
She was crying too over a glove she had found on Billys piano but she was crying over something else also
Not only had she lost Billy but she had lost her home
To be sure nothing had been said during that nightmare of a week of hurry and confusion about Aunt Hannahs future but Aunt Hannah knew very well how it must be
This dear little house on the side of Corey Hill was Billys home and Billy would not need it any longer
It would be sold of course and she Aunt Hannah would go back to a secondstory front and loneliness in some Back Bay boardinghouse and a second story front and loneliness would not be easy now after these years of homeand Billy
No wonder indeed that Aunt Hannah sat crying and patting the little white glove in her hand
No wonder too thatbeing Aunt Hannah she reached for the shawl near by and put it on shiveringly
Even July tonight was coldto Aunt Hannah
In yet another home that evening was the wedding of Billy Neilson and Bertram Henshaw uppermost in thought and speech
In a certain little SouthEnd flat where in two rented rooms lived Alice Greggory and her crippled mother Alice was talking to Mr M J Arkwright commonly known to his friends as Mary Jane owing to the mystery in which he had for so long shrouded his name
Arkwright tonight was plainly moody and ill at ease
Youre not listening
Youre not listening at all complained Alice Greggory at last reproachfully
With a visible effort the man roused himself
Indeed I am he maintained
I thought youd be interested in the wedding
You used to be friendsyou and Billy
The girls voice still vibrated with reproach
There was a moments silence then a little harshly the man said Perhapsbecause I wanted to be more thana friendis why youre not satisfied with my interest now
A look that was almost terror came to Alice Greggorys eyes
She flushed painfully then grew very white
You mean Yes he nodded dully without looking up
I cared too much for her
I supposed Henshaw was just a friendtill too late
There was a breathless hush before a little unsteadily the girl stammered Oh Im so sorryso very sorry
II didnt know
No of course you didnt
Ive almost told you though lots of times youve been so good to me all these weeks
He raised his head now and looked at her frank comradeship in his eyes
The girl stirred restlessly
Her eyes swerved a little under his level gaze
Oh but Ive done nothingnnothing she stammered
Then at the light tap of crutches on a bare floor she turned in obvious relief
Oh heres mother
Shes been in visiting with Mrs Delano our landlady
Mother Mr Arkwright is here
Meanwhile speeding north as fast as steam could carry them were the bride and groom
The wondrousness of the first hour of their journey side by side had become a joyous certitude that always it was to be like this now
Bertram began the bride after a long minute of eloquent silence
Yes love
You know our wedding was very different from most weddings
Of course it was
Yes but really it was
Now listen
The brides voice grew tenderly earnest
I think our marriage is going to be different too
Different
Yes
Billys tone was emphatic
There are so many common everyday marriages where where Why Bertram as if you could ever be to me likelike Mr Carleton is for instance
Like Mr Carleton isto you
Bertrams voice was frankly puzzled
No no
As Mr Carleton is to Mrs Carleton I mean
Oh
Bertram subsided in relief
And the Grahams and Whartons and the Freddie Agnews andand a lot of others
Why Bertram Ive seen the Grahams and the Whartons not even speak to each other a whole evening when theyve been at a dinner or something and Ive seen Mrs Carleton not even seem to know her husband came into the room
I dont mean quarrel dear
Of course wed never quarrel But I mean Im sure we shall never get used toto you being you and I being I
Indeed we shant agreed Bertram rapturously
Ours is going to be such a beautiful marriage
Of course it will be
And well be so happy
I shall be and I shall try to make you so
As if I could be anything else sighed Billy blissfully
And now we cant have any misunderstandings you see
Of course not
Erwhats that
Why I mean thatthat we cant ever repeat hose miserable weeks of misunderstanding
Everything is all explained up
I know now that you dont love Miss Winthrop or just girls any girlto paint
You love me
Not the tilt of my chin nor the turn of my head but me
I dojust you
Bertrams eyes gave the caress his lips would have given had it not been for the presence of the man in the seat across the aisle of the sleepingcar
And youyou know now that I love you just you
Not even Arkwright
Not even Arkwright smiled Billy
There was the briefest of hesitations then a little constrainedly Bertram asked And you said youyou never had cared for Arkwright didnt you
For the second time in her life Billy was thankful that Bertrams question had turned upon her love for Arkwright not Arkwrights love for her
In Billys opinion a mans unrequited love for a girl was his secret not hers and was certainly one that the girl had no right to tell
Once before Bertram had asked her if she had ever cared for Arkwright and then she had answered emphatically as she did now Never dear
I thought you said so murmured Bertram relaxing a little
I did besides didnt I tell you
she went on airily I think hell marry Alice Greggory
Alice wrote me all the time I was away and oh she didnt say anything definite Ill admit confessed Billy with an arch smile but she spoke of his being there lots and they used to know each other years ago you see
There was almost a romance there I think before the Greggorys lost their money and moved away from all their friends
Well he may have her
Shes a nice girl a mighty nice girl answered Bertram with the unmistakably satisfied air of the man who knows he himself possesses the nicest girl of them all
Billy reading unerringly the triumph in his voice grew suddenly grave
She regarded her husband with a thoughtful frown then she drew a profound sigh
Whew
laughed Bertram whimsically
So soon as this
Bertram
Billys voice was tragic
Yes my love
The bridegroom pulled his face into sobriety then Billy spoke with solemn impressiveness
Bertram I dont know a thing about cookingexcept what Ive been learning in Rosas cookbook this last week
Bertram laughed so loud that the man across the aisle glanced over the top of his paper surreptitiously
Rosas cookbook
Is that what you were doing all this week
Yes that isI tried so hard to learn something stammered Billy
But Im afraid I didntmuch there were so many things for me to think of you know with only a week
I believe I could make peach fritters though
They were the last thing I studied
Bertram laughed again uproariously but at Billys unchangingly tragic face he grew suddenly very grave and tender
Billy dear I didnt marry you toto get a cook he said gently
Billy shook her head
I know but Aunt Hannah said that even if I never expected to cook myself I ought to know how it was done so to properly oversee it
She said thatthat no woman who didnt know how to cook and keep house properly had any business to be a wife
And Bertram I did try honestly all this week
I tried so hard to remember when you sponged bread and when you kneaded it
I dont ever needyours cut in Bertram shamelessly but he got only a deservedly stern glance in return
And I repeated over and over again how many cupfuls of flour and pinches of salt and spoonfuls of bakingpowder went into things but Bertram I simply could not keep my mind on it
Everything everywhere was singing to me
And how do you suppose I could remember how many pinches of flour and spoonfuls of salt and cupfuls of bakingpowder went into a loaf of cake when all the while the very teakettle on the stove was singing Its all rightBertram loves meIm going to marry Bertram
You darling
In spite of the man across the aisle Bertram did almost kiss her this time
As if anybody cared how many cupfuls of bakingpowder went anywherewith that in your heart
Aunt Hannah says you willwhen youre hungry
And Kate said Bertram uttered a sharp word behind his teeth
Billy for heavens sake dont tell me what Kate said if you want me to stay sane and not attempt to fight somebodybroken arm and all
Kate thinks shes kind and I suppose she means well butwell shes made trouble enough between us already
Ive got you now sweetheart
Youre mineall mine his voice shook and dropped to a tender whisper  till death us do part
 Yes till death us do part  breathed Billy
And then for a time they fell silent
 I Bertram take thee Billy  sang the whirring wheels beneath them to one
 I Billy take thee Bertram  sang the whirring wheels beneath them to the other
While straight ahead before them both stretched fair and beautiful in their eyes the wondrous path of life which they were to tread together
CHAPTER II FOR WILLIAMA HOME On the first Sunday after the wedding Pete came upstairs to tell his master William that Mrs Stetson wanted to see him in the drawing room
William went down at once
Well Aunt Hannah he began reaching out a cordial hand
Why whats the matter
he broke off concernedly as he caught a clearer view of the little old ladys drawn face and troubled eyes
William its silly of course cried Aunt Hannah tremulously but I simply had to go to some one
II feel so nervous and unsettled
Diddid Billy say anything to you what she was going to do
What she was going to do
About what
What do you mean
About the houseselling it faltered Aunt Hannah sinking wearily back into her chair
William frowned thoughtfully
Why no he answered
It was all so hurried at the last you know
There was really very little chance to make plans for anything except the wedding he finished with a smile
Yes I know sighed Aunt Hannah
Everything was in such confusion
Still I didnt know but she might have said somethingto you
No she didnt
But I imagine it wont be hard to guess what shell do
When they get back from their trip I fancy she wont lose much time in having what things she wants brought down here
Then shell sell the rest and put the house on the market
Yes ofof course stammered Aunt Hannah pulling herself hastily to a more erect position
Thats what I thought too
Then dont you think wed better dismiss Rosa and close the house at once
Whyyes perhaps so
Why not
Then youd be all settled here when she comes home
Im sure the sooner you come the better Ill be pleased he smiled
Aunt Hannah turned sharply
Here
she ejaculated
William Henshaw you didnt suppose I was coming here to live did you
It was Williams turn to look amazed
Why of course youre coming here
Where else should you go pray
Where I was beforebefore Billy cameto you returned Aunt Hannah a little tremulously but with a certain dignity
I shall take a room in some quiet boardinghouse of course
Nonsense Aunt Hannah
As if Billy would listen to that
You came before why not come now
Aunt Hannah lifted her chin the fraction of an inch
You forget
I was needed before
Billy is a married woman now
She needs no chaperon
Nonsense
scowled William again
Billy will always need you
Aunt Hannah shook her head mournfully
I like to thinkshe wants me William but I know in my heart it isnt best
Why not
There was a moments pause then decisively came the answer
Because I think young married folks should not have outsiders in the home
William laughed relievedly
Oh so thats it
Well Aunt Hannah youre no outsider
Come run right along home and pack your trunk
Aunt Hannah was plainly almost crying but she held her ground
William I cant she reiterated
ButBilly is such a child and For once in her circumspect life Aunt Hannah was guilty of an interruption
Pardon me William she is not a child
She is a woman now and she has a womans problems to meet
Well then why dont you help her meet them
retorted William still with a whimsical smile
But Aunt Hannah did not smile
For a minute she did not speak then with her eyes studiously averted she said William the first four years of my married life werewere spoiled by an outsider in our home
I dont mean to spoil Billys
William relaxed visibly
The smile fled from his face
WhyAuntHannah
he exclaimed
The little old lady turned with a weary sigh
Yes I know
You are shocked of course
I shouldnt have told you
Still it is all past long ago andI wanted to make you understand why I cant come
He was my husbands eldest brothera bachelor
He was good and kind and meant well I suppose buthe interfered with everything
I was young and probably headstrong
At all events there was constant friction
He went away once and stayed two whole months
I shall never forget the utter freedom and happiness of those months for us with the whole house to ourselves
No William I cant come
She rose abruptly and turned toward the door
Her eyes were wistful and her face was still drawn with suffering but her whole frail little self quivered plainly with high resolve
John has Peggy outside
I must go
Butbut Aunt Hannah began William helplessly
She lifted a protesting hand
No dont urge me please
I cant come here
ButI believe I wont close the house till Billy gets home after all she declared
The next moment she was gone and William dazedly from the doorway was watching John help her into Billys automobile called by Billy and half her friends Peggy short for Pegasus
Still dazedly William turned back into the house and dropped himself into the nearest chair
What a curious call it had been
Aunt Hannah had not acted like herself at all
Not once had she said Oh my grief and conscience
while the things she had said
Someway he had never thought of Aunt Hannah as being young and a bride
Still of course she must have been once
And the reason she gave for not coming there to livethe pitiful story of that outsider in her home
But she was no outsider
She was no interfering brother of Billys William caught his breath suddenly and held it suspended
Then he gave a low ejaculation and half sprang from his chair
Spunkie disturbed from her doze by the fire uttered a purring meoow and looked up inquiringly
For a long minute William gazed dumbly into the cats yellow sleepily contented eyes then he said with tragic distinctness Spunkie its true Aunt Hannah isnt Billys husbands brother butI am
Do you hear
I am Purrmeow
commented Spunkie and curled herself for another nap
There was no peace for William after that
In vain he told himself that he was no interfering brother and that this was his home and had been all his life in vain did he declare emphatically that he could not go he would not go that Billy would not wish him to go always before his eyes was the vision of that little bride of years long gone always in his ears was the echo of Aunt Hannahs I shall never forget the utter freedom and happiness of those months for us with the whole house to ourselves
Nor turn which way he would could he find anything to comfort him
Simply because he was so fearfully looking for it he found itthe thing that had for its theme the wretchedness that might be expected from the presence of a third person in the new home
Poor William
Everywhere he met itthe hint the word the story the song even and always it added its mite to the woeful whole
Even the hoariest of motherinlaw jokes had its sting for him and to make his cup quite full he chanced to remember one day what Marie had said when he had suggested that she and Cyril come to the Strata to live No I think young folks should begin by themselves
Unhappy indeed were these days for William
Like a lost spirit he wandered from room to room touching this fingering that
For long minutes he would stand before some picture or some treasured bit of old mahogany as if to stamp indelibly upon his mind a thing that was soon to be no more
At other times like a man without a home he would go out into the Common or the Public Garden and sit for hours on some benchthinking
All this could have but one ending of course
Before the middle of August William summoned Pete to his rooms
Oh Pete Im going to move next week he began nonchalantly
His voice sounded as if moving were a pleasurable circumstance that occurred in his life regularly once a month
Id like you to begin to pack up these things please tomorrow
The old servants mouth fell open
Youre goin toto what sir
he stammered
Movemove I said
William spoke with unusual harshness
Pete wet his lips
You mean youve sold the old place sir that wewe aint goin to live here no longer
Sold
Of course not
Im going to move away not you
If Pete could have known what caused the sharpness in his masters voice he would not have been so grievedor rather he would have been grieved for a different reason
As it was he could only falter miserably You are goin to move away from here
Yes yes man
Why Pete what ails you
One would think a body never moved before
They didntnot you sir
William turned abruptly so that his face could not be seen
With stern deliberation he picked up an elaborately decorated teapot but the valuable bit of Lowestoft shook so in his hand that he set it down at once
It clicked sharply against its neighbor betraying his nervous hand
Pete stirred
But Mr William he stammered thickly how are youwhatll you do without There doesnt nobody but me know so well about your tea and the two lumps in your coffee and theres your flannels that you never put on till I get em out and the woolen socks that youd wear all summer if I didnt hide em
And and whos goin to take care of these
he finished with a glance that encompassed the overflowing cabinets and shelves of curios all about him
His master smiled sadly
An affection that had its inception in his boyhood days shone in his eyes
The hand in which the Lowestoft had shaken rested now heavily on an old mans bent shouldera shoulder that straightened itself in unconscious loyalty under the touch
Pete you have spoiled me and no mistake
I dont expect to find another like you
But maybe if I wear the woolen socks too late youll come and hunt up the others for me
Eh
And with a smile that was meant to be quizzical William turned and began to shift the teapots about again
But Mr William whythat is what will Mr Bertram and Miss Billy dowithout you
ventured the old man
There was a sudden tinkling crash
On the floor lay the fragments of a silverluster teapot
The servant exclaimed aloud in dismay but his master did not even glance toward his once treasured possession on the floor
Nonsense Pete
he was saying in a particularly cheery voice
Have you lived all these years and not found out that newlymarried folks dont need any one else around
Come do you suppose we could begin to pack these teapots tonight
he added a little feverishly
Arent there some boxes down cellar
Ill see sir said Pete respectfully but the expression on his face as he turned away showed that he was not thinking of teapotsnor of boxes in which to pack them
CHAPTER III BILLY SPEAKS HER MIND Mr and Mrs Bertram Henshaw were expected home the first of September
By the thirtyfirst of August the old Beacon Street homestead facing the Public Garden was in spickandspan order with Dong Ling in the basement hovering over a wellstocked larder and Pete searching the rest of the house for a chair awry or a bit of dust undiscovered
Twice before had the Strataas Bertram long ago dubbed the home of his boyhood been prepared for the coming of Billy Williams namesake once when it had been decorated with guns and fishingrods to welcome the boy who turned out to be a girl and again when with pink roses and sewingbaskets the three brothers got joyously ready for a feminine Billy who did not even come at all
The house had been very different then
It had been indeed a strata with its distinctive layers of fads and pursuits as represented by Bertram and his painting on one floor William and his curios on another and Cyril with his music on a third
Cyril was gone now
Only Pete and his humble belongings occupied the top floor
The floor below too was silent now and almost empty save for a rug or two and a few pieces of heavy furniture that William had not cared to take with him to his new quarters on top of Beacon Hill
Below this however came Billys old rooms and on these Pete had lavished all his skill and devotion
Freshly laundered curtains were at the windows dustless rugs were on the floor
The old workbasket had been brought down from the topfloor storeroom and the longclosed piano stood invitingly open
In a conspicuous place also sat the little green god upon whose exquisitely carved shoulders was supposed to rest the heap plenty velly good luckee of Dong Lings prophecy
On the first floor Bertrams old rooms and the drawingroom came in for their share of the general overhauling
Even Spunkie did not escape but had to submit to the ignominy of a bath
And then dawned fair and clear the first day of September bringing at five oclock the bride and groom
Respectfully lined up in the hall to meet them were Pete and Dong Ling Pete with his wrinkled old face alight with joy and excitement Dong Ling grinning and kotowing and chanting in a highpitched treble Miss Billee Miss Billeeplenty much welcome Miss Billee
Yes welcome home Mrs Henshaw bowed Bertram turning at the door with an elaborate flourish that did not in the least hide his tender pride in his new wife
Billy laughed and colored a pretty pink
Thank youall of you she cried a little unsteadily
And how good good everything does look to me
Why wheres Uncle William
she broke off casting hurriedly anxious eyes about her
Well I should say so echoed Bertram
Where is he Pete
He isnt sick is he
A quick change crossed the old servants face
He shook his head dumbly
Billy gave a gleeful laugh
I knowhes asleep
she caroled skipping to the bottom of the stairway and looking up Ho Uncle William
Better wake up sir
The folks have come
Pete cleared his throat
Mr William isnt here Missmaam he corrected miserably
Billy smiled but she frowned too
Not here
Well I like that she pouted and when Ive brought him the most beautiful pair of mirror knobs he ever saw and all the way in my bag too so I could give them to him the very first thing she added darting over to the small bag she had brought in with her
Im glad I did too for our trunks didnt come she continued laughingly
Still if he isnt here to receive them There Pete arent they beautiful
she cried carefully taking from their wrappings two exquisitely decorated porcelain discs mounted on two long spikes
Theyre Batterseas the real article
I know enough for that and theyre finer than anything hes got
Wont he be pleased
Yes Missmaam I mean stammered the old man
These new titles come hard dont they Pete
laughed Bertram
Pete smiled faintly
Never mind Pete soothed his new mistress
You shall call me Miss Billy all your life if you want to
Bertram she added turning to her husband Im going to just run upstairs and put these in Uncle Williams rooms so theyll be there when he comes in
Well see how soon he discovers them
Before Pete could stop her she was halfway up the first flight of stairs
Even then he tried to speak to his young master to explain that Mr William was not living there but the words refused to come
He could only stand dumbly waiting
In a minute it cameBillys sharp startled cry
Bertram
Bertram
Bertram sprang for the stairway but he had not reached the top when he met his wife coming down
She was whitefaced and trembling
Bertramthose roomstheres not so much as a teapot there
Uncle Williams gone
Gone
Bertram wheeled sharply
Pete what is the meaning of this
Where is my brother
To hear him one would think he suspected the old servant of having hidden his master
Pete lifted a shaking hand and fumbled with his collar
Hes moved sir
Moved
Oh you mean to other roomsto Cyrils
Bertram relaxed visibly
Hes upstairs maybe
Pete shook his head
No
sir
Hes moved awayout of the house sir
For a brief moment Bertram stared as if he could not believe what his ears had heard
Then step by step he began to descend the stairs
Do you meanto saythat my brother has movedgone awaylefthis home he demanded
Yes sir
Billy gave a low cry
But whywhy
she choked almost stumbling headlong down the stairway in her effort to reach the two men at the bottom
Pete why did he go
There was no answer
PeteBertrams voice was very sharp what is the meaning of this
Do you know why my brother left his home
The old man wet his lips and swallowed chokingly but he did not speak
Im waiting Pete
Billy laid one hand on the old servants arm in the other hand she still tightly clutched the mirror knobs
Pete if you do know wont you tell us please
she begged
Pete looked down at the hand then up at the troubled young face with the beseeching eyes
His own features worked convulsively
With a visible effort he cleared his throat
I knowwhat he said he stammered his eyes averted
What was it
There was no answer
Look here Pete youll have to tell us you know cut in Bertram decisively so you might as well do it now as ever
Once more Pete cleared his throat
This time the words came in a burst of desperation
Yes sir
I understand sir
It was only that he saidhe said as how young folks didnt need any one else around
So he was goin
Didnt need any one else
exclaimed Bertram plainly not comprehending
Yes sir
You two bein married so now
Petes eyes were still averted
Billy gave a low cry
You meanbecause I came
she demanded
Why yes Missnothat is Pete stopped with an appealing glance at Bertram
Then it wasit wason account of me choked Billy
Pete looked still more distressed No no
he faltered
It was only that he thought you wouldnt want him here now
Want him here
ejaculated Bertram
Want him here
echoed Billy with a sob
Pete where is he
As she asked the question she dropped the mirror knobs into her open bag and reached for her coat and glovesshe had not removed her hat
Pete gave the address
Its just down the street a bit and up the hill he added excitedly divining her purpose
Its a sort of a boardinghouse I reckon
A boardinghousefor Uncle William
scorned Billy her eyes ablaze
Come Bertram well see about that
Bertram reached out a detaining hand
But dearest youre so tired he demurred
Hadnt we better wait till after dinner or till tomorrow
After dinner
Tomorrow
Billys eyes blazed anew
Why Bertram Henshaw do you think Id leave that dear man even one minute longer if I could help it with a notion in his blessed old head that we didnt want him
But you said a little while ago you had a headache dear still objected Bertram
If youd just eat your dinner
Dinner
choked Billy
I wonder if you think I could eat any dinner with Uncle William turned out of his home
Im going to find Uncle William
And she stumbled blindly toward the door
Bertram reached for his hat
He threw a despairing glance into Petes eyes
Well be backwhen we can he said with a frown
Yes sir answered Pete respectfully
Then as if impelled by some hidden force he touched his masters arm
It was that way she looked sir when she came to youthat night last Julywith her eyes all shining he whispered
A tender smile curved Bertrams lips
The frown vanished from his face
Bless you Peteand bless her too
he whispered back
The next moment he had hurried after his wife
The house that bore the number Pete had given proved to have a pretentious doorway and a landlady who in response to the summons of the neat maid appeared with a most impressive rustle of black silk and jet bugles
No Mr William Henshaw was not in his rooms
In fact he was very seldom there
His business she believed called him to State Street through the day
Outside of that she had been told he spent much time sitting on a bench in the Common
Doubtless if they cared to search they could find him there now
A bench in the Common indeed
stormed Billy as she and Bertram hurried down the wide stone steps
Uncle Williamon a bench
But surely now dear ventured her husband youll come home and get your dinner
Billy turned indignantly
And leave Uncle William on a bench in the Common
Indeed no
Why Bertram you wouldnt either she cried as she turned resolutely toward one of the entrances to the Common
And Bertram with the eyes all shining still before him could only murmur No of course not dear
and follow obediently where she led
Under ordinary circumstances it would have been a delightful hour for a walk
The sun had almost set and the shadows lay long across the grass
The air was cool and unusually bracing for a day so early in September
But all this was lost on Bertram
Bertram did not wish to take a walk
He was hungry
He wanted his dinner and he wanted too his old home with his new wife flitting about the rooms as he had pictured this first evening together
He wanted William of course
Certainly he wanted William but if William would insist on running away and sitting on park benches in this ridiculous fashion he ought to take the consequences until tomorrow
Five ten fifteen minutes passed
Up one path and down another trudged the anxiouseyed Billy and her increasingly impatient husband
Then when the fifteen weary minutes had become a still more weary halfhour the bonds Bertram had set on his temper snapped
Billy he remonstrated despairingly do please come home
Dont you see how highly improbable it is that we should happen on William if we walked like this all night
He might movechange his seatgo home even
He probably has gone home
And surely never before did a bride insist on spending the first evening after her return tramping up and down a public park for hour after hour like this looking for any man
Wont you come home
But Billy had not even heard
With a glad little cry she had darted to the side of the humpedup figure of a man alone on a park bench just ahead of them
Uncle William
Oh Uncle William how could you
she cried dropping herself on to one end of the seat and catching the mans arm in both her hands
Yes how could you
demanded Bertram with just a touch of irritation dropping himself on to the other end of the seat and catching the mans other arm in his one usable hand
The bent shoulders and bowed head straightened up with a jerk
Well well bless my soul
If it isnt our little bride cried Uncle William fondly
And the happy bridegroom too
When did you get home
We havent got home retorted Bertram promptly before his wife could speak
Oh we looked in at the door an hour or so back but we didnt stay
Weve been hunting for you ever since
Nonsense children
Uncle William spoke with gay cheeriness but he refused to meet either Billys or Bertrams eyes
Uncle William how could you do it
reproached Billy again
Do what
Uncle William was plainly fencing for time
Leave the house like that
Ho
I wanted a change
As if wed believe that
scoffed Billy
All right lets call it youve had the change then laughed Bertram and well send over for your things tomorrow
Comenow lets go home to dinner
William shook his head
He essayed a gay smile
Why Ive only just begun
Im going to stayoh I dont know how long Im going to stay he finished blithely
Billy lifted her chin a little
Uncle William you arent playing square
Pete told us what you said when you left
Eh
What
William looked up with startled eyes
Aboutabout our not needing you
So we know now why you left and we shant stand it
Pete
That
Oh thatthats nonsense IIll settle with Pete
Billy laughed softly
Poor Pete
Dont
We simply dragged it out of him
And now were here to tell you that we do want you and that you must come back
Again William shook his head
A swift shadow crossed his face
Thank you no children he said dully
Youre very kind but you dont need me
I should be just an interfering elder brother
I should spoil your young married life
Williams voice now sounded as if he were reciting a well learned lesson
If I went away and stayed two months youd never forget the utter freedom and joy of those two whole months with the house all to yourselves
Uncle William gasped Billy what are you talking about
Aboutabout my not going back of course
But you are coming back cut in Bertram almost angrily
Oh come Will this is utter nonsense and you know it
Come lets go home to dinner
A stern look came to the corners of Williams moutha look that Bertram understood well
All right Ill go to dinner of course but I shant stay said William firmly
Ive thought it all out
I know Im right
Come well go to dinner now and say no more about it he finished with a cheery smile as he rose to his feet
Then to the bride he added Did you have a nice trip little girl
Billy too had risen now but she did not seem to have heard his question
In the fast falling twilight her face looked a little white
Uncle William she began very quietly do you think for a minute that just because I married your brother I am going to live in that house and turn you out of the home youve lived in all your life
Nonsense dear
Im not turned out
I just go corrected Uncle William gayly
With superb disdain Billy brushed this aside
Oh no you wont she declared but I shall
Billy
gasped Bertram
Mymy dear
expostulated William faintly
Uncle William
Bertram
Listen panted Billy
I never told you much before but Im going to now
Long ago when I went away with Aunt Hannah your sister Kate showed me how dear the old home was to youhow much you thought of it
And she saidshe said that I had upset everything
Bertram interjected a sharp word but Billy paid no attention
Thats why I went and I shall go againif you dont come home tomorrow to stay Uncle William
Come now lets go to dinner please
Bertrams hungry she finished with a bright smile
There was a tense moment of silence
William glanced at Bertram Bertram returned the glance with interest
Erahyes well we might go to dinner stammered William after a minute
Eryes agreed Bertram
And the three fell into step together
CHAPTER IV JUST LIKE BILLY Billy did not leave the Strata this time
Before twentyfour hours had passed the last cherished fragment of Mr William Henshaws possessions had been carefully carried down the imposing steps of the Beacon Hill boardinghouse under the disapproving eyes of its bugleadorned mistress who found herself now with a months advance rent and two vacant parlors on her hands
Before another twentyfour hours had passed her quondam boarder with a tired sigh sank into his favorite morris chair in his old familiar rooms and looked about him with contented eyes
Every treasure was in place from the traditional four small stones of his babyhood days to the Batterseas Billy had just brought him
Pete as of yore was hovering near with a dust cloth
Bertrams gay whistle sounded from the floor below
William Henshaw was at home again
This much accomplished Billy went to see Aunt Hannah
Aunt Hannah greeted her affectionately though with tearfully troubled eyes
She was wearing a gray shawl today topped with a black one sure sign of unrest either physical or mental as all her friends knew
Id begun to think youd forgottenme she faltered with a poor attempt at gayety
Youve been home three whole days
I know dearie smiled Billy and twas a shame
But I have been so busy
My trunks came at last and Ive been helping Uncle William get settled too
Aunt Hannah looked puzzled
Uncle William get settled
You mean hes changed his room
Billy laughed oddly and threw a swift glance into Aunt Hannahs face
Well yes he did change she murmured but hes moved back now into the old quarters
Eryou havent heard from Uncle William then lately I take it
No
Aunt Hannah shook her head abstractedly
I did see him once several weeks ago but I havent since
We had quite a talk then and Billy Ive been wanting to speak to you she hurried on a little feverishly
I didnt like to leave of course till you did come home as long as youd said nothing about your plans but Leave
interposed Billy dazedly
Leave where
What do you mean
Why leave here of course dear
I mean
I didnt like to get my room while you were away but I shall now of course at once
Nonsense Aunt Hannah
As if Id let you do that laughed Billy
Aunt Hannah stiffened perceptibly
Her lips looked suddenly thin and determined
Even the soft little curls above her ears seemed actually to bristle with resolution
Billy she began firmly we might as well understand each other at once
I know your good heart and I appreciate your kindness
But I can not come to live with you
I shall not
It wouldnt be best
I should be like an interfering elder brother in your home
I should spoil your young married life and if I went away for two months youd never forget the utter joy and freedom of those two months with the whole house ali to yourselves
At the beginning of this speech Billys eyes had still carried their dancing smile but as the peroration progressed on to the end a dawning surprise which soon became a puzzled questioning drove the smile away
Then Billy sat suddenly erect
Why Aunt Hannah thats exactly what Uncle William Billy stopped and regarded Aunt Hannah with quick suspicion
The next moment she burst into gleeful laughter
Aunt Hannah looked grieved and not a little surprised but Billy did not seem to notice this
Oh oh Aunt Hannahyou too
How perfectly funny
she gurgled
To think you two old blesseds should get your heads together like this
Aunt Hannah stirred restively and pulled the black shawl more closely about her
Indeed Billy I dont know what you mean by that she sighed with a visible effort at self control but I do know that I can not go to live with you
Bless your heart dear I dont want you to soothed Billy with gay promptness
Oh
Ohh stammered Aunt Hannah surprise mortification dismay and a grieved hurt bringing a flood of color to her face
It is one thing to refuse a home and quite another to have a home refused you
Oh
Ohh Aunt Hannah cried Billy turning very red in her turn
Please please dont look like that
I didnt mean it that way
I do want you dear onlyI want you somewhere else more
I want youhere
Here
Aunt Hannah looked relieved but unconvinced
Yes
Dont you like it here
Like it
Why I love it dear
You know I do
But you dont need this house now Billy
Oh yes I do retorted Billy airily
Im going to keep it up and I want you here
Fiddlededee Billy
As if Id let you keep up this house just for me scorned Aunt Hannah
 Tisnt just for you
Its forfor lots of folks
My grief and conscience Billy
What are you talking about
Billy laughed and settled herself more comfortably on the hassock at Aunt Hannahs feet
Well Ill tell you
Just now I want it for Tommy Dunn and the Greggorys if I can get them and maybe one or two others
Therell always be somebody
You see I had thought Id have them at the Strata
Tommy Dunnat the Strata
Billy laughed again ruefully
O dear
You sound just like Bertram she pouted
He didnt want Tommy either nor any of the rest of them
The rest of them
Well I could have had a lot more you know the Strata is so big especially now that Cyril has gone and left all those empty rooms
I got real enthusiastic but Bertram didnt
He just laughed and said nonsense
until he found I was really in earnest then hewell he said nonsense then tooonly he didnt laugh finished Billy with a sigh
Aunt Hannah regarded her with fond though slightly exasperated eyes
Billy you are indeed a most extraordinary young womanat times
Surely with you a body never knows what to expectexcept the unexpected
Why Aunt Hannahand from you too
reproached Billy mischievously but Aunt Hannah had yet more to say
Of course Bertram thought it was nonsense
The idea of you a bride filling up your house withwith people like that
Tommy Dunn indeed
Oh Bertram said he liked Tommy all right sighed Billy but he said that that didnt mean he wanted him for three meals a day
One would think poor Tommy was a breakfast food
So that is when I thought of keeping up this house you see and thats why I want you hereto take charge of it
And youll do thatfor me wont you
Aunt Hannah fell back in her chair
Why yyes Billy of course ifif you want it
But what an extraordinary idea child
Billy shook her head
A deeper color came to her cheeks and a softer glow to her eyes
I dont think so Aunt Hannah
Its only that Im so happy that some of it has just got to overflow somewhere and this is going to be the overflow housea sort of safety valve for me you see
Im going to call it the Annexit will be an annex to our home
And I want to keep it full always of people whowho can make the best use of all that extra happiness that I cant possibly use myself she finished a little tremulously
Dont you see
Oh yes I see replied Aunt Hannah with a fond shake of the head
But really listenits sensible urged Billy
First theres Tommy
His mother died last month
Hes at a neighbors now but theyre going to send him to a Home for Crippled Children and hes grieving his heart out over it
Im going to bring him here to a real home the kind that doesnt begin with a capital letter
He adores music and hes got real talent I think
Then theres the Greggorys
Aunt Hannah looked dubious
You cant get the Greggorys toto use any of that happiness Billy
Theyre too proud
Billy smiled radiantly
I know I cant get them to use it Aunt Hannah but I believe I can get them to give it she declared triumphantly
I shall ask Alice Greggory to teach Tommy music and I shall ask Mrs Greggory to teach him books and I shall tell them both that I positively need them to keep you company
Oh but Billy bridled Aunt Hannah with prompt objection
Tut tutI know youll be willing to be thrown as a little bit of a sop to the Greggorys pride coaxed Billy
You just wait till I get the Overflow Annex in running order
Why Aunt Hannah you dont know how busy youre going to be handing out all that extra happiness that I cant use
You dear child
Aunt Hannah smiled mistily
The black shawl had fallen unheeded to the floor now
As if anybody ever had any more happiness than ones self could use
I have avowed Billy promptly and its going to keep growing and growing I know
Oh my grief and conscience Billy dont
exclaimed Aunt Hannah lifting shocked hands of remonstrance
Rap on wooddo
How can you boast like that
Billy dimpled roguishly and sprang to her feet
Why Aunt Hannah Im ashamed of you
To be superstitious like thatyou a good Presbyterian
Aunt Hannah subsided shamefacedly
Yes I know Billy it is silly but I just cant help it
Oh but its worse than silly Aunt Hannah teased Billy with a remorseless chuckle
Its really heathen Bertram told me once that it dates way back to the time of the Druids appealing to the god of trees or something like that when you rap on wood you know
Ugh
shuddered Aunt Hannah
As if I would Billy
How is Bertram by the by
A swift shadow crossed Billys bright face
Hes lovelyonly his arm
His arm
But I thought that was better
Oh it is drooped Billy but it gets along so slowly and it frets him dreadfully
You know he never can do anything with his left hand he says and he just hates to have things done for himthough Pete and Dong Ling are quarreling with each other all the time to do things for him and Im quarreling with both of them to do them for him myself
By the way Dong Ling is going to leave us next week
Did you know it
Dong Lingleave
Yes
Oh he told Bertram long ago he should go when we were married that he had plenty much money and was going back to China and not be Melican man any longer
But I dont think Bertram thought hed do it
William says Dong Ling went to Pete however after we left and told him he wanted to go that he liked the little Missee plenty well but that thered be too much hentalk when she got back and Why the impudent creature
Billy laughed merrily
Yes Pete was furious William says but Dong Ling didnt mean any disrespect Im sure
He just wasnt used to having petticoats around and didnt want to take orders from them thats all
But Billy what will you do
Oh Petes fixed all that lovely returned Billy nonchalantly
You know his niece lives over in South Boston and it seems shes got a daughter whos a fine cook and will be glad to come
Mercy
Look at the time she broke off glancing at the clock
I shall be late to dinner and Dong Ling loathes anybody whos late to his mealsas I found out to my sorrow the night we got home
Goodby dear
Ill be out soon again and fix it all upabout the Annex you know
And with a bright smile she was gone
Dear me sighed Aunt Hannah stooping to pick up the black shawl dear me
Of course everything will be all righttheres a girl coming even if Dong Ling is going
Butbut Oh my grief and conscience what an extraordinary child Billy is to be surebut what a dear one
she added wiping a quick tear from her eye
An Overflow Annex indeed for her extra happiness
Now isnt that just like Billy
CHAPTER V TIGER SKINS September passed and October came bringing with it cool days and clear crisp evenings royally ruled over by a gorgeous harvest moon
According to Billy everything was just perfectexcept of course poor Bertrams arm and even the fact that that gained so slowly was not without its advantage again according to Billy for it gave Bertram more time to be with her
You see dear as long as you cant paint she told him earnestly one day why Im not really hindering you by keeping you with me so much
You certainly are not he retorted with a smile
Then I may be just as happy as I like over it settled Billy comfortably
As if you ever could hinder me he ridiculed
Oh yes I could nodded Billy emphatically
You forget sir
That was what worried me so
Everybody even the newspapers and magazines said I would do it too
They said Id slay your Art stifle your Ambition destroy your Inspiration and be a nuisance generally
And Kate said Yes
Well never mind what Kate said interrupted the man savagely
Billy laughed and gave his ear a playful tweak
All right but Im not going to do it you knowspoil your career sir
You just wait she continued dramatically
The minute your arm gets so you can paint I myself shall conduct you to your studio thrust the brushes into your hand fill your palette with all the colors of the rainbow and order you to paint my lord paint
Butuntil then Im going to have you all I like she finished with a complete change of manner nestling into the ready curve of his good left arm
You witch
laughed the man fondly
Why Billy you couldnt hinder me
Youll be my inspiration dear instead of slaying it
Youll see
This time Marguerite Winthrops portrait is going to be a success
Billy turned quickly
Then you arethat is you haventI mean youre going topaint it
I just am avowed the artist
And this time itll be a success too with you to help
Billy drew in her breath tremulously
I didnt know but youd already started it she faltered
He shook his head
No
After the other one failed and Mr Winthrop asked me to try again I couldnt then
I was so troubled over you
Thats the time you did hinder me he smiled
Then came your note breaking the engagement
Of course I knew too much to attempt a thing like that portrait then
But nownow
The pause and the emphasis were eloquent
Of course now nodded Billy brightly but a little feverishly
And when do you begin
Not till January
Miss Winthrop wont be back till then
I saw J G last week and I told him Id accept his offer to try again
What did he say
He gave my left hand a big grip and said Goodand youll win out this time
 Of course you will nodded Billy again though still a little feverishly
And this time I shant mind a bit if you do stay to luncheon and break engagements with me sir she went on tilting her chin archly for I shall know its the portrait and not the sitter thats really keeping you
Oh youll see what a fine artists wife Ill make
The very best declared Bertram so ardently that Billy blushed and shook her head in reproof
Nonsense
I wasnt fishing
I didnt mean it that way she protested
Then as he tried to catch her she laughed and danced teasingly out of his reach
Because Bertram could not paint therefore Billy had him quite to herself these October days nor did she hesitate to appropriate him
Neither on his part was Bertram loath to be appropriated
Like two lovers they read and walked and talked together and like two children sometimes they romped through the stately old rooms with Spunkie or with Tommy Dunn who was a frequent guest
Spunkie be it known was renewing her kittenhood so potent was the influence of the dangling strings and rolling balls that she encountered everywhere and Tommy Dunn with Billys help was learning that not even a pair of crutches need keep a lonely little lad from a frolic
Even William roused from his after dinner doze by peals of laughter was sometimes inveigled into activities that left him breathless but curiously aglow
While Pete polishing silver in the diningroom downstairs smiled indulgently at the merry clatter aboveand forgot the teasing pain in his side
But it was not all nonsense with Billy nor gay laughter
More often it was a tender glow in the eyes a softness in the voice a radiant something like an aura of joy all about her that told how happy indeed were these days for her
There was proof by word of mouth toolong talks with Bertram in the dancing firelight when they laid dear plans for the future and when she tried so hard to make her husband understand what a good good wife she intended to be and how she meant never to let anything come between them
It was so earnest and serious a Billy by this time that Bertram would turn startled dismayed eyes on his young wife whereupon with a very Billylike change of mood she would give him one of her rare caresses and perhaps sigh Gooseyits only because Im so happy happy happy
Why Bertram if it werent for that Overflow Annex I believe II just couldnt live
It was Bertram who sighed then and who prayed fervently in his heart that never might he see a real shadow cloud that dear face
Thus far certainly the cares of matrimony had rested anything but heavily upon the shapely young shoulders of the new wife
Domestic affairs at the Strata moved like a piece of welloiled machinery
Dong Ling to be sure was not there but in his place reigned Petes grandniece a fresh faced capable young woman who Bertram declared cooked like an angel and minded her own business like a man
Pete as of yore had full charge of the house and a casual eye would see few changes
Even the brothers themselves saw few for that matter
True at the very first Billy had donned a ruffled apron and a bewitching dustcap and had traversed the house from cellar to garret with a prettily important air of managing things as she suggested changes right and left
She had summoned Pete too for three mornings in succession and with great dignity had ordered the meals for the day
But when Bertram was discovered one evening tugging back his favorite chair and when William had asked if Billy were through using his pipetray the young wife had concluded to let things remain about as they were
And when William ate no breakfast one morning and Bertram aggrievedly refused dessert that night at dinner Billylearning through an apologetic Pete that Master William always had to have eggs for breakfast no matter what else there was and that Master Bertram never ate boiled ricegave up planning the meals
True for three more mornings she summoned Pete for orders but the orders were nothing more nor less than a blithe Well Pete what are we going to have for dinner today
By the end of a week even this ceremony was given up and before a month had passed Billy was little more than a guest in her own home so far as responsibility was concerned
Billy was not idle however far from it
First there were the delightful hours with Bertram
Then there was her music Billy was writing a new songthe best she had ever written Billy declared
Why Bertram it cant help being that she said to her husband one day
The words just sang themselves to me right out of my heart and the melody just dropped down from the sky
And now everywhere Im hearing the most wonderful harmonies
The whole universe is singing to me
If only now I can put it on paper what I hear
Then I can make the whole universe sing to some one else
Even music however had to step one side for the wedding calls which were beginning to be received and which must be returned in spite of the occasional rebellion of the young husband
There were the more intimate friends to be seen also and Cyril and Marie to be visited
And always there was the Annex
The Annex was in fine running order now and was a source of infinite satisfaction to its founder and great happiness to its beneficiaries
Tommy Dunn was there learning wonderful things from books and still more wonderful things from the piano in the livingroom
Alice Greggory and her mother were there toothe result of much persuasion
Indeed according to Bertram Billy had been able to fill the Annex only by telling each prospective resident that he or she was absolutely necessary to the welfare and happiness of every other resident
Not that the house was full either
There were still two unoccupied rooms
But then Im glad there are Billy had declared for theres sure to be some one that Ill want to send there
Some one did you say
Bertram had retorted meaningly but his wife had disdained to answer this
Billy herself was frequently at the Annex
She told Aunt Hannah that she had to come often to bring the happinessit accumulated so fast
Certainly she always found plenty to do there whenever she came
There was Aunt Hannah to be read to Mrs Greggory to be sung to and Tommy Dunn to be listened to for Tommy Dunn was always quivering with eagerness to play her his latest piece
Billy knew that some day at the Annex she would meet Mr M J Arkwright and she told herself that she hoped she should
Billy had not seen Arkwright except on the stage of the Boston Opera House since the day he had left her presence in whitefaced stony eyed misery after declaring his love for her and learning of her engagement to Bertram
Since then she knew he had been much with his old friend Alice Greggory
She did not believe should she see him now that he would be either whitefaced or stonyeyed
His heart she was sure had gone where it ought to have gone in the first placeto Alice
Such being in her opinion the case she longed to get the embarrassment of a first meeting between themselves over with for after that she was sure their old friendship could be renewed and she would be in a position to further this pretty love affair between him and Alice
Very decidedly therefore Billy wished to meet Arkwright
Very pleased consequently was she when one day coming into the livingroom at the Annex she found the man sitting by the fire
Arkwright was on his feet at once
MissMrs HHenshaw he stammered Oh Mr Arkwright she cried with just a shade of nervousness in her voice as she advanced her hand outstretched
Im glad to see you
Thank you
I wanted to see Miss Greggory he murmured
Then as the unconscious rudeness of his reply dawned on him he made matters infinitely worse by an attempted apology
That is I meanI didnt mean he began to stammer miserably
Some girls might have tossed the floundering man a straw in the shape of a light laugh intended to turn aside all embarrassmentbut not Billy
Billy held out a frankly helping hand that was meant to set the man squarely on his feet at her side
Mr Arkwright dont please she begged earnestly
You and I dont need to beat about the bush
I am glad to see you and I hope youre glad to see me
Were going to be the best of friends from now on Im sure and some day soon youre going to bring Alice to see me and well have some music
I left her upstairs
Shell be down at once I dare sayI met Rosa going up with your card
Goodby she finished with a bright smile as she turned and walked rapidly from the room
Outside on the steps Billy drew a long breath
There she whispered thats overand well over
The next minute she frowned vexedly
She had missed her glove
Never mind
I shant go back in there for it now anyway she decided
In the livingroom five minutes later Alice Greggory found only a hastily scrawled note waiting for her
If youll forgive the unforgivable she read youll forgive me for not being here when you come down
Circumstances over which I have no control have called me away
May we let it go at that
M J ARKWRIGHT
As Alice Greggorys amazed questioning eyes left the note they fell upon the long white glove on the floor by the door
Half mechanically she crossed the room and picked it up but almost at once she dropped it with a low cry
Billy
HesawBilly
Then a flood of understanding dyed her face scarlet as she turned and fled to the blessedly unseeing walls of her own room
Not ten minutes later Rosa tapped at her door with a note
Its from Mr Arkwright Miss
Hes downstairs
Rosas eyes were puzzled and a bit startled
Mr
Arkwright
Yes Miss
Hes come again
That is I didnt know hed wentbut he must have for hes come again now
He wrote something in a little book then he tore it out and gave it to me
He said hed wait please for an answer
Oh very well Rosa
Miss Greggory took the note and spoke with an elaborate air of indifference that was meant to express a calm ignoring of the puzzled questioning in the others eyes
The next moment she read this in Arkwrights peculiar scrawl If youve already forgiven the unforgivable youll do it again I know and come downstairs
Wont you please
I want to see you
Miss Greggory lifted her head with a jerk
Her face was a painful red
Tell Mr Arkwright I cant possibly She came to an abrupt pause
Her eyes had encountered Rosas and in Rosas eyes the puzzled questioning was plainly fast becoming a shrewd suspicion
There was the briefest of hesitations then lightly Miss Greggory tossed the note aside
Tell Mr Arkwright Ill be down at once please she directed carelessly as she turned back into the room
But she was not down at once
She was not down until she had taken time to bathe her red eyes powder her telltale nose smoothe her ruffled hair and whip herself into the calm steadyeyed selfcontrolled young woman that Arkwright finally rose to meet when she came into the room
I thought it was only women who were privileged to change their mind she began brightly but Arkwright ignored her attempt to conventionalize the situation
Thank you for coming down he said with a weariness that instantly drove the forced smile from the girls lips
II wanted toto talk to you
Yes
She seated herself and motioned him to a chair near her
He took the seat and then fell silent his eyes out the window
I thought you said youyou wanted to talk she reminded him nervously after a minute
I did
He turned with disconcerting abruptness
Alice Im going to tell you a story
I shall be glad to listen
People always like stories dont they
Do they
The somber pain in Arkwrights eyes deepened
Alice Greggory did not know it but he was thinking of another story he had once told in that same room
Billy was his listener then while now A little precipitately he began to speak
When I was a very small boy I went to visit my uncle who in his young days had been quite a hunter
Before the fireplace in his library was a huge tiger skin with a particularly lifelike head
The first time I saw it I screamed and ran and hid
I refused then even to go into the room again
My cousins urged scolded pleaded and laughed at me by turns but I was obdurate
I would not go where I could see the fearsome thing again even though it was as they said nothing but a dead old rug
Finally one day my uncle took a hand in the matter
By sheer willpower he forced me to go with him straight up to the dreaded creature and stand by its side
He laid one of my shrinking hands on the beasts smooth head and thrust the other one quite into the open red mouth with its gleaming teeth
 You see he said theres absolutely nothing to fear
He cant possibly hurt you
Just as if you werent bigger and finer and stronger in every way than that dead thing on the floor
Then when he had got me to the point where of my own free will I would walk up and touch the thing he drew a lesson for me
 Now remember he charged me
Never run and hide again
Only cowards do that
Walk straight up and face the thing
Ten to one youll find its nothing but a dead skin masquerading as the real thing
Even if it isnt if its aliveface it
Find a weapon and fight it
Know that you are going to conquer it and youll conquer
Never run
Be a man
Men dont run my boy
 Arkwright paused and drew a long breath
He did not look at the girl in the opposite chair
If he had looked he would have seen a face transfigured
Well he resumed I never forgot that tiger skin nor what it stood for after that day when Uncle Ben thrust my hand into its hideous but harmless red mouth
Even as a kid I began then to trynot to run
Ive tried ever since But todayI did run
Arkwrights voice had been getting lower and lower
The last three words would have been almost inaudible to ears less sensitively alert than were Alice Greggorys
For a moment after the words were uttered only the clocks ticking broke the silence then with an obvious effort the man roused himself as if breaking away from some benumbing force that held him
Alice I dont need to tell you after what I said the other night that I loved Billy Neilson
That was bad enough for I found she was pledged to another man
But today I discovered something worse I discovered that I loved Billy Henshaw another mans wife
AndI ran
But Ive come back
Im going to face the thing
Oh Im not deceiving myself
This love of mine is no dead tiger skin
Its a beast alive and alert God pity meto destroy my very soul
But Im going to fight it andI want you to help me
The girl gave a halfsmothered cry
The man turned but he could not see her face distinctly
Twilight had come and the room was full of shadows
He hesitated then went on a little more quietly
Thats why Ive told you all thisso you would help me
And you will wont you
There was no answer
Once again he tried to see her face but it was turned now quite away from him
Youve been a big help already little girl
Your friendship your comradeshiptheyve been everything to me
Youre not going to make me do without themnow
Nooh no
The answer was low and a little breathless but he heard it
Thank you
I knew you wouldnt
He paused then rose to his feet
When he spoke again his voice carried a note of whimsical lightness that was a little forced
But I must go else you will take them from me and with good reason
And please dont let your kind heart grieve too muchover me
Im no deepdyed villain in a melodrama nor wicked lover in a ten penny novel you know
Im just an everyday man in real life and were going to fight this thing out in everyday living
Thats where your help is coming in
Well go together to see Mrs Bertram Henshaw
Shes asked us to and youll do it I know
Well have music and everyday talk
Well see Mrs Bertram Henshaw in her own home with her husband where she belongs andIm not going to run again
ButIm counting on your help you know he smiled a little wistfully as he held out his hand in goodby
One minute later Alice Greggory alone was hurrying upstairs
I cantI cantI know I cant she was whispering wildly
Then in her own room she faced herself in the mirror
Yesyoucan Alice Greggory she asserted with swift change of voice and manner
This is your tiger skin and youre going to fight it
Do you understand
fight it
And youre going to win too
Do you want that man to know youcare
CHAPTER VI THE PAINTING LOOK It was toward the last of October that Billy began to notice her husbands growing restlessness
Twice when she had been playing to him she turned to find him testing the suppleness of his injured arm
Several times failing to receive an answer to her questions she had looked up to discover him gazing abstractedly at nothing in particular
They read and walked and talked together to be sure and Bertrams devotion to her lightest wish was beyond question but more and more frequently these days Billy found him hovering over his sketches in his studio and once when he failed to respond to the dinnerbell search revealed him buried in a profound treatise on The Art of Foreshortening
Then came the day when Billy after an hours vain effort to imprison within notes a tantalizing melody captured the truant and rain down to the studio to tell Bertram of her victory
But Bertram did not seem even to hear her
True he leaped to his feet and hurried to meet her his face radiantly aglow but she had not ceased to speak before he himself was talking
Billy Billy Ive been sketching he cried
My hand is almost steady
See some of those lines are all right
I just picked up a crayon and He stopped abruptly his eyes on Billys face
A vaguely troubled shadow crossed his own
Diddid youwere you saying anything inin particular when you came in
he stammered
For a short halfminute Billy looked at her husband without speaking
Then a little queerly she laughed
Oh no nothing at all in particular she retorted airily
The next moment with one of her unexpected changes of manner she darted across the room picked up a palette and a handful of brushes from the long box near it
Advancing toward her husband she held them out dramatically
And now paint my lord paint
she commanded him with stern insistence as she thrust them into his hands
Bertram laughed shamefacedly
Oh I say Billy he began but Billy had gone
Out in the hall Billy was speeding upstairs talking fiercely to herself
Well Billy Neilson Henshaw its come
Now behave yourself
That was the painting look You know what that means
Remember he belongs to his Art before he does to you
Kate and everybody says so
And youyou expected him to tend to you and your silly little songs
Do you want to ruin his career
As if now he could spend all his time and give all his thoughts to you
But II just hate that Art
What did you say Billy
asked William in mild surprise coming around the turn of the balustrade in the hall above
Were you speaking to me my dear
Billy looked up
Her face cleared suddenly and she laughedthough a little ruefully
No Uncle William I wasnt talking to you she sighed
I was justjust administering first aid to the injured she finished as she whisked into her own room
Well well bless the child
What can she mean by that
puzzled Uncle William turning to go down the stairway
Bertram began to paint a very little the next day
He painted still more the next and yet more again the day following
He was like a bird let out of a cage so joyously alive was he
The old sparkle came back to his eye the old gay smile to his lips
Now that they had come back Billy realized what she had not been conscious of before that for several weeks past they had not been there and she wondered which hurt the morethat they had not been there before or that they were there now
Then she scolded herself roundly for asking the question at all
They were not easythose days for Billy though always to Bertram she managed to show a cheerfully serene face
To Uncle William also and to Aunt Hannah she showed a smiling countenance and because she could not talk to anybody else of her feelings she talked to herself
This however was no new thing for Billy to do From earliest childhood she had fought things out in like manner
But its so absurd of you Billy Henshaw she berated herself one day when Bertram had become so absorbed in his work that he had forgotten to keep his appointment with her for a walk
Just because you have had his constant attention almost every hour since you were married is no reason why you should have it every hour now when his arm is better
Besides its exactly what you said you wouldnt doobject to his giving proper time to his work
But Im not objecting stormed the other half of herself
Im telling him to do it
Its only that hes soso pleased to do it
He doesnt seem to mind a bit being away from me
Hes actually happy
Well dont you want him to be happy in his work
Fie
For shame
A fine artists wife you are
It seems Kate was right then you are going to spoil his career
Ho
quoth Billy and tossed her head
Forthwith she crossed the room to her piano and plumped herself down hard on to the stool
Then from under her fingers there fell a rollicking melody that seemed to fill the room with little dancing feet
Faster and faster sped Billys fingers swifter and swifter twinkled the little dancing feet
Then a door was jerked open and Bertrams voice called Billy
The music stopped instantly
Billy sprang from her seat her eyes eagerly seeking the direction from which had come the voice
Perhapsperhaps Bertram wanted her
Perhaps he was not going to paint any longer that morning after all
Billy
called the voice again
Please do you mind stopping that playing just for a little while
Im a brute I know dear but my brush will try to keep time with that crazy little tune of yours and you know my hand is none too steady anyhow and when it tries to keep up with that jiggety jig jig jiggety jig jig
Do you mind darling justjust sewing or doing something still for a while
All the light fled from Billys face but her voice when she spoke was the quintessence of cheery indifference
Why no of course not dear
Thank you
I knew you wouldnt sighed Bertram
Then the door shut
For a long minute Billy stood motionless before she glanced at her watch and sped to the telephone
Is Miss Greggory there Rosa
she called when the operators ring was answered
Mis Greggory the lame one
No Miss GreggoryMiss Alice
Oh
Yesm
Then wont you ask her to come to the telephone please
There was a moments wait during which Billys small wellshod foot beat a nervous tattoo on the floor
Oh is that you Alice
she called then
Are you going to be home for an hour or two
Why yyes yes indeed
Then Im coming over
Well play duets singanything
I want some music
Do
AndMr Arkwright is here
Hell help
Mr Arkwright
You say hes there
Then I wont Yes I will too
Billy spoke with renewed firmness
Ill be there right away
Goodby
And she hung up the receiver and went to tell Pete to order John and Peggy at once
I suppose I ought to have left Alice and Mr Arkwright alone together muttered the young wife feverishly as she hurriedly prepared for departure
But Ill make it up to them later
Im going to give them lots of chances
But to daytoday I just had to gosomewhere
At the Annex with Alice Greggory and Arkwright Billy sang duets and trios and reveled in a sonorous wilderness of new music to her hearts content
Then rested refreshed and at peace with all the world she hurried home to dinner and to Bertram
There
I feel better she sighed as she took off her hat in her own room and now Ill go find Bertram
Bless his heartof course he didnt want me to play when he was so busy
Billy went straight to the studio but Bertram was not there
Neither was he in Williams room nor anywhere in the house
Downstairs in the diningroom Pete was found looking rather white leaning back in a chair
He struggled at once to his feet however as his mistress entered the room
Billy hurried forward with a startled exclamation
Why Pete what is it
Are you sick
she cried her glance encompassing the halfset table
No maam oh no maam
The old man stumbled forward and began to arrange the knives and forks
Its just a pesky painbeggin yer pardonin my side
But I aint sick
No Missmaam
Billy frowned and shook her head
Her eyes were on Petes palpably trembling hands
But Pete you are sick she protested
Let Eliza do that
Pete drew himself stiffly erect
The color had begun to come back to his face
There haint no one set this table much but me for moren fifty years an Ive got a sort of notion that nobody can do it just ter suit me
Besides Im better now
Its gonethat pain
But Pete what is it
How long have you had it
I haint had it any time steady
Its the comin an goin kind
It seems silly ter mind it at all only when it does come it sort o takes the backbone right out o my knees and they double up sos I have ter set down
There ye see
Im pert as a sparrer now
And with stiff celerity Pete resumed his task
His mistress still frowned
That isnt right Pete she demurred with a slow shake of her head
You should see a doctor
The old man paled a little
He had seen a doctor and he had not liked what the doctor had told him
In fact he stubbornly refused to believe what the doctor had said
He straightened himself now a little aggressively
Humph
Beggin yer pardon Missmaam but I dont think much o them doctor chaps
Billy shook her head again as she smiled and turned away
Then as if casually she asked Oh did Mr Bertram go out Pete
Yes Miss about five oclock
He said hed be back to dinner
Oh
All right
From the hall the telephone jangled sharply
Ill go said Petes mistress as she turned and hurried upstairs
It was Bertrams voice that answered her opening Hullo
Oh Billy is that you dear
Well youre just the one I wanted
I wanted to saythat is I wanted to ask you The speaker cleared his throat a little nervously and began all over again
The fact is Billy Ive run across a couple of old classmates on from New York and they are very anxious I should stay down to dinner with them
Would you mindvery much if I did
A cold hand seemed to clutch Billys heart
She caught her breath with a little gasp and tried to speak but she had to try twice before the words came
Why nono of course not
Billys voice was very highpitched and a little shaky but it was surpassingly cheerful
You sure you wont belonesome
Bertrams voice was vaguely troubled
Of course not
Youve only to say the word little girl came Bertrams anxious tones again and I wont stay
Billy swallowed convulsively
If only only he would stop and leave her to herself
As if she were going to own up that she was lonesome for him if he was not lonesome for her Nonsense
of course youll stay called Billy still in that highpitched shaky treble
Then before Bertram could answer she uttered a gay Goodby
and hung up the receiver
Billy had ten whole minutes in which to cry before Petes gong sounded for dinner but she had only one minute in which to try to efface the woefully visible effects of those ten minutes before William tapped at her door and called Gone to sleep my dear
Dinners ready
Didnt you hear the gong
Yes Im coming Uncle William
Billy spoke with breezy gayety and threw open the door but she did not meet Uncle Williams eyes
Her head was turned away
Her hands were fussing with the hang of her skirt
Bertrams dining out Pete tells me observed William with cheerful nonchalance as they went downstairs together
Billy bit her lip and looked up sharply
She had been bracing herself to meet with disdainful indifference this mans pitythe pity due a poor neglected wife whose husband preferred to dine with old classmates rather than with herself
Now she found in Williams face not pity but a calm even jovial acceptance of the situation as a matter of course
She had known she was going to hate that pity but now curiously enough she was conscious only of anger that the pity was not therethat she might hate it
She tossed her head a little
So even William Uncle Williamregarded this monstrous thing as an insignificant matter of everyday experience
Maybe he expected it to occur frequentlyevery night or so
Doubtless he did expect it to occur every night or so
Indeed
Very well
As if she were going to show now that she cared whether Bertram were there or not
They should see
So with head held high and eyes asparkle Billy marched into the diningroom and took her accustomed place
CHAPTER VII THE BIG BAD QUARREL It was a brilliant dinnerbecause Billy made it so
At first William met her sallies of wit with mild surprise but it was not long before he rose gallantly to the occasion and gave back full measure of retort
Even Pete twice had to turn his back to hide a smile and once his hand shook so that the tea he was carrying almost spilled
This threatened catastrophe however seemed to frighten him so much that his face was very grave throughout the rest of the dinner
Still laughing and talking gayly Billy and Uncle William after the meal was over ascended to the drawingroom
There however the man in spite of the young womans gay badinage fell to dozing in the big chair before the fire leaving Billy with only Spunkie for companySpunkie who disdaining every effort to entice her into a romp only winked and blinked stupid eyes and finally curled herself on the rug for a nap
Billy left to her own devices glanced at her watch
Halfpast seven
Time almost for Bertram to be coming
He had said dinner and of course after dinner was over he would be coming hometo her
Very well she would show him that she had at least got along without him as well as he had without her
At all events he would not find her forlornly sitting with her nose pressed against the windowpane
And forthwith Billy established herself in a big chair with its back carefully turned toward the door by which Bertram would enter and opened a book
Five ten fifteen minutes passed
Billy fidgeted in her chair twisted her neck to look out into the halland dropped her book with a bang
Uncle William jerked himself awake and Spunkie opened sleepy eyes
Then both settled themselves for another nap
Billy sighed picked up her book and flounced back into her chair
But she did not read
Disconsolately she sat staring straight aheaduntil a quick step on the sidewalk outside stirred her into instant action
Assuming a look of absorbed interest she twitched the book open and held it before her face



But the step passed by the door and Billy saw then that her book was upside down
Five ten fifteen more minutes passed
Billy still sat apparently reading though she had not turned a page
The book now however was right side up
One by one other minutes passed till the great clock in the hall struck nine long strokes
Well well bless my soul
mumbled Uncle William resolutely forcing himself to wake up
What time was that
Nine oclock
Billy spoke with tragic distinctness yet very cheerfully
Eh
Only nine
blinked Uncle William
I thought it must be ten
Well anyhow I believe Ill go upstairs
I seem to be unusually sleepy
Billy said nothing
 Only nine indeed
she was thinking wrathfully
At the door Uncle William turned
Youre not going to sit up my dear of course he remarked
For the second time that evening a cold hand seemed to clutch Billys heart
Sit up Had it come already to that
Was she even now a wife who had need to sit up for her husband
I really wouldnt my dear advised Uncle William again
Good night
Oh but Im not sleepy at all yet Billy managed to declare brightly
Good night
Then Uncle William went upstairs
Billy turned to her book which happened to be one of Williams on Fake Antiques
 To collect anything these days requires expert knowledge and the utmost care and discrimination  read Billys eyes
So Uncle William expected Bertram was going to spend the whole evening as well as stay to dinner
ran Billys thoughts
 The enormous quantity of bijouterie Dresden and Battersea enamel ware that is now flooding the market is made on the Continentand made chiefly for the American trade  continued the book
Well who cares if it is snapped Billy springing to her feet and tossing the volume aside
Spunkie come here
Youve simply got to play with me
Do you hear
I want to be gay gayGAY
Hes gay
Hes down there with those men where he wants to be
Where hed rather be than be with me
Do you think I want him to come home and find me moping over a stupid old book
Not much
Im going to have him find me gay too
Now come Spunkie hurrywake up
Hell be here right away Im sure
And Billy shook a pair of worsted reins hung with little soft balls full in Spunkies face
But Spunkie would not wake up and Spunkie would not play
She pretended to
She bit at the reins and sank her sharp claws into the dangling balls
For a fleeting instant even something like mischief gleamed in her big yellow eyes
Then the jaws relaxed the paws turned to velvet and Spunkies sleek gray head settled slowly back into lazy comfort
Spunkie was asleep
Billy gazed at the cat with reproachful eyes
And you too Spunkie she murmured
Then she got to her feet and went back to her chair
This time she picked up a magazine and began to turn the leaves very fast one after another
Halfpast nine came then ten
Pete appeared at the door to get Spunkie and to see that everything was all right for the night
Mr Bertram is not in yet
he began doubtfully
Billy shook her head with a bright smile
No Pete
Go to bed
I expect him every minute
Good night
Thank you maam
Good night
The old man picked up the sleepy cat and went downstairs
A little later Billy heard his quiet steps coming back through the hall and ascending the stairs
She listened until from away at the top of the house she heard his door close
Then she drew a long breath
Ten oclockafter ten oclock and Bertram not there yet
And was this what he called dinner
Did one eat then till ten oclock when one dined with ones friends
Billy was angry nowvery angry
She was too angry to be reasonable
This thing that her husband had done seemed monstrous to her smarting as she was under the sting of hurt pride and grieved lonelinessthe state of mind into which she had worked herself
No longer now did she wish to be gay when her husband came
No longer did she even pretend to assume indifference
Bertram had done wrong
He had been unkind cruel thoughtless inconsiderate of her comfort and happiness
Furthermore he did not love her as well as she did him or he never never could have done it
She would let him see when he came just how hurt and grieved she was and how disappointed too
Billy was walking the floor now back and forth back and forth
Halfpast ten came then eleven
As the eleven long strokes reverberated through the silent house Billy drew in her breath and held it suspended
A new look came to her eyes
A growing terror crept into them and culminated in a frightened stare at the clock
Billy ran then to the great outer door and pulled it open
A cold wind stung her face and caused her to shut the door quickly
Back and forth she began to pace the floor again but in five minutes she had run to the door once more
This time she wore a heavy coat of Bertrams which she caught up as she passed the hallrack
Out on to the broad top step Billy hurried and peered down the street
As far as she could see not a person was in sight
Across the street in the Public Garden the wind stirred the gray treebranches and set them to casting weird shadows on the bare frozen ground
A warning something behind her sent Billy scurrying into the house just in time to prevent the heavy doors closing and shutting her out keyless in the cold
Halfpast eleven came and again Billy ran to the door
This time she put the floormat against the casing so that the door could not close
Once more she peered wildly up and down the street and across into the deserted windswept Garden
There was only terror now in Billys face
The anger was all gone
In Billys mind there was not a shadow of doubtsomething had happened to Bertram
Bertram was illhurtdead
And he was so good so kind so noble such a dear dear husband
If only she could see him once
If only she could ask his forgiveness for those wicked unkind accusing thoughts
If only she could tell him again that she did love him
If only Far down the street a step rang sharply on the frosty air
A masculine figure was hurrying toward the house
Retreating well into the shadow of the doorway Billy watched it her heart pounding against her side in great suffocating throbs
Nearer and nearer strode the approaching figure until Billy had almost sprung to meet it with a glad cryalmost but not quite for the figure neither turned nor paused but marched straight onand Billy saw then under the arc light a brownbearded man who was not Bertram at all
Three times during the next few minutes did the waiting little bride on the doorstep watch with palpitating yearning a shadowy form appear approachand pass by
At the third heartbreaking disappointment Billy wrung her hands helplessly
I dont see how there can beso many utterly useless people in the world
she choked
Then thoroughly chilled and sick at heart she went into the house and closed the door
Once again back and forth back and forth Billy took up her weary vigil
She still wore the heavy coat
She had forgotten to take it off
Her face was pitifully white and drawn
Her eyes were wild
One of her hands was nervously caressing the rough sleeve of the coat as it hung from her shoulder
Onetwothree Billy gave a sharp cry and ran into the hall
Yes it was twelve oclock
And now always all the rest of the dreary useless hours that that clock would tick away through an endless existence she would have to livewithout Bertram
If only she could see him once more
But she could not
He was dead
He must be dead now
Here it was twelve oclock and There came a quick step the click of a key in the lock then the door swung back and Bertram big strong and merryeyed stood before her
Well well hullo he called jovially
Why Billy whats the matter
he broke off in quite a different tone of voice
And then a curious thing happened
Billy who a minute before had been seeing only a dear noble adorable lost Bertram saw now suddenly only the man that had stayed happily till midnight with two friends while sheshe Matter
Matter
exclaimed Billy sharply then
Is this what you call staying to dinner Bertram Henshaw
Bertram stared
A slow red stole to his forehead
It was his first experience of coming home to meet angry eyes that questioned his behavior and he did not like it
He had been perhaps a little consciencesmitten when he saw how late he had stayed and he had intended to say he was sorry of course
But to be thus sharply called to account for a perfectly innocent good time with a couple of friends
To come home and find Billy making a ridiculous scene like this
Hehe would not stand for it
He Bertrams lips snapped open
The angry retort was almost spoken when something in the piteously quivering chin and white drawn face opposite stopped it just in time
Why Billydarling
he murmured instead
It was Billys turn to change
All the anger melted away before the dismayed tenderness in those dear eyes and the grieved hurt in that dear voice
Well youyouI Billy began to cry
It was all right then of course for the next minute she was crying on Bertrams big broad shoulder and in the midst of broken words kisses gentle pats and inarticulate croonings the Big Bad Quarrel that had been all ready to materialize faded quite away into nothingness
I didnt have such an awfully good time anyhow avowed Bertram when speech became rational
Id rather have been home with you
Nonsense
blinked Billy valiantly
Of course you had a good time and it was perfectly right you should have it too
And II hope youll have it again
I shant emphasized Bertram promptly not and leave you
Billy regarded him with adoring eyes
Ill tell you well have em come here she proposed gayly
Sure we will agreed Bertram
Yes sure we will echoed Billy with a contented sigh
Then a little breathlessly she added Anyhow Ill knowwhere you are
I wont think youredead
Youblessedlittlegoose
scolded Bertram punctuating each word with a kiss
Billy drew a long sigh
If this is a quarrel Im going to have them often she announced placidly
Billy
The young husband was plainly aghast
Well I ambecause I like the makingup dimpled Billy with a mischievous twinkle as she broke from his clasp and skipped ahead up the stairway
CHAPTER VIII BILLY CULTIVATES A COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE The next morning under the uncompromising challenge of a bright sun Billy began to be uneasily suspicious that she had been just a bit unreasonable and exacting the night before
To make matters worse she chanced to run across a newspaper criticism of a new book bearing the ominous title When the Honeymoon Wanes A Talk to Young Wives
Such a title of course attracted her supersensitive attention at once and with a curiously faint feeling she picked up the paper and began to read
As the most of the criticism was taken up with quotations from the book it was such sentences as these that met her startled eyes Perhaps the first test comes when the young wife awakes to the realization that while her husband loves her very much he can still make plans with his old friends which do not include herself



Then is when the foolish wife lets her husband see how hurt she is that he can want to be with any one but herself



Then is when the husbandused all his life to independence perhapsbegins to chafe under these new bonds that hold him so fast



No man likes to be held up at the end of a threatened scene and made to give an account of himself



Before a woman has learned to cultivate a comfortable indifference to her husbands comings and goings she is apt to be tyrannical and exacting
 Comfortable indifference indeed
stormed Billy to herself
As if I ever could be comfortably indifferent to anything Bertram did
She dropped the paper but there were still other quotations from the book there she knew and in a moment she was back at the table reading them
No man however fondly he loves his wife likes to feel that she is everlastingly peering into the recesses of his mind and weighing his every act to find out if he does or does not love her to day as well as he did yesterday at this time



Then when spontaneity is dead she is the chief mourner at its funeral



A few couples never leave the Garden of Eden
They grow old hand in hand
They are the ones who bear and forbear who have learned to adjust themselves to the intimate relationship of living together



A certain amount of liberty both of action and thought must be allowed on each side



The family shut in upon itself grows so narrow that all interest in the outside world is lost



No two people are ever fitted to fill each others lives entirely
They ought not to try to do it
If they do try the process is belittling to each and the result if it is successful is nothing less than a tragedy for it could not mean the highest ideals nor the truest devotion



Brushing up against other interests and other personalities is good for both husband and wife
Then to each other they bring the best of what they have found and each to the other continues to be new and interesting



The young wife however is apt to be jealous of everything that turns her husbands attention for one moment away from herself
She is jealous of his thoughts his words his friends even his business



But the wife who has learned to be the clinging vine when her husband wishes her to cling and to be the sturdy oak when clinging vines would be tiresome has solved a tremendous problem
At this point Billy dropped the paper
She flung it down indeed a bit angrily
There were still a few more words in the criticism mostly the critics own opinion of the book but Billy did not care for this
She had read quite enough boo much in fact
All that sort of talk might be very well even necessary perhaps she told herself for ordinary husbands and wives
but for her and Bertram Then vividly before her rose those initial quoted words Perhaps the first test comes when the young wife awakes to the realization that while her husband loves her very much he can still make plans with his old friends which do not include herself
Billy frowned and put her finger to her lips
Was that then last night a test
Had she been tyrannical and exacting
Was she everlastingly peering into the recesses of Bertrams mind and weighing his every act
Was Bertram already beginning to chafe under these new bonds that held him
No no never that
She could not believe that
But what if he should sometime begin to chafe
What if they two should in days to come degenerate into just the ordinary everyday married folk whom she saw about her everywhere and for whom just such horrid books as this must be written
It was unbelievable unthinkable
And yet that man had said With a despairing sigh Billy picked up the paper once more and read carefully every word again
When she had finished she stood soberly thoughtful her eyes out of the window
After all it was nothing but the same old story
She was exacting
She did want her husbands every thought
She gloried in peering into every last recess of his mind if she had half a chance
She was jealous of his work
She had almost hated his paintingat times
She had held him up with a threatened scene only the night before and demanded that he should give an account of himself
She had very likely been the clinging vine when she should have been the sturdy oak
Very well then
Billy lifted her head and threw back her shoulders
He should have no further cause for complaint
She would be an oak
She would cultivate that comfortable indifference to his comings and goings
She would brush up against other interests and personalities so as to be new and interesting to her husband
She would not be tyrannical exacting or jealous
She would not threaten scenes nor peer into recesses
Whatever happened she would not let Bertram begin to chafe against those bonds
Having arrived at this heroic and to her eminently satisfactory state of mind Billy turned from the window and fell to work on a piece of manuscript music
 Brush up against other interests  she admonished herself sternly as she reached for her pen
Theoretically it was beautiful but practically Billy began at once to be that oak
Not an hour after she had first seen the fateful notice of When the Honeymoon Wanes Bertrams ring sounded at the door downstairs
Bertram always let himself in with his latchkey but from the first of Billys being there he had given a peculiar ring at the bell which would bring his wife flying to welcome him if she were anywhere in the house
Today when the bell sounded Billy sprang as usual to her feet with a joyous Theres Bertram
But the next moment she fell back
Tut tut Billy Neilson Henshaw
Learn to cultivate a comfortable indifference to your husbands comings and goings she whispered fiercely
Then she sat down and fell to work again
A moment later she heard her husbands voice talking to some onePete she surmised
Here
You say shes here
Then she heard Bertrams quick step on the stairs
The next minute very quietly he came to her door
Ho
he ejaculated gayly as she rose to receive his kiss
I thought Id find you asleep when you didnt hear my ring
Billy reddened a little
Oh no I wasnt asleep
But you didnt hear Bertram stopped abruptly an odd look in his eyes
Maybe you did hear it though he corrected
Billy colored more confusedly
The fact that she looked so distressed did not tend to clear Bertrams face
Why of course Billy I didnt mean to insist on your coming to meet me he began a little stiffly but Billy interrupted him
Why Bertram I just love to go to meet you she maintained indignantly
Then remembering just in time she amended That is I did love to meet you until With a sudden realization that she certainly had not helped matters any she came to an embarrassed pause
A puzzled frown showed on Bertrams face
You did love to meet me until he repeated after her then his face changed
Billy you arentyou cant be laying up last night against me
he reproached her a little irritably
Last night
Why of course not retorted Billy in a panic at the bare mention of the test whichaccording to When the Honeymoon Waneswas at the root of all her misery
Already she thought she detected in Bertrams voice signs that he was beginning to chafe against those bonds
It is a matter of of the utmost indifference to me what time you come home at night my dear she finished airily as she sat down to her work again
Bertram stared then he frowned turned on his heel and left the room
Bertram who knew nothing of the Talk to Young Wives in the newspaper at Billys feet was surprised puzzled and just a bit angry
Billy left alone jabbed her pen with such force against her paper that the note she was making became an unsightly blot
Well if this is what that man calls being comfortably indifferent Id hate to try the uncomfortable kind she muttered with emphasis
CHAPTER IX THE DINNER BILLY TRIED TO GET Notwithstanding what Billy was disposed to regard as the nonsuccess of her first attempt to profit by the Talk to Young Wives she still frantically tried to avert the waning of her honeymoon
Assiduously she cultivated the prescribed indifference and with at least apparent enthusiasm she sought the muchtobedesired outside interests
That is she did all this when she thought of it when something reminded her of the sword of destruction hanging over her happiness
At other times when she was just being happy without question she was her old self impulsive affectionate and altogether adorable
Naturally under these circumstances her conduct was somewhat erratic
For three days perhaps she would fly to the door at her husbands ring and hang upon his every movement
Then for the next three she would be a veritable willo thewisp for elusiveness caring apparently not one whit whether her husband came or went until poor Bertram at his wits end scourged himself with a merciless catechism as to what he had done to vex her
Then perhaps just when he had nerved himself almost to the point of asking her what was the trouble there would come another change bringing back to him the old Billy joyous winsome and devoted plainly caring nothing for anybody or anything but himself
Scarcely however would he become sure that it was his Billy back again before she was off once more quite beyond his reach singing with Arkwright and Alice Greggory playing with Tommy Dunn plunging into some club or church workanything but being with him
That all this was puzzling and disquieting to Bertram Billy not once suspected
Billy so far as she was concerned was but cultivating a comfortable indifference brushing up against outside interests and being an oak
December passed and January came bringing Miss Marguerite Winthrop to her Boston home
Bertrams arm was as good as ever now according to its owner and the sittings for the new portrait began at once
This left Billy even more to her own devices for Bertram entered into his new work with an enthusiasm born of a glad relief from forced idleness and a consuming eagerness to prove that even though he had failed the first time he could paint a portrait of Marguerite Winthrop that would be a credit to himself a conclusive retort to his critics and a source of pride to his once mortified friends
With his whole heart therefore he threw himself into the work before him staying sometimes well into the afternoon on the days Miss Winthrop could find time between her social engagements to give him a sitting
It was on such a day toward the middle of the month that Billy was called to the telephone at halfpast twelve oclock to speak to her husband
Billy dear began Bertram at once if you dont mind Im staying to luncheon at Miss Winthrops kind request
Weve changed the pose neither of us was satisfied you knowbut we havent quite settled on the new one
Miss Winthrop has two whole hours this afternoon that she can give me if Ill stay and of course under the circumstances I want to do it
Of course echoed Billy
Billys voice was indomitably cheerful
Thank you dear
I knew youd understand sighed Bertram contentedly
You see really two whole hours soits a chance I cant afford to lose
Of course you cant echoed Billy again
All right then
Goodby till tonight called the man
Goodby answered Billy still cheerfully
As she turned away however she tossed her head
A new pose indeed
she muttered with some asperity
Just as if there could be a new pose after all those she tried last year
Immediately after luncheon Pete and Eliza started for South Boston to pay a visit to Elizas mother and it was soon after they left the house that Bertram called his wife up again
Say dearie I forgot to tell you he began but I met an old friend in the subway this morning and Iwell I remembered what you said about bringing em home to dinner next time so I asked him for tonight
Do you mind
Its Mind
Of course not
Im glad you did plunged in Billy with feverish eagerness
Even now just the bare mention of anything connected with that awful test night was enough to set Billys nerves to tingling
I want you to always bring them home Bertram
All right dear
Well be there at six oclock then
Itsits Calderwell this time
You remember Calderwell of course
NotHugh Calderwell
Billys question was a little faint
Sure
Bertram laughed oddly and lowered his voice
I suspect once I wouldnt have brought him home to you
I was too jealous
But nowwell now maybe I want him to see what hes lost
Bertram But Bertram only laughed mischievously and called a gay Goodby till tonight then
Billy at her end of the wires hung up the receiver and backed against the wall a little palpitatingly
Calderwell
To dinnerCalderwell
Did she remember Calderwell
Did she indeed
As if one could easily forget the man that for a year or two had proposed marriage as regularly and almost as lightly
as he had torn a monthly leaf from his calendar
Besides was it not he too who had said that Bertram would never love any girl really that it would be only the tilt of her chin or the turn of her head that he lovedto paint
And now he was coming to dinnerand with Bertram
Very well he should see
He should see that Bertram did love her hernot the tilt of her chin nor the turn of her head
He should see how happy they were what a good wife she made and how devoted and satisfied Bertram was in his home
He should see
And forthwith Billy picked up her skirts and tripped upstairs to select her very prettiest housegown to do honor to the occasion
Upstairs however one thing and another delayed her so that it was four oclock when she turned her attention to her toilet and it was while she was hesitating whether to be stately and impressive in royally sumptuous blue velvet and ermine or cozy and tantalizingly homysic in bronzegold crepe de Chine and swansdown that the telephone bell rang again
Eliza and Pete had not yet returned so as before Billy answered it
This time Elizas shaking voice came to her
Is that you maam
Why yes Eliza
Yesm its me maam
Its about Uncle Pete
Hes give us a turn thats most scared us out of our wits
Pete
You mean hes sick
Yes maam he was
That is he is too only hes better now thank goodness panted Eliza
But he aint hisself yet
Hes that white and shaky
Would youcould youthat is would you mind if we didnt come back till into the evenin maybe
Why of course not cried Petes mistress quickly
Dont come a minute before hes able Eliza
Dont come until tomorrow
Eliza gave a trembling little laugh
Thank you maam but there wouldnt be no keepin of Uncle Pete here till then
If he could take five steps alone hed start now
But he cant
He says hell be all right pretty quick though
Hes had em beforethese spells but never quite so bad as this I guess an hes worryin somethin turrible cause he cant start for home right away
Nonsense
cut in Mrs Bertram Henshaw
Yesm
I knew youd feel that way stammered Eliza gratefully
You see I couldnt leave him to come alone and besides anyhow Id have to stay for mother aint no more use than a wet dishrag at such times shes that scared herself
And she aint very well too
So ifif you could get along Of course we can
And tell Pete not to worry one bit
Im so sorry hes sick
Thank you maam
Then well be there some time this evenin sighed Eliza
From the telephone Billy turned away with a troubled face
Pete is ill she was saying to herself
I dont like the looks of it and hes so faithful hed come if With a little cry Billy stopped short
Then tremblingly she sank into the nearest chair
Calderwelland hes coming to dinner she moaned
For two benumbed minutes Billy sat staring at nothing
Then she ran to the telephone and called the Annex
Aunt Hannah answered
Aunt Hannah for heavens sake if you love me pleaded Billy send Rosa down instanter
Pete is sick over to South Boston and Eliza is with him and Bertram is bringing Hugh Calderwell home to dinner
Can you spare Rosa
Oh my grief and conscience Billy
Of course I canI mean I couldbut Rosa isnt here dear child
Its her day out you know
O dear of course it is
I might have known if Id thought but Pete and Eliza have spoiled me
They never take days out at meal time both together I meanuntil tonight
But my dear child what will you do
I dont know
Ive got to think
I must do something
Of course you must
Id come over myself if it wasnt for my cold
As if Id let you
There isnt anybody here only Tommy
Even Alice is gone
Oh Billy Billy this only goes to prove what Ive always said that no woman ought to be a wife until shes an efficient housekeeper and Yes yes Aunt Hannah I know moaned Billy frenziedly
But I am a wife and Im not an efficient housekeeper and Hugh Calderwell wont wait for me to learn
Hes coming tonight
Tonight And Ive got to do something
Never mind
Ill fix it some way
Goodby
But Billy Billy
Oh my grief and conscience fluttered Aunt Hannahs voice across the wires as Billy snapped the receiver into place
For the second time that day Billy backed palpitatingly against the wall
Her eyes sought the clock fearfully
Fifteen minutes past four
She had an hour and three quarters
She could of course telephone Bertram to dine Calderwell at a club or some hotel
But to do this now the very first time when it had been her own suggestion that he bring them homeno no she could not do that
Anything but that
Besides very likely she could not reach Bertram anyway
Doubtless he had left the Winthrops by this time
There was Marie
She could telephone Marie
But Marie could not very well come just now she knew and then too there was Cyril to be taken into consideration
How Cyril would gibe at the wife who had to call in all the neighbors just because her husband was bringing home a friend to dinner
How he would Well he shouldnt
He should not have the chance
So there
With a jerk Mrs Bertram Henshaw pulled herself away from the wall and stood erect
Her eyes snapped and the very poise of her chin spelled determination
Very well she would show them
Was not Bertram bringing this man home because he was proud of her
Mighty proud he would be if she had to call in half of Boston to get his dinner for him
Nonsense
She would get it herself
Was not this the time if ever to be an oak
A vine doubtless would lean and cling and telephone and whine I cant
But not an oak
An oak would hold up its head and say I can
An oak would go ahead and get that dinner
She would be an oak
She would get that dinner
What if she didnt know how to cook bread and cake and pies and things
One did not have to cook bread and cake and pies just to get a dinner meat and potatoes and vegetables
Besides she could make peach fritters
She knew she could
She would show them
And with actually a bit of song on her lips Billy skipped upstairs for her ruffled apron and dust captwo necessary accompaniments to this dinnergetting in her opinion
Billy found the apron and dustcap with no difficulty but it took fully ten of her precious minutes to unearth from its obscure hidingplace the blueandgold Brides Helper cookbook one of Aunt Hannahs wedding gifts
On the way to the kitchen Billy planned her dinner
As was natural perhaps she chose the things she herself would like to eat
I wont attempt anything very elaborate she said to herself
It would be wiser to have something simple like chicken pie perhaps
I love chicken pie
And Ill have oyster stew first that is after the grapefruit
Just oysters boiled in milk must be easier than soup to make
Ill begin with grapefruit with a cherry in it like Pete fixes it
Those dont have to be cooked anyhow
Ill have fishBertram loves the fish course
Let me see halibut I guess with egg sauce
I wont have any roast nothing but the chicken pie
And Ill have squash and onions
I can have a salad easyjust lettuce and stuff
That doesnt have to be cooked
Oh and the peach fritters if I get time to make them
For dessertwell maybe I can find a new pie or pudding in the cookbook
I want to use that cookbook for something after hunting all this time for it
In the kitchen Billy found exquisite neatness and silence
The first brought an approving light to her eyes but the second for some unapparent reason filled her heart with vague misgiving
This feeling however Billy resolutely cast from her as she crossed the room dropped her book on to the table and turned toward the shining black stove
There was an excellent fire
Glowing points of light showed that only a good draft was needed to make the whole mass of coal redhot
Billy however did not know this
Her experience of fires was confined to burning wood in open grates and wood in open grates had to be poked to make it red and glowing
With confident alacrity now therefore Billy caught up the poker thrust it into the mass of coals and gave them a fine stirring up
Then she set back the lid of the stove and went to hunt up the ingredients for her dinner
By the time Billy had searched five minutes and found no chicken no oysters and no halibut it occurred to her that her larder was not after all an open market and that ones provisions must be especially ordered to fit ones needs
As to ordering them nowBilly glanced at the clock and shook her head
Its almost five already and theyd never get here in time she sighed regretfully
Ill have to have something else
Billy looked now not for what she wanted but for what she could find
And she found some cold roast lamb at which she turned up her nose an uncooked beefsteak which she appropriated doubtfully a raw turnip and a head of lettuce which she hailed with glee and some beets potatoes onions and grapefruit from all of which she took a generous supply
Thus laden she went back to the kitchen
Spread upon the table they made a brave show
Oh well Ill have quite a dinner after all she triumphed cocking her head happily
And now for the dessert she finished pouncing on the cookbook
It was while she was turning the leaves to find the pies and puddings that she ran across the vegetables and found the word beets staring her in the face
Mechanically she read the line below
Winter beets will require three hours to cook
Use hot water
Billys startled eyes sought the clock
Three hoursand it was five now
Frenziedly then she ran her finger down the page
Onions one and onehalf hours
Use hot water
Turnips require a long time but if cut thin they will cook in an hour and a quarter
An hour and a quarter indeed
she moaned
Isnt there anything anywhere that doesnt take forever to cook
Early peas 


green corn 


summer squash 


mumbled Billys dry lips
But what do folks eat in JanuaryJanuary
It was the apparently inoffensive sentence New potatoes will boil in thirty minutes that brought fresh terror to Billys soul and set her to fluttering the cookbook leaves with renewed haste
If it took new potatoes thirty minutes to cook how long did it take old ones
In vain she searched for the answer
There were plenty of potatoes
They were mashed whipped scalloped creamed fried and broiled they were made into puffs croquettes potato border and potato snow
For many of these they were boiled firstuntil tender one rule said
But that doesnt tell me how long it takes to get em tender fumed Billy despairingly
I suppose they think anybody ought to know that but I dont
Suddenly her eyes fell once more on the instructions for boiling turnips and her face cleared
If it helps to cut turnips thin why not potatoes
she cried
I can do that anyhow and I will she finished with a sigh of relief as she caught up half a dozen potatoes and hurried into the pantry for a knife
A few minutes later the potatoes peeled and cut almost to wafer thinness were dumped into a basin of cold water
There
now I guess youll cook nodded Billy to the dish in her hand as she hurried to the stove
Chilled by an ominous unresponsiveness Billy lifted the stove lid and peered inside
Only a mass of black and graying coals greeted her
The fire was out
To think that even you had to go back on me like this
upbraided Billy eyeing the dismal mass with reproachful gaze
This disaster however as Billy knew was not so great as it seemed for there was still the gas stove
In the old days under Dong Lings rule there had been no gas stove
Dong Ling disapproved of devil stoves that had no coalee no woodee but burned like hellee
Eliza however did approve of them and not long after her arrival a fine one had been put in for her use
So now Billy soon had her potatoes with a brisk blaze under them
In frantic earnest then Billy went to work
Brushing the discarded onions turnip and beets into a pail under the table she was still confronted with the beefsteak lettuce and grapefruit
All but the beefsteak she pushed to one side with gentle pats
Youre all right she nodded to them
I can use you
You dont have to be cooked bless your hearts
But you
Billy scowled at the beefsteak and ran her finger down the index of the Brides HelperBilly knew how to handle that book now
No you dontnot for me
she muttered after a minute shaking her finger at the tenderloin on the table
I havent got any hot coals and I thought a gridiron was where they played football though it seems its some sort of a dish to cook you in herebut I shouldnt know it from a teaspoon probably if I should see it
No sir
Its back to the refrigerator for you and a nice cold sensible roast leg of lamb for me that doesnt have to be cooked
Understand
Cooked she finished as she carried the beefsteak away and took possession of the hitherto despised cold lamb
Once more Billy made a mad search through cupboards and shelves
This time she bore back in triumph a can of corn another of tomatoes and a glass jar of preserved peaches
In the kitchen a cheery bubbling from the potatoes on the stove greeted her
Billys spirits rose with the steam
There Spunkie she said gayly to the cat who had just uncurled from a nap behind the stove
Tell me I cant get up a dinner
And maybe well have the peach fritters too she chirped
Ive got the peachpart anyway
But Billy did not have the peach fritters after all
She got out the sugar and the flour to be sure and she made a great ado looking up the rule but a hurried glance at the clock sent her into the diningroom to set the table and all thought of the peach fritters was given up
CHAPTER X THE DINNER BILLY GOT At five minutes of six Bertram and Calderwell came
Bertram gave his peculiar ring and let himself in with his latchkey but Billy did not meet him in the hall nor in the drawingroom
Excusing himself Bertram hurried upstairs
Billy was not in her room nor anywhere on that floor
She was not in Williams room
Coming downstairs to the hall again Bertram confronted William who had just come in
Wheres Billy
demanded the young husband with just a touch of irritation as if he suspected William of having Billy in his pocket
William stared slightly
Why I dont know
Isnt she here
Ill ask Pete frowned Bertram
In the diningroom Bertram found no one though the table was prettily set and showed half a grapefruit at each place
In the kitchen in the kitchen Bertram found a din of rattling tin an odor of burned food a confusion of scattered pots and pans a frightened cat who peered at him from under a littered stove and a flushed disheveled young woman in a blue dustcap and ruffled apron whom he finally recognized as his wife
Why Billy
he gasped
Billy who was struggling with something at the sink turned sharply
Bertram Henshaw she panted I used to think you were wonderful because you could paint a picture
I even used to think I was a little wonderful because I could write a song
Well I dont any more
But Ill tell you who is wonderful
Its Eliza and Rosa and all the rest of those women who can get a meal on to the table all at once so its fit to eat
Why Billy
gasped Bertram again falling back to the door he had closed behind him
What in the world does this mean
Mean
It means Im getting dinner choked Billy
Cant you see
ButPete
Eliza
Theyre sickI mean hes sick and I said Id do it
Id be an oak
But how did I know there wasnt anything in the house except stuff that took hours to cookonly potatoes
And how did I know that they cooked in no time and then got all smushy and wet staying in the water
And how did I know that everything else would stick on and burn on till youd used every dish there was in the house to cook em in
Why Billy
gasped Bertram for the third time
And then because he had been married only six months instead of six years he made the mistake of trying to argue with a woman whose nerves were already at the snapping point
But dear it was so foolish of you to do all this
Why didnt you telephone
Why didnt you get somebody
Like an irate little tigress Billy turned at bay
Bertram Henshaw she flamed angrily if you dont go upstairs and tend to that man up there I shall scream
Now go
Ill be up when I can
And Bertram went
It was not so very long after all before Billy came in to greet her guest
She was not stately and imposing in royally sumptuous blue velvet and ermine nor yet was she cozy and homy in bronzegold crepe de Chine and swansdown
She was just herself in a pretty little morning house gown of blue gingham
She was minus the dustcap and the ruffled apron but she had a dab of flour on the left cheek and a smutch of crock on her forehead
She had too a cut finger on her right hand and a burned thumb on her left
But she was Billyand being Billy she advanced with a bright smile and held out a cordial hand not even wincing when the cut finger came under Calderwells hearty clasp
Im glad to see you she welcomed him
Youll excuse my not appearing sooner Im sure fordidnt Bertram tell youIm playing Bridget tonight
But dinner is ready now and well go down please she smiled as she laid a light hand on her guests arm
Behind her Bertram remembering the scene in the kitchen stared in sheer amazement
Bertram it might be mentioned again had been married six months not six years
What Billy had intended to serve for a simple dinner that night was grapefruit with cherries oyster stew boiled halibut with egg sauce chicken pie squash onions and potatoes peach fritters a lettuce and stuff salad and some new pie or pudding
What she did serve was grapefruit without the cherries cold roast lamb potatoes a mush of sogginess tomatoes canned and slightly burned corn canned and very much burned lettuce plain and for dessert preserved peaches and cake the latter rather dry and stale
Such was Billys dinner
The grapefruit everybody ate
The cold lamb too met with a hearty reception especially after the potatoes corn and tomatoes were served and tasted
Outwardly through it all Billy was gayety itself
Inwardly she was burning up with anger and mortification
And because she was all this there was apparently no limit to her laughter and sparkling repartee as she talked with Calderwell her guestthe guest who according to her original plans was to be shown how happy she and Bertram were what a good wife she made and how devoted and satisfied Bertram was in his home
William picking at his dinneras only a hungry man can pick at a dinner that is uneatable watched Billy with a puzzled uneasy frown
Bertram choking over the few mouthfuls he ate marked his wifes animated face and Calderwells absorbed attention and settled into gloomy silence
But it could not continue forever
The preserved peaches were eaten at last and the stale cake left
Billy had forgotten the coffee which was just as well perhaps
Then the four trailed upstairs to the drawingroom
At nine oclock an anxious Eliza and a remorseful apologetic Pete came home and descended to the horror the once orderly kitchen and dining room had become
At ten Calderwell with very evident reluctance tore himself away from Billys gay badinage and said good night
At two minutes past ten an exhausted nerveracked Billy was trying to cry on the shoulders of both Uncle William and Bertram at once
There there child dont
It went off all right patted Uncle William
Billy darling pleaded Bertram please dont cry so
As if Id ever let you step foot in that kitchen again
At this Billy raised a tearwet face aflame with indignant determination
As if Id ever let you keep me from it Bertram Henshaw after this
she contested
Im not going to do another thing in all my life but cook When I think of the stuff we had to eat after all the time I took to get it Im simply crazy
Do you think Id run the risk of such a thing as this ever happening again
CHAPTER XI CALDERWELL DOES SOME QUESTIONING On the day after his dinner with Mr and Mrs Bertram Henshaw Hugh Calderwell left Boston and did not return until more than a month had passed
One of his first acts when he did come was to look up Mr M J Arkwright at the address which Billy had given him
Calderwell had not seen Arkwright since they parted in Paris some two years before after a six months tramp through Europe together
Calderwell liked Arkwright then greatly and he lost no time now in renewing the acquaintance
The address as given by Billy proved to be an attractive but modest apartment hotel near the Conservatory of Music and Calderwell was delighted to find Arkwright at home in his comfortable little bachelor suite
Arkwright greeted him most cordially
Well well he cried if it isnt Calderwell
And hows Mont Blanc
Or is it the Killarney Lakes this time or maybe the Sphinx that I should inquire for eh
Guess again laughed Calderwell throwing off his heavy coat and settling himself comfortably in the invitinglooking morris chair his friend pulled forward
Shant do it retorted Arkwright with a smile
I never gamble on palpable uncertainties except for a chance throw or two as I gave a minute ago
Your movements are altogether too erratic and too farreaching for ordinary mortals to keep track of
Well maybe youre right grinned Calderwell appreciatively
Anyhow you would have lost this time sure thing for Ive been working
Seen the doctor yet
queried Arkwright coolly pushing the cigars across the table
Thanksfor both sniffed Calderwell with a reproachful glance helping himself
Your good judgment in some matters is still unimpaired I see he observed tapping the little gilded band which had told him the cigar was an old favorite
As to other matters howeveryoure wrong again my friend in your surmise
I am not sick and I have been working
So
Well Im told they have very good specialists here
Some one of them ought to hit your case
Stillhow long has it been running
Arkwrights face showed only grave concern
Oh come let up Arkwright snapped Calderwell striking his match alight with a vigorous jerk
Ill admit I havent ever given any special indication of an absorbing passion for work
But what can you expect of a fellow born with a whole dozen silver spoons in his mouth
And thats what I was according to Bertram Henshaw
According to him again its a wonder I ever tried to feed myself and perhaps hes right with my mouth already so full
I should say so laughed Arkwright
Well be that as it may
Im going to feed myself and Im going to earn my feed too
I havent climbed a mountain or paddled a canoe for a year
Ive been in Chicago cultivating the acquaintance of John Doe and Richard Roe
You meanlaw
Sure
I studied it here for a while before that bout of ours a couple of years ago
Billy drove me away then
BillyerMrs
Henshaw
Yes
I thought I told you
She turned down my tenthdozen proposal so emphatically that I lost all interest in Boston and took to the tall timber again
But Ive come back
A friend of my fathers wrote me to come on and consider a good opening there was in his law office
I came on a month ago and considered
Then I went back to pack up
Now Ive come for good and here I am
You have my history to date
Now tell me of yourself
Youre looking as fit as a penny from the mint even though you have discarded that lovely brown beard
Was that a concession toerMary Jane
Arkwright lifted a quick hand of protest
 Michael Jeremiah please
There is no Mary Jane now he said a bit stiffly
The other stared a little
Then he gave a low chuckle
 Michael Jeremiah  he repeated musingly eyeing the glowing tip of his cigar
And to think how that mysterious M
J
used to tantalize me
Do you mean he added turning slowly that no one calls you Mary Jane now
Not if they know what is best for them
Oh
Calderwell noted the smouldering fire in the others eyes a little curiously
Very well
Ill take the hintMichael Jeremiah
Thanks
Arkwright relaxed a little
To tell the truth Ive had quite enough nowof Mary Jane
Very good
So be it nodded the other still regarding his friend thoughtfully
But tell me what of yourself
Arkwright shrugged his shoulders
Theres nothing to tell
Youve seen
Im here
Humph
Very pretty scoffed Calderwell
Then if you wont tell I will
I saw Billy a month ago you see
It seems youve hit the trail for Grand Opera as you threatened to that night in Paris but you havent brought up in vaudeville as you prophesied you would dothough for that matter judging from the plums some of the stars are picking on the vaudeville stage nowadays that isnt to be sneezed at
But Billy says youve made two or three appearances already on the sacred boards themselvesone of them a subscription performanceand that you created no end of a sensation
Nonsense
Im merely a student at the Opera School here scowled Arkwright
Oh yes Billy said you were that but she also said you wouldnt be long
That youd already had one good offerIm not speaking of marriage and that you were going abroad next summer and that they were all insufferably proud of you
Nonsense
scowled Arkwright again coloring like a girl
That is only some ofof Mrs Henshaws kind flattery
Calderwell jerked the cigar from between his lips and sat suddenly forward in his chair
Arkwright tell me about them
How are they making it go
Arkwright frowned
Who
Make what go
he asked
The Henshaws
Is she happy
Is heon the square
Arkwrights face darkened
Well really he began but Calderwell interrupted
Oh come dont be squeamish
You think Im butting into what doesnt concern me but Im not
What concerns Billy does concern me
And if he doesnt make her happy IllIll kill him
In spite of himself Arkwright laughed
The vehemence of the others words and the fierceness with which he puffed at his cigar as he fell back in his chair were most expressive Well I dont think you need to load revolvers nor sharpen daggers just yet he observed grimly
Calderwell laughed this time though without much mirth
Oh Im not in love with Billy now he explained
Please dont think I am
I shouldnt see her if I was of course
Arkwright changed his position suddenly bringing his face into the shadow
Calderwell talked on without pausing
No Im not in love with Billy
But Billys a trump
You know that
I do
The words were low but steadily spoken
Of course you do
We all do
And we want her happy
But as for her marrying Bertram you could have bowled me over with a soap bubble when I heard shed done it
Now understand Bertram is a good fellow and I like him
Ive known him all his life and hes all right
Oh six or eight years ago to be sure he got in with a set of fellowsBob Seaver and his cliquethat were no good
Went in for Bohemianism and all that rot
It wasnt good for Bertram
Hes got the confounded temperament that goes with his talent I supposethough why a man cant paint a picture or sing a song and keep his temper and a level head I dont see
He can cut in Arkwright with curt emphasis
Humph
Well thats what I think
But about this marriage business
Bertram admires a pretty face wherever he sees itto paint and always has
Not but that hes straight as a string with womenI dont mean that but girls are always just so many pictures to be picked up on his brushes and transferred to his canvases
And as for his settling down and marrying anybody for keeps right alongGreat Scott
imagine Bertram Henshaw as a domestic man
Arkwright stirred restlessly as he spoke up in quick defense Oh but he is I assure you
IIve seen them in their home togethermany times
I think they arevery happy
Arkwright spoke with decision though still a little diffidently
Calderwell was silent
He had picked up the little gilt band he had torn from his cigar and was fingering it musingly
Yes Ive seen themonce he said after a minute
I took dinner with them when I was on a month ago
I heard you did
At something in Arkwrights voice Calderwell turned quickly
What do you mean
Why do you say it like that
Arkwright laughed
The constraint fled from his manner
Well I may as well tell you
Youll hear of it
Its no secret
Mrs Henshaw herself tells of it everywhere
It was her friend Alice Greggory who told me of it first however
It seems the cook was gone and the mistress had to get the dinner herself
Yes I know that
But you should hear Mrs Henshaw tell the story now or Bertram
It seems she knew nothing whatever about cooking and her trials and tribulations in getting that dinner on to the table were only one degree worse than the dinner itself according to her story
Didnt youer notice anything
Notice anything
exploded Calderwell
I noticed that Billy was so brilliant she fairly radiated sparks and I noticed that Bertram was so glum hehe almost radiated thunderclaps
Then I saw that Billys high spirits were all assumed to cover a threatened burst of tears and I laid it all to him
I thought hed said something to hurt her and I could have punched him
Great Scott
Was that what ailed them
I reckon it was
Alice says that since then Mrs Henshaw has fairly haunted the kitchen begging Eliza to teach her everything every single thing she knows
Calderwell chuckled
If that isnt just like Billy
She never does anything by halves
By George but she was game over that dinner
I can see it all now
Alice says shes really learning to cook in spite of old Petes horror and Elizas pleadings not to spoil her pretty hands
Then Pete is back all right
What a faithful old soul he is
Arkwright frowned slightly
Yes hes faithful but he isnt all right by any means
I think hes a sick man myself
What makes Billy let him work then
Let him
sniffed Arkwright
Id like to see you try to stop him
Mrs Henshaw begs and pleads with him to stop but he scouts the idea
Pete is thoroughly and unalterably convinced that the family would starve to death if it werent for him and Mrs Henshaw says that shell admit he has some grounds for his opinion when one remembers the condition of the kitchen and diningroom the night she presided over them
Poor Billy
chuckled Calderwell
Id have gone down into the kitchen myself if Id suspected what was going on
Arkwright raised his eyebrows
Perhaps its well you didntif Bertrams picture of what he found there when he went down is a true one
Mrs Henshaw acknowledges that even the cat sought refuge under the stove
As if the veriest worm that crawls ever needed to seek refuge from Billy
scoffed Calderwell
By the way whats this Annex I hear of
Bertram mentioned it but I couldnt get either of them to tell what it was
Billy wouldnt and Bertram said he couldntnot with Billy shaking her head at him like that
So I had my suspicions
One of Billys pet charities
She doesnt call it that
Arkwrights face and voice softened
It is Hillside
She still keeps it open
She calls it the Annex to her home
Shes filled it with a crippled woman a poor little music teacher a lame boy and Aunt Hannah
But howextraordinary
She doesnt think so
She says its just an overflow house for the extra happiness she cant use
There was a moments silence
Calderwell laid down his cigar pulled out his handkerchief and blew his nose furiously
Then he got to his feet and walked to the fireplace
After a minute he turned
Well if she isnt the beat em
he spluttered
And I had the gall to ask you if Henshaw made herhappy
Overflow house indeed
The best of it is the way she does it smiled Arkwright
Theyre all the sort of people ordinary charity could never reach and the only way she got them there at all was to make each one think that he or she was absolutely necessary to the rest of them
Even as it is they all pay a little something toward the running expenses of the house
They insisted on that and Mrs Henshaw had to let them
I believe her chief difficulty now is that she has not less than six people whom she wishes to put into the two extra rooms still unoccupied and she cant make up her mind which to take
Her husband says he expects to hear any day of an Annexette to the Annex
Humph
grunted Calderwell as he turned and began to walk up and down the room
Bertram is still painting I suppose
Oh yes
Whats he doing now
Several things
Hes up to his eyes in work
As you probably have heard he met with a severe accident last summer and lost the use of his right arm for many months
I believe they thought at one time he had lost it forever
But its all right now and he has several commissions for portraits
Alice says hes doing ideal heads again too
Same old Face of a Girl
I suppose so though Alice didnt say
Of course his special work just now is painting the portrait of Miss Marguerite Winthrop
You may have heard that he tried it last year and and didnt make quite a success of it
Yes
My sister Belle told me
She hears from Billy once in a while
Will it be a go this time
Well hope sofor everybodys sake
I imagine no one has seen it yetits not finished but Alice says Calderwell turned abruptly a quizzical smile on his face
See here my son he interposed it strikes me that this Alice is saying a good dealto you
Who is she
Arkwright gave a light laugh
Why I told you
She is Miss Alice Greggory Mrs Henshaws friendand mine
I have known her for years
Hmm what is she like
Like
Why shes likelike herself of course
Youll have to know Alice
Shes the salt of the earthAlice is smiled Arkwright rising to his feet with a remonstrative gesture as he saw Calderwell pick up his coat
Whats your hurry
Hmm commented Calderwell again ignoring the question
And when may I ask do you intend to appropriate thisersalt toerahseason your own life with as I might sayeh
Arkwright laughed
There was not the slightest trace of embarrassment in his face
Never
Youre on the wrong track this time
Alice and I are good friendsalways have been and always will be I hope
Nothing more
Nothing more
I see her frequently
She is musical and the Henshaws are good enough to ask us there often together
You will meet her doubtless now yourself
She is frequently at the Henshaw home
Hmm Calderwell still eyed his host shrewdly
Then youll give me a clear field eh
Certainly
Arkwrights eyes met his friends gaze without swerving
All right
However I suppose youll tell me as I did you once that a right of way in such a case doesnt mean a thoroughfare for the party interested
If my memory serves me I gave you right of way in Paris to win the affections of a certain elusive Miss Billy here in Boston if you could
But I see you didnt seem to improve your opportunities he finished teasingly
Arkwright stooped of a sudden to pick up a bit of paper from the floor
No he said quietly
I didnt seem to improve my opportunities
This time he did not meet Calderwells eyes
The goodbyes had been said when Calderwell turned abruptly at the door
Oh I say I suppose youre going to that devils carnival at Jordan Hall tomorrow night
Devils carnival
You dont meanCyril Henshaws piano recital
Sure I do grinned Calderwell unabashed
And Ill warrant itll be a devils carnival too
Isnt Mr Cyril Henshaw going to play his own music
Oh I know Im hopeless from your standpoint but I cant help it
I like mine with some go in it and a tune that you can find without hunting for it
And I dont like lost spirits gone mad that wail and shriek through ten perfectly good minutes and then die with a gasping moan whose home is the tombs
However youre going I take it
Of course I am laughed the other
You couldnt hire Alice to miss one shriek of those spirits
Besides I rather like them myself you know
Yes I suppose you do
Youre brought up on itin your business
But me for the Merry Widow and even the hoary Jingle Bells every time
However Im going to be thereout of respect to the poor fellows family
And by the way thats another thing that bowled me over Cyrils marriage
Why Cyril hates women
Not all womenwell hope smiled Arkwright
Do you know his wife
Not much
I used to see her a little at Billys
Music teacher wasnt she
Then shes the same sort I suppose
But she isnt laughed Arkwright
Oh she taught music but that was only because of necessity I take it
Shes domestic through and through with an overwhelming passion for making puddings and darning socks I hear
Alice says she believes Mrs Cyril knows every dish and spoon by its Christian name and that theres never so much as a spool of thread out of order in the house
But how does Cyril stand itthe trials and tribulations of domestic life
Bertram used to declare that the whole Strata was aquiver with fear when Cyril was composing and I remember him as a perfect bear if anybody so much as whispered when he was in one of his moods
I never forgot the night Bertram and I were up in Williams room trying to sing When Johnnie comes marching home to the accompaniment of a banjo in Bertrams hands and a guitar in mine
Gorry
it was Hugh that went marching home that night
Oh well from reports I reckon Mrs Cyril doesnt play either a banjo or a guitar smiled Arkwright
Alice says she wears rubber heels on her shoes and has put hushers on all the chair legs and feltmats between all the plates and saucers
Anyhow Cyril is building a new house and he looks as if he were in a pretty healthy condition as youll see tomorrow night
Humph
I wish hed make his music healthy then grumbled Calderwell as he opened the door
CHAPTER XII FOR BILLYSOME ADVICE February brought busy days
The public opening of the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition was to take place the sixth of March with a private view for invited guests the night before and it was at this exhibition that Bertram planned to show his portrait of Marguerite Winthrop
He also if possible wished to enter two or three other canvases upon which he was spending all the time he could get
Bertram felt that he was doing very good work now
The portrait of Marguerite Winthrop was coming on finely
The spoiled idol of society had at last found a pose and a costume that suited her and she was graciously pleased to give the artist almost as many sittings as he wanted
The elusive something in her face which had previously been so baffling was now already caught and held bewitchingly on his canvas
He was confident that the portrait would be a success
He was also much interested in another piece of work which he intended to show called The Rose
The model for this was a beautiful young girl he had found selling flowers with her father in a street booth at the North End
On the whole Bertram was very happy these days
He could not to be sure spend quite so much time with Billy as he wished but she understood of course as did he that his work must come first
He knew that she tried to show him that she understood it
At the same time he could not help thinking occasionally that Billy did sometimes mind his necessary absorption in his painting
To himself Bertram owned that Billy was in some ways a puzzle to him
Her conduct was still erratic at times
One day he would seem to be everything to her the nextalmost nothing judging by the ease with which she relinquished his society and substituted that of some one else Arkwright or Calderwell for instance
And that was another thing
Bertram was ashamed to hint even to himself that he was jealous of either of those men
Surely after what had happened after Billys emphatic assertion that she had never loved any one but himself it would seem not only absurd but disloyal that he should doubt for an instant Billys entire devotion to him and yetthere were times when he wished he could come home and not always find Alice Greggory Calderwell Arkwright or all three of them strumming the piano in the drawingroom
At such times always though if he did feel impatient he immediately demanded of himself Are you then the kind of husband that begrudges your wife young companions of her own age and tastes to help her while away the hours that you cannot possibly spend with her yourself
This question and the answer that his better self always gave to it were usually sufficient to send him into some florists for a bunch of violets for Billy or into a candy shop on a like atoning errand
As to BillyBilly too was busy these days chief of her concerns being perhaps attention to that honeymoon of hers to see that it did not wane
At least the most of her thoughts and many of her actions centered about that object
Billy had the book nowthe Talk to Young Wives
For a time she had worked with only the newspaper criticism to guide her but coming at last to the conclusion that if a little was good more must be better she had shyly gone into a bookstore one day and with a pink blush had asked for the book
Since bringing it home she had studied assiduously though never if Bertram was near keeping it wellhidden when not in use in a remote corner of her desk
There was a good deal in the book that Billy did not like and there were some statements that worried her but yet there was much that she tried earnestly to follow
She was still striving to be the oak and she was still eagerly endeavoring to brush up against those necessary outside interests
She was so thankful in this connection for Alice Greggory and for Arkwright and Hugh Calderwell
It was such a help that she had them
They were not only very pleasant and entertaining outside interests but one or another of them was almost always conveniently within reach
Then too it pleased her to think that she was furthering the pretty love story between Alice and Mr Arkwright
And she was furthering it
She was sure of that
Already she could see how dependent the man was on Alice how he looked to her for approbation and appealed to her on all occasions exactly as if there was not a move that he wanted to make without her presence near him
Billy was very sure now of Arkwright
She only wished she were as much so of Alice
But Alice troubled her
Not but that Alice was kindness itself to the man either
It was only a peculiar something almost like fear or constraint that Billy thought she saw in Alices eyes sometimes when Arkwright made a particularly intimate appeal
There was Calderwell too
He also worried Billy
She feared he was going to complicate matters still more by falling in love with Alice himself and this certainly Billy did not want at all
As this phase of the matter presented itself indeed Billy determined to appropriate Calderwell a little more exclusively to herself when the four were together thus leaving Alice for Arkwright
After all it was rather entertainingthis playing at Cupids assistant
If she could not have Bertram all the time it was fortunate that these outside interests were so pleasurable
Most of the mornings Billy spent in the kitchen despite the remonstrances of both Pete and Eliza
Almost every meal now was graced with a palatable cake pudding or muffin that Billy would proudly claim as her handiwork
Pete still served at table and made strenuous efforts to keep up all his old duties but he was obviously growing weaker and really serious blunders were beginning to be noticeable
Bertram even hinted once or twice that perhaps it would be just as well to insist on his going but to this Billy would not give her consent
Even when one night his poor old trembling hands spilled half the contents of a soup plate over a new and costly evening gown of Billys own she still refused to have him dismissed
Why Bertram I wouldnt do it she declared hotly and you wouldnt either
Hes been here more than fifty years
It would break his heart
Hes really too ill to work and I wish he would go of his own accord of course but I shant ever tell him to gonot if he spills soup on every dress Ive got
Ill buy moreand more if its necessary
Bless his dear old heart
He thinks hes really serving usand he is too
Oh yes youre right he is sighed Bertram with meaning emphasis as he abandoned the argument
In addition to her Talk to Young Wives Billy found herself encountering advice and comment on the marriage question from still other quartersfrom her acquaintances mostly the feminine ones right and left
Continually she was hearing such words as these Oh well what can you expect Billy
Youre an old married woman now
Never mind youll find hes like all the rest of the husbands
You just wait and see
Better begin with a high hand Billy
Dont let him fool you
Mercy
If I had a husband whose business it was to look at womens beautiful eyes peachy cheeks and luxurious tresses I should go crazy
Its hard enough to keep a mans eyes on yourself when his daily interests are supposed to be just lumps of coal and chunks of ice without flinging him into the very jaws of temptation like asking him to paint a pretty girls picture
In response to all this of course Billy could but laugh and blush and toss back some gay reply with a careless unconcern
But in her heart she did not like it
Sometimes she told herself that if there were not any advice or comment from anybodyeither book or womanif there were not anybody but just Bertram and herself life would be just one long honeymoon forever and forever
Once or twice Billy was tempted to go to Marie with this honeymoon question but Marie was very busy these days and very preoccupied
The new house that Cyril was building on Corey Hill not far from the Annex was almost finished and Marie was immersed in the subject of house furnishings and interior decoration
She was too still more deeply engrossed in the fashioning of tiny garments of the softest linen lace and woolen and there was on her face such a look of beatific wonder and joy that Billy did not like to so much as hint that there was in the world such a book as When the Honeymoon Wanes A Talk to Young Wives
Billy tried valiantly these days not to mind that Bertrams work was so absorbing
She tried not to mind that his business dealt not with lumps of coal and chunks of ice but with beautiful women like Marguerite Winthrop who asked him to luncheon and lovely girls like his model for The Rose who came freely to his studio and spent hours in the beloved presence being studied for what Bertram declared was absolutely the most wonderful poise of head and shoulders that he had ever seen
Billy tried also these days to so conduct herself that not by any chance could Calderwell suspect that sometimes she was jealous of Bertrams art
Not for worlds would she have had Calderwell begin to get the notion into his head that his oldtime prophecy concerning Bertrams caring only for the turn of a girls head or the tilt of her chinto paint was being fulfilled
Hence particularly gay and cheerful was Billy when Calderwell was near
Nor could it be said that Billy was really unhappy at any time
It was only that on occasion the very depth of her happiness in Bertrams love frightened her lest it bring disaster to herself or Bertram
Billy still went frequently to the Annex
There were yet two unfilled rooms in the house
Billy was hesitating which two of six new friends of hers to choose as occupants and it was one day early in March after she had been talking the matter over with Aunt Hannah that Aunt Hannah said Dear me Billy if you had your way I believe youd open another whole house
Do you knowthats just what Im thinking of retorted Billy gravely
Then she laughed at Aunt Hannahs shocked gesture of protest
Oh well I dont expect to she added
I havent lived very long but Ive lived long enough to know that you cant always do what you want to
Just as if there were anything you wanted to do that you dont do my dear reproved Aunt Hannah mildly
Yes I know
Billy drew in her breath with a little catch
I have so much that is lovely and thats why I need this house you know for the overflow she nodded brightly
Then with a characteristic change of subject she added My but you should have tasted of the popovers I made for breakfast this morning
I should like to smiled Aunt Hannah
William says youre getting to be quite a cook
Well maybe conceded Billy doubtfully
Oh I can do some things all right but just wait till Pete and Eliza go away again and Bertram brings home a friend to dinner
Thatll tell the tale
I think now I could have something besides potatomush and burned cornbut maybe I wouldnt when the time came
If only I could buy everything I needed to cook with Id be all right
But I cant I find
Cant buy what you need
What do you mean
Billy laughed ruefully
Well every other question I ask Eliza she says Why I dont know you have to use your judgment
Just as if I had any judgment about how much salt to use or what dish to take
Dear me Aunt Hannah the man that will grow judgment and can it as you would a mess of peas has got his fortune made
What an absurd child you are Billy laughed Aunt Hannah
I used to tell Marie By the way how is Marie
Have you seen her lately
Oh yes I saw her yesterday twinkled Billy
She had a book of wallpaper samples spread over the back of a chair two bunches of samples of different colored damasks on the table before her a Young Mothers Guide propped open in another chair and a pair of babys socks in her lap with a roll each of pink and white and blue ribbon
She spent most of the time after I had helped her choose the ribbon in asking me if I thought she ought to let the baby cry and bother Cyril or stop its crying and hurt the baby because her Mothers Guide says a certain amount of crying is needed to develop a babys lungs
Aunt Hannah laughed but she frowned too
The idea
I guess Cyril can stand proper cryingand laughing toofrom his own child
she said then crisply
Oh but Marie is afraid he cant smiled Billy
And thats the trouble
She says thats the only thing that worries herCyril
Nonsense
ejaculated Aunt Hannah
Oh but it isnt nonsense to Marie retorted Billy
You should see the preparations shes made and the precautions shes taken
Actually when I saw those babys socks in her lap I didnt know but she was going to put rubber heels on them
Theyve built the new house with deadening felt in all the walls and Maries planned the nursery and Cyrils den at opposite ends of the house and she says she shall keep the baby there all the timethe nursery I mean not the den
She says shes going to teach it to be a quiet baby and hate noise
She says she thinks she can do it too
Humph
sniffed Aunt Hannah scornfully
You should have seen Maries disgust the other day went on Billy a bit mischievously
Her Cousin Jane sent on a rattle shed made herself all soft worsted with bells inside
It was a dear but Marie was horrorstricken
My baby have a rattle
she cried
Why what would Cyril say
As if he could stand a rattle in the house
And if she didnt give that rattle to the janitors wife that very day while I was there
Humph
sniffed Aunt Hannah again as Billy rose to go
Well Im thinking Marie has still some things to learn in this worldand Cyril too for that matter
I wouldnt wonder laughed Billy giving Aunt Hannah a goodby kiss
CHAPTER XIII PETE Bertram Henshaw had no disquieting forebodings this time concerning his portrait of Marguerite Winthrop when the doors of the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition were thrown open to members and invited guests
Just how great a popular success it was destined to be he could not know of course though he might have suspected it when he began to receive the admiring and hearty congratulations of his friends and fellowartists on that first evening
Nor was the Winthrop portrait the only jewel in his crown on that occasion
His marvelously exquisite The Rose and his smaller ideal picture Expectation came in for scarcely less commendation
There was no doubt now
The originator of the famous Face of a Girl had come into his own again
On all sides this was the verdict one longhaired critic of international fame even claiming openly that Henshaw had not only equaled his former best work but had gone beyond it in both artistry and technique
It was a brilliant gathering
Society as usual in costly evening gowns and correct swallowtails rubbed elbows with names famous in the world of Art and Letters
Everywhere were gay laughter and sparkling repartee
Even the austerefaced J G Winthrop unbent to the extent of grim smiles in response to the laudatory comments bestowed upon the pictured image of his idol his beautiful daughter
As to the great financiers own opinion of the work no one heard him express it except perhaps the artist and all that he got was a grip of the hand and a Good
I knew youd fetch it this time my boy
But that was enough
And indeed no one who knew the stern old man needed to more than look into his face that evening to know of his entire satisfaction in this portrait soon to be the most recent and the most cherished addition to his farfamed art collection
As to BertramBertram was pleased and happy and gratified of course as was natural but he was not one whit more so than was Bertrams wife
Billy fairly radiated happiness and proud joy
She told Bertram indeed that if he did anything to make her any prouder it would take an Annex the size of the Boston Opera House to hold her extra happiness
Shh Billy
Some one will hear you protested Bertram tragically but in spite of his horrified voice he did not look displeased
For the first time Billy met Marguerite Winthrop that evening
At the outset there was just a bit of shyness and constraint in the young wifes manner
Billy could not forget her old insane jealousy of this beautiful girl with the envied name of Marguerite
But it was for only a moment and soon she was her natural charming self
Miss Winthrop was fascinated and she made no pretense of hiding it
She even turned to Bertram at last and cried Surely now Mr Henshaw you need never go far for a model
Why dont you paint your wife
Billy colored
Bertram smiled
I have he said
I have painted her many times
In fact I have painted her so often that she once declared it was only the tilt of her chin and the turn of her head that I lovedto paint he said merrily enjoying Billys pretty confusion and not realizing that his words really distressed her
I have a whole studio full of Billys at home
Oh have you really
questioned Miss Winthrop eagerly
Then maynt I see them
Maynt I please Mrs Henshaw
Id so love to
Why of course you may murmured both the artist and his wife
Thank you
Then Im coming right away
May I
Im going to Washington next week you see
Will you let me come tomorrow at at halfpast three then
Will it be quite convenient for you Mrs
Henshaw
Quite convenient
I shall be glad to see you smiled Billy
And Bertram echoed his wifes cordial permission
Thank you
Then Ill be there at halfpast three nodded Miss Winthrop with a smile as she turned to give place to an admiring group who were waiting to pay their respects to the artist and his wife
There was after all that evening one fly in Billys ointment
It fluttered in at the behest of an old acquaintanceone of the advice women as Billy termed some of her too interested friends
Well theyre lovely perfectly lovely of course Mrs Henshaw said this lady coming up to say goodnight
But all the sameesic Im glad my husband is just a plain lawyer
Look out my dear that while Mr Henshaw is stealing all those pretty faces for his canvasesjust look out that the fair ladies dont turn around and steal his heart before you know it
Dear me but you must be so proud of him
I am smiled Billy serenely and only the jagged split that rent the glove on her hand at that moment told of the fierce anger behind that smile
As if I couldnt trust Bertram
raged Billy passionately to herself stealing a surreptitious glance at her ruined glove
And as if there werent ever any perfectly happy marriages even if you dont ever hear of them or read of them
Bertram was not home to luncheon on the day following the opening night of the Bohemian Ten Club
A matter of business called him away from the house early in the morning but he told his wife that he surely would be on hand for Miss Winthrops call at halfpast three oclock that afternoon
Yes do Billy had urged
I think shes lovely but you know her so much better than I do that I want you here
Besides you neednt think Im going to show her all those Billys of yours
I may be vain but Im not quite vain enough for that sir
Dont worry her husband had laughed
Ill be here
As it chanced however something occurred an hour before halfpast three oclock that drove every thought of Miss Winthrops call from Billys head
For three days now Pete had been at the home of his niece in South Boston
He had been forced finally to give up and go away
News from him the day before had been anything but reassuring and today Bertram being gone Billy had suggested that Eliza serve a simple luncheon and go immediately afterward to South Boston to see how her uncle was
This suggestion Eliza had followed leaving the house at one oclock
Shortly after two Calderwell had dropped in to bring Bertram as he expressed it a bunch of bouquets he had gathered at the picture show the night before
He was still in the drawing room chatting with Billy when the telephone bell rang
If thats Bertram tell him to come home hes got company laughed Calderwell as Billy passed into the hall
A moment later he heard Billy give a startled cry followed by a few broken words at short intervals
Then before he could surmise what had happened she was back in the drawingroom again her eyes full of tears
Its Pete she choked
Eliza says he cant live but a few minutes
He wants to see me once more
What shall I do
Johns got Peggy out with Aunt Hannah and Mrs Greggory
It was so nice today I made them go
But I must get there some wayPete is calling for me
Uncle William is going and I told Eliza where she might reach Bertram but what shall I do
How shall I go
Calderwell was on his feet at once
Ill get a taxi
Dont worrywell get there
Poor old soulof course he wants to see you
Get on your things
Ill have it here in no time he finished hurrying to the telephone
Oh Hugh Im so glad Ive got you here sobbed Billy stumbling blindly toward the stairway
Ill be ready in two minutes
And she was but neither then nor a little later when she and Calderwell drove hurriedly away from the house did Billy once remember that Miss Marguerite Winthrop was coming to call that afternoon to see Mrs Bertram Henshaw and a roomful of Billy pictures
Pete was still alive when Calderwell left Billy at the door of the modest little home where Elizas mother lived
Yes youre in time maam sobbed Eliza and oh Im so glad youve come
Hes been askin and askin for ye
From Eliza Billy learned then that Mr William was there but not Mr Bertram
They had not been able to reach Mr Bertram or Mr Cyril
Billy never forgot the look of reverent adoration that came into Petes eyes as she entered the room where he lay
Miss Billymy Miss Billy
You were so goodto come he whispered faintly
Billy choked back a sob
Of course Id come Pete she said gently taking one of the thin worn hands into both her soft ones
It was more than a few minutes that Pete lived
Four oclock came and five and he was still with them
Often he opened his eyes and smiled
Sometimes he spoke a low word to William or Billy or to one of the weeping women at the foot of the bed
That the presence of his beloved master and mistress meant much to him was plain to be seen
Im so sorry he faltered once about that pretty dressI spoiled Miss Billy
But you knowmy hands I know I know soothed Billy but dont worry
It wasnt spoiled Pete
Its all fixed now
Oh Im so glad sighed the sick man
After another long interval of silence he turned to William
Them socksthe medium thin onesyoud oughter be puttin em on soon sir now
Theyre in the righthand corner of the bottom drawer you know
Yes Pete Ill attend to it William managed to stammer after he had cleared his throat
Elizas turn came next
Remember about the coffee Pete said to her the way Mr William likes it
And always eggs you know forfor His voice trailed into an indistinct murmur and his eyelids drooped wearily
One by one the minutes passed
The doctor came and went there was nothing he could do
At halfpast five the thin old face became again alight with consciousness
There was a goodby message for Bertram and one for Cyril
Aunt Hannah was remembered and even little Tommy Dunn
Then gradually a gray shadow crept over the wasted features
The words came more brokenly
The mind plainly was wandering for old Pete was young again and around him were the lads he loved William Cyril and Bertram
And then very quietly soon after the clock struck six Pete fell into the beginning of his long sleep
CHAPTER XIV WHEN BERTRAM CAME HOME It was a little after halfpast three oclock that afternoon when Bertram Henshaw hurried up Beacon Street toward his home
He had been delayed and he feared that Miss Winthrop would already have reached the house
Mindful of what Billy had said that morning he knew how his wife would fret if he were not there when the guest arrived
The sight of what he surmised to be Miss Winthrops limousine before his door hastened his steps still more
But as he reached the house he was surprised to find Miss Winthrop herself turning away from the door
Why Miss Winthrop he cried youre not going now You cant have been here anyyet
Well no II havent retorted the lady with heightened color and a somewhat peculiar emphasis
My ring wasnt answered
Wasnt answered
Bertram reddened angrily
Why what can that mean
Wheres the maid
Wheres my wife
Mrs Henshaw must be here
She was expecting you
Bertram in his annoyed amazement spoke loudly vehemently
Hence he was quite plainly heard by the group of small boys and girls who had been improving the mild weather for a frolic on the sidewalk and who had been attracted to his door a moment before by the shining magnet of the Winthrop limousine with its resplendently liveried chauffeur
As Bertram spoke one of the small girls Bessie Bailey stepped forward and piped up a shrill reply
She aint Mr Henshaw
She aint here
I saw her go away just a little while ago
Bertram turned sharply
You saw her go away
What do you mean
Small Bessie swelled with importance
Bessie was thirteen in spite of her diminutive height
Bessies mother was dead and Bessies caretakers were gossiping nurses and servants who frequently left in her way books that were much too old for Bessie to readbut she read them
I mean she aint hereyour wife Mr Henshaw
She went away
I saw her
I guess likely shes eloped sir
Eloped
Bessie swelled still more importantly
To her experienced eyes the situation contained all the necessary elements for the customary flight of the heroine in her storybooks as here now was the irate deserted husband
Sure
And twas just before you came quite a while before
A big shiny black automobile like this drove uponly it wasnt quite such a nice onean Mrs Henshaw an a man came out of your house an got in an drove right away quick They just ran to get into it toodidnt they
She appealed to her young mates grouped about her
A chorus of shrill exclamations brought Mr Bertram Henshaw suddenly to his senses
By a desperate effort he hid his angry annoyance as he turned to the manifestly embarrassed young woman who was already descending the steps
My dear Miss Winthrop he apologized contritely Im sure youll forgive this seeming great rudeness on the part of my wife
Notwithstanding the lurid tales of our young friends here I suspect nothing more serious has happened than that my wife has been hastily summoned to Aunt Hannah perhaps
Or of course she may not have understood that you were coming today at halfpast threethough I thought she did
But Im so sorrywhen you were so kind as to come Miss Winthrop interrupted with a quick gesture
Say no more I beg of you she entreated
Mrs Henshaw is quite excusable Im sure
Please dont give it another thought she finished as with a hurried direction to the man who was holding open the door of her car she stepped inside and bowed her goodbyes
Bertram with stern selfcontrol forced himself to walk nonchalantly up his steps leisurely take out his key and open his door under the interested eyes of Bessie Bailey and her friends but once beyond their hateful stare his demeanor underwent a complete change
Throwing aside his hat and coat he strode to the telephone
Oh is that you Aunt Hannah
he called crisply a moment later
Well if Billys there will you tell her I want to speak to her please
Billy
answered Aunt Hannahs slow gentle tones
Why my dear boy Billy isnt here
She isnt
Well when did she leave
Shes been there hasnt she
Why I dont think so but Ill see if you like
Mrs Greggory and I have just this minute come in from an automobile ride
We would have stayed longer but it began to get chilly and I forgot to take one of the shawls that Id laid out
Yes well if you will see please if Billy has been there and when she left said Bertram with grim selfcontrol
All right
Ill see murmured Aunt Hannah
In a few moments her voice again sounded across the wires
Why no Bertram Rosa says she hasnt been here since yesterday
Isnt she there somewhere about the house
Didnt you know where she was going
Well no I didntelse I shouldnt have been asking you snapped the irate Bertram and hung up the receiver with most rude haste thereby cutting off an astounded Oh my grief and conscience
in the middle of it
The next ten minutes Bertram spent in going through the whole house from garret to basement
Needless to say he found nothing to enlighten him or to soothe his temper
Four oclock came then halfpast and five
At five Bertram began to look for Eliza but in vain
At halfpast five he watched for William but William too did not come
Bertram was pacing the floor now nervously
He was a little frightened but more mortified and angry
That Billy should have allowed Miss Winthrop to call by appointment only to find no hostess no message no maid even to answer her ringit was inexcusable
Impulsiveness unconventionality and girlish irresponsibility were all very delightful of courseat times but not now certainly
Billy was not a girl any longer
She was a married woman
Something was due to him her husband
A pretty picture he must have made on those steps trying to apologize for a truant wife and to laugh off that absurd Bessie Baileys preposterous assertion at the same time
What would Miss Winthrop think
What could she think
Bertram fairly ground his teeth with chagrin at the situation in which he found himself
Nor were matters helped any by the fact that Bertram was hungry
Bertrams luncheon had been meager and unsatisfying
That the kitchen downstairs still remained in silent spotless order instead of being astir with the sounds and smells of a good dinner as it should have been did not improve his temper
Where Billy was he could not imagine
He thought once or twice of calling up some of her friends but something held him back from thatthough he did try to get Marie knowing very well that she was probably over to the new house and would not answer
He was not surprised therefore when he received no reply to his ring
That there was the slightest truth in Bessie Baileys absurd elopement idea Bertram did not of course for an instant believe
The only thing that rankled about that was the fact that she had suggested such a thing and that Miss Winthrop and those silly children had heard her
He recognized half of Bessies friends as neighborhood youngsters and he knew very well that there would be many a quiet laugh at his expense around various Beacon Street dinner tables that night
At the thought of those dinnertables he scowled again
He had no dinnertableat least he had no dinner on it
Who the man might be Bertram thought he could easily guess
It was either Arkwright or Calderwell of course and probably that tiresome Alice Greggory was mixed up in it somehow
He did wish Billy Six oclock came then halfpast
Bertram was indeed frightened now but he was more angry and still more hungry
He had in fact reached that state of blind unreasonableness said to be peculiar to hungry males from time immemorial
At ten minutes of seven a key clicked in the lock of the outer door and William and Billy entered the hall
It was almost dark
Bertram could not see their faces
He had not lighted the hall at all
Well he began sharply is this the way you receive your callers Billy
I came home and found Miss Winthrop just leavingno one here to receive her
Whereve you been
Wheres Eliza
Wheres my dinner
Of course I dont mean to scold Billy but there is a limit to even my patienceand its reached now
I cant help suggesting that if you would tend to your husband and your home a little more and go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a little less that Where is Eliza anyway
he finished irritably switching on the lights with a snap
There was a moment of dead silence
At Bertrams first words Billy and William had stopped short
Neither had moved since
Now William turned and began to speak but Billy interrupted
She met her husbands gaze steadily
I will be down at once to get your dinner she said quietly
Eliza will not come tonight
Pete is dead
Bertram started forward with a quick cry
Dead
Oh Billy
Then you werethere Billy
But his wife did not apparently hear him
She passed him without turning her head and went on up the stairs leaving him to meet the sorrowful accusing eyes of William
CHAPTER XV AFTER THE STORM The young husbands apologies were profuse and abject
Bertram was heartily ashamed of himself and was man enough to acknowledge it
Almost on his knees he begged Billy to forgive him and in a frenzy of selfdenunciation he followed her down into the kitchen that night piteously beseeching her to speak to him to just look at him even so that he might know he was not utterly despisedthough he did indeed deserve to be more than despised he moaned
At first Billy did not speak or even vouchsafe a glance in his direction
Very quietly she went about her preparations for a simple meal paying apparently no more attention to Bertram than as if he were not there
But that her ears were only seemingly and not really deaf was shown very clearly a little later when at a particularly abject wail on the part of the babbling shadow at her heels Billy choked into a little gasp half laughter half sob
It was all over then
Bertram had her in his arms in a twinkling while to the floor clattered and rolled a knife and a halfpeeled baked potato
Naturally after that there could be no more dignified silences on the part of the injured wife
There were instead halfsmiles tears sobs a tremulous telling of Petes going and his messages followed by a tearful listening to Bertrams story of the torture he had endured at the hands of Miss Winthrop Bessie Bailey and an empty dinnerless house
And thus in one corner of the kitchen some time later a hungry desperate William found them the halfpeeled cold baked potato still at their feet
Torn between his craving for food and his desire not to interfere with any possible peace making William was obviously hesitating what to do when Billy glanced up and saw him
She saw too at the same time the empty blazing gasstove burner and the pile of halfprepared potatoes to warm which the burner had long since been lighted
With a little cry she broke away from her husbands arms
Mercy
and heres poor Uncle William bless his heart with not a thing to eat yet
They all got dinner then together with many a sigh and quickcoming tear as everywhere they met some sad reminder of the gentle old hands that would never again minister to their comfort
It was a silent meal and little after all was eaten though brave attempts at cheerfulness and naturalness were made by all three
Bertram especially talked and tried to make sure that the shadow on Billys face was at least not the one his own conduct had brought there
For you doyou surely do forgive me dont you
he begged as he followed her into the kitchen after the sorry meal was over
Why yes dear yes sighed Billy trying to smile
And youll forget
There was no answer
Billy
And youll forget
Bertrams voice was insistent reproachful
Billy changed color and bit her lip
She looked plainly distressed
Billy
cried the man still more reproachfully
But Bertram I cant forgetquite yet faltered Billy
Bertram frowned
For a minute he looked as if he were about to take up the matter seriously and argue it with her but the next moment he smiled and tossed his head with jaunty playfulness Bertram to tell the truth had now had quite enough of what he privately termed scenes and heroics and manlike he was very ardently longing for the old easygoing friendliness with all unpleasantness banished to oblivion
Oh but youll have to forget he claimed with cheery insistence for youve promised to forgive meand one cant forgive without forgetting
So there
he finished with a smilingly determined noweverythingisjustasitwasbefore air
Billy made no response
She turned hurriedly and began to busy herself with the dishes at the sink
In her heart she was wondering could she ever forget what Bertram had said
Would anything ever blot out those awful words If you would tend to your husband and your home a little more and go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a little less
It seemed now that always for evermore they would ring in her ears always for evermore they would burn deeper and deeper into her soul
And not once in all Bertrams apologies had he referred to themthose words he had uttered
He had not said he did not mean them
He had not said he was sorry he spoke them
He had ignored them and he expected that now she too would ignore them
As if she could
If you would tend to your husband and your home a little more and go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a little less Oh if only she could indeedforget
When Billy went upstairs that night she ran across her Talk to Young Wives in her desk
With a halfstifled cry she thrust it far back out of sight
I hate you I hate youwith all your old talk about brushing up against outside interests
she whispered fiercely
Well Ive brushedand now see what Ive got for it
Later however after Bertram was asleep Billy crept out of bed and got the book
Under the carefully shaded lamp in the adjoining room she turned the pages softly till she came to the sentence Perhaps it would be hard to find a more utterly unreasonable irritable irresponsible creature than a hungry man
With a long sigh she began to read and not until some minutes later did she close the book turn off the light and steal back to bed
During the next three days until after the funeral at the shabby little South Boston house Eliza spent only about half of each day at the Strata
This much to her distress left many of the household tasks for her young mistress to perform
Billy however attacked each new duty with a feverish eagerness that seemed to make the performance of it very like some glad penance done for past misdeeds
And whenon the day after they had laid the old servant in his last resting placea despairing message came from Eliza to the effect that now her mother was very ill and would need her care Billy promptly told Eliza to stay as long as was necessary that they could get along all right without her
But Billy what are we going to do
Bertram demanded when he heard the news
We must have somebody
Im going to do it
Nonsense
As if you could
scoffed Bertram
Billy lifted her chin
Couldnt I indeed she retorted
Do you realize young man how much Ive done the last three days
How about those muffins you had this morning for breakfast and that cake last night
And didnt you yourself say that you never ate a better pudding than that date puff yesterday noon
Bertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders
My dear love Im not questioning your ability to do it he soothed quickly
Still he added with a whimsical smile I must remind you that Eliza has been here half the time and that muffins and date puffs however delicious arent all there is to running a big house like this
Besides just be sensible Billy he went on more seriously as he noted the rebellious gleam coming into his young wifes eyes youd know you couldnt do it if youd just stop to think
Theres the Carletons coming to dinner Monday and my studio Tea tomorrow to say nothing of the Symphony and the opera and the concerts youd lose because you were too dead tired to go to them
You know how it was with that concert yesterday afternoon which Alice Greggory wanted you to go to with her
I didntwantto go choked Billy under her breath
And theres your music
You havent done a thing with that for days yet only last week you told me the publishers were hurrying you for that last song to complete the group
I havent felt likewriting stammered Billy still half under her breath
Of course you havent triumphed Bertram
Youve been too dead tired
And thats just what I say
Billy you cant do it all yourself
But I want to
I want toto tend to things faltered Billy with a halffearful glance into her husbands face
Billy was hearing very loudly now that accusing If youd tend to your husband and your home a little more Bertram however was not hearing it evidently
Indeed he seemed never to have heard itmuch less to have spoken it
 Tend to things  he laughed lightly
Well youll have enough to do to tend to the maid I fancy
Anyhow were going to have one
Ill just step into one of thosewhat do you call emintelligence offices on my way down and send one up he finished as he gave his wife a goodby kiss
An hour later Billy struggling with the broom and the drawingroom carpet was called to the telephone
It was her husbands voice that came to her
Billy for heavens sake take pity on me
Wont you put on your duds and come and engage your maid yourself
Why Bertram whats the matter
Matter
Holy smoke
Well Ive been to three of those intelligence officesthough why they call them that I cant imagine
If ever there was a place utterly devoid of intelligencebut never mind
Ive interviewed four fat ladies two thin ones and one medium with a wart
Ive cheerfully divulged all our family secrets promised every other halfhour out and taken oath that our household numbers three adult members and no more but I simply cant remember how many handkerchiefs we have in the wash each week
Billy will you come
Maybe you can do something with them
Im sure you can
Why of course Ill come chirped Billy
Where shall I meet you
Bertram gave the street and number
Good
Ill be there promised Billy as she hung up the receiver
Quite forgetting the broom in the middle of the drawingroom floor Billy tripped upstairs to change her dress
On her lips was a gay little song
In her heart was joy
I rather guess now Im tending to my husband and my home
she was crowing to herself
Just as Billy was about to leave the house the telephone bell jangled again
It was Alice Greggory
Billy dear she called cant you come out
Mr Arkwright and Mr Calderwell are here and theyve brought some new music
We want you
Will you come
I cant dear
Bertram wants me
Hes sent for me
Ive got some housewifely duties to perform today returned Billy in a voice so curiously triumphant that Alice at her end of the wires frowned in puzzled wonder as she turned away from the telephone
CHAPTER XVI INTO TRAINING FOR MARY ELLEN Bertram told a friend afterwards that he never knew the meaning of the word chaos until he had seen the Strata during the weeks immediately following the laying away of his old servant
Every stratum was aquiver with apprehension he declared and there was never any telling when the next grand upheaval would rock the whole structure to its foundations
Nor was Bertram so far from being right
It was indeed a chaos as none knew better than did Bertrams wife
Poor Billy
Sorry indeed were these days for Billy and as if to make her cup of woe full to overflowing there were Sister Kates epistolary I told you so and Aunt Hannahs ever recurring lament If only Billy you were a practical housekeeper yourself they wouldnt impose on you so
Aunt Hannah to be sure offered Rosa and Kate by letter offered adviceplenty of it
But Billy stung beyond all endurance and fairly radiating hurt pride and dogged determination disdained all assistance and with head held high declared she was getting along very well very well indeed
And this was the way she got along
First came Nora
Nora was a blueeyed black haired Irish girl the sixth that the despairing Billy had interviewed on that fateful morning when Bertram had summoned her to his aid
Nora stayed two days
During her reign the entire Strata echoed to banged doors dropped china and slammed furniture
At her departure the Henshaws possessions were less by four cups two saucers one plate one salad bowl two cut glass tumblers and a teapotthe latter Williams choicest bit of Lowestoft
Olga came next
Olga was a Treasure
She was lowvoiced gentleeyed and a good cook
She stayed a week
By that time the growing frequency of the disappearance of sundry small articles of value and convenience led to Billys making a reluctant search of Olgas roomand to Olgas departure for the room was indeed a treasure house the Treasure having gathered unto itself other treasures
Following Olga came a period of what Bertram called one night stands so frequently were the dramatis personae below stairs changed
Gretchen drank
Christine knew only four words of English salt goodby no and yes and Billy found need occasionally of using other words
Mary was impertinent and lazy
Jennie could not even boil a potato properly much less cook a dinner
Sarah colored was willing and pleasant but insufferably untidy
Bridget was neatness itself but she had no conception of the value of time
Her meals were always from thirty to sixty minutes late and halfcooked at that
Vera sangwhen she wasnt whistlingand as she was generally off the key and always off the tune her almost frantic mistress dismissed her before twentyfour hours had passed
Then came Mary Ellen
Mary Ellen began well
She was neat capable and obliging but it did not take her long to discover just how muchand how littleher mistress really knew of practical housekeeping
Matters and things were very different then
Mary Ellen became argumentative impertinent and domineering
She openly shirked her work when it pleased her so to do and demanded perquisites and privileges so insolently that even William asked Billy one day whether Mary Ellen or Billy herself were the mistress of the Strata and Bertram with mock humility inquired how soon Mary Ellen would be wanting the house
Billy in weary despair submitted to this bullying for almost a week then in a sudden accession of outraged dignity that left Mary Ellen gasping with surprise she told the girl to go
And thus the days passed
The maids came and the maids went and to Billy each one seemed a little worse than the one before
Nowhere was there comfort rest or peacefulness
The nights were a torture of apprehension and the days an even greater torture of fulfilment
Noise confusion meals poorly cooked and worse served dust disorder and uncertainty
And this was home Billy told herself bitterly
No wonder that Bertram telephoned more and more frequently that he had met a friend and was dining in town
No wonder that William pushed back his plate almost every meal with his food scarcely touched and then wandered about the house with that hungry homesick homeless look that nearly broke her heart
No wonder indeed
And so it had come
It was true
Aunt Hannah and Kate and the Talk to Young Wives were right
She had not been fit to marry Bertram
She had not been fit to marry anybody
Her honeymoon was not only waning but going into a total eclipse
Had not Bertram already declared that if she would tend to her husband and her home a little more Billy clenched her small hands and set her round chin squarely
Very well she would show them
She would tend to her husband and her home
She fancied she could learn to run that house and run it well
And forthwith she descended to the kitchen and told the then reigning tormentor that her wages would be paid until the end of the week but that her services would be immediately dispensed with
Billy was well aware now that housekeeping was a matter of more than muffins and date puffs
She could gauge in a measure the magnitude of the task to which she had set herself
But she did not falter and very systematically she set about making her plans
With a good stout woman to come in twice a week for the heavier work she believed she could manage by herself very well until Eliza could come back
At least she could serve more palatable meals than the most of those that had appeared lately and at least she could try to make a home that would not drive Bertram to club dinners and Uncle William to hungry wanderings from room to room
Meanwhile all the time she could be learning and in due course she would reach that shining goal of Housekeeping Efficiency short of whichaccording to Aunt Hannah and the Talk to Young Wivesno woman need hope for a waneless honeymoon
So chaotic and erratic had been the household service and so quietly did Billy slip into her new role that it was not until the second meal after the maids departure that the master of the house discovered what had happened
Then as his wife rose to get some forgotten article he questioned with uplifted eyebrows Too good to wait upon us is my lady now eh
My lady is waiting on you smiled Billy
Yes I see this lady is retorted Bertram grimly but I mean our real lady in the kitchen
Great Scott Billy how long are you going to stand this
Billy tossed her head airily though she shook in her shoes
Billy had been dreading this moment
Im not standing it
Shes gone responded Billy cheerfully resuming her seat
Uncle William shant I give you some more pudding
Gone so soon
groaned Bertram as William passed his plate with a smiling nod
Oh well went on Bertram resignedly she stayed longer than the last one
When is the next one coming
Shes already here
Bertram frowned
Here
Butyou served the dessert and At something in Billys face a quick suspicion came into his own
Billy you dont mean that youyou Yes she nodded brightly thats just what I mean
Im the next one
Nonsense
exploded Bertram wrathfully
Oh come Billy weve been all over this before
You know I cant have it
Yes you can
Youve got to have it retorted Billy still with that disarming airy cheerfulness
Besides twont be half so bad as you think
Wasnt that a good pudding tonight
Didnt you both come back for more
Well I made it
Puddings
ejaculated Bertram with an impatient gesture
Billy as Ive said before it takes something besides puddings to run this house
Yes I know it does dimpled Billy and Ive got Mrs Durgin for that part
Shes coming twice a week and more if I need her
Why dearie you dont know anything about how comfortable youre going to be
Ill leave it to Uncle William if But Uncle William had gone
Silently he had slipped from his chair and disappeared
Uncle William it might be mentioned in passing had never quite forgotten Aunt Hannahs fateful call with its dire revelations concerning a certain unwanted superfluous thirdparty husbands brother
Remembering this there were times when he thought absence was both safest and best
This was one of the times
But Billy dear still argued Bertram irritably how can you
You dont know how
Youve had no experience
Billy threw back her shoulders
An ominous light came to her eyes
She was no longer airily playful
Thats exactly it Bertram
I dont know howbut Im going to learn
I havent had experiencebut Im going to get it
I cant make a worse mess of it than weve had ever since Eliza went anyway
But if youd get a maida good maid persisted Bertram feebly
I had oneMary Ellen
She was a good maiduntil she found out how little her mistress knew thenwell you know what it was then
Do you think Id let that thing happen to me again
No sir
Im going into training for my next Mary Ellen
And with a very majestic air Billy rose from the table and began to clear away the dishes
CHAPTER XVII THE EFFICIENCY STARAND BILLY Billy was not a young woman that did things by halves
Long ago in the days of her childhood her Aunt Ella had once said of her If only Billy didnt go into things all over so but whether its measles or mud pies I always know that shell be the measliest or the muddiest of any child in town
It could not be expected therefore that Billy would begin to play her new role now with any lack of enthusiasm
But even had she needed any incentive there was still ever ringing in her ears Bertrams accusing If youd tend to your husband and your home a little more Billy still declared very emphatically that she had forgiven Bertram but she knew in her heart that she had not forgotten
Certainly as the days passed it could not be said that Billy was not tending to her husband and her home
From morning till night now she tended to nothing else
She seldom touched her pianosave to dust itand she never touched her halffinished songmanuscript long since banished to the oblivion of the music cabinet
She made no calls except occasional flying visits to the Annex or to the pretty new home where Marie and Cyril were now delightfully settled
The opera and the Symphony were over for the season but even had they not been Billy could not have attended them
She had no time
Surely she was not doing any gallivanting now she told herself sometimes a little aggrievedly
There was indeed no time
From morning until night Billy was busy flying from one task to another
Her ambition to have everything just right was equalled only by her dogged determination to just show them that she could do this thing
At first of course hampered as she was by ignorance and inexperience each task consumed about twice as much time as was necessary
Yet afterwards when accustomedness had brought its reward of speed there was still for Billy no time for increased knowledge had only opened the way to other paths untrodden and alluring
Study of cookbooks had led to the study of food values
Billy discovered suddenly that potatoes beef onions oranges and puddings were something besides vegetables meat fruit and dessert
They possessed attributes known as proteids fats and carbohydrates
Faint memories of long forgotten school days hinted that these terms had been heard before but never Billy was sure had she fully realized what they meant
It was at this juncture that Billy ran across a book entitled Correct Eating for Efficiency
She bought it at once and carried it home in triumph
It proved to be a marvelous book
Billy had not read two chapters before she began to wonder how the family had managed to live thus far with any sort of success in the face of their dense ignorance and her own criminal carelessness concerning their daily bill of fare
At dinner that night Billy told Bertram and William of her discovery and with growing excitement dilated on the wonderful good that it was to bring to them
Why you dont know you cant imagine what a treasure it is
she exclaimed
It gives a complete table for the exact balancing of food
For what
demanded Bertram glancing up
The exact balancing of food and this book says thats the biggest problem that modern scientists have to solve
Humph
shrugged Bertram
Well you just balance my food to my hunger and Ill agree not to complain
Oh but Bertram its serious really urged Billy looking genuinely distressed
Why it says that what you eat goes to make up what you are
It makes your vital energies
Your brain power and your body power come from what you eat
Dont you see
If youre going to paint a picture you need something different from what you would if you were going toto saw wood and what this book tells isis what I ought to give you to make you do each one I should think from what Ive read so far
Now dont you see how important it is
What if I should give you the sawwood kind of a breakfast when you were just going upstairs to paint all day
And what if I should give Uncle William aa soldiers breakfast when all he is going to do is to go down on State Street and sit still all day
Butbut my dear began Uncle William looking slightly worried theres my eggs that I always have you know
For heavens sake Billy what have you got hold of now
demanded Bertram with just a touch of irritation
Billy laughed merrily
Well I suppose I didnt sound very logical she admitted
But the bookyou just wait
Its in the kitchen
Im going to get it
And with laughing eagerness she ran from the room
In a moment she had returned book in hand
Now listen
This is the real thingnot my garbled inaccuracies
The food which we eat serves three purposes it builds the body substance bone muscle etc it produces heat in the body and it generates vital energy
Nitrogen in different chemical combinations contributes largely to the manufacture of body substances the fats produce heat and the starches and sugars go to make the vital energy
The nitrogenous food elements we call proteins the fats and oils fats and the starches and sugars because of the predominance of carbon we call carbohydrates
Now in selecting the diet for the day you should take care to choose those foods which give the proteins fats and carbohydrates in just the right proportion
 Oh Billy
groaned Bertram
But its so Bertram maintained Billy anxiously
And its every bit here
I dont have to guess at it at all
They even give the quantities of calories of energy required for different sized men
Im going to measure you both tomorrow and you must be weighed too she continued ignoring the sniffs of remonstrance from her two listeners
Then Ill know just how many calories to give each of you
They say a man of average size and weight and sedentary occupation should have at least 2000 calories and some authorities say 3000in this proportion proteins 300 calories fats 350 calories carbohydrates 1350 calories
But you both are taller than five feet five inches and I should think you weighed more than 145 pounds so I cant tell just yet how many calories you will need
How many we will need indeed
ejaculated Bertram
But my dear you know I have to have my eggs began Uncle William again in a worried voice
Of course you do dear and you shall have them soothed Billy brightly
Its only that Ill have to be careful and balance up the other things for the day accordingly
Dont you see
Now listen
Well see what eggs are
She turned the leaves rapidly
Heres the food table
Its lovely
It tells everything
I never saw anything so wonderful
Abcde here we are
Eggs scrambled or boiled fats and proteins one egg 100
If its poached its only 50 but you like yours boiled so well have to reckon on the 100
And you always have two so that means 200 calories in fats and proteins
Now dont you see
If you cant have but 300 proteins and 350 fats all day and youve already eaten 200 in your two eggs thatll leave juster450 for all the rest of the dayof fats and proteins you understand
And youve no idea how fast thatll count up
Why just one serving of butter is 100 of fats and eight almonds is another while a serving of lentils is 100 of proteins
So you see how itll go
Yes I see murmured Uncle William casting a mournful glance about the generously laden table much as if he were bidding farewell to a departing friend
But if I should want more to eat He stopped helplessly and Bertrams aggrieved voice filled the pause
Look here Billy if you think Im going to be measured for an egg and weighed for an almond youre much mistaken because Im not
I want to eat what I like and as much as I like whether its six calories or six thousand
Billy chuckled but she raised her hands in pretended shocked protest
Six thousand
Mercy
Bertram I dont know what would happen if you ate that quantity but Im sure you couldnt paint
Youd just have to saw wood and dig ditches to use up all that vital energy
Humph
scoffed Bertram
Besides this is for efficiency went on Billy with an earnest air
This man owns up that some may think a 2000 calory ration is altogether too small and he advises such to begin with 3000 or even 3500graded of course according to a mans size weight and occupation
But he says one famous man does splendid work on only 1800 calories and another on even 1600
But that is just a matter of chewing
Why Bertram you have no idea what perfectly wonderful things chewing does
Yes Ive heard of that grunted Bertram ten chews to a cherry and sixty to a spoonful of soup
Theres an old metronome upstairs that Cyril left
You might bring it down and set it going on the tableso many ticks to a mouthful I suppose
I reckon with an incentive like that to eat just about two calories would do me
Eh William
Bertram
Now youre only making fun chided Billy and when its really serious too
Now listen she admonished picking up the book again
 If a man consumes a large amount of meat and very few vegetables his diet will be too rich in protein and too lacking in carbohydrates
On the other hand if he consumes great quantities of pastry bread butter and tea his meals will furnish too much energy and not enough building material
There Bertram dont you see
Oh yes I see teased Bertram
William better eat what you can tonight
I foresee its the last meal of just food well get for some time
Hereafter well have proteins fats and carbohydrates made into calory croquettes and Bertram
scolded Billy
But Bertram would not be silenced
Here just let me take that book he insisted dragging the volume from Billys reluctant fingers
Now William listen
Heres your breakfast tomorrow morning strawberries 100 calories wholewheat bread 75 calories butter 100 calories no second helping mind you or youd ruin the balance and something would topple boiled eggs 200 calories cocoa 100 calories which all comes to 570 calories
Sounds like an English bill of fare with a new kind of foreign money but tisnt really you know
Now for luncheon you can have tomato soup 50 calories potato saladthats cheap only 30 calories and But Billy pulled the book away then and in righteous indignation carried it to the kitchen
You dont deserve anything to eat she declared with dignity as she returned to the dining room
No
queried Bertram his eyebrows uplifted
Well as near as I can make out we arent going to getmuch
But Billy did not deign to answer this
In spite of Bertrams tormenting gibes Billy did for some days arrange her meals in accordance with the wonderful table of food given in Correct Eating for Efficiency
To be sure Bertram whatever he found before him during those days anxiously asked whether he were eating fats proteins or carbohydrates and he worried openly as to the possibility of his meals producing one calory too much or too little thus endangering his balance
Billy alternately laughed and scolded to the unvarying good nature of her husband
As it happened however even this was not for long for Billy ran across a magazine article on food adulteration and this so filled her with terror lest in the food served she were killing her family by slow poison that she forgot all about the proteins fats and carbohydrates
Her talk these days was of formaldehyde benzoate of soda and salicylic acid
Very soon too Billy discovered an exclusive Back Bay school for instruction in household economics and domestic hygiene
Billy investigated it at once and was immediately aflame with enthusiasm
She told Bertram that it taught everything everything she wanted to know and forthwith she enrolled herself as one of its most devoted pupils in spite of her husbands protests that she knew enough more than enough already
This school attendance to her consternation Billy discovered took added time but in some way she contrived to find it to take
And so the days passed
Elizas mother though better was still too ill for her daughter to leave her
Billy as the warm weather approached began to look pale and thin
Billy to tell the truth was working altogether too hard but she would not admit it even to herself
At first the novelty of the work and her determination to conquer at all costs had given a fictitious strength to her endurance
Now that the novelty had become accustomedness and the conquering a surety Billy discovered that she had a back that could ache and limbs that at times could almost refuse to move from weariness
There was still however one spur that never failed to urge her to fresh endeavor and to make her at least temporarily forget both ache and weariness and that was the comforting thought that now certainly even Bertram himself must admit that she was tending to her home and her husband
As to BertramBertram it is true had at first uttered frequent and vehement protests against his wifes absorption of both mind and body in that plaguy housework as he termed it
But as the days passed and blessed order superseded chaos peace followed discord and delicious wellserved meals took the place of the horrors that had been called meals in the past he gradually accepted the change with tranquil satisfaction and forgot to question how it was brought about though he did still sometimes rebel because Billy was always too tired or too busy to go out with him
Of late however he had not done even this so frequently for a new Face of a Girl had possessed his soul and all his thoughts and most of his time had gone to putting on canvas the vision of loveliness that his minds eye saw
By June fifteenth the picture was finished
Bertram awoke then to his surroundings
He found summer was upon him with no plans made for its enjoyment
He found William had started West for a two weeks business trip
But what he did not find one dayat least at firstwas his wife when he came home unexpectedly at four oclock
And Bertram especially wanted to find his wife that day for he had met three people whose words had disquieted him not a little
First Aunt Hannah
She had said Bertram where is Billy
She hasnt been out to the Annex for a week and the last time she was there she looked sick
I was real worried about her
Cyril had been next
Wheres Billy
he had asked abruptly
Marie says she hasnt seen her for two weeks
Maries afraid shes sick
She says Billy didnt look well a bit when she did see her
Calderwell had capped the climax
He had said Great Scott Henshaw where have you been keeping yourself
And wheres your wife
Not one of us has caught more than a glimpse of her for weeks
She hasnt sung with us nor played for us nor let us take her anywhere for a month of Sundays
Even Miss Greggory says she hasnt seen much of her and that Billy always says shes too busy to go anywhere
But Miss Greggory says she looks pale and thin and that she thinks shes worrying too much over running the house
I hope she isnt sick
Why no Billy isnt sick
Billys all right Bertram had answered
He had spoken lightly nonchalantly with an elaborate air of carelessness but after he had left Calderwell he had turned his steps abruptly and a little hastily toward home
And he had not found Billyat least not at once
He had gone first down into the kitchen and diningroom
He remembered then uneasily that he had always looked for Billy in the kitchen and diningroom of late
Today however she was not there
On the kitchen table Bertram did see a book wide open and mechanically he picked it up
It was a muchthumbed cookbook and it was open where two onceblank pages bore his wifes handwriting
On the first page under the printed heading Things to Remember he read these sentences That rice swells till every dish in the house is full and that spinach shrinks till you cant find it
That beets boil dry if you look out the window
That biscuits which look as if theyd been mixed up with a rusty stove poker havent really been so but have only got too much undissolved soda in them
There were other sentences but Bertrams eyes chanced to fall on the opposite page where the Things to Remember had been changed to Things to Forget and here Billy had written just four words Burns cuts and yesterdays failures
Bertram dropped the book then with a spasmodic clearing of his throat and hurriedly resumed his search
When he did find his wife at last he gave a cry of dismayshe was on her own bed huddled in a little heap and shaking with sobs
Billy
Why Billy
he gasped striding to the bedside
Billy sat up at once and hastily wiped her eyes
Oh is it you BBertram
I didnt hear you come in
Youyou ssaid you werent coming till six oclock
she choked
Billy what is the meaning of this
Nnothing
II guess Im just tired
What have you been doing
Bertram spoke sternly almost sharply
He was wondering why he had not noticed before the little hollows in his wifes cheeks
Billy what have you been doing
Why nnothing extra only some sweeping and cleaning out the refrigerator
Sweeping
Cleaning
You I thought Mrs Durgin did that
She does
I mean she did
But she couldnt come
She broke her legfell off the stepladder where she was three days ago
So I had to do it
And today someway everything went wrong
I burned me and I cut me and I used two sodas with not any cream of tartar and I should think I didnt know anything not anything
And down went Billys head into the pillows again in another burst of sobs
With gentle yet uncompromising determination Bertram gathered his wife into his arms and carried her to the big chair
There for a few minutes he soothed and petted her as if she were a tired childwhich indeed she was
Billy this thing has got to stop he said then
There was a very inexorable ring of decision in his voice
What thing
This housework business
Billy sat up with a jerk
But Bertram it isnt fair
You cantyou mustntjust because of today
I can do it
I have done it
Ive done it days and days and its gone beautifullyeven if they did say I couldnt
Couldnt what
Be an eefficient housekeeper
Who said you couldnt
Aunt Hannah and KKate
Bertram said a savage word under his breath
Holy smoke Billy
I didnt marry you for a cook or a scrublady
If you had to do it that would be another matter of course and if we did have to do it we wouldnt have a big house like this for you to do it in
But I didnt marry for a cook and I knew I wasnt getting one when I married you
Billy bridled into instant wrath
Well I like that Bertram Henshaw
Cant I cook
Havent I proved that I can cook
Bertram laughed and kissed the indignant lips till they quivered into an unwilling smile
Bless your spunky little heart of course you have
But that doesnt mean that I want you to do it
You see it so happens that you can do other things too and Id rather you did those
Billy you havent played to me for a week nor sung to me for a month
Youre too tired every night to talk or read together or go anywhere with me
I married for companionshipnot cooking and sweeping
Billy shook her head stubbornly
Her mouth settled into determined lines
Thats all very well to say
You arent hungry now Bertram
But its different when you are and they said twould be
Humph
They are Aunt Hannah and Kate I suppose
Yesand the Talk to Young Wives
 The wwhat
Billy choked a little
She had forgotten that Bertram did not know about the Talk to Young Wives
She wished that she had not mentioned the book but now that she had she would make the best of it
She drew herself up with dignity
Its a book a very nice book
It says lots of thingsthat have come true
Where is that book
Let me see it please
With visible reluctance Billy got down from her perch on Bertrams knee went to her desk and brought back the book
Bertram regarded it frowningly so frowningly that Billy hastened to its defense
And its truewhat it says in there and what Aunt Hannah and Kate said
It is different when theyre hungry
You said yourself if Id tend to my husband and my home a little more and Bertram looked up with unfeigned amazement
I said what
he demanded
In a voice shaken with emotion Billy repeated the fateful words
I neverwhen did I say that
The night Uncle William and I came home fromPetes
For a moment Bertram stared dumbly then a shamed red swept to his forehead
Billy did I say that
I ought to be shot if I did
But Billy you said youd forgiven me
I did deartruly I did but dont you see
it was true
I hadnt tended to things
So Ive been doing it since
A sudden comprehension illuminated Bertrams face
Heavens Billy
And is that why you havent been anywhere or done anything
Is that why Calderwell said today that you hadnt been with them anywhere and that Great Scott Billy
Did you think I was such a selfish brute as that
Oh but when I was going with them I was following the bookI thought quavered Billy and hurriedly she turned the leaves to a carefully marked passage
Its thereabout the outside interests
See
I was trying to brush up against them so that I wouldnt interfere with your Art
Then when you accused me of gallivanting off with But Bertram swept her back into his arms and not for some minutes could Billy make a coherent speech again
Then Bertram spoke
See here Billy he exploded a little shakily if I could get you off somewhere on a desert island where there werent any Aunt Hannahs or Kates or Talks to Young Wives I think thered be a chance to make you happy but Oh but there was truth in it interrupted Billy sitting erect again
I didnt know how to run a house and it was perfectly awful while we were having all those dreadful maids one after the other and no woman should be a wife who doesnt know All right all right dear interrupted Bertram in his turn
Well concede that point if you like
But you do know now
Youve got the efficient housewife racket down pat even to the last calory your husband should be fed and Ill warrant there isnt a Mary Ellen in Christendom who can find a spot of ignorance on you as big as a pinhead
So well call that settled
What you need now is a good rest and youre going to have it too
Im going to have six Mary Ellens here tomorrow morning
Six
Do you hear
And all youve got to do is to get your gladdest rags together for a trip to Europe with me next month
Because were going
I shall get the tickets to morrow after I send the six Mary Ellens packing up here
Now come put on your bonnet
Were going down town to dinner
CHAPTER XVIII BILLY TRIES HER HAND AT MANAGING Bertram did not engage six Mary Ellens the next morning nor even one as it happened for that evening Elizawho had not been unaware of conditions at the Stratatelephoned to say that her mother was so much better now she believed she could be spared to come to the Strata for several hours each day if Mrs Henshaw would like to have her begin in that way
Billy agreed promptly and declared herself as more than willing to put up with such an arrangement
Bertram it is true when he heard of the plan rebelled and asserted that what Billy needed was a rest an entire rest from care and labor
In fact what he wanted her to do he said was to gallivantto gallivant all day long
Nonsense
Billy had laughed coloring to the tips of her ears
Besides as for the work Bertram with just you and me here and with all my vast experience now and Eliza here for several hours every day itll be nothing but play for this little time before we go away
Youll see
All right Ill see then Bertram had nodded meaningly
But just make sure that it is play for you
I will laughed Billy and there the matter had ended
Eliza began work the next day and Billy did indeed soon find herself playing under Bertrams watchful insistence
She resumed her music and brought out of exile the unfinished song
With Bertram she took drives and walks and every two or three days she went to see Aunt Hannah and Marie
She was pleasantly busy too with plans for her coming trip and it was not long before even the remorseful Bertram had to admit that Billy was looking and appearing quite like her old self
At the Annex Billy found Calderwell and Arkwright one day
They greeted her as if she had just returned from a far country
Well if you arent the stranger lady began Calderwell looking frankly pleased to see her
Wed thought of advertising in the daily press somewhat after this fashion Lost strayed or stolen one Billy comrade good friend and kind cheererup of lonely hearts
Any information thankfully received by her bereft sorrowing friends
 Billy joined in the laugh that greeted this sally but Arkwright noticed that she tried to change the subject from her own affairs to a discussion of the new song on Alice Greggorys piano
Calderwell however was not to be silenced
The last I heard of this elusive Billy he resumed with teasing cheerfulness she was running down a certain lost calory that had slipped away from her husbands breakfast and Billy wheeled sharply
Where did you get hold of that
she demanded
Oh I didnt returned the man defensively
I never got hold of it at all
I never even saw the calorythough for that matter I dont think I should know one if I did see it
What we feared was that in hunting the lost calory you had lost yourself and But Billy would hear no more
With her disdainful nose in the air she walked to the piano
Come Mr Arkwright she said with dignity
Lets try this song
Arkwright rose at once and accompanied her to the piano
They had sung the song through twice when Billy became uneasily aware that on the other side of the room Calderwell and Alice Greggory were softly chuckling over something they had found in a magazine
Billy frowned and twitched the corners of a pile of music with restless fingers
I wonder if Alice hasnt got some quartets here somewhere she murmured her disapproving eyes still bent on the absorbed couple across the room
Arkwright was silent
Billy throwing a hurried glance into his face thought she detected a somber shadow in his eyes
She thought too she knew why it was there
So possessed had Billy been during the early winter of the idea that her special mission in life was to inaugurate and foster a love affair between disappointed Mr Arkwright and lonely Alice Greggory that now she forgot for a moment that Arkwright himself was quite unaware of her efforts
She thought only that the present shadow on his face must be caused by the same thing that brought worry to her own heartthe manifest devotion of Calderwell to Alice Greggory just now across the room
Instinctively therefore as to a coworker in a common cause she turned a disturbed face to the man at her side
It is indeed high time that I looked after something besides lost calories she said significantly
Then at the evident uncomprehension in Arkwrights face she added Has it been going on like thisvery long
Arkwright still apparently did not understand
Haswhat been going on
he questioned
Thatover there answered Billy impatiently scarcely knowing whether to be more irritated at the threatened miscarriage of her cherished plans or at Arkwrights to her wilfully blind insistence on her making her meaning more plain
Has it been going on longsuch utter devotion
As she asked the question Billy turned and looked squarely into Arkwrights face
She saw therefore the great change that came to it as her meaning became clear to him
Her first feeling was one of shocked realization that Arkwright had indeed been really blind
Her secondshe turned away her eyes hurriedly from what she thought she saw in the mans countenance
With an assumedly gay little cry she sprang to her feet
Come come what are you two children chuckling over
she demanded crossing the room abruptly
Didnt you hear me say I wanted you to come and sing a quartet
Billy blamed herself very much for what she called her stupidity in so baldly summoning Arkwrights attention to Calderwells devotion to Alice Greggory
She declared that she ought to have known better and she asked herself if this were the way she was furthering matters between Alice Greggory and Arkwright
Billy was really seriously disturbed
She had never quite forgiven herself for being so blind to Arkwrights feeling for herself during those days when he had not known of her engagement to Bertram
She had never forgotten either the painful scene when he had hopefully told of his love only to be met with her own shocked repudiation
For long weeks after that his face had haunted her
She had wished oh so ardently that she could do something in some way to bring him happiness
When therefore it had come to her knowledge afterward that he was frequently with his old friend Alice Greggory she had been so glad
It was very easy then to fan hope into conviction that here in this old friend he had found sweet balm for his wounded heart and she determined at once to do all that she could do to help
So very glowing indeed was her eagerness in the matter that it looked suspiciously as if she thought could she but bring this thing about that old scores against herself would be erased
Billy told herself virtuously however that not only for Arkwright did she desire this marriage to take place but for Alice Greggory
In the very nature of things Alice would one day be left alone
She was poor and not very strong
She sorely needed the shielding love and care of a good husband
What more natural than that her oldtime friend and almostsweetheart M J Arkwright should be that good husband
That really it was more Arkwright and less Alice that was being considered however was proved when the devotion of Calderwell began to be first suspected then known for a fact
Billys distress at this turn of affairs indicated very plainly that it was not just a husband but a certain one particular husband that she desired for Alice Greggory
All the more disturbed was she therefore when today seeing her three friends together again for the first time for some weeks she discovered increased evidence that her worst fears were to be realized
It was to be Alice and Calderwell not Alice and Arkwright
Arkwright was again to be disappointed in his dearest hopes
Telling herself indignantly that it could not be it should not be Billy determined to remain after the men had gone and speak to Alice
Just what she would say she did not know
Even what she could say she was not sure
But certainly there must be something some little thing that she could say which would open Alices eyes to what she was doing and what she ought to do
It was in this frame of mind therefore that Billy after Arkwright and Calderwell had gone spoke to Alice
She began warily with assumed nonchalance
I believe Mr Arkwright sings better every time I hear him
There was no answer
Alice was sorting music at the piano
Dont you think so
Billy raised her voice a little
Alice turned almost with a start
Whats that
Oh yes
Well I dont know maybe I do
You wouldif you didnt hear him any oftener than I do laughed Billy
But then of course you do hear him oftener
I
Oh no indeed
Not so very much oftener
Alice had turned back to her music
There was a slight embarrassment in her manner
I wonderwherethat new songis she murmured
Billy who knew very well where the song lay was not to be diverted
Nonsense
As if Mr Arkwright wasnt always telling how Alice liked this song and didnt like that one and thought the other the best yet
I dont believe he sings a thing that he doesnt first sing to you
For that matter I fancy he asks your opinion of everything anyway
Why Billy he doesnt
exclaimed Alice a deep red flaming into her cheeks
You know he doesnt
Billy laughed gleefully
She had not been slow to note the color in her friends face or to ascribe to it the one meaning she wished to ascribe to it
So sure indeed was she now that her fears had been groundless that she flung caution to the winds
Ho
My dear Alice you cant expect us all to be blind she teased
Besides we all think its such a lovely arrangement that were just glad to see it
Hes such a fine fellow and we like him so much
We couldnt ask for a better husband for you than Mr Arkwright and From sheer amazement at the sudden white horror in Alice Greggorys face Billy stopped short
Why Alice
she faltered then
With a visible effort Alice forced her trembling lips to speak
My husbandMr
Arkwright Why Billy you couldnt have seenyou havent seen theres nothing you could see
He isnthe wasnthe cant be
Wewere nothing but friends Billy just good friends
Billy though dismayed was still not quite convinced
Friends
Nonsense
When But Alice interrupted feverishly
Alice in an agony of fear lest the true state of affairs should be suspected was hiding behind a bulwark of pride
Now Billy please
Say no more
Youre quite wrong entirely
Youll never never hear of my marrying Mr Arkwright
As I said before were friendsthe best of friends that is all
We couldnt be anything else possibly
Billy plainly discomfited fell back but she threw a sharp glance into her friends flushed countenance
You meanbecause ofHugh Calderwell
she demanded
Then for the second time that afternoon throwing discretion to the winds she went on plaintively You wont listen of course
Girls in love never do
Hugh is all right and I like him but theres more real solid worth in Mr Arkwrights little finger than there is in Hughs whole self
And But a merry peal of laughter from Alice Greggory interrupted
And pray do you think Im in love with Hugh Calderwell
she demanded
There was a curious note of something very like relief in her voice
Well I didnt know began Billy uncertainly
Then Ill tell you now smiled Alice
Im not
Furthermore perhaps its just as well that you should know right now that I dont intend to marryever
Oh Alice
No
There was determination and there was still that curious note of relief in the girls voice
It was as if somewhere a great danger had been avoided
I have my music
That is enough
Im not intending to marry
Oh but Alice while I will own up Im glad it isnt Hugh Calderwell there is Mr Arkwright and I did hope But Alice shook her head and turned resolutely away
At that moment too Aunt Hannah came in from the street so Billy could say no more
Aunt Hannah dropped herself a little wearily into a chair
Ive just come from Maries she said
How is she
asked Billy
Aunt Hannah smiled and raised her eyebrows
Well just now shes quite exercised over another rattlefrom her cousin out West this time
There were four little silver bells on it and she hasnt got any janitors wife now to give it to
Billy laughed softly but Aunt Hannah had more to say
You know she isnt going to allow any toys but Teddy bears and woolly lambs of which I believe she has already bought quite an assortment
She says they dont rattle or squeak
I declare when I see the woolen pads and rubber hushers that that child has put everywhere all over the house I dont know whether to laugh or cry
And shes so worried
It seems Cyril must needs take just this time to start composing a new opera or symphony or something and never before has she allowed him to be interrupted by anything on such an occasion
But what hell do when the baby comes she says she doesnt know for she says she cantshe just cant keep it from bothering him some shes afraid
As if any opera or symphony that ever lived was of more consequence than a mans own child
finished Aunt Hannah with an indignant sniff as she reached for her shawl
CHAPTER XIX A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK FOR CYRIL It was early in the forenoon of the first day of July that Eliza told her mistress that Mrs Stetson was asking for her at the telephone
Elizas face was not a little troubled
Im afraid maybe it isnt good news she stammered as her mistress hurriedly arose
Shes at Mr Cyril HenshawsMrs Stetson isand she seemed so terribly upset about something that there was no making real sense out of what she said
But she asked for you and said to have you come quick
Billy her own face paling was already at the telephone
Yes Aunt Hannah
What is it
Oh my grief and conscience Billy if you can come up here please
You must come
Cant you come
Why yes of course
ButbutMarie Thethe baby A faint groan came across the wires
Oh my grief and conscience Billy
It isnt the baby
Its babies Its twinsboys
Cyril has them nowthe nurse hasnt got here yet
Twins
Cyril has them
broke in Billy hysterically
Yes and theyre crying something terrible
Weve sent for a second nurse to come too of course but she hasnt got here yet either
And those babiesif you could hear them
Thats what we want you for to But Billy was almost laughing now
All right Ill come outand hear them she called a bit wildly as she hung up the receiver
Some little time later a palpably nervous maid admitted Billy to the home of Mr and Mrs Cyril Henshaw
Even as the door was opened Billy heard faintly but unmistakably the moaning wails of two infants
Mrs Stetson says if you will please to help Mr Henshaw with the babies stammered the maid after the preliminary questions and answers
Ive been in when I could and theyre all right only theyre crying
Theyre in his den
We had to put them as far away as possible their crying worried Mrs Henshaw so
Yes I see murmured Billy
Ill go to them at once
No dont trouble to come
I know the way
Just tell Mrs Stetson Im here please she finished as she tossed her hat and gloves on to the hall table and turned to go upstairs
Billys feet made no sound on the soft rugs
The crying however grew louder and louder as she approached the den
Softly she turned the knob and pushed open the door
She stopped short then at what she saw
Cyril had not heard her nor seen her
His back was partly toward the door
His coat was off and his hair stood fiercely on end as if a nervous hand had ruffled it
His usually pale face was very red and his forehead showed great drops of perspiration
He was on his feet hovering over the couch at each end of which lay a rumpled roll of linen lace and flannel from which emerged a prodigiously puckered little face two uncertainly waving roseleaf fists and a wail of protesting rage that was not uncertain in the least
In one hand Cyril held a Teddy bear in the other his watch dangling from its fob chain
Both of these he shook feebly one after the other above the tiny faces
Oh come come pretty baby good baby hush hush he begged agitatedly
In the doorway Billy clapped her hands to her lips and stifled a laugh
Billy knew of course that what she should do was to go forward at once and help this poor distracted man but Billy just then was not doing what she knew she ought to do
With a muttered ejaculation which Billy to her sorrow could not catch Cyril laid down the watch and flung the Teddy bear aside
Then in very evident despair he gingerly picked up one of the rumpled rolls of flannel lace and linen and held it straight out before him
After a moments indecision he began awkwardly to jounce it teeter it rock it back and forth and to pat it jerkily
Oh come come pretty baby good baby hush hush he begged again frantically
Perhaps it was the change of position perhaps it was the novelty of the motion perhaps it was only utter weariness or lack of breath
Whatever the cause the wailing sobs from the bundle in his arms dwindled suddenly to a gentle whisper then ceased altogether
With a ray of hope illuminating his drawn countenance Cyril carefully laid the baby down and picked up the other
Almost confidently now he began the jouncing and teetering and rocking as before
There there
Oh come come pretty baby good baby hush hush he chanted again
This time he was not so successful
Perhaps he had lost his skill
Perhaps it was merely the worldold difference in babies
At all events this infant did not care for jerks and jounces and showed it plainly by emitting loud and yet louder wails of ragewails in which his brother on the couch speedily joined
Oh come come pretty baby good baby hush hushconfound it HUSH I say
exploded the frightened weary baffled distracted man picking up the other baby and trying to hold both his sons at once
Billy hurried forward then tearfully remorsefully her face all sympathy her arms all tenderness
Here Cyril let me help you she cried
Cyril turned abruptly
Thank God some ones come he groaned holding out both the babies with an exuberance of generosity
Billy youve saved my life
Billy laughed tremulously
Yes Ive come Cyril and Ill help every bit I can but I dont know a thingnot a single thing about them myself
Dear me arent they cunning
But Cyril do they always cry so
The fatherofanhour drew himself stiffly erect
Cry
What do you mean
Why shouldnt they cry
he demanded indignantly
I want you to understand that Doctor Brown said those were A number I fine boys
Anyhow I guess theres no doubt theyve got lungs all right he added with a grim smile as he pulled out his handkerchief and drew it across his perspiring brow
Billy did not have an opportunity to show Cyril how much or how little she knew about babies for in another minute the maid had appeared with the extra nurse and that young woman with trained celerity and easy confidence assumed instant command and speedily had peace and order restored
Cyril freed from responsibility cast longing eyes for a moment upon his work but the next minute with a despairing glance about him he turned and fled precipitately
Billy following the direction of his eyes suppressed a smile
On the top of Cyrils manuscript music on the table lay a hotwater bottle
Draped over the back of his favorite chair was a pink bordered baby blanket
On the pianostool rested a beribboned and beruffled babys toilet basket
From behind the sofa pillow leered ridiculously the Teddy bear just as it had left Cyrils desperate hand
No wonder indeed that Billy smiled
Billy was thinking of what Marie had said not a week before I shall keep the baby of course in the nursery
Ive been in homes where theyve had baby things strewn from one end of the house to the other but it wont be that way here
In the first place I dont believe in it but even if I did Id have to be careful on account of Cyril
Imagine Cyrils trying to write his music with a baby in the room
No
I shall keep the baby in the nursery if possible but wherever it is it wont be anywhere near Cyrils den anyway
Billy suppressed many a smile during the days that immediately followed the coming of the twins
Some of the smiles however refused to be suppressed
They became indeed shamelessly audible chuckles
Billy was to sail the tenth and naturally during those early July days her time was pretty much occupied with her preparations for departure but nothing could keep her from frequent though short visits to the home of her brother inlaw
The twins were proving themselves to be fine healthy boys
Two trained maids and two trained nurses ruled the household with a rod of iron
As to CyrilBilly declared that Cyril was learning something every day of his life now
Oh yes hes learning things she said to Aunt Hannah one morning lots of things
For instance he has his breakfast now not when he wants it but when the maid wants to give it to himwhich is precisely at eight oclock every morning
So hes learning punctuality
And for the first time in his life he has discovered the astounding fact that there are several things more important in the world than is the special piece of music he happens to be composing chiefly the twins bath the twins nap the twins airing and the twins colic
Aunt Hannah laughed though she frowned too
But surely Billy with two nurses and the maids Cyril doesnt have toto She came to a helpless pause
Oh no laughed Billy Cyril doesnt have to really attend to any of those thingsthough I have seen each of the nurses at different times unhesitatingly thrust a twin into his arms and bid him hold the child till she comes back
But its this way
You see Marie must be kept quiet and the nursery is very near her room
It worries her terribly when either of the children cries
Besides the little rascals have apparently fixed up some sort of laborunion compact with each other so that if one cries for something or nothing the other promptly joins in and helps
So the nurses have got into the habit of picking up the first disturber of the peace and hurrying him to quarters remote and Cyrils den being the most remote of all they usually fetch up there
You meanthey take those babies into Cyrils dennow
Even Aunt Hannah was plainly aghast
Yes twinkled Billy
I fancy their Hygienic Immaculacies approved of Cyrils bare floors undraped windows and generally knick knackless condition
Anyhow theyve made his den a sort ofof annex to the nursery
Butbut Cyril
What does he say
stammered the dumfounded Aunt Hannah
Think of Cyrils standing a thing like that
Doesnt he do anythingor say anything
Billy smiled and lifted her brows quizzically
My dear Aunt Hannah did you ever know many people to have the courage to say things to one of those becapped beaproned bespotless creatures of loftily superb superiority known as trained nurses
Besides you wouldnt recognize Cyril now
Nobody would
Hes as meek as Moses and has been ever since his two young sons were laid in his reluctant trembling arms
He breaks into a cold sweat at nothing and moves about his own home as if he were a stranger and an interloper endured merely on sufferance in this abode of strange women and strange babies
Nonsense
scoffed Aunt Hannah
But its so maintained Billy merrily
Now for instance
You know Cyril always has been in the habit of venting his moods on the piano just as I do only more so by playing exactly as he feels
Well as near as I can gather he was at his usual trick the next day after the twins arrived and you can imagine about what sort of music it would be after what he had been through the preceding fortyeight hours
Of course I dont know exactly what happened but JuliaMaries second maid you knowtells the story
Shes been with them long enough to know something of the way the whole household always turns on the pivot of the masters whims so she fully appreciated the situation
She says she heard him begin to play and that she never heard such queer creepy shivery music in her life but that he hadnt been playing five minutes before one of the nurses came into the livingroom where Julia was dusting and told her to tell whoever was playing to stop that dreadful noise as they wanted to take the twins in there for their nap
 But I didnt do it maam Julia says
I want lookin for losin my place an I let the young woman do the job herself
An she done it pert as you please
An jest as I was seekin a hidinplace for the explosion if Mr Henshaw didnt come out lookin a little wild but as meek as a lamb an when he sees me he asked wouldnt I please get him a cup of coffee good an strong
An I got it
So you see finished Billy Cyril is learning thingslots of things
Oh my grief and conscience
I should say he was halfshivered Aunt Hannah
Cyril looking meek as a lamb indeed
Billy laughed merrily
Well it must be a new experiencefor Cyril
For a man whose daily existence for years has been rubberheeled and woolenpadded and whose family from boyhood has stood at attention and saluted if he so much as looked at them it must be quite a change as things are now
However itll be different of course when Marie is on her feet again
Does she know at all how things are going
Not very much as yet though I believe she has begun to worry some
She confided to me one day that she was glad of course that she had two darling babies instead of one but that she was afraid it might be hard just at first to teach them both at once to be quiet for she was afraid that while she was teaching one the other would be sure to cry or do something noisy
Do something noisy indeed
ejaculated Aunt Hannah
As for the real state of affairs Marie doesnt dream that Cyrils sacred den is given over to Teddy bears and baby blankets
All is I hope shell be measurably strong before she does find it out laughed Billy as she rose to go
CHAPTER XX ARKWRIGHTS EYES ARE OPENED William came back from his business trip the eighth of July and on the ninth Billy and Bertram went to New York
Elizas mother was so well now that Eliza had taken up her old quarters in the Strata and the household affairs were once more running like clockwork
Later in the season William would go away for a months fishing trip and the house would be closed
Mr and Mrs Bertram Henshaw were not expected to return until the first of October but with Eliza to look after the comfort of William the mistress of the house did no worrying
Ever since Petes going Eliza had said that she preferred to be the only maid with a charwoman to come in for the heavier work and to this arrangement her mistress had willingly consented for the present
Marie and the babies were doing finely and Aunt Hannahs health and affairs at the Annex were all that could be desired
As Billy indeed saw it there was only one flaw to mar her perfect content on this holiday trip with Bertram and that was her disappointment over the very evident disaster that had come to her cherished matrimonial plans for Arkwright and Alice Greggory
She could not forget Arkwrights face that day at the Annex when she had so foolishly called his attention to Calderwells devotion and she could not forget either Alice Greggorys very obvious perturbation a little later and her suspiciously emphatic assertion that she had no intention of marrying any one certainly not Arkwright
As Billy thought of all this now she could not but admit that it did look dark for Arkwrightpoor Arkwright whom she more than any one else in the world perhaps had a special reason for wishing to see happily married
There was then this one cloud on Billys horizon as the big boat that was to bear her across the water steamed down the harbor that beautiful July day
As it chanced naturally perhaps not only was Billy thinking of Arkwright that morning but Arkwright was thinking of Billy
Arkwright had thought frequently of Billy during the last few days particularly since that afternoon meeting at the Annex when the four had renewed their old good times together
Up to that day Arkwright had been trying not to think of Billy
He had been fighting his tiger skin
Sternly he had been forcing himself to meet her to see her to talk with her to sing with her or to pass her byall with the indifference properly expected to be shown in association with Mrs Bertram Henshaw another mans wife
He had known of course that deep down in his heart he loved her always had loved her and always would love her
Hopelessly and drearily he accepted this as a fact even while with all his might fighting that tiger skin
So sure was he indeed of this so implicitly had he accepted it as an unalterable certainty that in time even his efforts to fight it became almost mechanical and unconscious in their stern round of forced indifference
Then came that day at the Annexand the discovery the discovery which he had made when Billy called his attention to Calderwell and Alice Greggory across the room in the corner the discovery which had come with so blinding a force and which even now he was tempted to question as to its reality the discovery that not Billy Neilson nor Mrs Bertram Henshaw nor even the tender ghost of a lost love held the center of his heartbut Alice Greggory
The first intimation of all this had come with his curious feeling of unreasoning hatred and blind indignation toward Calderwell as through Billys eyes he had seen the two together
Then had come the overwhelming longing to pick up Alice Greggory and run off with hersomewhere anywhere so that Calderwell could not follow
At once however he had pulled himself up short with the mental cry of Absurd
What was it to him if Calderwell did care for Alice Greggory
Surely he himself was not in love with the girl
He was in love with Billy that is It was all confusion then in his mind and he was glad indeed when he could leave the house
He wanted to be alone
He wanted to think
He must in some way thrash out this astounding thing that had come to him
Arkwright did not visit the Annex again for some days
Until he was more nearly sure of himself and of his feelings he did not wish to see Alice Greggory
It was then that he began to think of Billy deliberately purposefully for it must be of course that he had made a mistake he told himself
It must be that he did really still care for Billythough of course he ought not to
Arkwright made another discovery then
He learned that however deliberately he started in to think of Billy he ended every time in thinking of Alice
He thought of how good she had been to him and of how faithful she had been in helping him to fight his love for Billy
Just here he decided for a moment that probably after all his feeling of anger against Calderwell was merely the fear of losing this helpful comradeship that he so needed
Even with himself however Arkwright could not keep up this farce long and very soon he admitted miserably that it was not the comradeship of Alice Greggory that he wanted or needed but the love
He knew it now
No longer was there any use in beating about the bush
He did love Alice Greggory but so curiously and unbelievably stupid had he been that he had not found it out until now
And now it was too late
Had not even Billy called his attention to the fact of Calderwells devotion
Besides had not he himself at the very first told Calderwell that he might have a clear field
Fool that he had been to let another thus lightly step in and win from under his very nose what might have been his if he had but known his own mind before it was too late
But was it after all quite too late
He and Alice were old friends
Away back in their young days in their native town they had been indeed almost sweethearts in a boyandgirl fashion
It would not have taken much in those days he believed to have made the relationship more interesting
But changes had come
Alice had left town and for years they had drifted apart
Then had come Billy and Billy had found Alice thus bringing about the odd circumstance of their renewing of acquaintanceship
Perhaps at that time if he had not already thought he cared for Billy there would have been something more than acquaintanceship
But he had thought he cared for Billy all these years and now at this late day to wake up and find that he cared for Alice
A pretty mess he had made of things
Was he so inconstant then so fickle
Did he not know his own mind five minutes at a time
What would Alice Greggory think even if he found the courage to tell her
What could she think
What could anybody think
Arkwright fairly ground his teeth in impotent wrathand he did not know whether he were the most angry that he did not love Billy or that he had loved Billy or that he loved somebody else now
It was while he was in this unenviable frame of mind that he went to see Alice
Not that he had planned definitely to speak to her of his discovery nor yet that he had planned not to
He had indeed planned nothing
For a man usually so decided as to purpose and energetic as to action he was in a most unhappy state of uncertainty and changeableness
One thing only was unmistakably clear to him and that was that he must see Alice
For months now he had taken to Alice all his hopes and griefs perplexities and problems and never had he failed to find comfort in the shape of sympathetic understanding and wise counsel
To Alice therefore now he turned as a matter of course telling himself vaguely that perhaps after he had seen Alice he would feel better
Just how intimately this particular problem of his concerned Alice herself he did not stop to realize
He did not indeed think of it at all from Alices standpointuntil he came face to face with the girl in the livingroom at the Annex
Then suddenly he did
His manner became at once consequently full of embarrassment and quite devoid of its usual frank friendliness
As it happened this was perhaps the most unfortunate thing that could have occurred so far as it concerned the attitude of Alice Greggory for thereby innumerable tiny sparks of suspicion that had been tormenting the girl for days were instantly fanned into consuming flames of conviction
Alice had not been slow to note Arkwrights prolonged absence from the Annex
Coming as it did so soon after her most disconcerting talk with Billy in regard to her own relations with him it had filled her with frightened questionings
If Billy had seen things to make her think of linking their names together perhaps Arkwright himself had heard some such idea put forth somewhere and that was why he was staying awayto show the world that there was no foundation for such rumors
Perhaps he was even doing it to show her that Even in her thoughts Alice could scarcely bring herself to finish the sentence
That Arkwright should ever suspect for a moment that she cared for him was intolerable
Painfully conscious as she was that she did care for him it was easy to fear that others must be conscious of it too
Had she not already proof that Billy suspected it
Why then might not it be quite possible even probable that Arkwright suspected it also and because he did suspect it had decided that it would be just as well perhaps if he did not call so often
In spite of Alices angry insistence to herself that after all this could not be the case that the man knew she understood he still loved Billyshe could not help fearing in the face of Arkwrights unusual absence that it might yet be true
When therefore he finally did appear only to become at once obviously embarrassed in her presence her fears instantly became convictions
It was true then
The man did believe she cared for him and he had been trying to teach herto save her
To teach her
To save her indeed
Very well he should see
And forthwith from that moment Alice Greggorys chief reason for living became to prove to Mr M J Arkwright that he needed not to teach her to save her nor yet to sympathize with her
How do you do
she greeted him with a particularly bright smile
Im sure I hope you are well such a beautiful day as this
Oh yes Im well I suppose
Still I have felt better in my life smiled Arkwright with some constraint
Oh Im sorry murmured the girl striving so hard to speak with impersonal unconcern that she did not notice the inaptness of her reply
Eh
Sorry Ive felt better are you
retorted Arkwright with nervous humor
Then because he was embarrassed he said the one thing he had meant not to say Dont you think Im quite a stranger
Its been some time since Ive been here
Alice smarting under the sting of what she judged to be the only possible cause for his embarrassment leaped to this new opportunity to show her lack of interest
Oh has it
she murmured carelessly
Well I dont know but it has now that I come to think of it
Arkwright frowned gloomily
A week ago he would have tossed back a laughingly aggrieved remark as to her unflattering indifference to his presence
Now he was in no mood for such joking
It was too serious a matter with him
Youve been busy no doubt withother matters he presumed forlornly thinking of Calderwell
Yes I have been busy assented the girl
One is always happier I think to be busy
Not that I meant that I needed the work to be happy she added hastily in a panic lest he think she had a consuming sorrow to kill
No of course not he murmured abstractedly rising to his feet and crossing the room to the piano
Then with an elaborate air of trying to appear very natural he asked jovially Anything new to play to me
Alice arose at once
Yes
I have a little nocturne that I was playing to Mr Calderwell last night
Oh to Calderwell
Arkwright had stiffened perceptibly
Yes
He didnt like it
Ill play it to you and see what you say she smiled seating herself at the piano
Well if he had liked it its safe to say I shouldnt shrugged Arkwright
Nonsense
laughed the girl beginning to appear more like her natural self
I should think you were Mr Cyril Henshaw
Mr Calderwell is partial to ragtime Ill admit
But there are some good things he likes
There are indeed some good things he likes returned Arkwright with grim emphasis his somber eyes fixed on what he believed to be the one especial object of Calderwells affections at the moment
Alice unaware both of the melancholy gaze bent upon herself and of the cause thereof laughed again merrily
Poor Mr Calderwell she cried as she let her fingers slide into soft introductory chords
He isnt to blame for not liking what he calls our lost spirits that wail
Its just the way hes made
Arkwright vouchsafed no reply
With an abrupt gesture he turned and began to pace the room moodily
At the piano Alice slipped from the chords into the nocturne
She played it straight through then with a charm and skill that brought Arkwrights feet to a pause before it was half finished
By George thats great
he breathed when the last tone had quivered into silence
Yes isnt itbeautiful
she murmured
The room was very quiet and in semidarkness
The last rays of a late June sunset had been filling the room with golden light but it was gone now
Even at the piano by the window Alice had barely been able to see clearly enough to read the notes of her nocturne
To Arkwright the air still trembled with the exquisite melody that had but just left her fingers
A quick fire came to his eyes
He forgot everything but that it was Alice there in the halflight by the windowAlice whom he loved
With a low cry he took a swift step toward her
Alice
Instantly the girl was on her feet
But it was not toward him that she turned
It was away resolutely and with a haste that was strangely like terror
Alice too had forgotten for just a moment
She had let herself drift into a dream world where there was nothing but the music she was playing and the man she loved
Then the music had stopped and the man had spoken her name
Alice remembered then
She remembered Billy whom this man loved
She remembered the long days just passed when this man had stayed away presumably to teach herto save her
And now at the sound of his voice speaking her name she had almost bared her heart to him
No wonder that Alice with a haste that looked like terror crossed the floor and flooded the room with light
Dear me
she shivered carefully avoiding Arkwrights eyes
If Mr Calderwell were here now hed have some excuse to talk about our lost spirits that wail
That is a creepy piece of music when you play it in the dark
And for fear that he should suspect how her heart was aching she gave a particularly brilliant and joyous smile
Once again at the mention of Calderwells name Arkwright stiffened perceptibly
The fire left his eyes
For a moment he did not speak then gravely he said Calderwell
Yes perhaps he would and you ought to be a judge I should think
You see him quite frequently dont you
Why yes of course
He often comes out here you know
Yes I had heard that he didsince you came
His meaning was unmistakable
Alice looked up quickly
A prompt denial of his implication was on her lips when the thought came to her that perhaps just here lay a sure way to prove to this man before her that there was indeed no need for him to teach her to save her or yet to sympathize with her
She could not affirm of course but she need not denyyet
Nonsense
she laughed lightly pleased that she could feel what she hoped would pass for a telltale color burning her cheeks
Come let us try some duets she proposed leading the way to the piano
And Arkwright interpreting the apparently embarrassed change of subject exactly as she had hoped that he would interpret it followed her sick at heart
 O wert thou in the cauld blast  sang Arkwrights lips a few moments later
I cant tell her nowwhen I know she cares for Calderwell gloomily ran his thoughts the while
It would do no possible good and would only make her unhappy to grieve me
 O wert thou in the cauld blast  chimed in Alices alto low and sweet
I reckon now he wont be staying away from here any more just to save me
ran Alices thoughts palpitatingly triumphant
CHAPTER XXI BILLY TAKES HER TURN AT QUESTIONING Arkwright did not call to see Alice Greggory for some days
He did not want to see Alice now
He told himself wearily that she could not help him fight this tiger skin that lay across his path The very fact of her presence by his side would indeed incapacitate himself for fighting
So he deliberately stayed away from the Annex until the day before he sailed for Germany
Then he went out to say goodby
Chagrined as he was at what he termed his imbecile stupidity in not knowing his own heart all these past months and convinced as he also was that Alice and Calderwell cared for each other he could see no way for him but to play the part of a man of kindliness and honor leaving a clear field for his preferred rival and bringing no shadow of regret to mar the happiness of the girl he loved
As for being his old easy frank self on this last call however that was impossible so Alice found plenty of fuel for her still burning fires of suspicionfires which had indeed blazed up anew at this second long period of absence on the part of Arkwright
Naturally therefore the call was anything but a joy and comfort to either one
Arkwright was nervous gloomy and abnormally gay by turns
Alice was nervous and abnormally gay all the time
Then they said goodby and Arkwright went away
He sailed the next day and Alice settled down to the summer of study and hard work she had laid out for herself
On the tenth of September Billy came home
She was brown plumpcheeked and smiling
She declared that she had had a perfectly beautiful time and that there couldnt be anything in the world nicer than the trip she and Bertram had takenjust they two together
In answer to Aunt Hannahs solicitous inquiries she asserted that she was all well and rested now
But there was a vaguely troubled questioning in her eyes that Aunt Hannah did not quite like
Aunt Hannah however said nothing even to Billy herself about this
One of the first friends Billy saw after her return was Hugh Calderwell
As it happened Bertram was out when he came so Billy had the first half hour of the call to herself
She was not sorry for this as it gave her a chance to question Calderwell a little concerning Alice Greggorysomething she had long ago determined to do at the first opportunity
Now tell me everythingeverything about everybody she began diplomatically settling herself comfortably for a good visit
Thank you Im well and have had a passably agreeable summer barring the heat sundry persistent mosquitoes several grievous disappointments and a felon on my thumb he began with shameless imperturbability
I have been to Revere once to the circus once to Nantasket three times and to Keiths and the movies ten times perhapsto be accurate
I have also But perhaps there was some one else you desired to inquire for he broke off turning upon his hostess a bland but unsmiling countenance
Oh no how could there be
twinkled Billy
Really Hugh I always knew you had a pretty good opinion of yourself but I didnt credit you with thinking you were everybody
Go on
Im so interested
Hugh chuckled softly but there was a plaintive tone in his voice as he answered
Thanks no
Ive rather lost my interest now
Lack of appreciation always did discourage me
Well talk of something else please
You enjoyed your trip
Very much
It just couldnt have been nicer
You were lucky
The heat here has been something fierce
What made you stay
Reasons too numerous and one too heart breaking to mention
Besides you forget with dignity
There is my profession
I have joined the workers of the world now you know
Oh fudge Hugh
laughed Billy
You know very well youre as likely as not to start for the ends of the earth tomorrow morning
Hugh drew himself up
I dont seem to succeed in making people understand that Im serious he began aggrievedly
I With an expressive flourish of his hands he relaxed suddenly and fell back in his chair
A slow smile came to his lips
Well Billy Ill give up
Youve hit it he confessed
I have thought seriously of starting to morrow morning for halfway to the ends of the earthPanama
Hugh
Well I have
Even this call was to be a goodbyif I went
Oh Hugh
But I really thoughtin spite of my teasingthat you had settled down this time
Yes so did I sighed the man a little soberly
But I guess its no use Billy
Oh Im coming back of course and link arms again with their worthy Highnesses John Doe and Richard Roe but just now Ive got a restless fit on me
I want to see the wheels go round
Of course if I had my bread and butter and cigars to earn twould be different
But I havent and I know I havent and I suspect thats where the trouble lies
If it wasnt for those natal silver spoons of mine that Bertram is always talking about things might be different
But the spoons are there and always have been and I know theyre all ready to dish out mountains to climb and lakes to paddle in any time Ive a mind to say the word
SoI just say the word
Thats all
And youve said it now
Yes I think so for a while
Andthose reasons that have kept you here all summer ventured Billy they arent in ercommission any longer
No
Billy hesitated regarding her companion meditatively
Then with the feeling that she had followed a blind alley to its termination she retreated and made a fresh start
Well you havent yet told me everything about everybody you know she hinted smilingly
You might begin thatI mean the less important everybodies of course now that Ive heard about you
Meaning Oh Aunt Hannah and the Greggorys and Cyril and Marie and the twins and Mr Arkwright and all the rest
But youve had letters surely
Yes Ive had letters from some of them and Ive seen most of them since I came back
Its just that I wanted to know your viewpoint of whats happened through the summer
Very well
Aunt Hannah is as dear as ever wears just as many shawls and still keeps her clock striking twelve when its halfpast eleven
Mrs Greggory is just as sweet as everand a little more frail I fearbless her heart
Mr Arkwright is still abroad as I presume you know
I hear he is doing great stunts over there and will sing in Berlin and Paris this winter
Im thinking of going across from Panama later
If I do I shall look him up
Mr and Mrs Cyril are as well as could be expected when you realize that they havent yet settled on a pair of names for the twins
I know itand the poor little things three months old too
I think its a shame
Youve heard the reason I suppose
Cyril declares that naming babies is one of the most serious and delicate operations in the world and that for his part he thinks people ought to select their own names when theyve arrived at years of discretion
He wants to wait till the twins are eighteen and then make each of them a birthday present of the name of their own choosing
Well if that isnt the limit
laughed Calderwell
Id heard some such thing before but I hadnt supposed it was really so
Well it is
He says he knows more tomboys and enormous fat women named Grace and Lily and sweet little mouselike ladies staggering along under a sonorous Jerusha Theodosia or Zenobia Jane and that if he should name the boys Franz and Felix after Schubert and Mendelssohn as Marie wants to theyd as likely as not turn out to be men who hated the sound of music and doted on stocks and dry goods
Humph
grunted Calderwell
I saw Cyril last week and he said he hadnt named the twins yet but he didnt tell me why
I offered him two perfectly good names myself but he didnt seem interested
What were they
Eldad and Bildad
Hugh
protested Billy
Well why not
bridled the man
Im sure those are new and unique and really musical tooway ahead of your Franz and Felix
But those arent really names
Indeed they are
Where did you get them
Off our family tree though theyre Bible names Belle says
Perhaps you didnt know but Sister Belle has been making the dirt fly quite lively of late around that family tree of ours and she wrote me some of her discoveries
It seems two of the roots or branchessay are ancestors roots or brancheswere called Eldad and Bildad
Now I thought those names were good enough to pass along but as I said before Cyril wasnt interested
I should say not laughed Billy
But honestly Hugh its really serious
Marie wants them named something but she doesnt say much to Cyril
Marie wouldnt really breathe you know if she thought Cyril disapproved of breathing
And in this case Cyril does not hesitate to declare that the boys shall name themselves
What a situation
laughed Calderwell
Isnt it
But do you know I can sympathize with it in a way for Ive always mourned so over my name
Billy was always such a trial to me
Poor Uncle William wasnt the only one that prepared guns and fishing rods to entertain the expected boy
I dont know though Im afraid if Id been allowed to select my name I should have been a Helen Clarabella all my days for that was the name I gave all my dolls with first second third and so on added to them for distinction
Evidently I thought that Helen Clarabella was the most feminine appellation possible and the most foreign to the despised Billy
So you see I can sympathize with Cyril to a certain extent
But they must call the little chaps something now argued Hugh
Billy gave a sudden merry laugh
They do she gurgled and thats the funniest part of it
Oh Cyril doesnt
He always calls them impersonally they or it
He doesnt see much of them anyway now I understand
Marie was horrified when she realized how the nurses had been using his den as a nursery annex and she changed all that instanter when she took charge of things again
The twins stay in the nursery now Im told
But about the names the nurses it seems have got into the way of calling them Dot and Dimple
One has a dimple in his cheek and the other is a little smaller of the two
Marie is no end distressed particularly as she finds that she herself calls them that and she says the idea of boys being Dot and Dimple
I should say so laughed Calderwell
Not I regard that as worse than my Eldad and Bildad
 I know it and Alice says By the way you havent mentioned Alice but I suppose you see her occasionally
Billy paused in evident expectation of a reply
Billy was in fact quite pluming herself on the adroit casualness with which she had introduced the subject nearest her heart
Calderwell raised his eyebrows
Oh yes I see her
But you hadnt mentioned her
There was the briefest of pauses then with a halfquizzical dejection there came the remark You seem to forget
I told you that I stayed here this summer for reasons too numerous and one too heartbreaking to mention
She was the one
You mean Yes
The usual thing
She turned me down
Oh I havent asked her yet as many times as I did you but Hugh Hugh tossed her a grim smile and went on imperturbably
Im older now of course and know more perhaps
Besides the finality of her remarks was not to be mistaken
Billy in spite of her sympathy for Calderwell was conscious of a throb of relief that at least one stumblingblock was removed from Arkwrights possible pathway to Alices heart
Did she give any special reason
hazarded Billy a shade too anxiously
Oh yes
She said she wasnt going to marry anybodyonly her music
Nonsense
ejaculated Billy falling back in her chair a little
Yes I said that too gloomed the man but it didnt do any good
You see I had known another girl whod said the same thing once
He did not look up but a vivid red flamed suddenly into Billys cheeks
And she when the right one cameforgot all about the music and married the man
So I naturally suspected that Alice would do the same thing
In fact I said so to her
I was bold enough to even call the man by nameI hadnt been jealous of Arkwright for nothing you seebut she denied it and flew into such an indignant allegation that there wasnt a word of truth in it that I had to sue for pardon before I got anything like peace
Ohh
said Billy in a disappointed voice falling quite back in her chair this time
And so thats why Im wanting especially just now to see the wheels go round smiled Calderwell a little wistfully
Oh I shall get over it I suppose
It isnt the first time Ill ownbut some day I take it there will be a last time
Enough of this however
You havent told me a thing about yourself
How about it
When I come back are you going to give me a dinner cooked by your own fair hands
Going to still play Bridget
Billy laughed and shook her head
No far from it
Eliza has come back and her cousin from Vermont is coming as second girl to help her
But I could cook a dinner for you if I had to now sir and it wouldnt be potatomush and cold lamb she bragged shamelessly as there sounded Bertrams peculiar ring and the click of his key in the lock
It was the next afternoon that Billy called on Marie
From Maries Billy went to the Annex which was very near Cyrils new house and there in Aunt Hannahs room she had what she told Bertram afterwards was a perfectly lovely visit
Aunt Hannah too enjoyed the visit very much though yet there was one thing that disturbed herthe vaguely troubled look in Billys eyes which today was more apparent than ever
Not until just before Billy went home did something occur to give Aunt Hannah a possible clue as to what was the meaning of it
That something was a question from Billy
Aunt Hannah why dont I feel like Marie did
why dont I feel like everybody does in books and stories
Marie went around with such a detached heavenly absorbed look in her eyes before the twins came to her home
But I dont
I dont find anything like that in my face when I look in the glass
And I dont feel detached and absorbed and heavenly
Im happy of course but I cant help thinking of the dear dear times Bertram and I have together just we two and I cant seem to imagine it at all with a third person around
Billy
Third person indeed
There
I knew twould shock you mourned Billy
It shocks me
I want to feel detached and heavenly and absorbed
But Billy dear think of itcalling your own baby a third person
Billy sighed despairingly
Yes I know
And I suppose I might as well own up to the rest of it too
IIm actually afraid of babies Aunt Hannah
Well I am she reiterated in answer to Aunt Hannahs gasp of disapproval
Im not used to them at all
I never had any little brothers and sisters and I dont know how to treat babies
IIm always afraid theyll break or something
Im just as afraid of the twins as I can be
How Marie can handle them and toss them about as she does I dont see
Toss them about indeed
Well it looks that way to me sighed Billy
Anyhow I know I can never get to handle them like thatand thats no way to feel
And Im ashamed of myself because I cant be detached and heavenly and absorbed she added rising to go
Everybody always is it seems but just me
Fiddlededee my dear
scoffed Aunt Hannah patting Billys downcast face
Wait till a year from now and well see about that third person bugaboo youre worrying about
Im not worrying now so youd better not
CHAPTER XXII A DOT AND A DIMPLE On the day Cyril Henshaws twins were six months old a momentous occurrence marked the date with a flaming red letter of remembrance and it all began with a babys smile
Cyril in quest of his wife at about ten oclock that morning and not finding her pursued his search even to the nurserya room he very seldom entered
Cyril did not like to go into the nursery
He felt ill at ease and as if he were away from homeand Cyril was known to abhor being away from home since he was married
Now that Marie had taken over the reins of government again he had been obliged to see very little of those strange women and babies
Not but that he liked the babies of course
They were his sons and he was proud of them
They should have every advantage that college special training and travel could give them
He quite anticipated what they would be to himwhen they really knew anything
But of course now when they could do nothing but cry and wave their absurd little fists and wobble their heads in so fearsome a manner as if they simply did not know the meaning of the word backbone and for that matter of course they didnt why he could not be expected to be anything but relieved when he had his den to himself again with a reasonable chance of finding his manuscript as he had left it and not cut up into a ridiculous string of paper dolls holding hands as he had once found it after a visit from a woman with a small girl
Since Marie had been at the helm however he had not been troubled in such a way
He had indeed known almost his old customary peace and freedom from interruption with only an occasional flitting across his path of the strange women and babiesthough he had realized of course that they were in the house especially in the nursery
For that reason therefore he always avoided the nursery when possible
But today he wanted his wife and his wife was not to be found anywhere else in the house
So reluctantly he turned his steps toward the nursery and with a frown knocked and pushed open the door
Is Mrs Henshaw here
he demanded not over gently
Absolute silence greeted his question
The man saw then that there was no one in the room save a baby sitting on a mat in the middle of the floor barricaded on all sides with pillows
With a deeper frown the man turned to go when a gleeful Ahgoo
halted his steps midway
He wheeled sharply
Ereh
he queried uncertainly eyeing his small son on the floor
Ahgoo
observed the infant who had been very lonesome with greater emphasis and this time he sent into his fathers eyes the most bewitching of smiles
Well by George
murmured the man weakly a dawning amazement driving the frown from his face
Spggghoowah
gurgled the boy holding out two tiny fists
A slow smile came to the mans face
Well Illbedarned he muttered half shamefacedly wholly delightedly
If the rascal doesnt act as if heknew me
Ahgoospggghh
grinned the infant toothlessly but entrancingly
With almost a stealthy touch Cyril closed the door back of him and advanced a little dubiously toward his son
His countenance carried a mixture of guilt curiosity and dogged determination so ludicrous that it was a pity none but baby eyes could see it
As if to meet more nearly on a level this baffling new acquaintance Cyril got to his kneessomewhat stiffly it must be confessed and faced his son
Gooeeeoooyah
crowed the baby now thrashing legs and arms about in a transport of joy at the acquisition of this new playmate
Well well young man youyou dont say so
stammered the growinglyproud father thrusting a plainly timid and unaccustomed finger toward his offspring
So you do know me eh
Well who am I
Dada
gurgled the boy triumphantly clutching the outstretched finger and holding on with a tenacity that brought a gleeful chuckle to the lips of the man
Jove
but arent you the strong little beggar though
Neednt tell me you dont know a good thing when you see it
So Im dada am I
he went on unhesitatingly accepting as the pure gold of knowledge the shameless imitation vocabulary his son was foisting upon him
Well I expect I am and Oh Cyril
The door had opened and Marie was in the room
If she gave a start of surprise at her husbands unaccustomed attitude she quickly controlled herself
Julia said you wanted me
I must have been going down the back stairs when you came up the front and Please Mrs Henshaw is it Dot you have in here or Dimple
asked a new voice as the second nurse entered by another door
Before Mrs Henshaw could answer Cyril who had got to his feet turned sharply
Is itwho
he demanded
Oh
Oh Mr Henshaw stammered the girl
I beg your pardon
I didnt know you were here
It was only that I wanted to know which baby it was
We thought we had Dot with us until Dot
Dimple
exploded the man
Do you mean to say you have given my sons the ridiculous names of Dot and Dimple
Why noyeswell that iswe had to call them something faltered the nurse as with a despairing glance at her mistress she plunged through the doorway
Cyril turned to his wife
Marie what is the meaning of this
he demanded
Why Cyril dear dontdont get so wrought up she begged
Its only as Mary said we had to call them something and Wrought up indeed
interrupted Cyril savagely
Who wouldnt be
Dot and Dimple
Great Scott
One would think those boys were a couple of kittens or puppies that they didnt know anythingdidnt have any brains
But they haveif the other is anything like this one at least he declared pointing to his son on the floor who at this opportune moment joined in the conversation to the extent of an appropriate Ahgoodada
There hear that will you
triumphed the father
What did I tell you
Thats the way hes been going on ever since I came into the room The little rascal knows meso soon
Marie clapped her fingers to her lips and turned her back suddenly with a spasmodic little cough but her husband if he noticed the interruption paid no heed
Dot and Dimple indeed
he went on wrathfully
That settles it
Well name those boys today Marie today Not once again will I let the sun go down on a Dot and a Dimple under my roof
Marie turned with a quick little cry of happiness
Oh Cyril Im so glad
Ive so wanted to have them named you know
And shall we call them Franz and Felix as wed talked
Franz Felix John James Paul Charles anything so its sane and sensible
Id even adopt Calderwells absurd Bildad ander Tomdad or whatever it was rather than have those poor little chaps insulted a day longer with a Dot and a Dimple
Great Scott
And entirely forgetting what he had come to the nursery for Cyril strode from the room
Ahgoospggggh
commented baby from the middle of the floor
It was on a very windy March day that Bertram Henshaws son Bertram Jr arrived at the Strata
Billy went so far into the Valley of the Shadow of Death for her baby that it was some days before she realized in all its importance the presence of the new member of her family
Even when the days had become weeks and Bertram Jr was a month and a half old the extreme lassitude and weariness of his young mother was a source of evergrowing anxiety to her family and friends
Billy was so unlike herself they all said
If something could only rouse her suggested the Henshaws old family physician one day
A certain sort of mental shockif not too severewould do the deed I think and with no injuryonly benefit
Her physical condition is in just the state that needs a stimulus to stir it into new life and vigor
As it happened this was said on a certain Monday
Two days later Bertrams sister Kate on her way with her husband to Mr Hartwells old home in Vermont stopped over in Boston for a two days visit
She made her headquarters at Cyrils home but very naturally she went without much delay to pay her respects to Bertram Jr Mr Hartwells brother isnt well she explained to Billy after the greetings were over
You know hes the only one left there since Mother and Father Hartwell came West
We shall go right on up to Vermont in a couple of days but we just had to stay over long enough to see the baby and we hadnt ever seen the twins either you know
By the way how perfectly ridiculous Cyril is over those boys
Is he
smiled Billy faintly
Yes
One would think there were never any babies born before to hear him talk
He thinks theyre the most wonderful things in the world and they are cunning little fellows Ill admit
But Cyril thinks they know so much went on Kate laughingly
Hes always bragging of something one or the other of them has done
Think of itCyril Marie says it all started from the time last January when he discovered the nurses had been calling them Dot and Dimple
Yes I know smiled Billy again faintly lifting a thin white very unBillylike hand to her head
Kate frowned and regarded her sisterinlaw thoughtfully
Mercy
how you look Billy
she exclaimed with cheerful tactlessness
They said you did but I declare you look worse than I thought
Billys pale face reddened perceptibly
Nonsense
Its just that Im soso tired she insisted
I shall be all right soon
How did you leave the children
Well and happyspecially little Kate because mother was going away
Kate is mistress you know when Im gone and she takes herself very seriously
Mistress
A little thing like her
Why she cant be more than ten or eleven murmured Billy
She isnt
She was ten last month
But youd think she was forty the airs she gives herself sometimes
Oh of course theres Nora and the cook and Miss Winton the governess there to really manage things and Mother Hartwell is just around the corner but little Kate thinks shes managing so shes happy
Billy suppressed a smile
Billy was thinking that little Kate came naturally by at least one of her traits
Really that child is impossible sometimes resumed Mrs Hartwell with a sigh
You know the absurd things she was always saying two or three years ago when we came on to Cyrils wedding
Yes I remember
Well I thought she would get over it
But she doesnt
Shes worse if anything and sometimes her insight or intuition or whatever you may call it is positively uncanny
I never know what shes going to remark next when I take her anywhere but its safe to say whatever it is itll be unexpected and usually embarrassing to somebody
Andis that the baby
broke off Mrs Hartwell as a cooing laugh and a womans voice came from the next room
Yes
The nurse has just brought him in I think said Billy
Then Ill go right now and see him rejoined Kate rising to her feet and hurrying into the next room
Left alone Billy lay back wearily in her recliningchair
She wondered why Kate always tired her so
She wished she had had on her blue kimono then perhaps Kate would not have thought she looked so badly
Blue was always more becoming to her than Billy turned her head suddenly
From the next room had come Kates clearcut decisive voice
Oh no I dont think he looks a bit like his father
That little snubby nose was never the Henshaw nose
Billy drew in her breath sharply and pulled herself half erect in her chair
From the next room came Kates voice again after a low murmur from the nurse
Oh but he isnt I tell you
He isnt one bit of a Henshaw baby
The Henshaw babies are always pretty ones
They have more hair and they lookwell different
Billy gave a low cry and struggled to her feet
Oh no spoke up Kate in answer to another indistinct something from the nurse
I dont think hes near as pretty as the twins
Of course the twins are a good deal older but they have such a bright lookand they did have from the very first
I saw it in their tiniest baby pictures
But this baby This baby is mine please cut in a tremulous but resolute voice and Mrs Hartwell turned to confront Bertram Jrs mother manifestly weak and trembling but no less manifestly blazingeyed and determined
Why Billy
expostulated Mrs Hartwell as Billy stumbled forward and snatched the child into her arms
Perhaps he doesnt look like the Henshaw babies
Perhaps he isnt as pretty as the twins
Perhaps he hasnt much hair and does have a snub nose
Hes my baby just the same and I shall not stay calmly by and see him abused
Besides I think hes prettier than the twins ever thought of being and hes got all the hair I want him to have and his nose is just exactly what a babys nose ought to be
And with a superb gesture Billy turned and bore the baby away
CHAPTER XXIII BILLY AND THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY When the doctor heard from the nurse of Mrs Hartwells visit and what had come of it he only gave a discreet smile as befitted himself and the occasion but to his wife privately that night the doctor said when he had finished telling the story And I couldnt have prescribed a better pill if Id tried
PillMrs Hartwell
Oh Harold reproved the doctors wife mildly
But the doctor only chuckled the more and said You wait and see
If Billys friends were worried before because of her lassitude and lack of ambition they were almost as worried now over her amazing alertness and insistent activity
Day by day almost hour by hour she seemed to gain in strength and every bit she acquired she promptly tested almost to the breaking point so plainly eager was she to be well and strong
And always from morning until night and again from night until morning the pivot of her existence around which swung all thoughts words actions and plans was the sturdy little plumpcheeked firmfleshed atom of humanity known as Bertram Jr
Even Aunt Hannah remonstrated with her at last
But Billy dear she exclaimed one would almost get the idea that you thought there wasnt a thing in the world but that baby
Billy laughed
Well do you know sometimes I most think there isnt she retorted unblushingly
Billy
protested Aunt Hannah then a little severely she demanded And who was it that just last September was calling this same onlyobjectintheworld a third person in your home
Third person indeed
Aunt Hannah did I
Did I really say such a dreadful thing as that
But I didnt know then of course
I couldnt know how perfectly wonderful a baby is especially such a baby as Bertram Jr is
Why Aunt Hannah that little thing knows a whole lot already
Hes known me for weeks I know he has
And ages and ages ago he began to give me little smiles when he saw me
They were smilesreal smiles
Oh yes I know nurse said they werent smiles at the first admitted Billy in answer to Aunt Hannahs doubting expression
I know nurse said it was only wind on his stomach
Think of it wind on his stomach
Just as if I didnt know the difference between my own babys smile and wind on his stomach
And you dont know how soon he began to follow my moving finger with his eyes
Yes I tried that one day I remember observed Aunt Hannah demurely
I moved my finger
He looked at the ceilingfixedly
Well probably he wanted to look at the ceiling then defended the young mother promptly
Im sure I wouldnt give a snap for a baby if he didnt sometimes have a mind of his own and exercise it
Oh Billy Billy laughed Aunt Hannah with a shake of her head as Billy turned away chin uptilted
By the time Bertram Jr was three months old Billy was unmistakably her old happy merry self strong and well
Affairs at the Strata once more were moving as by clockworkonly this time it was a babys hand that set the clock and that wound it too
Billy told her husband very earnestly that now they had entered upon a period of Enormous Responsibility
The Life Character and Destiny of a Human Soul was intrusted to their care and they must be Wise Faithful and Efficient
They must be at once Proud and Humble at this their Great Opportunity
They must Observe Learn and Practice
First and foremost in their eyes must always be this wonderful Important Trust
Bertram laughed at first very heartily at Billys instructions which he declared were so bristling with capitals that he could fairly see them drop from her lips
Then when he found how really very much in earnest she was and how hurt she was at his levity he managed to pull his face into something like sobriety while she talked to him though he did persist in dropping kisses on her cheeks her chin her fingertips her hair and the little pink lobes of her earsjust by way of punctuation to her sentences he said
And he told her that he wasnt really slighting her lips only that they moved so fast he could not catch them
Whereat Billy pouted and told him severely that he was a bad naughty boy and that he did not deserve to be the father of the dearest most wonderful baby in the world
No I know I dont beamed Bertram with cheerful unrepentance but I am just the same he finished triumphantly
And this time he contrived to find his wifes lips
Oh Bertram sighed Billy despairingly
Youre an old dear of course and one just cant be cross with you but you dont you just dont realize your Immense Responsibility
Oh yes I do maintained Bertram so seriously that even Billy herself almost believed him
In spite of his assertions however it must be confessed that Bertram was much more inclined to regard the new member of his family as just his son rather than as an Important Trust and there is little doubt that he liked to toss him in the air and hear his gleeful crows of delight without any bother of Observing him at all
As to the Life and Character and Destiny intrusted to his care it is to be feared that Bertram just plain gloried in his son poked him in the ribs and chuckled him under the chin whenever he pleased and gave never so much as a thought to Character and Destiny
It is to be feared too that he was Proud without being Humble and that the only Opportunity he really appreciated was the chance to show off his wife and baby to some less fortunate fellowman
But not so Billy
Billy joined a Mothers Club and entered a class in Child Training with an elaborate system of Charts Rules and Tests
She subscribed to each new Mothers Helper and the like that she came across devouring each and every one with an eagerness that was tempered only by a vague uneasiness at finding so many differences of opinion among Those Who Knew
Undeniably Billy if not Bertram was indeed realizing the Enormous Responsibility and was keeping ever before her the Important Trust
In June Bertram took a cottage at the South Shore and by the time the really hot weather arrived the family were well settled
It was only an hour away from Boston and easy of access but William said he guessed he would not go he would stay in Boston sleeping at the house and getting his meals at the club until the middle of July when he was going down in Maine for his usual fishing trip which he had planned to take a little earlier than usual this year
But youll be so lonesome Uncle William Billy demurred in this great house all alone
Oh no I shant rejoined Uncle William
I shall only be sleeping here you know he finished
with a slightly peculiar smile
It was well perhaps that Billy did not exactly realize the significance of that smile nor the unconscious emphasis on the word sleeping for it would have troubled her not a little
William to tell the truth was quite anticipating that sleeping
Williams nights had not been exactly restful since the baby came
His evenings too had not been the peaceful things they were wont to be
Some of Billys Rules and Tests were strenuously objected to on the part of her small son and the young man did not hesitate to show it
Billy said that it was good for the baby to cry that it developed his lungs but William was very sure that it was not good for him
Certainly when the baby did cry William never could help hovering near the center of disturbance and he always had to remind Billy that it might be a pin you know or some cruel thing that was hurting
As if he William a great strong man could sit calmly by and smoke a pipe or lie in his comfortable bed and sleep while that blessed little baby was crying his heart out like that
Of course if one did not know he was crying Hence Williams anticipation of those quiet restful nights when he could not know it
Very soon after Billys arrival at the cottage Aunt Hannah and Alice Greggory came down for a days visit
Aunt Hannah had been away from Boston for several weeks so it was some time since she had seen the baby
My but hasnt he grown
she exclaimed picking the baby up and stooping to give him a snuggling kiss
The next instant she almost dropped the little fellow so startling had been Billys cry
No no wait Aunt Hannah please Billy was entreating hurrying to the little corner cupboard
In a moment she was back with a small bottle and a bit of antiseptic cotton
We always sterilize our lips now before we kiss him its so much safer you know
Aunt Hannah sat down limply the baby still in her arms
Fiddlededee Billy
What an absurd idea
What have you got in that bottle
Why Aunt Hannah its just a little simple listerine bridled Billy and it isnt absurd at all
Its very sensible
My Hygienic Guide for Mothers says Well I suppose I may kiss his hand interposed Aunt Hannah just a little curtly without subjecting myself to a City Hospital treatment
Billy laughed shamefacedly but she still held her ground
No you cantnor even his foot
He might get them in his mouth
Aunt Hannah why does a baby think that everything from his own toes to his fathers watch fob and the plush balls on a callers wristbag is made to eat
As if I could sterilize everything and keep him from getting hold of germs somewhere
Youll have to have a germproof room for him laughed Alice Greggory playfully snapping her fingers at the baby in Aunt Hannahs lap
Billy turned eagerly
Oh did you read about that too
she cried
I thought it was so interesting and I wondered if I could do it
Alice stared frankly
You dont mean to say they actually have such things she challenged
Well I read about them in a magazine asserted Billy how you could have a germ proof room
They said it was very simple too
Just pasteurize the air you know by heating it to one hundred and ten and onehalf degrees Fahrenheit for seventeen and onehalf minutes
I remember just the figures
Simple indeed
It sounds so scoffed Aunt Hannah with uplifted eyebrows
Oh well I couldnt do it of course admitted Billy regretfully
Bertram neverd stand for that in the world
Hes always rushing in to show the baby off to every Tom Dick and Harry and his wife that comes and of course if you opened the nursery door that would let in those germ things and you couldnt very well pasteurize your callers by heating them to one hundred and ten and onehalf degrees for seventeen and onehalf minutes
I dont see how you could manage such a room anyway unless you had a system of of rooms like locks same as they do for water in canals
Oh my grief and consciencelocks indeed
almost groaned Aunt Hannah
Here Alice will you please take this childthat is if you have a germproof certificate about you to show to his mother
I want to take off my bonnet and gloves
Take him
Of course Ill take him laughed Alice and right under his mothers nose too she added with a playful grimace at Billy
And well make patacakes and send the little pigs to market and have such a beautiful time that well forget there ever was such a thing in the world as an old germ
Eh babykins
Babykins cooed his unqualified approval of this plan but his mother looked troubled
Thats all right Alice
You may play with him she frowned doubtfully but you mustnt do it long you knownot over five minutes
Five minutes
Well I like that when Ive come all the way from Boston purposely to see him pouted Alice
Whats the matter now
Time for his nap
Oh no not forthirteen minutes replied Billy consulting the watch at her belt
But we never play with Baby more than five minutes at a time
My Scientific Care of Infants says it isnt wise that with some babies its positively dangerous until after theyre six months old
It makes them nervous and forces their mind you know she explained anxiously
So of course wed want to be careful
Bertram Jr isnt quite four yet
Why yes of course murmured Alice politely stopping a patacake before it was half baked
The infant as if suspecting that he was being deprived of his lawful baby rights began to fret and whimper
Poor itty sing crooned Aunt Hannah who having divested herself of bonnet and gloves came hurriedly forward with outstretched hands
Do they just buse em
Come here to your old auntie sweetems and well go walkee
I saw a bowwowsuch a tunnin ickey wickey bow wow on the steps when I came in
Come we go see ickey wickey bowwow
Aunt Hannah please protested Billy both hands upraised in horror
Wont you say dog and leave out that dreadful ickey wickey
Of course he cant understand things now really but we never know when hell begin to and we arent ever going to let him hear babytalk at all if we can help it
And truly when you come to think of it it is absurd to expect a child to talk sensibly and rationally on the mental diet of moomoos and choochoos served out to them
Our Professor of Metaphysics and Ideology in our Child Study Course says that nothing is so receptive and plastic as the Mind of a Little Child and that it is perfectly appalling how we fill it with trivial absurdities that havent even the virtue of being accurate
So thats why were trying to be so careful with Baby
You didnt mind my speaking I know Aunt Hannah
Oh no of course not Billy retorted Aunt Hannah a little tartly and with a touch of sarcasm most unlike her gentle self
Im sure I shouldnt wish to fill this infants plastic mind with anything so appalling as trivial inaccuracies
May I be pardoned for suggesting however she went on as the babys whimper threatened to become a lusty wail that this young gentleman cries as if he were sleepy and hungry
Yes he is admitted Billy
Well doesnt your system of scientific training allow him to be given such trivial absurdities as food and naps
inquired the lady mildly
Of course it does Aunt Hannah retorted Billy laughing in spite of herself
And its almost time now
There are only a few more minutes to wait
Few more minutes to wait indeed
scorned Aunt Hannah
I suppose the poor little fellow might cry and cry and you wouldnt set that clock ahead by a teeny weeny minute
Certainly not said the young mother decisively
My Daily Guide for Mothers says that a time for everything and everything in its time is the very A B C and whole alphabet of Right Training
He does everything by the clock and to the minute declared Billy proudly
Aunt Hannah sniffed obviously skeptical and rebellious
Alice Greggory laughed
Aunt Hannah looks as if shed like to bring down her clock that strikes half an hour ahead she said mischievously but Aunt Hannah did not deign to answer this
How long do you rock him
she demanded of Billy
I suppose I may do that maynt I
Mercy I dont rock him at all Aunt Hannah exclaimed Billy
Nor sing to him
Certainly not
But you didbefore I went away
I remember that you did
Yes I know I did admitted Billy and I had an awful time too
Some evenings every single one of us even to Uncle William had to try before we could get him off to sleep
But that was before I got my Efficiency of Mother and Child or my Scientific Training and oh lots of others
You see I didnt know a thing then and I loved to rock him so I did itthough the nurse said it wasnt good for him but I didnt believe her
Ive had an awful time changing but Ive done it
I just put him in his little crib or his carriage and after a while he goes to sleep
Sometimes now he doesnt cry hardly any
Im afraid today though he will she worried
Yes Im afraid he will almost screamed Aunt Hannah in order to make herself heard above Bertram Jr who by this time was voicing his opinion of matters and things in no uncertain manner
It was not after all so very long before peace and order reigned and in due course Bertram Jr in his carriage lay fast asleep
Then while Aunt Hannah went to Billys room for a short rest Billy and Alice went out on to the wide veranda which faced the wonderful expanse of sky and sea
Now tell me of yourself commanded Billy almost at once
Its been ages since Ive heard or seen a thing of you
Theres nothing to tell
Nonsense
But there must be insisted Billy
You know its months since Ive seen anything of you hardly
I know
We feel quite neglected at the Annex said Alice
But I dont go anywhere defended Billy
I cant
There isnt time
Even to bring us the extra happiness
smiled Alice
A quick change came to Billys face
Her eyes glowed deeply
No though Ive had so much that ought to have gonesuch loads and loads of extra happiness which I couldnt possibly use myself
Sometimes Im so happy Alice thatthat Im just frightened
It doesnt seem as if anybody ought to be so happy
Oh Billy dear demurred Alice her eyes filling suddenly with tears
Well Ive got the Annex
Im glad Ive got that for the overflow anyway resumed Billy trying to steady her voice
Ive sent a whole lot of happiness up there mentally if I havent actually carried it so Im sure you must have got it
Now tell me of yourself
Theres nothing to tell insisted Alice as before
Youre working as hard as ever
Yesharder
New pupils
Yes and some concert engagementsgood ones for next season
Accompaniments you know
Billy nodded
Yes Ive heard of you already twice lately in that line and very flatteringly too
Have you
Well thats good
Hmm There was a moments silence then abruptly Billy changed the subject
I had a letter from Belle Calderwell yesterday
She paused expectantly but there was no comment
You dont seem interested she frowned after a minute
Alice laughed
Pardon me butI dont know the Lady you see
Was it a good letter
You know her brother
Very true
Alices cheeks showed a deeper color
Did she say anything of him
Yes
She said he was coming back to Boston next winter
Indeed
Yes
She says that this time he declares he really is going to settle down to work murmured Billy demurely with a sidelong glance at her companion
She says hes engaged to be married one of her friends over there
There was no reply
Alice appeared to be absorbed in watching a tiny white sail far out at sea
Again Billy was silent
Then with studied carelessness she said Yes and you know Mr Arkwright too
She told of him
Yes
Well what of him
Alices voice was studiedly indifferent
Oh there was quite a lot of him
Belle had just been to hear him sing and then her brother had introduced him to her
She thinks hes perfectly wonderful in every way I should judge
In fact she simply raved over him
It seems that while weve been hearing nothing from him all winter hes been winning no end of laurels for himself in Paris and Berlin
Hes been studying too of course as well as singing and now hes got a chance to sing somewherecreate a role or somethingBelle said she wasnt quite clear on the matter herself but it was a perfectly splendid chance and one that was a fine feather in his cap
Then he wont be coming homethat is to Bostonat all this winter probably said Alice with a cheerfulness that sounded just a little forced
Not until February
But he is coming then
Hes been engaged for six performances with the Boston Opera Companyas a star tenor mind you
Isnt that splendid
Indeed it is murmured Alice
Belle writes that Hugh says hes improved wonderfully and that even he can see that his singing is marvelous
He says Paris is wild over him butfor my part I wish hed come home and stay here where he belongs finished Billy a bit petulantly
Why why Billy
murmured her friend a curiously startled look coming into her eyes
Well I do maintained Billy then recklessly she added I had such beautiful plans for him once Alice
Oh if you only could have cared for him youd have made such a splendid couple
A vivid scarlet flew to Alices face
Nonsense
she cried getting quickly to her feet and bending over one of the flower boxes along the veranda railing
Mr Arkwright never thought of marrying meand Im not going to marry anybody but my music
Billy sighed despairingly
I know thats what you say now but if She stopped abruptly
Around the turn of the veranda had appeared Aunt Hannah wheeling Bertram Jr still asleep in his carriage
I came out the other door she explained softly
And it was so lovely I just had to go in and get the baby
I thought it would be so nice for him to finish his nap out here
Billy arose with a troubled frown
But Aunt Hannah he mustnthe cant stay out here
Im sorry but well have to take him back
Aunt Hannahs eyes grew mutinous
But I thought the outdoor air was just the thing for him
Im sure your scientific hygienic nonsense says that They dothey didthat is some of them do acknowledged Billy worriedly but they differ so
And the one Im going by now says that Baby should always sleep in an even temperatureseventy degrees if possible and thats exactly what the room in there was when I left him
Its not the same out here Im sure
In fact I looked at the thermometer to see just before I came out myself
So Aunt Hannah Im afraid Ill have to take him back
But you used to have him sleep out of doors all the time on that little balcony out of your room argued Aunt Hannah still plainly unconvinced
Yes I know I did
I was following the other mans rules then
As I said if only they wouldnt differ so
Of course I want the best but its so hard to always know the best and At this very inopportune moment Master Bertram took occasion to wake up which brought even a deeper wrinkle of worry to his fond mothers forehead for she said that according to the clock he should have been sleeping exactly ten and onehalf more minutes and that of course he couldnt commence the next thing until those ten and onehalf minutes were up or else his entire schedule for the day would be shattered
So what she should do with him for those shouldhave beensleeping ten minutes and a half she did not know
All of which drew from Aunt Hannah the astounding exclamation of Oh my grief and conscience Billy if you arent thethe limit
Which indeed she must have been to have brought circumspect Aunt Hannah to the point of actually using slang
CHAPTER XXIV A NIGHT OFF The Henshaw family did not return to the Strata until late in September
Billy said that the sea air seemed to agree so well with the baby it would be a pity to change until the weather became really too cool at the shore to be comfortable
William came back from his fishing trip in August and resumed his old habit of sleeping at the house and taking his meals at the club
To be sure for a week he went back and forth between the city and the beach house but it happened to be a time when Bertram Jr was cutting a tooth and this so wore upon Williams sympathy William still could not help insisting it might be a pinthat he concluded peace lay only in flight
So he went back to the Strata
Bertram had stayed at the cottage all summer painting industriously
Heretofore he had taken more of a vacation through the summer months but this year there seemed to be nothing for him to do but to paint
He did not like to go away on a trip and leave Billy and she declared she could not take the baby nor leave him and that she did not need any trip anyway
All right then well just stay at the beach and have a fine vacation together he had answered her
As Bertram saw it however he could detect very little vacation to it
Billy had no time for anything but the baby
When she was not actually engaged in caring for it she was studying how to care for it
Never had she been sweeter or dearer and never had Bertram loved her half so well
He was proud too of her devotion and of her triumphant success as a mother but he did wish that sometimes just once in a while she would remember she was a wife and pay a little attention to him her husband
Bertram was ashamed to own it even to himself but he was feeling just a little abused that summer and he knew that in his heart he was actually getting jealous of his own son in spite of his adoration of the little fellow
He told himself defensively that it was not to be expected that he should not want the love of his wife the attentions of his wife and the companionship of his wifea part of the time
It was nothing more than natural that occasionally he should like to see her show some interest in subjects not mentioned in Mothers Guides and Scientific Trainings of Infants and he did not believe he could be blamed for wanting his residence to be a home for himself as well as a nursery for his offspring
Even while he thus discontentedly argued with himself however Bertram called himself a selfish brute just to think such things when he had so dear and loving a wife as Billy and so fine and splendid a baby as Bertram Jr
He told himself too that very likely when they were back in their own house again and when motherhood was not so new to her Billy would not be so absorbed in the baby
She would return to her old interest in her husband her music her friends and her own personal appearance
Meanwhile there was always of course for him his painting
So he would paint accepting gladly what crumbs of attention fell from the babys table and trust to the future to make Billy none the less a mother perhaps but a little more the wife
Just how confidently he was counting on this coming change Bertram hardly realized himself but certainly the family was scarcely settled at the Strata before the husband gayly proposed one evening that he and Billy should go to the theater to see Romeo and Juliet
Billy was clearly both surprised and shocked
Why Bertram I cantyou know I cant
she exclaimed reprovingly
Bertrams heart sank but he kept a brave front
Why not
What a question
As if Id leave Baby
But Billy dear youd be gone less than three hours and you say Delias the most careful of nurses
Billys forehead puckered into an anxious frown
I cant help it
Something might happen to him Bertram
I couldnt be happy a minute
But dearest arent you ever going to leave him
demanded the young husband forlornly
Why yes of course when its reasonable and necessary
I went out to the Annex yesterday afternoon
I was gone almost two whole hours
Well did anything happen
Nno but then I telephoned you see several times so I knew everything was all right
Oh well if thats all you want I could telephone you know between every act suggested Bertram with a sarcasm that was quite lost on the earnest young mother
Yyes you could do that couldnt you
conceded Billy and of course I havent been anywhere much lately
Indeed I could agreed Bertram with a promptness that carefully hid his surprise at her literal acceptance of what he had proposed as a huge joke
Come is it a go
Shall I telephone to see if I can get seats
You think Babyll surely be all right
I certainly do
And youll telephone home between every act
I will
Bertrams voice sounded almost as if he were repeating the marriage service
And well come straight home afterwards as fast as John and Peggy can bring us
Certainly
Then I thinkIllgo breathed Billy tremulously plainly showing what a momentous concession she thought she was making
I do love Romeo and Juliet and I havent seen it for ages
Good
Then Ill find out about the tickets cried Bertram so elated at the prospect of having an oldtime evening out with his wife that even the halfhourly telephones did not seem too great a price to pay
When the time came they were a little late in starting
Baby was fretful and though Billy usually laid him in his crib and unhesitatingly left the room insisting that he should go to sleep by himself in accordance with the most approved rules in her Scientific Training yet tonight she could not bring herself to the point of leaving the house until he was quiet
Hurried as they were when they did start Billy was conscious of Bertrams frowning disapproval of her frock
You dont like it of course dear and I dont blame you she smiled remorsefully
Oh I like itthat is I did when it was new rejoined her husband with apologetic frankness
But dear didnt you have anything else
This looks almostwell mussy you know
Nowell yes maybe there were others admitted Billy but this was the quickest and easiest to get into and it all came just as I was getting Baby ready for bed you know
I am a fright though Ill acknowledge so far as clothes go
I havent had time to get a thing since Baby came
I must get something right away I suppose
Yes indeed declared Bertram with emphasis hurrying his wife into the waiting automobile
Billy had to apologize again at the theater for the curtain had already risen on the ancient quarrel between the houses of Capulet and Montague and Billy knew her husbands special abhorrence of tardy arrivals
Later though when well established in their seats Billys mind was plainly not with the players on the stage
Do you suppose Baby is all right
she whispered after a time
Shh
Of course he is dear
There was a brief silence during which Billy peered at her program in the semidarkness
Then she nudged her husbands arm ecstatically
Bertram I couldnt have chosen a better play if Id tried
There are five acts
Id forgotten there were so many
That means you can telephone four times
Yes dear
Bertrams voice was sternly cheerful
You must be sure they tell you exactly how Baby is
All right dear
Shh
Heres Romeo
Billy subsided
She even clapped a little in spasmodic enthusiasm
Presently she peered at her program again
There wouldnt be time I suppose to telephone between the scenes she hazarded wistfully
There are sixteen of those
Well hardly
Billy you arent paying one bit of attention to the play
Why of course I am whispered Billy indignantly
I think its perfectly lovely and Im perfectly contented toosince I found out about those five acts and as long as I cant have the sixteen scenes she added settling back in her seat
As if to prove that she was interested in the play her next whisper some time later had to do with one of the characters on the stage
Whos thatthe nurse
Mercy
We wouldnt want her for Baby would we
In spite of himself Bertram chuckled this time
Billy too laughed at herself
Then resolutely she settled into her seat again
The curtain was not fairly down on the first act before Billy had laid an urgent hand on her husbands arm
Now remember ask if hes waked up or anything she directed
And be sure to say Ill come right home if they need me
Now hurry
Yes dear
Bertram rose with alacrity
Ill be back right away
Oh but I dont want you to hurry too much she called after him softly
I want you to take plenty of time to ask questions
All right nodded Bertram with a quizzical smile as he turned away
Obediently Bertram asked all the question she could think of then came back to his wife
There was nothing in his report that even Billy could disapprove of or worry about and with almost a contented look on her face she turned toward the stage as the curtain went up on the second act
I love this balcony scene she sighed happily
Romeo however had not half finished his impassioned lovemaking when Billy clutched her husbands arm almost fiercely
Bertram she fairly hissed in a tragic whisper Ive just happened to think
Wont it be awful when Baby falls in love
I know I shall just hate that girl for taking him away from me
Shh
Billy expostulated her husband choking with halfstifled laughter
That woman in front heard you I know she did
Well I shall sighed Billy mournfully turning back to the stage
 Good night good night
parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow sighed Juliet passionately to her Romeo
Mercy
I hope not whispered Billy flippantly in Bertrams ear
Im sure I dont want to stay here till tomorrow
I want to go home and see Baby
Billy pleaded Bertram so despairingly that Billy really consciencesmitten sat back in her seat and remained for the rest of the act very quiet indeed
Deceived by her apparent tranquillity Bertram turned as the curtain went down
Now Billy surely you dont think itll be necessary to telephone so soon as this again he ventured
Billys countenance fell
But Bertram you said you would
Of course if you arent willing tobut Ive been counting on hearing all through this horrid long act and Goodness me Billy Ill telephone every minute for you of course if you want me to cried Bertram springing to his feet and trying not to show his impatience
He was back more promptly this time
Everything 0
K he smiled reassuringly into Billys anxious eyes
Delia said shed just been up and the little chap was sound asleep
To the mans unbounded surprise his wife grew actually white
Up
Up
she exclaimed
Do you mean that Delia went downstairs to stay and left my baby up there alone
But Billy she said he was all right murmured Bertram softly casting uneasy sidelong glances at his too interested neighbors
 All right
Perhaps he was thenbut he may not be later
Delia should stay in the next room all the time where she could hear the least thing
Yes dear she will Im sure if you tell her to soothed Bertram quickly
Itll be all right next time
Billy shook her head
She was obviously near to crying
But Bertram I cant stand it to sit here enjoying myself all safe and comfortable and know that Baby is alone up there in that great big room
Please please wont you go and telephone Delia to go up now and stay there
Bertram weary sorely tried and increasingly aware of those annoyingly interested neighbors was on the point of saying a very decided no but a glance into Billys pleading eyes settled it
Without a word he went back to the telephone
The curtain was up when he slipped into his seat very red of face
In answer to Billys hurried whisper he shook his head but in the short pause between the first and second scenes he said in a low voice Im sorry Billy but I couldnt get the house at all
Couldnt get them
But youd just been talking with them
Thats exactly it probably
I had just telephoned so they werent watching for the bell
Anyhow I couldnt get them
Then you didnt get Delia at all
Of course not
And Baby is stillall alone
But hes all right dear
Delias keeping watch of him
For a moment there was silence then with clear decisiveness carne Billys voice
Bertram I am going home
Billy
I am
Billy for heavens sake dont be a silly goose
The plays half over already
Well soon be going anyway
Billys lips came together in a thin little determined line
Bertram I am going home now please she said
You neednt come with me I can go alone
Bertram said two words under his breath which it was just as well perhaps that Billyand the neighborsdid not hear then he gathered up their wraps and with Billy stalked out of the theater
At home everything was found to be absolutely as it should be
Bertram Jr was peacefully sleeping and Delia who had come up from downstairs was sewing in the next room
There you see observed Bertram a little sourly
Billy drew a long contented sigh
Yes I see everything is all right
But thats exactly what I wanted to do Bertram you know to see for myself she finished happily
And Bertram looking at her rapt face as she hovered over the babys crib called himself a brute and a beast to mind anything that could make Billy look like that
CHAPTER XXV SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT Bertram did not ask Billy very soon again to go to the theater
For some days indeed he did not ask her to do anything
Then one evening he did beg for some music
Billy you havent played to me or sung to me since I could remember he complained
I want some music
Billy gave a merry laugh and wriggled her fingers experimentally
Mercy Bertram
I dont believe I could play a note
You know Im all out of practice
But why dont you practice
Why Bertram I cant
In the first place I dont seem to have any time except when Babys asleep and I cant play thenId wake him up
Bertram sighed irritably rose to his feet and began to walk up and down the room
He came to a pause at last his eyes bent a trifle disapprovingly on his wife
Billy dear dont you wear anything but those wrapper things nowadays
he asked plaintively
Again Billy laughed
But this time a troubled frown followed the laugh
I know Bertram I suppose they do look dowdy sometimes she confessed but you see I hate to wear a really good dressBaby rumples them up so and Im usually in a hurry to get to him mornings and these are so easy to slip into and so much more comfortable for me to handle him in
Yes of course of course I see mumbled Bertram listlessly taking up his walk again
Billy after a moments silence began to talk animatedly
Baby had done a wonderfully cunning thing that morning and Billy had not had a chance yet to tell Bertram
Baby was growing more and more cunning anyway these days and there were several things she believed she had not told him so she told them now
Bertram listened politely interestedly
He told himself that he was interested too
Of course he was interested in the doings of his own child
But he still walked up and down the room a little restlessly coming to a halt at last by the window across which the shade had not been drawn
Billy he cried suddenly with his old boyish eagerness theres a glorious moon
Come on
Lets take a little walka real fellowand hisbestgirl walk
Will you
Mercy
dear I couldnt cried Billy springing to her feet
Id love to though if I could she added hastily as she saw disappointment cloud her husbands face
But I told Delia she might go out
It isnt her regular evening of course but I told her I didnt mind staying with Baby a bit
So Ill have to go right up now
Shell be going soon
But dear you go and take your walk
Itll do you good
Then you can come back and tell me all about itonly you must come in quietly so not to wake the baby she finished giving her husband an affectionate kiss as she left the room
After a disconsolate five minutes of solitude Bertram got his hat and coat and went out for his walkbut he told himself he did not expect to enjoy it
Bertram Henshaw knew that the old rebellious jealousy of the summer had him fast in its grip
He was heartily ashamed of himself but he could not help it
He wanted Billy and he wanted her then
He wanted to talk to her
He wanted to tell her about a new portrait commission he had just obtained and he wanted to ask her what she thought of the idea of a brandnew Face of a Girl for the Bohemian Ten Exhibition next March
He wantedbut then what would be the use
She would listen of course but he would know by the very looks of her face that she would not be really thinking of what he was saying and he would be willing to wager his best canvas that in the very first pause she would tell about the babys newest tooth or latest toy
Not but that he liked to hear about the little fellow of course and not but that he was proud as Punch of him too but that he would like sometimes to hear Billy talk of something else
The sweetest melody in the world if dinned into ones ears day and night became something to be fled from
And Billy ought to talk of something else too
Bertram Jr wonderful as he was really was not the only thing in the world or even the only baby and other peopleoutsiders their friends had a right to expect that sometimes other matters might be consideredtheir own for instance
But Billy seemed to have forgotten this
No matter whether the subject of conversation had to do with the latest novel or a trip to Europe under Billys guidance it invariably led straight to Babys JackandJill book or to a perambulator journey in the Public Garden
If it had not been so serious it would have been really funny the way all roads led straight to one goal
He himself when alone with Billy had started the most unusual and foreign subjects sometimes just to see if there were not somewhere a little bypath that did not bring up in his own nursery
He never however found one
But it was not funny it was serious
Was this glorious gift on parenthood to which he had looked forward as the crowning joy of his existence to be nothing but a tragedy that would finally wreck his domestic happiness
It could not be
It must not be
He must he patient and wait
Billy loved him
He was sure she did
By and by this obsession of motherhood which had her so fast in its grasp would relax
She would remember that her husband had rights as well as her child
Once again she would give him the companionship love and sympathetic interest so dear to him
Meanwhile there was his work
He must bury himself in that
And fortunate indeed he was he told himself that he had something so absorbing
It was at this point in his meditations that Bertram rounded a corner and came face to face with a man who stopped him short with a jovial Isnt itby George it is Bertie Henshaw
Well what do you think of that for luckand me only two days home from Gay Paree
Oh Seaver
How are you
You are a stranger
Bertrams voice and handshake were a bit more cordial than they would have been had he not at the moment been feeling so abused and forlorn
In the old days he had liked this Bob Seaver well
Seaver was an artist like himself and was good company always
But Seaver and his crowd were a little too Bohemian for Williams taste and after Billy came she too had objected to what she called that horrid Seaver man
In his heart Bertram knew that there was good foundation for their objections so he had avoided Seaver for a time and for some years now the man had been abroad somewhat to Bertrams relief
Tonight however Seavers genial smile and hearty friendliness were like a sudden burst of sunshine on a rainy dayand Bertram detested rainy days
He was feeling now too as if he had just had a whole week of them
Yes I am something of a stranger here nodded Seaver
But I tell you what little old Boston looks mighty good to me all the same
Come on
Youre just the fellow we want
Im on my way now to the old stamping ground
Comeright about face old chap and come with me
Bertram shook his head
Sorrybut I guess I cant tonight he sighed
Both gesture and words were unhesitating but the voice carried the discontent of a small boy who while the sun is still shining has been told to come into the house
Oh rats
Yes you can too
Come on
Lots of the old crowd will be thereGriggs Beebe Jack Jenkins and Tully
We need you to complete the show
Jack Jenkins
Is he here
A new eagerness had come into Bertrams voice
Sure
He came on from New York last night
Great boy Jenkins
Just back from Paris fairly covered with medals you know
Yes so I hear
I havent seen him for four years
Better come tonight then
Noo began Bertram with obvious reluctance
Its already nine oclock and Nine oclock
cut in Seaver with a broad grin
Since when has your limit been nine oclock
Ive seen the time when you didnt mind nine oclock in the morning Bertie
Whats got Oh I remember
I met another friend of yours in Berlin chap named Arkwright and say hes some singer you bet
Youre going to hear of him one of these days
Well he told me all about how youd settled down now son and heir fireside bliss pretty wife and all the fixings
But I say Bertie doesnt she let you outany
Nonsense Seaver
flared Bertram in annoyed wrath
Well then why dont you come tonight
If you want to see Jenkins youll have to hes going back to New York tomorrow
For only a brief minute longer did Bertram hesitate then he turned squarely about with an air of finality
Is he
Well then perhaps I will he said
Id hate to miss Jenkins entirely
Good
exclaimed his companion as they fell into step
Have a cigar
Thanks
Dont mind if I do
If Bertrams chin was a little higher and his step a little more decided than usual it was all merely by way of accompaniment to his thoughts
Certainly it was right that he should go and it was sensible
Indeed it was really almost imperativedue to Billy as it wereafter that disagreeable taunt of Seavers
As if she did not want him to go when and where he pleased
As if she would consent for a moment to figure in the eyes of his friends as a tyrannical wife who objected to her husbands passing a social evening with his friends
To be sure in this particular case she might not favor Seavers presence but even she would not mind this once and anyhow it was Jenkins that was the attraction not Seaver
Besides he himself was no undeveloped boy now
He was a man presumedly able to take care of himself
Besides again had not Billy herself told him to go out and enjoy the evening without her as she had to stay with the baby
He would telephone her of course that he had met some old friends and that he might be late then she would not worry
And forthwith having settled the matter in his mind and to his complete satisfaction Bertram gave his undivided attention to Seaver who had already plunged into an account of a recent Art Exhibition he had attended in Paris
CHAPTER XXVI GHOSTS THAT WALKED FOR BERTRAM October proved to be unusually mild and about the middle of the month Bertram after much unselfish urging on the part of Billy went to a friends camp in the Adirondacks for a weeks stay
He came back with an angry lugubrious faceand a broken arm
Oh Bertram
And your right one too the same one you broke before
mourned Billy tearfully
Of course retorted Bertram trying in vain to give an air of jauntiness to his reply
Didnt want to be too changeable you know
But how did you do it dear
Fell into a silly little hole covered with underbrush
Butoh Billy whats the use
I did it and I cant undo itmores the pity
Of course you cant you poor boy sympathized Billy and you shant be tormented with questions
Well just be thankful twas no worse
You cant paint for a while of course but we wont mind that
Itll just give Baby and me a chance to have you all to ourselves for a time and well love that
Yes of course sighed Bertram so abstractedly that Billy bridled with pretty resentment
Well I like your enthusiasm sir she frowned
Im afraid you dont appreciate the blessings you do have young man
Did you realize what I said
I remarked that you could be with Baby and me she emphasized
Bertram laughed and gave his wife an affectionate kiss
Indeed I do appreciate my blessings dear when those blessings are such treasures as you and Baby but Only his doleful eyes fixed on his injured arm finished his sentence
I know dear of course and I understand murmured Billy all tenderness at once
They were not easy for Bertramthose following days
Once again he was obliged to accept the little intimate personal services that he so disliked
Once again he could do nothing but read or wander disconsolately into his studio and gaze at his halffinished Face of a Girl
Occasionally it is true driven nearly to desperation by the haunting vision in his minds eye he picked up a brush and attempted to make his left hand serve his will but a bare halfdozen irritating ineffectual strokes were usually enough to make him throw down his brush in disgust
He never could do anything with his left hand he told himself dejectedly
Many of his hours of course he spent with Billy and his son and they were happy hours too but they always came to be restless ones before the day was half over
Billy was always devotion itself to himwhen she was not attending to the baby he had no fault to find with Billy
And the baby was delightfulhe could find no fault with the baby
But the baby was fretfulhe was teething Billy saidand he needed a great deal of attention so naturally Bertram drifted out of the nursery after a time and went down into his studio where were his dear empty palette his orderly brushes and his tantalizing Face of a Girl
From the studio generally Bertram went out on to the street
Sometimes he dropped into a fellowartists studio
Sometimes he strolled into a club or cafe where he knew he would be likely to find some friend who would help him while away a tiresome hour
Bertrams friends quite vied with each other in rendering this sort of aid so much so indeed thatnaturally perhapsBertram came to call on their services more and more frequently
Particularly was this the case when after the splints were removed Bertram found as the days passed that his arm was not improving as it should improve
This not only disappointed and annoyed him but worried him
He remembered sundry disquieting warnings given by the physician at the time of the former breakwarnings concerning the probable seriousness of a repetition of the injury
To Billy of course Bertram said nothing of all this but just before Christmas he went to see a noted specialist
An hour later almost in front of the learned surgeons door Bertram met Bob Seaver
Great Scott Bertie whats up
ejaculated Seaver
You look as if youd seen a ghost
I have answered Bertram with grim bitterness
Ive seen the ghost ofof every Face of a Girl I ever painted
Gorry
So bad as that
No wonder you look as if youd been disporting in graveyards chuckled Seaver laughing at his own joke Whats the matterarm on a rampage to day
He paused for reply but as Bertram did not answer at once he resumed with gay insistence Come on
You need cheering up
Suppose we go down to Trentinis and see whos there
All right agreed Bertram dully
Suit yourself
Bertram was not thinking of Seaver Trentinis or whom he might find there
Bertram was thinking of certain words he had heard less than half an hour ago
He was wondering too if ever again he could think of anything but those words
The truth
the great surgeon had said
Well the truth isIm sorry to tell you the truth Mr Henshaw but if you will have it youve painted the last picture youll ever paint with your right hand I fear
Its a bad case
This break coming as it did on top of the serious injury of two or three years ago was bad enough but to make matters worse the bone was imperfectly set and wrongly treated which could not be helped of course as you were miles away from skilled surgeons at the time of the injury
Well do the best we can of course butwell you asked for the truth you remember so I had to give it to you
CHAPTER XXVII THE MOTHERTHE WIFE Bertram made up his mind at once that for the present at least he would tell no one what the surgeon had said to him
He had placed himself under the mans care and there was nothing to do but to take the prescribed treatment and await results as patiently as he could
Meanwhile there was no need to worry Billy or William or anybody else with the matter
Billy was so busy with her holiday plans that she was only vaguely aware of what seemed to be an increase of restlessness on the part of her husband during those days just before Christmas
Poor dear is the arm feeling horrid today
she asked one morning when the gloom on her husbands face was deeper than usual
Bertram frowned and did not answer directly
Lots of good I am these days
he exclaimed his moody eyes on the armful of manyshaped manysized packages she carried
What are those forthe tree
Yes and its going to be so pretty Bertram exulted Billy
And do you know Baby positively acts as if he suspected thingslittle as he is she went on eagerly
Hes as nervous as a witch
I cant keep him still a minute
How about his mother
hinted Bertram with a faint smile
Billy laughed
Well Im afraid she isnt exactly calm herself she confessed as she hurried out of the room with her parcels
Bertram looked after her longingly despondently
I wonder what shed say if sheknew he muttered
But she shant knowtill she just has to he vowed suddenly under his breath striding into the hall for his hat and coat
Never had the Strata known such a Christmas as this was planned to be
Cyril Marie and the twins were to be there also Kate her husband and three children Paul Egbert and little Kate from the West
On Christmas Day there was to be a big family dinner with Aunt Hannah down from the Annex
Then in concession to the extreme youth of the young host and his twin cousins there was to be an afternoon tree
The shades were to be drawn and the candles lighted however so that there might be no loss of effect
In the evening the tree was to be once more loaded with fascinating packages and candybags and this time the Greggorys Tommy Dunn and all the rest from the Annex were to have the fun all over again
From garret to basement the Strata was aflame with holly and aglitter with tinsel
Nowhere did there seem to be a spot that did not have its bit of tissue paper or its trail of red ribbon
And everythingholly ribbon tissue and tinsel led to the mysteriously closed doors of the great front drawingroom past which none but Billy and her accredited messengers might venture
No wonder indeed that even Baby scented excitement and that Babys mother was not exactly calm
No wonder too that Bertram with his helpless right arm and his heavy heart felt peculiarly forlorn and out of it
No wonder also that he took himself literally out of it with growing frequency
Mr and Mrs Hartwell and little Kate were to stay at the Strata
The boys Paul and Egbert were to go to Cyrils
Promptly at the appointed time two days before Christmas they arrived
And from that hour until two days after Christmas when the last bit of holly ribbon tissue and tinsel disappeared from the floor Billy moved in a whirl of anxious responsibility that was yet filled with fun frolic and laughter
It was a great success the whole affair
Everybody seemed pleased and happythat is everybody but Bertram and he very plainly tried to seem pleased and happy
Even Cyril unbent to the extent of not appearing to mind the noise one bit and Sister Kate Bertram said found only the extraordinarily small number of four details to change in the arrangements
Baby obligingly let his teethgetting go for the occasion and he and the twins Franz and Felix were the admiration and delight of all
Little Kate to be sure was a trifle disconcerting once or twice but everybody was too absorbed to pay much attention to her
Billy did however remember her opening remarks
Well little Kate do you remember me
Billy had greeted her pleasantly
Oh yes little Kate had answered with a winning smile
Youre my Aunt Billy what married my Uncle Bertram instead of Uncle William as you said you would first
Everybody laughed and Billy colored of course but little Kate went on eagerly And Ive been wanting just awfully to see you she announced
Have you
Im glad Im sure
I feel highly flattered smiled Billy
Well I have
You see I wanted to ask you something
Have you ever wished that you had married Uncle William instead of Uncle Bertram or that youd tried for Uncle Cyril before Aunty Marie got him
Kate
gasped her horrified mother
I told you You see she broke off turning to Billy despairingly
Shes been pestering me with questions like that ever since she knew she was coming
She never has forgotten the way you changed from one uncle to the other
You may remember it made a great impression on her at the time
Yes II remember stammered Billy trying to laugh off her embarrassment
But you havent told me yet whether you did wish youd married Uncle William or Uncle Cyril interposed little Kate persistently
No no of course not
exclaimed Billy with a vivid blush casting her eyes about for a door of escape and rejoicing greatly when she spied Delia with the baby coming toward them
There look my dear heres your new cousin little Bertram
she exclaimed
Dont you want to see him
Little Kate turned dutifully
Yesm Aunt Billy but Id rather see the twins
Mother says theyre real pretty and cunning
Eryyes they are murmured Billy on whom the emphasis of the theyre had not been lost
Naturally as may be supposed therefore Billy had not forgotten little Kates opening remarks
Immediately after Christmas Mr Hartwell and the boys went back to their Western home leaving Mrs Hartwell and her daughter to make a round of visits to friends in the East
For almost a week after Christmas they remained at the Strata and it was on the last day of their stay that little Kate asked the question that proved so momentous in results
Billy almost unconsciously had avoided tete atetes with her small guest
But today they were alone together
Aunt Billy began the little girl after a meditative gaze into the others face you are married to Uncle Bertram arent you
I certainly am my dear smiled Billy trying to speak unconcernedly
Well then what makes you forget it
What makes me forget Why child what a question
What do you mean
I dont forget it
exclaimed Billy indignantly
Then what did mother mean
I heard her tell Uncle William myselfshe didnt know I heard thoughthat she did wish youd remember you were Uncle Bertrams wife as well as Cousin Bertrams mother
Billy flushed scarlet then grew very white
At that moment Mrs Hartwell came into the room
Little Kate turned triumphantly
There she hasnt forgotten and I knew she hadnt mother
I asked her just now and she said she hadnt
Hadnt what
questioned Mrs Hartwell looking a little apprehensively at her sisterin laws white face and angry eyes
Hadnt forgotten that she was Uncle Bertrams wife
Kate interposed Billy steadily meeting her sisterinlaws gaze will you be good enough to tell me what this child is talking about
Mrs Hartwell sighed and gave an impatient gesture
Kate Ive a mind to take you home on the next train she said to her daughter
Run away now downstairs
Your Aunt Billy and I want to talk
Come come hurry
I mean what I say she added warningly as she saw unmistakable signs of rebellion on the small young face
I wish pouted little Kate rising reluctantly and moving toward the door that you didnt always send me away just when I wanted most to stay
Well Kate
prompted Billy as the door closed behind the little girl
Yes I suppose Ill have to say it now as long as that child has put her finger in the pie
But I hadnt intended to speak no matter what I saw
I promised myself I wouldnt before I came
I know of course how Bertram and Cyril and William too say that Im always interfering in affairs that dont concern methough for that matter if my own brothers affairs dont concern me I dont know whose should
But as I said I wasnt going to speak this time no matter what I saw
And I havent except to William and Cyril and Aunt Hannah but I suppose somewhere little Kate got hold of it
Its simply this Billy
It seems to me its high time you began to realize that youre Bertrams wife as well as the babys mother
That I am I dont think I quite understand said Billy unsteadily
No I suppose you dont sighed Kate though where your eyes are I dont seeor rather I do see theyre on the baby always
Its all very well and lovely Billy to be a devoted mother and you certainly are that
Ill say that much for you and Ill admit I never thought you would be
But cant you see what youre doing to Bertram
Doing to Bertramby being a devoted mother to his son
Yes doing to Bertram
Cant you see what a change there is in the boy
He doesnt act like himself at all
Hes restless and gloomy and entirely out of sorts
Yes I know but thats his arm pleaded Billy
Poor boyhes so tired of it
Kate shook her head decisively
Its more than his arm Billy
Youd see it yourself if you werent blinded by your absorption in that baby
Where is Bertram every evening
Where is he daytimes
Do you realize that hes been at home scarcely one evening since I came
And as for the dayshes almost never here
But Kate he cant paint now you know so of course he doesnt need to stay so closely at home defended Billy
He goes out to find distraction from himself
Yes distraction indeed sniffed Kate
And where do you suppose he finds it
Do you know where he finds it
I tell you Billy Bertram Henshaw is not the sort of man that should find too much distraction outside his home
His tastes and his temperament are altogether too Bohemian and Billy interrupted with a peremptorily upraised hand
Please remember Kate you are speaking of my husband to his wife and his wife has perfect confidence in him and is just a little particular as to what you say
Yes well Im speaking of my brother too whom I know very well shrugged Kate
All is you may remember sometime that I warned youthats all
This trusting business is all very pretty but I think twould be a lot prettier and a vast deal more sensible if youd give him a little attention as well as trust and see if you cant keep him at home a bit more
At least youll know whom hes with then
Cyril says he saw him last week with Bob Seaver
WithBobSeaver
faltered Billy changing color
Yes
I see you remember him smiled Kate not quite agreeably
Perhaps now youll take some stock in what Ive said and remember it
Ill remember it certainly returned Billy a little proudly
Youve said a good many things to me in the past Mrs Hartwell and Ive remembered them allevery one
It was Kates turn to flush and she did it
Yes I know
And I presume very likely sometimes there hasnt been much foundation for what Ive said
I think this time however youll find there is she finished with an air of hurt dignity
Billy made no reply perhaps because Delia at that moment brought in the baby
Mrs Hartwell and little Kate left the Strata the next morning
Until then Billy contrived to keep before them a countenance serene and a manner free from unrest
Even when after dinner that evening Bertram put on his hat and coat and went out Billy refused to meet her sister inlaws meaning gaze
But in the morning after they had left the house Billy did not attempt to deceive herself
Determinedly then she set herself to going over in her mind the past months since the baby came and she was appalled at what she found
Ever in her ears too was that feared name Bob Seaver and ever before her eyes was that night years ago when as an eighteenyearold girl she had followed Bertram and Bob Seaver into a glittering cafe at eleven oclock at night because Bertram had been drinking and was not himself
She remembered Bertrams face when he had seen her and what he had said when she begged him to come home
She remembered too what the family had said afterward
But she remembered also that years later Bertram had told her what that escapade of hers had really done for him and that he believed he had actually loved her from that moment
After that night at all events he had had little to do with Bob Seaver
And now Seaver was back again it seemed and with Bertram
They had been seen together
But if they had what could she do
Surely she could hardly now follow them into a public cafe and demand that Seaver let her husband come home
But she could keep him at home perhaps
Billy quite brightened at this thought
Kate had said that she was so absorbed in Baby that her husband received no attention at all
Billy did not believe this was true but if it were true she could at least rectify that mistake
If it were attention that he wantedhe should want no more
Poor Bertram
No wonder that he had sought distraction outside
When one had a horrid broken arm that would not let one do anything what else could one do
Just here Billy suddenly remembered the book A Talk to Young Wives
If she recollected rightly there was a chapter that covered the very claim Kate had been making
Billy had not thought of the book for months but she went at once to get it now
There might be after all something in it that would help her
The Coming of the First Baby
Billy found the chapter without difficulty and settled herself to read her countenance alight with interest
In a surprisingly short time however a new expression came to her face and at last a little gasp of dismay fell from her lips
She looked up then with a startled gaze
Had her walls possessed eyes and ears all these past months only to give instructions to an unseen hand that it might write what the eyes and ears had learned
For it was such sentences as these that the consciencesmitten Billy read Maternity is apt to work a miracle in a womans life but sometimes it spells disaster so far as domestic bliss is concerned
The young mother wrapped up in the delights and duties of motherhood utterly forgets that she has a husband
She lives and moves and has her being in the nursery
She thinks baby talks baby knows only baby
She refuses to dress up because it is easier to take care of baby in a frowzy wrapper
She will not go out with her husband for fear something might happen to the baby
She gives up her music because baby wont let her practice
In vain her husband tries to interest her in his own affairs
She has neither eyes nor ears for him only for baby
Now no man enjoys having his nose put out of joint even by his own child
He loves his child devotedly and is proud of him of course but that does not keep him from wanting the society of his wife occasionally nor from longing for her oldtime love and sympathetic interest
It is an admirable thing certainly for a woman to be a devoted mother but maternal affection can be carried too far
Husbands have some rights as well as offspring and the wife who neglects her husband for her babies does so at her peril
Home with the wife eternally in the nursery is apt to be a dull and lonely thing to the average husband so he starts out to find amusement for himselfand he finds it
Then is the time when the new little life that is so precious and that should have bound the two more closely together becomes the wedge that drives them apart
Billy did not read any more
With a little sobbing cry she flung the book back into her desk and began to pull off her wrapper
Her fingers shook
Already she saw herself a Monster a Wicked Destroyer of Domestic Bliss with her thoughtless absorption in Baby until he had become that Awful Thinga Wedge
And Bertram poor Bertram with his broken arm
She had not played to him nor sung to him nor gone out with him
And when had they had one of their good long talks about Bertrams work and plans
But it should all be changed now
She would play and sing and go out with him
She would dress up too
He should see no more wrappers
She would ask about his work and seem interested
She was interested
She remembered now that just before he was hurt he had told her of a new portrait and of a new Face of a Girl that he had planned to do
Lately he had said nothing about these
He had seemed discouragedand no wonder with his broken arm
But she would change all that
He should see
And forthwith Billy hurried to her closet to pick out her prettiest house frock
Long before dinner Billy was ready waiting in the drawingroom
She had on a pretty little blue silk gown that she knew Bertram liked and she watched very anxiously for Bertram to come up the steps
She remembered now with a pang that he had long since given up his peculiar ring but she meant to meet him at the door just the same
Bertram however did not come
At a quarter before six he telephoned that he had met some friends and would dine at the club
My my how pretty we are
exclaimed Uncle William when they went down to dinner together
New frock
Why no Uncle William laughed Billy a little tremulously
Youve seen it dozens of times
Have I
murmured the man
I dont seem to remember it
Too bad Bertram isnt here to see you
Somehow you look unusually pretty tonight
And Billys heart ached anew
Billy spent the evening practicingsoftly to be sure so as not to wake Babybut practicing
As the days passed Billy discovered that it was much easier to say she would change things than it was really to change them
She changed herself it is trueher clothes her habits her words and her thoughts but it was more difficult to change Bertram
In the first place he was there so little
She was dismayed when she saw how very little indeed he was at homeand she did not like to ask him outright to stay
That was not in accordance with her plans
Besides the Talk to Young Wives said that indirect influence was much to be preferred always to direct persuasionwhich last indeed usually failed to produce results
So Billy dressed up and practiced and talked of anything but the baby and even hinted shamelessly once or twice that she would like to go to the theater but all to little avail
True Bertram brightened up for a minute when he came home and found her in a new or a favorite dress and he told her how pretty she looked
He appeared to like to have her play to him too even declaring once or twice that it was quite like old times yes it was
But he never noticed her hints about the theater and he did not seem to like to talk about his work even a little bit
Billy laid this last fact to his injured arm
She decided that he had become blue and discouraged and that he needed cheering up especially about his work so she determinedly and systematically set herself to doing it
She talked of the fine work he had done and of the still finer work he would yet do when his arm was well
She told him how proud she was of him and she let him see how dear his Art was to her and how badly she would feel if she thought he had really lost all his interest in his work and would never paint again
She questioned him about the new portrait he was to begin as soon as his arm would let him and she tried to arouse his enthusiasm in the picture he had planned to show in the March Exhibition of the Bohemian Ten telling him that she was sure his arm would allow him to complete at least one canvas to hang
In none of this however did Bertram appear in the least interested
The one thing indeed which he seemed not to want to talk about was his work and he responded to her overtures on the subject with only moody silence or else with almost irritable monosyllables all of which not only grieved but surprised Billy very much
For according to the Talk to Young Wives she was doing exactly what the ideal sympathetic interestedinherhusbandswork wife should do
When February came bringing with it no change for the better Billy was thoroughly frightened
Bertrams arm plainly was not improving
He was more gloomy and restless than ever
He seemed not to want to stay at home at all and Billy knew now for a certainty that he was spending more and more time with Bob Seaver and the boys
Poor Billy
Nowhere could she look these days and see happiness
Even the adored baby seemed at times almost to give an added pang
Had he not become according to the Talk to Young Wives that awful thing a Wedge
The Annex too carried its sting for where was the need of an overflow house for happiness now when there was no happiness to overflow
Even the little jade idol on Billys mantel Billy could not bear to see these days for its once bland smile had become a hideous grin demanding Where now is your heap plenty velly good luckee
But before Bertram Billy still carried a bravely smiling face and to him still she talked earnestly and enthusiastically of his workwhich last as it happened was the worst course she could have pursued for the one thing poor Bertram wished to forget just now washis work
CHAPTER XXVIII CONSPIRATORS Early in February came Arkwrights appearance at the Boston Opera Housethe first since he had sung there as a student a few years before
He was an immediate and an unquestioned success
His portrait adorned the front page of almost every Boston newspaper the next morning and captious critics vied with each other to do him honor
His full history from boyhood up was featured with special emphasis on his recent triumphs in New York and foreign capitals
He was interviewed as to his opinion on everything from vegetarianism to womans suffrage and his preferences as to pies and pastimes were given headline prominence
There was no doubt of it
Mr M J Arkwright was a star
All Arkwrights old friends including Billy Bertram Cyril Marie Calderwell Alice Greggory Aunt Hannah and Tommy Dunn went to hear him sing and after the performance he held a miniature reception with enough adulation to turn his head completely around he declared deprecatingly
Not until the next evening however did he have an opportunity for what he called a real talk with any of his friends then in Calderwells room he settled back in his chair with a sigh of content
For a time his own and Calderwells affairs occupied their attention then after a short pause the tenor asked abruptly Is there anythingwrong with the Henshaws Calderwell
Calderwell came suddenly erect in his chair
Thank you
I hoped youd introduce that subject though for that matter if you hadnt I should
Yes there isand Im looking to you old man to get them out of it
I
Arkwright sat erect now
Yes
What do you mean
In a way the expected has happened though I know now that I didnt really expect it to happen in spite of my prophecies
You may remember I was always skeptical on the subject of Bertrams settling down to a domestic hearthstone
I insisted twould be the turn of a girls head and the curve of her cheek that he wanted to paint
Arkwright looked up with a quick frown
You dont mean that Henshaw has been cad enough to find another Calderwell threw up his hand
No no not that
We havent that to deal withyet thank goodness
Theres no woman in it
And really when you come right down to it if ever a fellow had an excuse to seek diversion Bertram Henshaw haspoor chap
Its just this
Bertram broke his arm again last October
Yes so I hear and I thought he was looking badly
He is
Its a bad business
Twas improperly set in the first place and its not doing well now
In fact Im told on pretty good authority that the doctor says he probably will never use it again
Oh by George
Calderwell
Yes
Tough isnt it
Specially when you think of his work and knowas I happen to that hes particularly dependent on his right hand for everything
He doesnt tell this generally and I understand Billy and the family know nothing of ithow hopeless the case is I mean
Well naturally the poor fellow has been pretty thoroughly discouraged and to get away from himself hes gone back to his old Bohemian habits spending much of his time with some of his old cronies that are none too good for himSeaver for instance
Bob Seaver
Yes I know him
Arkwrights lips snapped together crisply
Yes
He said he knew you
Thats why Im counting on your help
What do you mean
I mean I want you to get Henshaw away from him and keep him away
Arkwrights face darkened with an angry flush
Great Scott Calderwell
What are you talking about
Henshaw is no kid to be toted home and Im no nursery governess to do the toting
Calderwell laughed quietly
No I dont think any one would take you for a nursery governess Arkwright in spite of the fact that you are still known to some of your friends as Mary Jane
But you can sing a song man which will promptly give you a through ticket to their innermost sacred circle
In fact to my certain knowledge Seaver is already planning a jamboree with you at the right hand of the toastmaster
Theres your chance
Once in stay inlong enough to get Henshaw out
But good heavens Calderwell its impossible
What can I do
demanded Arkwright savagely
I cant walk up to the man take him by the ear and say Here you sirmarch home
Neither can I come the Iamholier thanthou act and hold up to him the mirror of his transgressions
No but you can get him out of it some way
You can find a wayfor Billys sake
There was no answer and after a moment Calderwell went on more quietly
I havent seen Billy but two or three times since I came back to Bostonbut I dont need to to know that shes breaking her heart over something
And of course that something is Bertram
There was still no answer
Arkwright got up suddenly and walked to the window
You see Im helpless resumed Calderwell
I dont paint pictures nor sing songs nor write stories nor dance jigs for a livingand you have to do one or another to be in with that set
And its got to be a Johnnyonthespot with Bertram
All is something will have to be done to get him out of the state of mind and body hes in now or Arkwright wheeled sharply
When did you say this jamboree was going to be
he demanded
Next week some time
The date is not settled
They were going to consult you
Hmm commented Arkwright
And though his next remark was a complete change of subject Calderwell gave a contented sigh
If when the proposition was first made to him Arkwright was doubtful of his ability to be a successful Johnnyonthespot he was even more doubtful of it as the days passed and he was attempting to carry out the suggestion
He had known that he was undertaking a most difficult and delicate task and he soon began to fear that it was an impossible one as well
With a dogged persistence however he adhered to his purpose ever on the alert to be more watchful more tactful more efficient in emergencies
Disagreeable as was the task in a way in another way it was a great pleasure to him
He was glad of the opportunity to do anything for Billy and then too he was glad of something absorbing enough to take his mind off his own affairs
He told himself sometimes that this helping another man to fight his tiger skin was assisting himself to fight his own
Arkwright was trying very hard not to think of Alice Greggory these days
He had come back hoping that he was in a measure cured of his folly as he termed it but the first look into Alice Greggorys bluegray eyes had taught him the fallacy of that idea
In that very first meeting with Alice he feared that he had revealed his secret for she was plainly so nervously distant and ill at ease with him that he could but construe her embarrassment and chilly dignity as pity for him and a desire to show him that she had nothing but friendship for him
Since then he had seen but little of her partly because he did not wish to see her and partly because his time was so fully occupied
Then too in a round about way he had heard a rumor that Calderwell was engaged to be married and though no feminine name had been mentioned in connection with the story Arkwright had not hesitated to supply in his own mind that of Alice Greggory
Beginning with the jamboree which came off quite in accordance with Calderwells prophecies Arkwright spent the most of such time as was not given to his professional duties in deliberately cultivating the society of Bertram and his friends
To this extent he met with no difficulty for he found that M J Arkwright the new star in the operatic firmament was obviously a welcome comrade
Beyond this it was not so easy
Arkwright wondered indeed sometimes if he were making any progress at all
But still he persevered
He walked with Bertram he talked with Bertram unobtrusively he contrived to be near Bertram almost always when they were together with the boys
Gradually he won from him the story of what the surgeon had said to him and of how black the future looked in consequence
This established a new bond between them so potent that Arkwright ventured to test it one day by telling Bertram the story of the tiger skinthe first tiger skin in his uncles library years ago and of how since then any difficulty he had encountered he had tried to treat as a tiger skin
In telling the story he was careful to draw no moral for his listener and to preach no sermon
He told the tale too with all possible whimsical lightness of touch and immediately at its conclusion he changed the subject
But that he had not failed utterly in his design was evidenced a few days later when Bertram grimly declared that he guessed his tiger skin was a lively beast all right
The first time Arkwright went home with Bertram his presence was almost a necessity
Bertram was not quite himself that night
Billy admitted them
She had plainly been watching and waiting
Arkwright never forgot the look on her face as her eyes met his
There was a curious mixture of terror hurt pride relief and shame overtopped by a fierce loyalty which almost seemed to say aloud the words Dont you dare to blame him
Arkwrights heart ached with sympathy and admiration at the proudly courageous way in which Billy carried off the next few painful minutes
Even when he bade her good night a little later only her eyes said thank you
Her lips were dumb
Arkwright often went home with Bertram after that
Not that it was always necessary far from it
Some time indeed elapsed before he had quite the same excuse again for his presence
But he had found that occasionally he could get Bertram home earlier by adroit suggestions of one kind or another and more and more frequently he was succeeding in getting him home for a game of chess
Bertram liked chess and was a fine player
Since breaking his arm he had turned to games with the feverish eagerness of one who looks for something absorbing to fill an unrestful mind
It was Seavers skill in chess that had at first attracted Bertram to the man long ago but Bertram could beat him easilytoo easily for much pleasure in it now
So they did not play chess often these days
Bertram had found that in spite of his injury he could still take part in other games and some of them if not so intricate as chess were at least more apt to take his mind off himself especially if there were a bit of money up to add zest and interest
As it happened however Bertram learned one day that Arkwright could play chessand play well too as he discovered after their first game together
This fact contributed not a little to such success as Arkwright was having in his efforts to wean Bertram from his undesirable companions for Bertram soon found out that Arkwright was more than a match for himself and the occasional games he did succeed in winning only whetted his appetite for more
Many an evening now therefore was spent by the two men in Bertrams den with Billy anxiously hovering near her eyes longingly watching either her husbands absorbed face or the pretty little red and white ivory figures which seemed to possess so wonderful a power to hold his attention
In spite of her joy at the chessmens efficacy in keeping Bertram at home however she was almost jealous of them
Mr Arkwright couldnt you show me how to play sometime
she said wistfully one evening when the momentary absence of Bertram had left the two alone together
I used to watch Bertram and Marie play years ago but I never knew how to play myself
Not that I can see where the fun is in just sitting staring at a chessboard for half an hour at a time though
But Bertram likes it and so II want to learn to stare with him
Will you teach me
I should be glad to smiled Arkwright
Then will you come maybe sometimes when Bertram is at the doctors
He goes every Tuesday and Friday at three oclock for treatment
Id rather you came then for two reasons first because I dont want Bertram to know Im learning till I can play some and secondly becausebecause I dont want to take you awayfrom him
The last words were spoken very low and were accompanied by a painful blush
It was the first time Billy had ever hinted to Arkwright in words that she understood what he was trying to do
Ill come next Tuesday promised Arkwright with a cheerfully unobservant air
Then Bertram came in bringing the book of Chess Problems for which he had gone upstairs
CHAPTER XXIX CHESS Promptly at three oclock Tuesday afternoon Arkwright appeared at the Strata and for the next hour Billy did her best to learn the names and the moves of the pretty little ivory men
But at the end of the hour she was almost ready to give up in despair
If there werent so many kinds and if they didnt all insist on doing something different it wouldnt be so bad she sighed
But how can you be expected to remember which goes diagonal and which crisscross and which cant go but one square and which can skip way across the board specially when that little pawnthing can go straight ahead two squares sometimes and the next minute only one except when it takes things and then it goes crooked one square and when that tiresome little horse tries to go all ways at once and can jump round and hurdle over anybodys head even the kingshow can you expect folks to remember
But then Bertram remembers she added resolutely so I guess I can
Whenever possible after that Arkwright came on Tuesdays and Fridays and in spite of her doubts Billy did very soon begin to remember
Spurred by her great desire to play with Bertram and surprise him Billy spared no pains to learn well her lessons
Even among the babys books and playthings these days might be found a Manual of Chess for Billy pursued her study at all hours and some nights even her dreams were of ruined castles where kings and queens and bishops disported themselves with pawns for servants and where a weird knight on horseback used the castles highest tower for a hurdle landing always a hundred yards to one side of where he would be expected to come down
It was not long of course before Billy could play a game of chess after a fashion but she knew just enough to realize that she actually knew nothing and she knew too that until she could play a really good game her moves would not hold Bertrams attention for one minute
Not at present therefore was she willing Bertram should know what she was attempting to do
Billy had not yet learned what the great surgeon had said to Bertram
She knew only that his arm was no better and that he never voluntarily spoke of his painting
Over her now seemed to be hanging a vague horror
Something was the matter
She knew that
But what it was she could not fathom
She realized that Arkwright was trying to help and her gratitude though silent knew no bounds
Not even to Aunt Hannah or Uncle William could she speak of this thing that was troubling her
That they too understood in a measure she realized
But still she said no word
Billy was wearing a proud little air of aloofness these days that was heart breaking to those who saw it and read it aright for what it was loyalty to Bertram no matter what happened
And so Billy pored over her chessboard feverishly tirelessly having ever before her longing eyes the dear time when Bertram across the table from her should sit happily staring for half an hour at a move she had made
Whatever Billys chessplaying was to signify however in her own life it was destined to play a part in the lives of two friends of hers that was most unexpected
During Billys very first lesson as it chanced Alice Greggory called and found Billy and Arkwright so absorbed in their game that they did not at first hear Eliza speak her name
The quick color that flew to Arkwrights face at sight of herself was construed at once by Alice as embarrassment on his part at being found teteatete with Bertram Henshaws wife
And she did not like it
She was not pleased that he was there
She was less pleased that he blushed for being there
It so happened that Alice found him there again several times
Alice gave a piano lesson at two oclock every Tuesday and Friday afternoon to a little Beacon Street neighbor of Billys and she had fallen into the habit of stepping in to see Billy for a few minutes afterward which brought her there at a little past three just after the chess lesson was well started
If the first time that Alice Greggory found Arkwright opposite Billy at the chesstable she was surprised and displeased the second and third times she was much more so
When it finally came to her one day with sickening illumination that always the teteatetes were during Bertrams hour at the doctors she was appalled
What could it mean
Had Arkwright given up his fight
Was he playing false to himself and to Bertram by trying thus on the sly to win the love of his friends wife
Was this man whom she had so admired for his brave stand and to whom all unasked she had given her hearts best love more the pity of it
was this idol of hers to show feet of clay after all
She could not believe it
And yet Sick at heart but imbued with the determination of a righteous cause Alice Greggory resolved for Billys sake to watch and wait
If necessary she should speak to some onethough to whom she did not know
Billys happiness should not be put in jeopardy if she could help it
Indeed no
As the weeks passed Alice came to be more and more uneasy distressed and grieved
Of Billy she could believe no evil but of Arkwright she was beginning to think she could believe everything that was dishonorable and despicable
And to believe that of the man she still loved no wonder that Alice did not look nor act like herself these days
Incensed at herself because she did love him angry at him because he seemed to be proving himself so unworthy of that love and genuinely frightened at what she thought was the fast approaching wreck of all happiness for her dear friend Billy Alice did not know which way to turn
At the first she had told herself confidently that she would speak to somebody
But as time passed she saw the impracticability of that idea
Speak to somebody indeed
To whom
When
Where
What should she say
Where was her right to say anything
She was not dealing with a parcel of naughty children who had pilfered the cake jar
She was dealing with grown men and women who presumedly knew their own affairs and who certainly would resent any interference from her
On the other hand could she stand calmly by and see Bertram lose his wife Arkwright his honor Billy her happiness and herself her faith in human nature all because to do otherwise would be to meddle in other peoples business
Apparently she could and should
At least that seemed to be the role which she was expected to play
It was when Alice had reached this unhappy frame of mind that Arkwright himself unexpectedly opened the door for her
The two were alone together in Bertram Henshaws den
It was Tuesday afternoon
Alice had called to find Billy and Arkwright deep in their usual game of chess
Then a matter of domestic affairs had taken Billy from the room
Im afraid Ill have to be gone ten minutes or more she had said as she rose from the table reluctantly
But you might be showing Alice the moves Mr Arkwright she had added with a laugh as she disappeared
Shall I teach you the moves
he had smiled when they were alone together
Alices reply had been so indignantly short and sharp that Arkwright after a moments pause had said with a whimsical smile that yet carried a touch of sadness I am forced to surmise from your answer that you think it is you who should be teaching me moves
At all events I seem to have been making some moves lately that have not suited you judging by your actions
Have I offended you in any way Alice
The girl turned with a quick lifting of her head
Alice knew that if ever she were to speak it must be now
Never again could she hope for such an opportunity as this
Suddenly throwing circumspect caution quite aside she determined that she would speak
Springing to her feet she crossed the room and seated herself in Billys chair at the chesstable
Me
Offend me
she exclaimed in a low voice
As if I were the one you were offending
Why Alice murmured the man in obvious stupefaction
Alice raised her hand palm outward
Now dont please dont pretend you dont know she begged almost piteously
Please dont add that to all the rest
Oh I understand of course its none of my affairs and I wasnt going to speak she choked but today when you gave me this chance I had to
At first I couldnt believe it she plunged on plainly hurrying against Billys return
After all youd told me of how you meant to fight ityour tiger skin
And I thought it merely happened that you were here alone with her those days I came
Then when I found out they were always the days Mr Henshaw was away at the doctors I had to believe
She stopped for breath
Arkwright who up to this moment had shown that he was completely mystified as to what she was talking about suddenly flushed a painful red
He was obviously about to speak but she prevented him with a quick gesture
Theres a little more Ive got to say please
As if it werent bad enough to do what youre doing at all but you must needs take it at such a time as this whenwhen her husband isnt doing just what he ought to do and we all know itits so unfair to take her now and try to to win And you arent even fair with him she protested tremulously
You pretend to be his friend
You go with him everywhere
Its just as if you were helping toto pull him down
Youre one with the whole bunch
The blood suddenly receded from Arkwrights face leaving it very white but if Alice saw it she paid no heed
Everybody says you are
Then to come here like this on the sly when you know he cant be here I Oh cant you see what youre doing
There was a moments pause then Arkwright spoke
A deep pain looked from his eyes
He was still very pale and his mouth had settled into sad lines
I think perhaps it may be just as well if I tell you what I am doingor rather trying to do he said quietly
Then he told her
And so you see he added when he had finished the tale I havent really accomplished much after all and it seems the little I have accomplished has only led to my being misjudged by you my best friend
Alice gave a sobbing cry
Her face was scarlet
Horror shame and relief struggled for mastery in her countenance
Oh but I didnt know I didnt know she moaned twisting her hands nervously
And now when youve been so brave so truefor me to accuse you of Oh can you ever forgive me
But you see knowing that you did care for her it did look She choked into silence and turned away her head
He glanced at her tenderly mournfully
Yes he said after a minute in a low voice
I can see how it did look and so Im going to tell you now something I had meant never to tell you
There really couldnt have been anything in that you see for I found out long ago that it was gonewhatever love there had been for Billy
But yourtiger skin
Oh yes I thought it was alive smiled Arkwright sadly when I asked you to help me fight it
But one day very suddenly I discovered that it was nothing but a dead skin of dreams and memories
But I made another discovery too
I found that just beyond lay another one and that was very much alive
Another one
Alice turned to him in wonder
But you never asked me to help you fight that one
He shook his head
No I couldnt you see
You couldnt have helped me
Youd only have hindered me
Hindered you
Yes
You see it was my love foryou that I was fightingthen
Alice gave a low cry and flushed vividly but Arkwright hurried on his eyes turned away
Oh I understand
I know
Im not asking foranything
I heard some time ago of your engagement to Calderwell
Ive tried many times to say the proper expected pretty speeches butI couldnt
I will now though
I do
You have all my tenderest best wishes for your happinessdear
If long ago I hadnt been such a blind fool as not to know my own heart Butbut theres some mistake interposed Alice palpitatingly with hanging head
IIm not engaged to Mr
Calderwell
Arkwright turned and sent a keen glance into her face
Yourenot
No
But I heard that Calderwell He stopped helplessly
You heard that Mr Calderwell was engaged very likely
Butit so happens he isnt engaged to me murmured Alice faintly
But long ago you said Arkwright paused his eyes still keenly searching her face
Never mind what I saidlong ago laughed Alice trying unsuccessfully to meet his gaze
One says lots of things at times you know
Into Arkwrights eyes came a new light a light that plainly needed but a breath to fan it into quick fire
Alice he said softly do you mean that maybe nowI neednt try to fightthat other tiger skin
There was no answer
Arkwright reached out a pleading hand
Alice dear Ive loved you so long he begged unsteadily
Dont you think that sometime if I was very very patient you could just begin to care a little for me
Still there was no answer
Then slowly Alice shook her head
Her face was turned quite away which was a pity for if Arkwright could have seen the sudden tender mischief in her eyes his own would not have become so somber
Not even a little bit
I couldnt everbegin answered a half smothered voice
Alice
cried the man heartbrokenly
Alice turned now and for a fleeting instant let him see her eyes glowing with the love so long kept in relentless exile
I couldnt because you seeI began long ago she whispered
Alice
It was the same single word but spoken with a world of difference for into it now was crowded all the glory and the wonder of a great love
Alice
breathed the man again and this time the word was oh so tenderly whispered into the little pink and white ear of the girl in his arms
I got delayed began Billy in the doorway
Ohh
she broke off beating a hushed but precipitate retreat
Fully thirty minutes later Billy came to the door again
This time her approach was heralded by a snatch of song
I hope youll excuse my being gone so long she smiled as she entered the room where her two guests sat decorously face to face at the chess table
Well you know you said youd be gone ten minutes Arkwright reminded her politely
Yes I know I did
And Billy to her credit did not even smile at the man who did not know ten minutes from fifty
CHAPTER XXX BY A BABYS HAND After all it was the babys hand that did it as was proper and perhaps to be expected for surely was it not Bertram Jrs place to show his parents that he was indeed no Wedge but a dear and precious Tie binding two loving loyal hearts more and more closely together
It would seem indeed that Bertram Jr thought so perhaps and very bravely he set about it though to carry out his purpose he had to turn his steps into an unfamiliar waya way of pain and weariness and danger
It was Arkwright who told Bertram that the baby was very sick and that Billy wanted him
Bertram went home at once to find a distracted whitefaced Billy and a twisted painracked little creature who it was almost impossible to believe was the happy laughing baby boy he had left that morning
For the next two weeks nothing was thought of in the silent old Beacon Street house but the tiny little life hovering so near Deaths door that twice it appeared to have slipped quite across the threshold
All through those terrible weeks it seemed as if Billy neither ate nor slept and always at her side comforting cheering and helping wherever possible was Bertram tender loving and marvelously thoughtful
Then came the turning point when the universe itself appeared to hang upon a babys breath
Gradually almost imperceptibly came the fluttering back of the tiny spirit into the longing arms stretched so far far out to meet and hold it
And the father and the mother looking into each others sleepless darkringed eyes knew that their son was once more theirs to love and cherish
When two have gone together with a dear one down into the Valley of the Shadow of Death and have come back either mourning or rejoicing they find a different world from the one they had left
Things that were great before seem small and some things that were small seem great
At least Bertram and Billy found their world thus changed when together they came back bringing their son with them
In the long weeks of convalescence when the healthy rosiness stole bit by bit into the babys waxen face and the light of recognition and understanding crept day by day into the babys eyes there was many a quiet hour for heartto heart talks between the two who so anxiously and joyously hailed every rosy tint and fleeting sparkle
And there was so much to tell so much to hear so much to talk about
And always running through everything was that golden thread of joy beside which all else paledthat they had Baby and each other
As if anything else mattered
To be sure there was Bertrams arm
Very early in their talks Billy found out about that
But Billy with Baby getting well was not to be daunted even by this
Nonsense darlingnot paint again indeed
Why Bertram of course you will she cried confidently
But Billy the doctor said began Bertram but Billy would not even listen
Very well what if he did dear
she interrupted
What if he did say you couldnt use your right arm much again
Billys voice broke a little then quickly steadied into something very much like triumph
Youve got your left one
Bertram shook his head
I cant paint with that
Yes you can insisted Billy firmly
Why Bertram what do you suppose you were given two arms for if not to fight with both of them
And Im going to be ever so much prouder of what you paint now because Ill know how splendidly you worked to do it
Besides theres Baby
As if you werent ever going to paint for Baby
Why Bertram Im going to have you paint Baby one of these days
Think how pleased hell be to see it when he grows up
Hes nicer anyhow than any old Face of a Girl you ever did
Paint
Why Bertram darling of course youre going to paint and better than you ever did before
Bertram shook his head again but this time he smiled and patted Billys cheek with the tip of his forefinger
As if I could
he disclaimed
But that afternoon he went into his longdeserted studio and hunted up his last unfinished picture
For some time he stood motionless before it then with a quick gesture of determination he got out his palette paints and brushes
This time not until he had painted ten a dozen a score of strokes did he drop his brush with a sigh and carefully erase the fresh paint on the canvas
The next day he worked longer and this time he allowed a little a very little of what he had done to remain
The third day Billy herself found him at his easel
I wonderdo you suppose I could
he asked fearfully
Why dearest of course you can
Havent you noticed
Cant you see how much more you can do with your left hand now
Youve had to use it you see
Ive seen you do a lot of things with it lately that you never used to do at all
And of course the more you do with it the more you can
I know but that doesnt mean that I can paint with it sighed Bertram ruefully eyeing the tiny bit of fresh color his canvas showed for his long afternoons work
You wait and see nodded Billy with so overwhelming a cheery confidence that Bertram looking into her glowing face was conscious of a curious throb of exultation almost as if already the victory were his
But it was not always of Bertrams broken arm nor even of his work that they talked
Bertram hanging over the babys crib to assure himself that the rosiness and the sparkle were really growing more apparent every day used to wonder sometimes how ever in the world he could have been jealous of his son
He said as much one day to Billy
To Billy it was a most astounding idea
You mean you were actually jealous of your own baby
she gasped
Why Bertram how could And was that why youyou sought distraction and Oh but Bertram that was all my ffault she quavered remorsefully
I wouldnt play nor sing nor go to walk nor anything and I wore horrid frowzy wrappers all the time and Oh come come Billy expostulated the man
Im not going to have you talk like that about my wife But I didthe book said I did wailed Billy
The book
Good heavens
Are there any books in this too
demanded Bertram
Yes the same one thethe Talks to Young Wives  nodded Billy
And then because some things had grown small to them and some others great they both laughed happily
But even this was not quite all for one evening very shyly Billy brought out the chessboard
Of course I cant play well she faltered and maybe you dont want to play with me at all
But Bertram when he found out why she had learned was very sure he did want very much to play with her
Billy did not beat of course
But she did several times experiencefor a few blissful minutes the pleasure of seeing Bertram sit motionless studying the board because of a move she had made
And though in the end her king was ignominiously trapped with not an unguarded square upon which to set his poor distracted foot the memory of those blissful minutes when she had made Bertram stare more than paid for the final checkmate
By the middle of June the baby was well enough to be taken to the beach and Bertram was so fortunate as to secure the same house they had occupied before
Once again William went down in Maine for his fishing trip and the Strata was closed
In the beach house Bertram was painting industriouslywith his left hand
Almost he was beginning to feel Billys enthusiasm
Almost he was believing that he was doing good work
It was not the Face of a Girl now
It was the face of a baby smiling laughing even crying sometimes at other times just gazing straight into your eyes with adorable soberness
Bertram still went into Boston twice a week for treatment though the treatment itself had changed
The great surgeon had sent him to still another specialist
Theres a chancethough perhaps a small one he had said
Id like you to try it anyway
As the summer advanced Bertram thought sometimes that he could see a slight improvement in his injured arm but he tried not to think too much about this
He had thought the same thing before only to be disappointed in the end
Besides he was undeniably interested just now in seeing if he could paint with his left hand
Billy was so sure and she had said that she would be prouder than ever of him if he couldand he would like to make Billy proud
Then too there was the babyhe had no idea a baby could be so interesting to paint
He was not sure but that he was going to like to paint babies even better than he had liked to paint his Face of a Girl that had brought him his first fame
In September the family returned to the Strata
The move was made a little earlier this year on account of Alice Greggorys wedding
Alice was to be married in the pretty living room at the Annex just where Billy herself had been married a few short years before and Billy had great plans for the weddingnot all of which she was able to carry out for Alice like Marie before her had very strong objections to being placed under too great obligations
And you see really anyway she told Billy I owe the whole thing to you to begin with even my husband
Nonsense
Of course you dont disputed Billy
But I do
If it hadnt been for you I should never have found him again and of course I shouldnt have had this dear little home to be married in
And I never could have left mother if she hadnt had Aunt Hannah and the Annex which means you
And if I hadnt found Mr Arkwright I might never have known how how I could go back to my old home as I am going on my honeymoon trip and just know that every one of my old friends who shakes hands with me isnt pitying me now because Im my fathers daughter
And that means you for you see I never would have known that my fathers name was cleared if it hadnt been for you
And Oh Alice please please begged Billy laughingly raising two protesting hands
Why dont you say that its to me you owe just breathing and be done with it
Well I will then avowed Alice doggedly
And its true too for honestly my dear I dont believe I would have been breathing today nor mother either if you hadnt found us that morning and taken us out of those awful rooms
I
Never
You wouldnt let me take you out laughed Billy
You proud little thing
Maybe youve forgotten how you turned poor Uncle William and me out into the cold cold world that morning just because we dared to aspire to your Lowestoft teapot but I havent
Oh Billy please dont begged Alice the painful color staining her face
If you knew how Ive hated myself since for the way I acted that dayand really you did take us away from there you know
No I didnt
I merely found two good tenants for Mr and Mrs Delano corrected Billy with a sober face
Oh yes I know all about that smiled Alice affectionately and you got mother and me here to keep Aunt Hannah company and teach Tommy Dunn and you got Aunt Hannah here to keep us company and take care of Tommy Dunn and you got Tommy Dunn here so Aunt Hannah and we could have somebody to teach and take care of and as for the others But Billy put her hands to her ears and fled
The wedding was to be on the fifteenth
From the West Kate wrote that of course it was none of her affairs particularly as neither of the interested parties was a relation but still she should think that for a man in Mr Arkwrights position nothing but a church wedding would do at all as of course he did in a way belong to the public
Alice however declared that perhaps he did belong to the public when he was Don Somebody orother in doublet and hose but when he was just plain Michael Jeremiah Arkwright in a frock coat he was hers and she did not propose to make a Grand Opera show of her wedding
And as Arkwright too very much disapproved of the churchwedding idea the two were married in the Annex livingroom at noon on the fifteenth as originally planned in spite of Mrs Kate Hartwells letter
It was soon after the wedding that Bertram told Billy he wished she would sit for him with Bertram Jr I want to try my hand at you both together he coaxed
Why of course if you like dear agreed Billy promptly though I think Baby is just as nice and even nicer alone
Once again all over Bertrams studio began to appear sketches of Billy this time a glorified tender Billy with the wonderful motherlove in her eyes
Then after several sketches of trial poses Bertram began his picture of Billy and the baby together
Even now Bertram was not sure of his work
He knew that he could not yet paint with his old freedom and ease he knew that his stroke was not so sure so untrammeled
But he knew too that he had gained wonderfully during the summer and that he was gaining now every day
To Billy he said nothing of all this
Even to himself he scarcely put his hope into words but in his heart he knew that what he was really painting his Mother and Child picture for was the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition in Marchif he could but put upon canvas the vision that was spurring him on
And so Bertram worked all through those short winter days not always upon the one picture of course but upon some picture or sketch that would help to give his still uncertain left hand the skill that had belonged to its mate
And always cheering encouraging insisting on victory was Billy so that even had Bertram been tempted sometimes to give up he could not have done soand faced Billys grieved disappointed eyes
And when at last his work was completed and the pictured mother and child in all their marvelous life and beauty seemed ready to step from the canvas Billy drew a long ecstatic breath
Oh Bertram it is it is the best work you have ever done
Billy was looking at the baby
Always she had ignored herself as part of the picture
And wont it be fine for the Exhibition
Bertrams hand tightened on the chairback in front of him
For a moment he could not speak
Then a bit huskily he asked Would you darerisk it
Risk it
Why Bertram Henshaw Ive meant that picture for the Exhibition from the very firstonly I never dreamed you could get it so perfectly lovely
Now what do you say about Baby being nicer than any old Face of a Girl that you ever did
she triumphed
And Bertram who even to himself had not dared whisper the word exhibition gave a tremulous laugh that was almost a sob so overwhelming was his sudden realization of what faith and confidence had meant to Billy his wife
If there was still a lingering doubt in Bertrams mind it must have been dispelled in less than an hour after the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition flung open its doors on its opening night
Once again Bertram found his picture the cynosure of all admiring eyes and himself the center of an enthusiastic group of friends and fellowartists who vied with each other in hearty words of congratulation
And when later the feared critics whose names and opinions counted for so much in his world had their say in the daily press and weekly reviews Bertram knew how surely indeed he had won
And when he read that Henshaws work shows now a peculiar strength a sort of reserve power as it were which beautiful as was his former work it never showed before he smiled grimly and said to Billy I suppose now that was the fighting I did with my good left hand eh dear
But there was yet one more drop that was to make Bertrams cup of joy brim to overflowing
It came just one month after the Exhibition in the shape of a terse dozen words from the doctor
Bertram fairly flew home that day
He had no consciousness of any means of locomotion
He thought he was going to tell his wife at once his great good news but when he saw her speech suddenly fled and all that he could do was to draw her closely to him with his left arm and hide his face
Why Bertram dearest whatwhat is it
stammered the thoroughly frightened Billy
Has anythinghappened
No noyesyes everything has happened
I mean its going to happen choked the man
Billy that old chap says that Im going to have my arm again
Think of itmy good right arm that Ive lost so long
Oh Bertram breathed Billy
And she too fell to sobbing
Later when speech was more coherent she faltered Well anyway it doesnt make any difference how many beautiful pictures you ppaint after this Bertram I cant be prouder of any than I am of the one your lleft hand did
Oh but I have you to thank for all that dear
No you havent disputed Billy blinking teary eyes but she paused then went on spiritedly but anyhow II dont believe any onenot even Katecan say now that that Ive been a hindrance to you in your ccareer
Hindrance
scoffed Bertram in a tone that left no room for doubt and with a kiss that left even less if possible
Billy for still another minute was silent then with a wistfulness that was half playful half serious she sighed Bertram I believe being married is something like clocks you know specially at the first
Clocks dear
Yes
I was out to Aunt Hannahs today
She was fussing with her clockthe one that strikes half an hour aheadand I saw all those quantities of wheels little and big that have to go just so with all the little cogs fitting into all the other little cogs just exactly right
Well thats like marriage
See
Theres such a lot of little cogs in everyday life that have to be fitted so theyll run smoothlythat have to be adjusted specially at the first
Oh Billy what an idea
But its so really Bertram
Anyhow I know my cogs were always getting out of place at the first laughed Billy
And I was like Aunt Hannahs clock too always going off half an hour ahead of time
And maybe I shall be so again sometimes
But Bertramher voice shook a littleif youll just look at my face youll see that I tell the right time there just as Aunt Hannahs clock does
Im sure always Ill tell the right time there even if I do go off half an hour ahead
As if I didnt know that answered Bertram very low and tenderly
Besides I reckon I have some cogs of my own that need adjusting
