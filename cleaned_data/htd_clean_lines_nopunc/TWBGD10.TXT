Alberts Uncles Grandmother or The LongLost CHAPTER 1 THE JUNGLE Children are like jam all very well in the proper place but you cant stand them all over the shopeh what
These were the dreadful words of our Indian uncle
They made us feel very young and angry and yet we could not be comforted by calling him names to ourselves as you do when nasty grownups say nasty things because he is not nasty but quite the exact opposite when not irritated
And we could not think it ungentlemanly of him to say we were like jam because as Alice says jam is very nice indeedonly not on furniture and improper places like that
My father said Perhaps they had better go to boardingschool
And that was awful because we know Father disapproves of boardingschools
And he looked at us and said I am ashamed of them sir
Your lot is indeed a dark and terrible one when your father is ashamed of you
And we all knew this so that we felt in our chests just as if we had swallowed a hardboiled egg whole
At least this is what Oswald felt and Father said once that Oswald as the eldest was the representative of the family so of course the others felt the same
And then everybody said nothing for a short time
At last Father said You may gobut remember The words that followed I am not going to tell you
It is no use telling you what you know beforeas they do in schools
And you must all have had such words said to you many times
We went away when it was over
The girls cried and we boys got out books and began to read so that nobody should think we cared
But we felt it deeply in our interior hearts especially Oswald who is the eldest and the representative of the family
We felt it all the more because we had not really meant to do anything wrong
We only thought perhaps the grownups would not be quite pleased if they knew and that is quite different
Besides we meant to put all the things back in their proper places when we had done with them before anyone found out about it
But I must not anticipate that means telling the end of the story before the beginning
I tell you this because it is so sickening to have words you dont know in a story and to be told to look it up in the dicker
We are the BastablesOswald Dora Dicky Alice Noel and H O
If you want to know why we call our youngest brother H O you can jolly well read The Treasure Seekers and find out
We were the Treasure Seekers and we sought it high and low and quite regularly because we particularly wanted to find it
And at last we did not find it but we were found by a good kind Indian uncle who helped Father with his business so that Father was able to take us all to live in a jolly big red house on Blackheath instead of in the Lewisham Road where we lived when we were only poor but honest Treasure Seekers
When we were poor but honest we always used to think that if only Father had plenty of business and we did not have to go short of pocket money and wear shabby clothes I dont mind this myself but the girls do we should be happy and very very good
And when we were taken to the beautiful big Blackheath house we thought now all would be well because it was a house with vineries and pineries and gas and water and shrubberies and stabling and replete with every modern convenience like it says in Dyer  Hiltons list of Eligible House Property
I read all about it and I have copied the words quite right
It is a beautiful house all the furniture solid and strong no casters off the chairs and the tables not scratched and the silver not dented and lots of servants and the most decent meals every dayand lots of pocketmoney
But it is wonderful how soon you get used to things even the things you want most
Our watches for instance
We wanted them frightfully but when I had mine a week or two after the mainspring got broken and was repaired at Bennetts in the village I hardly cared to look at the works at all and it did not make me feel happy in my heart any more though of course I should have been very unhappy if it had been taken away from me
And the same with new clothes and nice dinners and having enough of everything
You soon get used to it all and it does not make you extra happy although if you had it all taken away you would be very dejected
That is a good word and one I have never used before
You get used to everything as I said and then you want something more
Father says this is what people mean by the deceitfulness of riches but Alberts uncle says it is the spirit of progress and Mrs Leslie said some people called it divine discontent
Oswald asked them all what they thought one Sunday at dinner
Uncle said it was rot and what we wanted was bread and water and a licking but he meant it for a joke
This was in the Easter holidays
We went to live at the Red House at Christmas
After the holidays the girls went to the Blackheath High School and we boys went to the Prop
that means the Proprietary School
And we had to swot rather during term but about Easter we knew the deceitfulness of riches in the vac when there was nothing much on like pantomimes and things
Then there was the summer term and we swotted more than ever and it was boiling hot and masters tempers got short and sharp and the girls used to wish the exams came in cold weather
I cant think why they dont
But I suppose schools dont think of sensible thinks like that
They teach botany at girls schools
Then the Midsummer holidays came and we breathed againbut only for a few days
We began to feel as if we had forgotten something and did not know what it was
We wanted something to happenonly we didnt exactly know what
So we were very pleased when Father said Ive asked Mr Foulkes to send his children here for a week or two
You knowthe kids who came at Christmas
You must be jolly to them and see that they have a good time dont you know
We remembered them right enoughthey were little pinky frightened things like white mice with very bright eyes
They had not been to our house since Christmas because Denis the boy had been ill and they had been with an aunt at Ramsgate
Alice and Dora would have liked to get the bedrooms ready for the honoured guests but a really good housemaid is sometimes more ready to say Dont than even a general
So the girls had to chuck it
Jane only let them put flowers in the pots on the visitors mantelpieces and then they had to ask the gardener which kind they might pick because nothing worth gathering happened to be growing in our own gardens just then
Their train got in at 1227
We all went to meet them
Afterwards I thought that was a mistake because their aunt was with them and she wore black with beady things and a tight bonnet and she said when we took our hats off Who are you
quite crossly
We said We are the Bastables weve come to meet Daisy and Denny
The aunt is a very rude lady and it made us sorry for Daisy and Denny when she said to them Are these the children
Do you remember them
We werent very tidy perhaps because wed been playing brigands in the shrubbery and we knew we should have to wash for dinner as soon as we got back anyhow
But still Denny said he thought he remembered us
But Daisy said Of course they are and then looked as if she was going to cry
So then the aunt called a cab and told the man where to drive and put Daisy and Denny in and then she said You two little girls may go too if you like but you little boys must walk
So the cab went off and we were left
The aunt turned to us to say a few last words
We knew it would have been about brushing your hair and wearing gloves so Oswald said Goodbye and turned haughtily away before she could begin and so did the others
No one but that kind of black beady tight lady would say little boys
She is like Miss Murdstone in David Copperfield
I should like to tell her so but she would not understand
I dont suppose she has ever read anything but Markhams History and Mangnalls Questionsimproving books like that
When we got home we found all four of those who had ridden in the cab sitting in our sittingroomwe dont call it nursery nowlooking very thoroughly washed and our girls were asking polite questions and the others were saying Yes and No and I dont know
We boys did not say anything
We stood at the window and looked out till the gong went for our dinner
We felt it was going to be awfuland it was
The newcomers would never have done for knighterrants or to carry the Cardinals sealed message through the heart of France on a horse they would never have thought of anything to say to throw the enemy off the scent when they got into a tight place
They said Yes please and No thank you and they ate very neatly and always wiped their mouths before they drank as well as after and never spoke with them full
And after dinner it got worse and worse
We got out all our books and they said Thank you and didnt look at them properly
And we got out all our toys and they said Thank you its very nice to everything
And it got less and less pleasant and towards teatime it came to nobody saying anything except Noel and H
Oand they talked to each other about cricket
After tea Father came in and he played Letters with them and the girls and it was a little better but while late dinner was going onI shall never forget it
Oswald felt like the hero of a bookalmost at the end of his resources
I dont think I was ever glad of bedtime before but that time I was
When they had gone to bed Daisy had to have all her strings and buttons undone for her Dora told me though she is nearly ten and Denny said he couldnt sleep without the gas being left a little bit on we held a council in the girls room
We all sat on the bedit is a mahogany fourposter with green curtains very good for tents only the housekeeper doesnt allow it and Oswald said This is jolly nice isnt it
Theyll be better tomorrow Alice said theyre only shy
Dicky said shy was all very well but you neednt behave like a perfect idiot
Theyre frightened
You see were all strange to them Dora said
Were not wild beasts or Indians we shant eat them
What have they got to be frightened of
Dicky said this
Noel told us he thought they were an enchanted prince and princess whod been turned into white rabbits and their bodies had got changed back but not their insides
But Oswald told him to dry up
Its no use making things up about them he said
The thing is what are we going to DO
We cant have our holidays spoiled by these snivelling kids
No Alice said but they cant possibly go on snivelling for ever
Perhaps theyve got into the habit of it with that Murdstone aunt
Shes enough to make anyone snivel
All the same said Oswald we jolly well arent going to have another day like today
We must do something to rouse them from their snivelling lethwhats its namesomething sudden andwhat is itdecisive
A booby trap said H O the first thing when they get up and an applepie bed at night
But Dora would not hear of it and I own she was right
Suppose she said we could get up a good play like we did when we were Treasure Seekers
We said well what
But she did not say
It ought to be a good long thingto last all day Dicky said and if they like they can play and if they dont If they dont Ill read to them Alice said
But we all said No you dontif you begin that way youll have to go on
And Dicky added I wasnt going to say that at all
I was going to say if they didnt like it they could jolly well do the other thing
We all agreed that we must think of something but we none of us could and at last the council broke up in confusion because Mrs Blakeshe is the housekeepercame up and turned off the gas
But next morning when we were having breakfast and the two strangers were sitting there so pink and clean Oswald suddenly said I know well have a jungle in the garden
And the others agreed and we talked about it till brek was over
The little strangers only said I dont know whenever we said anything to them
After brekker Oswald beckoned his brothers and sisters mysteriously apart and said Do you agree to let me be captain today because I thought of it
And they said they would
Then he said Well play Jungle Book and I shall be Mowgli
The rest of you can be what you likeMowglis father and mother or any of the beasts
I dont suppose they know the book said Noel
They dont look as if they read anything except at lesson times
Then they can go on being beasts all the time Oswald said
Anyone can be a beast
So it was settled
And now OswaldAlberts uncle has sometimes said he is clever at arranging thingsbegan to lay his plans for the jungle
The day was indeed well chosen
Our Indian uncle was away Father was away Mrs Blake was going away and the housemaid had an afternoon off
Oswalds first conscious act was to get rid of the white miceI mean the little good visitors
He explained to them that there would be a play in the afternoon and they could be what they liked and gave them the Jungle Book to read the stories he told them toall the ones about Mowgli
He led the strangers to a secluded spot among the seakale pots in the kitchen garden and left them
Then he went back to the others and we had a jolly morning under the cedar talking about what we would do when Blakie was gone
She went just after our dinner
When we asked Denny what he would like to be in the play it turned out he had not read the stories Oswald told him at all but only the White Seal and Rikki Tikki
We then agreed to make the jungle first and dress up for our parts afterwards
Oswald was a little uncomfortable about leaving the strangers alone all the morning so he said Denny should be his aidedecamp and he was really quite useful
He is rather handy with his fingers and things that he does up do not come untied
Daisy might have come too but she wanted to go on reading so we let her which is the truest manners to a visitor
Of course the shrubbery was to be the jungle and the lawn under the cedar a forest glade and then we began to collect the things
The cedar lawn is just nicely out of the way of the windows
It was a jolly hot daythe kind of day when the sunshine is white and the shadows are dark grey not black like they are in the evening
We all thought of different things
Of course first we dressed up pillows in the skins of beasts and set them about on the grass to look as natural as we could
And then we got Pincher and rubbed him all over with powdered slatepencil to make him the right colour for Grey Brother
But he shook it all off and it had taken an awful time to do
Then Alice said Oh I know
and she ran off to Fathers dressingroom and came back with the tube of creme damande pour la barbe et les mains and we squeezed it on Pincher and rubbed it in and then the slatepencil stuff stuck all right and he rolled in the dustbin of his own accord which made him just the right colour
He is a very clever dog but soon after he went off and we did not find him till quite late in the afternoon
Denny helped with Pincher and with the wildbeast skins and when Pincher was finished he said Please may I make some paper birds to put in the trees
I know how
And of course we said Yes and he only had red ink and newspapers and quickly he made quite a lot of large paper birds with red tails
They didnt look half bad on the edge of the shrubbery
While he was doing this he suddenly said or rather screamed Oh
And we looked and it was a creature with great horns and a fur rugsomething like a bull and something like a minotaurand I dont wonder Denny was frightened
It was Alice and it was firstclass
Up to now all was not yet lost beyond recall
It was the stuffed fox that did the mischiefand I am sorry to own it was Oswald who thought of it
He is not ashamed of having THOUGHT of it
That was rather clever of him
But he knows now that it is better not to take other peoples foxes and things without asking even if you live in the same house with them
It was Oswald who undid the back of the glass case in the hall and got out the fox with the green and grey duck in its mouth and when the others saw how awfully like life they looked on the lawn they all rushed off to fetch the other stuffed things
Uncle has a tremendous lot of stuffed things
He shot most of them himselfbut not the fox of course
There was another foxs mask too and we hung that in a bush to look as if the fox was peeping out
And the stuffed birds we fastened on to the trees with string
The duckbillwhats its namelooked very well sitting on his tail with the otter snarling at him
Then Dicky had an idea and though not nearly so much was said about it afterwards as there was about the stuffed things I think myself it was just as bad though it was a good idea too
He just got the hose and put the end over a branch of the cedartree
Then we got the steps they clean windows with and let the hose rest on the top of the steps and run
It was to be a waterfall but it ran between the steps and was only wet and messy so we got Fathers mackintosh and uncles and covered the steps with them so that the water ran down all right and was glorious and it ran away in a stream across the grass where we had dug a little channel for itand the otter and the duckbillthing were as if in their native haunts
I hope all this is not very dull to read about
I know it was jolly good fun to do
Taking one thing with another I dont know that we ever had a better time while it lasted
We got all the rabbits out of the hutches and put pink paper tails on to them and hunted them with horns made out of The Times
They got away somehow and before they were caught next day they had eaten a good many lettuces and other things
Oswald is very sorry for this
He rather likes the gardener
Denny wanted to put paper tails on the guineapigs and it was no use our telling him there was nothing to tie the paper on to
He thought we were kidding until we showed him and then he said Well never mind and got the girls to give him bits of the blue stuff left over from their dressinggowns
Ill make them sashes to tie round their little middles he said
And he did and the bows stuck up on the tops of their backs
One of the guineapigs was never seen again and the same with the tortoise when we had done his shell with vermilion paint
He crawled away and returned no more
Perhaps someone collected him and thought he was an expensive kind unknown in these cold latitudes
The lawn under the cedar was transformed into a dream of beauty what with the stuffed creatures and the papertailed things and the waterfall
And Alice said I wish the tigers did not look so flat
For of course with pillows you can only pretend it is a sleeping tiger getting ready to make a spring out at you
It is difficult to prop up tigerskins in a lifelike manner when there are no bones inside them only pillows and sofa cushions
What about the beerstands
I said
And we got two out of the cellar
With bolsters and string we fastened insides to the tigersand they were really fine
The legs of the beerstands did for tigers legs
It was indeed the finishing touch
Then we boys put on just our bathing drawers and vestsso as to be able to play with the waterfall without hurting our clothes
I think this was thoughtful
The girls only tucked up their frocks and took their shoes and stockings off
H O painted his legs and his hands with Condys fluidto make him brown so that he might be Mowgli although Oswald was captain and had plainly said he was going to be Mowgli himself
Of course the others werent going to stand that
So Oswald said Very well
Nobody asked you to brown yourself like that
But now youve done it youve simply got to go and be a beaver and live in the dam under the waterfall till it washes off
He said he didnt want to be beavers
And Noel said Dont make him
Let him be the bronze statue in the palace gardens that the fountain plays out of
So we let him have the hose and hold it up over his head
It made a lovely fountain only he remained brown
So then Dicky and Oswald and I did ourselves brown too and dried H O as well as we could with our handkerchiefs because he was just beginning to snivel
The brown did not come off any of us for days
Oswald was to be Mowgli and we were just beginning to arrange the different parts
The rest of the hose that was on the ground was Kaa the Rock Python and Pincher was Grey Brother only we couldnt find him
And while most of us were talking Dicky and Noel got messing about with the beerstand tigers
And then a really sad event instantly occurred which was not really our fault and we did not mean to
That Daisy girl had been mooning indoors all the afternoon with the Jungle Books and now she came suddenly out just as Dicky and Noel had got under the tigers and were shoving them along to fright each other
Of course this is not in the Mowgli book at all but they did look jolly like real tigers and I am very far from wishing to blame the girl though she little knew what would be the awful consequence of her rash act
But for her we might have got out of it all much better than we did
What happened was truly horrid
As soon as Daisy saw the tigers she stopped short and uttering a shriek like a railway whistle she fell flat on the ground
Fear not gentle Indian maid Oswald cried thinking with surprise that perhaps after all she did know how to play I myself will protect thee
And he sprang forward with the native bow and arrows out of uncles study
The gentle Indian maiden did not move
Come hither Dora said let us take refuge in yonder covert while this good knight does battle for us
Dora might have remembered that we were savages but she did not
And that is Dora all over
And still the Daisy girl did not move
Then we were truly frightened
Dora and Alice lifted her up and her mouth was a horrid violetcolour and her eyes half shut
She looked horrid
Not at all like fair fainting damsels who are always of an interesting pallor
She was green like a cheap oyster on a stall
We did what we could a prey to alarm as we were
We rubbed her hands and let the hose play gently but perseveringly on her unconscious brow
The girls loosened her dress though it was only the kind that comes down straight without a waist
And we were all doing what we could as hard as we could when we heard the click of the front gate
There was no mistake about it
I hope whoever it is will go straight to the front door said Alice
But whoever it was did not
There were feet on the gravel and there was the uncles voice saying in his hearty manner This way
This way
On such a day as this we shall find our young barbarians all at play somewhere about the grounds
And then without further warning the uncle three other gentlemen and two ladies burst upon the scene
We had no clothes on to speak ofI mean us boys
We were all wet through
Daisy was in a faint or a fit or dead none of us then knew which
And all the stuffed animals were there staring the uncle in the face
Most of them had got a sprinkling and the otter and the duckbill brute were simply soaked
And three of us were dark brown
Concealment as so often happens was impossible
The quick brain of Oswald saw in a flash exactly how it would strike the uncle and his brave young blood ran cold in his veins
His heart stood still
Whats all thiseh what
said the tones of the wronged uncle
Oswald spoke up and said it was jungles we were playing and he didnt know what was up with Daisy
He explained as well as anyone could but words were now in vain
The uncle had a Malacca cane in his hand and we were but ill prepared to meet the sudden attack
Oswald and H O caught it worst
The other boys were under the tigersand of course my uncle would not strike a girl
Denny was a visitor and so got off
But it was bread and water for us for the next three days and our own rooms
I will not tell you how we sought to vary the monotonousness of imprisonment
Oswald thought of taming a mouse but he could not find one
The reason of the wretched captives might have given way but for the gutter that you can crawl along from our room to the girls
But I will not dwell on this because you might try it yourselves and it really is dangerous
When my father came home we got the talking to and we said we were sorryand we really wereespecially about Daisy though she had behaved with muffishness and then it was settled that we were to go into the country and stay till we had grown into better children
Alberts uncle was writing a book in the country we were to go to his house
We were glad of thisDaisy and Denny too
This we bore nobly
We knew we had deserved it
We were all very sorry for everything and we resolved that for the future we WOULD be good
I am not sure whether we kept this resolution or not
Oswald thinks now that perhaps we made a mistake in trying so very hard to be good all at once
You should do everything by degrees
PSIt turned out Daisy was not really dead at all
It was only faintingso like a girl
NBPincher was found on the drawingroom sofa
AppendixI have not told you half the things we did for the junglefor instance about the elephants tusks and the horsehair sofacushions and uncles fishingboots
CHAPTER 2 THE WOULDBEGOODS When we were sent down into the country to learn to be good we felt it was rather good business because we knew our being sent there was really only to get us out of the way for a little while and we knew right enough that it wasnt a punishment though Mrs Blake said it was because we had been punished thoroughly for taking the stuffed animals out and making a jungle on the lawn with them and the garden hose
And you cannot be punished twice for the same offence
This is the English law at least I think so
And at any rate no one would punish you three times and we had had the Malacca cane and the solitary confinement and the uncle had kindly explained to us that all illfeeling between him and us was wiped out entirely by the bread and water we had endured
And what with the bread and water and being prisoners and not being able to tame any mice in our prisons I quite feel that we had suffered it up thoroughly and now we could start fair
I think myself that descriptions of places are generally dull but I have sometimes thought that was because the authors do not tell you what you truly want to know
However dull or not here goesbecause you wont understand anything unless I tell you what the place was like
The Moat House was the one we went to stay at
There has been a house there since Saxon times
It is a manor and a manor goes on having a house on it whatever happens
The Moat House was burnt down once or twice in ancient centuriesI dont remember whichbut they always built a new one and Cromwells soldiers smashed it about but it was patched up again
It is a very odd house the front door opens straight into the diningroom and there are red curtains and a blackandwhite marble floor like a chessboard and there is a secret staircase only it is not secret nowonly rather rickety
It is not very big but there is a watery moat all round it with a brick bridge that leads to the front door
Then on the other side of the moat there is the farm with barns and oast houses and stables or things like that
And the other way the garden lawn goes on till it comes to the churchyard
The churchyard is not divided from the garden at all except by a little grass bank
In the front of the house there is more garden and the big fruit garden is at the back
The man the house belongs to likes new houses so he built a big one with conservatories and a stable with a clock in a turret on the top and he left the Moat House
And Alberts uncle took it and my father was to come down sometimes from Saturday to Monday and Alberts uncle was to live with us all the time and he would be writing a book and we were not to bother him but he would give an eye to us
I hope all this is plain
I have said it as short as I can
We got down rather late but there was still light enough to see the big bell hanging at the top of the house
The rope belonging to it went right down the house through our bedroom to the diningroom
H O saw the rope and pulled it while he was washing his hands for supper and Dicky and I let him and the bell tolled solemnly
Father shouted to him not to and we went down to supper
But presently there were many feet trampling on the gravel and Father went out to see
When he came back he said The whole village or half of it has come up to see why the bell rang
Its only rung for fire or burglars
Why cant you kids let things alone
Alberts uncle said Bed follows supper as the fruit follows the flower
Theyll do no more mischief tonight sir
Tomorrow I will point out a few of the things to be avoided in this bucolic retreat
So it was bed directly after supper and that was why we did not see much that night
But in the morning we were all up rather early and we seemed to have awakened in a new world rich in surprises beyond the dreams of anybody as it says in the quotation
We went everywhere we could in the time but when it was breakfasttime we felt we had not seen half or a quarter
The room we had breakfast in was exactly like in a storyblack oak panels and china in corner cupboards with glass doors
These doors were locked
There were green curtains and honeycomb for breakfast
After brekker my father went back to town and Alberts uncle went too to see publishers
We saw them to the station and Father gave us a long list of what we werent to do
It began with Dont pull ropes unless youre quite sure what will happen at the other end and it finished with For goodness sake try to keep out of mischief till I come down on Saturday
There were lots of other things in between
We all promised we would
And we saw them off and waved till the train was quite out of sight
Then we started to walk home
Daisy was tired so Oswald carried her home on his back
When we got home she said I do like you Oswald
She is not a bad little kid and Oswald felt it was his duty to be nice to her because she was a visitor
Then we looked all over everything
It was a glorious place
You did not know where to begin
We were all a little tired before we found the hayloft but we pulled ourselves together to make a fort with the trusses of haygreat square thingsand we were having a jolly good time all of us when suddenly a trapdoor opened and a head bobbed up with a straw in its mouth
We knew nothing about the country then and the head really did scare us rather though of course we found out directly that the feet belonging to it were standing on the bar of the loosebox underneath
The head said Dont you let the governor catch you aspoiling of that there hay thats all
And it spoke thickly because of the straw
It is strange to think how ignorant you were in the past
We can hardly believe now that once we really did not know that it spoiled hay to mess about with it
Horses dont like to eat it afterwards
Always remember this
When the head had explained a little more it went away and we turned the handle of the chaffcutting machine and nobody got hurt though the head HAD said we should cut our fingers off if we touched it
And then we sat down on the floor which is dirty with the nice clean dirt that is more than half chopped hay and those there was room for hung their legs down out of the top door and we looked down at the farmyard which is very slushy when you get down into it but most interesting
Then Alice said Now were all here and the boys are tired enough to sit still for a minute I want to have a council
We said what about
And she said Ill tell you
H O dont wriggle so sit on my frock if the straws tickle your legs
You see he wears socks and so he can never be quite as comfortable as anyone else
Promise not to laugh Alice said getting very red and looking at Dora who got red too
We did and then she said Dora and I have talked this over and Daisy too and we have written it down because it is easier than saying it
Shall I read it
or will you Dora
Dora said it didnt matter Alice might
So Alice read it and though she gabbled a bit we all heard it
I copied it afterwards
This is what she read NEW SOCIETY FOR BEING GOOD IN I Dora Bastable and Alice Bastable my sister being of sound mind and body when we were shut up with bread and water on that jungle day we thought a great deal about our naughty sins and we made our minds up to be good for ever after
And we talked to Daisy about it and she had an idea
So we want to start a society for being good in
It is Daisys idea but we think so too
You know Dora interrupted when people want to do good things they always make a society
There are thousandstheres the Missionary Society
Yes Alice said and the Society for the Prevention of something or other and the Young Mens Mutual Improvement Society and the SPG
Whats SPG
Oswald asked
Society for the Propagation of the Jews of course said Noel who cannot always spell
No it isnt but do let me go on
Alice did go on
We propose to get up a society with a chairman and a treasurer and secretary and keep a journalbook saying what weve done
If that doesnt make us good it wont be my fault
The aim of the society is nobleness and goodness and great and unselfish deeds
We wish not to be such a nuisance to grownup people and to perform prodigies of real goodness
We wish to spread our wingshere Alice read very fast
She told me afterwards Daisy had helped her with that part and she thought when she came to the wings they sounded rather sillyto spread our wings and rise above the kind of interesting things that you ought not to do but to do kindnesses to all however low and mean
Denny was listening carefully
Now he nodded three or four times
Little words of kindness he said Little deeds of love Make this earth an eagle Like the one above
This did not sound right but we let it pass because an eagle does have wings and we wanted to hear the rest of what the girls had written
But there was no rest
Thats all said Alice and Daisy said Dont you think its a good idea
That depends Oswald answered who is president and what you mean by being good
Oswald did not care very much for the idea himself because being good is not the sort of thing he thinks it is proper to talk about especially before strangers
But the girls and Denny seemed to like it so Oswald did not say exactly what he thought especially as it was Daisys idea
This was true politeness
I think it would be nice Noel said if we made it a sort of play
Lets do the Pilgrims Progress
We talked about that for some time but it did not come to anything because we all wanted to be Mr Greatheart except H O who wanted to be the lions and you could not have lions in a Society for Goodness
Dicky said he did not wish to play if it meant reading books about children who die he really felt just as Oswald did about it he told me afterwards
But the girls were looking as if they were in Sunday school and we did not wish to be unkind
At last Oswald said Well lets draw up the rules of the society and choose the president and settle the name
Dora said Oswald should be president and he modestly consented
She was secretary and Denny treasurer if we ever had any money
Making the rules took us all the afternoon
They were these RULES 1
Every member is to be as good as possible
2
There is to be no more jaw than necessary about being good
Oswald and Dicky put that rule in
3
No day must pass without our doing some kind action to a suffering fellowcreature
4
We are to meet every day or as often as we like
5
We are to do good to people we dont like as often as we can
6
No one is to leave the Society without the consent of all the rest of us
7
The Society is to be kept a profound secret from all the world except us
8
The name of our Society is And when we got as far as that we all began to talk at once
Dora wanted it called the Society for Humane Improvement Denny said the Society for Reformed Outcast Children but Dicky said No we really were not so bad as all that
Then H O said Call it the Good Society
Or the Society for Being Good In said Daisy
Or the Society of Goods said Noel
Thats priggish said Oswald besides we dont know whether we shall be so very
You see Alice explained we only said if we COULD we would be good
Well then Dicky said getting up and beginning to dust the chopped hay off himself call it the Society of the Wouldbegoods and have done with it
Oswald thinks Dicky was getting sick of it and wanted to make himself a little disagreeable
If so he was doomed to disappointment
For everyone else clapped hands and called out Thats the very thing
Then the girls went off to write out the rules and took H O with them and Noel went to write some poetry to put in the minute book
Thats what you call the book that a societys secretary writes what it does in
Denny went with him to help
He knows a lot of poetry
I think he went to a ladys school where they taught nothing but that
He was rather shy of us but he took to Noel
I cant think why
Dicky and Oswald walked round the garden and told each other what they thought of the new society
Im not sure we oughtnt to have put our foot down at the beginning Dicky said
I dont see much in it anyhow
It pleases the girls Oswald said for he is a kind brother
But were not going to stand jaw and words in season and loving sisterly warnings
I tell you what it is Oswald well have to run this thing our way or itll be jolly beastly for everybody
Oswald saw this plainly
We must do something Dicky said its very very hard though
Still there must be SOME interesting things that are not wrong
I suppose so Oswald said but being good is so much like being a muff generally
Anyhow Im not going to smooth the pillows of the sick or read to the aged poor or any rot out of Ministering Children
No more am I Dicky said
He was chewing a straw like the head had in its mouth but I suppose we must play the game fair
Lets begin by looking out for something useful to dosomething like mending things or cleaning them not just showing off
The boys in books chop kindling wood and save their pennies to buy tea and tracts
Little beasts
said Dick
I say lets talk about something else
And Oswald was glad to for he was beginning to feel jolly uncomfortable
We were all rather quiet at tea and afterwards Oswald played draughts with Daisy and the others yawned
I dont know when weve had such a gloomy evening
And everyone was horribly polite and said Please and Thank you far more than requisite
Alberts uncle came home after tea
He was jolly and told us stories but he noticed us being a little dull and asked what blight had fallen on our young lives
Oswald could have answered and said It is the Society of the Wouldbegoods that is the blight but of course he didnt and Alberts uncle said no more but he went up and kissed the girls when they were in bed and asked them if there was anything wrong
And they told him no on their honour
The next morning Oswald awoke early
The refreshing beams of the morning sun shone on his narrow white bed and on the sleeping forms of his dear little brothers and Denny who had got the pillow on top of his head and was snoring like a kettle when it sings
Oswald could not remember at first what was the matter with him and then he remembered the Wouldbegoods and wished he hadnt
He felt at first as if there was nothing you could do and even hesitated to buzz a pillow at Dennys head
But he soon saw that this could not be
So he chucked his boot and caught Denny right in the waistcoat part and thus the day began more brightly than he had expected
Oswald had not done anything out of the way good the night before except that when no one was looking he polished the brass candlestick in the girls bedroom with one of his socks
And he might just as well have let it alone for the servants cleaned it again with the other things in the morning and he could never find the sock afterwards
There were two servants
One of them had to be called Mrs Pettigrew instead of Jane and Eliza like others
She was cook and managed things
After breakfast Alberts uncle said I now seek the retirement of my study
At your peril violate my privacy before 130 sharp
Nothing short of bloodshed will warrant the intrusion and nothing short of manor rather boyslaughter shall avenge it
So we knew he wanted to be quiet and the girls decided that we ought to play out of doors so as not to disturb him we should have played out of doors anyhow on a jolly fine day like that
But as we were going out Dicky said to Oswald I say come along here a minute will you
So Oswald came along and Dicky took him into the other parlour and shut the door and Oswald said Well spit it out what is it
He knows that is vulgar and he would not have said it to anyone but his own brother
Dicky said Its a pretty fair nuisance
I told you how it would be
And Oswald was patient with him and said What is
Dont be all day about it
Dicky fidgeted about a bit and then he said Well I did as I said
I looked about for something useful to do
And you know that dairy window that wouldnt openonly a little bit like that
Well I mended the catch with wire and whip cord and it opened wide
And I suppose they didnt want it mended said Oswald
He knew but too well that grownup people sometimes like to keep things far different from what we would and you catch it if you try to do otherwise
I shouldnt have minded THAT Dicky said because I could easily have taken it all off again if theyd only said so
But the sillies went and propped up a milkpan against the window
They never took the trouble to notice I had mended it
So the wretched thing pushed the window open all by itself directly they propped it up and it tumbled through into the moat and they are most awfully waxy
All the men are out in the fields and they havent any spare milkpans
If I were a farmer I must say I wouldnt stick at an extra milkpan or two
Accidents must happen sometimes
I call it mean
Dicky spoke in savage tones
But Oswald was not so unhappy first because it wasnt his fault and next because he is a farseeing boy
Never mind he said kindly
Keep your tail up
Well get the beastly milkpan out all right
Come on
He rushed hastily to the garden and gave a low signifying whistle which the others know well enough to mean something extra being up
And when they were all gathered round him he spoke
Fellow countrymen he said were going to have a rousing good time
Its nothing naughty is it Daisy asked like the last time you had that was rousingly good
Alice said Shish and Oswald pretended not to hear
A precious treasure he said has inadvertently been laid low in the moat by one of us
The rotten thing tumbled in by itself Dicky said
Oswald waved his hand and said Anyhow its there
Its our duty to restore it to its sorrowing owners
I say look herewere going to drag the moat
Everyone brightened up at this
It was our duty and it was interesting too
This is very uncommon
So we went out to where the orchard is at the other side of the moat
There were gooseberries and things on the bushes but we did not take any till we had asked if we might
Alice went and asked
Mrs Pettigrew said Law
I suppose so youd eat em anyhow leave or no leave
She little knows the honourable nature of the house of Bastable
But she has much to learn
The orchard slopes gently down to the dark waters of the moat
We sat there in the sun and talked about dragging the moat till Denny said How DO you drag moats
And we were speechless because though we had read many times about a moat being dragged for missing heirs and lost wills we really had never thought about exactly how it was done
Grapplingirons are right I believe Denny said but I dont suppose theyd have any at the farm
And we asked and found they had never even heard of them
I think myself he meant some other word but he was quite positive
So then we got a sheet off Oswalds bed and we all took our shoes and stockings off and we tried to see if the sheet would drag the bottom of the moat which is shallow at that end
But it would keep floating on the top of the water and when we tried sewing stones into one end of it it stuck on something in the bottom and when we got it up it was torn
We were very sorry and the sheet was in an awful mess but the girls said they were sure they could wash it in the basin in their room and we thought as we had torn it anyway we might as well go on
That washing never came off
No human being Noel said knows half the treasures hidden in this dark tarn
And we decided we would drag a bit more at that end and work gradually round to under the dairy window where the milkpan was
We could not see that part very well because of the bushes that grow between the cracks of the stones where the house goes down into the moat
And opposite the dairy window the barn goes straight down into the moat too
It is like pictures of Venice but you cannot get opposite the dairy window anyhow
We got the sheet down again when we had tied the torn parts together in a bunch with string and Oswald was just saying Now then my hearties pull together pull with a will
One two three when suddenly Dora dropped her bit of the sheet with a piercing shriek and cried out Oh
its all wormy at the bottom
I felt them wriggle
And she was out of the water almost before the words were out of her mouth
The other girls all scuttled out too and they let the sheet go in such a hurry that we had no time to steady ourselves and one of us went right in and the rest got wet up to our waistbands
The one who went right in was only H O but Dora made an awful fuss and said it was our fault
We told her what we thought and it ended in the girls going in with H O to change his things
We had some more gooseberries while they were gone
Dora was in an awful wax when she went away but she is not of a sullen disposition though sometimes hasty and when they all came back we saw it was all right so we said What shall we do now
Alice said I dont think we need drag any more
It is wormy
I felt it when Dora did
And besides the milkpan is sticking a bit of itself out of the water
I saw it through the dairy window
Couldnt we get it up with fishhooks
Noel said
But Alice explained that the dairy was now locked up and the key taken out
So then Oswald said Look here well make a raft
We should have to do it some time and we might as well do it now
I saw an old door in that corner stable that they dont use
You know
The one where they chop the wood
We got the door
We had never made a raft any of us but the way to make rafts is better described in books so we knew what to do
We found some nice little tubs stuck up on the fence of the farm garden and nobody seemed to want them for anything just then so we took them
Denny had a box of tools someone had given him for his last birthday they were rather rotten little things but the gimlet worked all right so we managed to make holes in the edges of the tubs and fasten them with string under the four corners of the old door
This took us a long time
Alberts uncle asked us at dinner what we had been playing at and we said it was a secret and it was nothing wrong
You see we wished to atone for Dickys mistake before anything more was said
The house has no windows in the side that faces the orchard
The rays of the afternoon sun were beaming along the orchard grass when at last we launched the raft
She floated out beyond reach with the last shove of the launching
But Oswald waded out and towed her back he is not afraid of worms
Yet if he had known of the other things that were in the bottom of that moat he would have kept his boots on
So would the others especially Dora as you will see
At last the gallant craft rode upon the waves
We manned her though not up to our full strength because if more than four got on the water came up too near our knees and we feared she might founder if overmanned
Daisy and Denny did not want to go on the raft white mice that they were so that was all right
And as H O had been wet through once he was not very keen
Alice promised Noel her best paintbrush if hed give up and not go because we knew well that the voyage was fraught with deep dangers though the exact danger that lay in wait for us under the dairy window we never even thought of
So we four elder ones got on the raft very carefully and even then every time we moved the water swished up over the raft and hid our feet
But I must say it was a jolly decent raft
Dicky was captain because it was his adventure
We had hoppoles from the hopgarden beyond the orchard to punt with
We made the girls stand together in the middle and hold on to each other to keep steady
Then we christened our gallant vessel
We called it the Richard after Dicky and also after the splendid admiral who used to eat wineglasses and died after the Battle of the Revenge in Tennysons poetry
Then those on shore waved a fond adieu as well as they could with the dampness of their handkerchiefs which we had had to use to dry our legs and feet when we put on our stockings for dinner and slowly and stately the good ship moved away from shore riding on the waves as though they were her native element
We kept her going with the hoppoles and we kept her steady in the same way but we could not always keep her steady enough and we could not always keep her in the winds eye
That is to say she went where we did not want and once she bumped her corner against the barn wall and all the crew had to sit down suddenly to avoid falling overboard into a watery grave
Of course then the waves swept her decks and when we got up again we said that we should have to change completely before tea
But we pressed on undaunted and at last our saucy craft came into port under the dairy window and there was the milkpan for whose sake we had endured such hardships and privations standing up on its edge quite quietly
The girls did not wait for orders from the captain as they ought to have done but they cried out Oh here it is
and then both reached out to get it
Anyone who has pursued a naval career will see that of course the raft capsized
For a moment it felt like standing on the roof of the house and the next moment the ship stood up on end and shot the whole crew into the dark waters
We boys can swim all right
Oswald has swum three times across the Ladywell Swimming Baths at the shallow end and Dicky is nearly as good but just then we did not think of this though of course if the water had been deep we should have
As soon as Oswald could get the muddy water out of his eyes he opened them on a horrid scene
Dicky was standing up to his shoulders in the inky waters the raft had righted itself and was drifting gently away towards the front of the house where the bridge is and Dora and Alice were rising from the deep with their hair all plastered over their faceslike Venus in the Latin verses
There was a great noise of splashing
And besides that a feminine voice looking out of the dairy window and screaming Lord love the children
It was Mrs Pettigrew
She disappeared at once and we were sorry we were in such a situation that she would be able to get at Alberts uncle before we could
Afterwards we were not so sorry
Before a word could be spoken about our desperate position Dora staggered a little in the water and suddenly shrieked Oh my foot
oh its a shark
I know it isor a crocodile
The others on the bank could hear her shrieking but they could not see us properly they did not know what was happening
Noel told me afterwards he never could care for that paintbrush
Of course we knew it could not be a shark but I thought of pike which are large and very angry always and I caught hold of Dora
She screamed without stopping
I shoved her along to where there was a ledge of brickwork and shoved her up till she could sit on it then she got her foot out of the water still screaming
It was indeed terrible
The thing she thought was a shark came up with her foot and it was a horrid jagged old meattin and she had put her foot right into it
Oswald got it off and directly he did so blood began to pour from the wounds
The tin edges had cut it in several spots
It was very pale blood because her foot was wet of course
She stopped screaming and turned green and I thought she was going to faint like Daisy did on the jungle day
Oswald held her up as well as he could but it really was one of the least agreeable moments in his life
For the raft was gone and she couldnt have waded back anyway and we didnt know how deep the moat might be in other places
But Mrs Pettigrew had not been idle
She is not a bad sort really
Just as Oswald was wondering whether he could swim after the raft and get it back a boats nose shot out from under a dark archway a little further up under the house
It was the boathouse and Alberts uncle had got the punt and took us back in it
When we had regained the dark arch where the boat lives we had to go up the cellar stairs
Dora had to be carried
There was but little said to us that day
We were sent to bedthose who had not been on the raft the same as the others for they owned up all right and Alberts uncle is the soul of justice
Next day but one was Saturday
Father gave us a talking towith other things
The worst was when Dora couldnt get her shoe on so they sent for the doctor and Dora had to lie down for ever so long
It was indeed poor luck
When the doctor had gone Alice said to me It IS hard lines but Doras very jolly about it
Daisys been telling her about how we should all go to her with our little joys and sorrows and things and about the sweet influence from a sick bed that can be felt all over the house like in What Katy Did and Dora said she hoped she might prove a blessing to us all while shes laid up
Oswald said he hoped so but he was not pleased
Because this sort of jaw was exactly the sort of thing he and Dicky didnt want to have happen
The thing we got it hottest for was those little tubs off the garden railings
They turned out to be buttertubs that had been put out there to sweeten
But as Denny said After the mud in that moat not all the perfumes of somewhere or other could make them fit to use for butter again
I own this was rather a bad business
Yet we did not do it to please ourselves but because it was our duty
But that made no difference to our punishment when Father came down
I have known this mistake occur before
CHAPTER 3 BILLS TOMBSTONE There were soldiers riding down the road on horses two and two
That is the horses were two and two and the men not
Because each man was riding one horse and leading another
To exercise them
They came from Chatham Barracks
We all drew up in a line outside the churchyard wall and saluted as they went by though we had not read Toady Lion then
We have since
It is the only decent book I have ever read written by Toady Lions author
The others are mere piffle
But many people like them
In Sir Toady Lion the officer salutes the child
There was only a lieutenant with those soldiers and he did not salute me
He kissed his hand to the girls and a lot of the soldiers behind kissed theirs too
We waved ours back
Next day we made a Union Jack out of pockethandkerchiefs and part of a red flannel petticoat of the White Mouses which she did not want just then and some blue ribbon we got at the village shop
Then we watched for the soldiers and after three days they went by again by twos and twos as before
It was A1
We waved our flag and we shouted
We gave them three cheers
Oswald can shout loudest
So as soon as the first man was level with us not the advance guard but the first of the batteryhe shouted Three cheers for the Queen and the British Army
And then we waved the flag and bellowed
Oswald stood on the wall to bellow better and Denny waved the flag because he was a visitor and so politeness made us let him enjoy the fat of whatever there was going
The soldiers did not cheer that day they only grinned and kissed their hands
The next day we all got up as much like soldiers as we could
H O and Noel had tin swords and we asked Alberts uncle to let us wear some of the real arms that are on the wall in the diningroom
And he said Yes if we would clean them up afterwards
But we jolly well cleaned them up first with Brookes soap and brick dust and vinegar and the knife polish invented by the great and immortal Duke of Wellington in his spare time when he was not conquering Napoleon
Three cheers for our Iron Duke
 and with emery paper and wash leather and whitening
Oswald wore a cavalry sabre in its sheath
Alice and the Mouse had pistols in their belts large old flintlocks with bits of red flannel behind the flints
Denny had a naval cutlass a very beautiful blade and old enough to have been at Trafalgar
I hope it was
The others had French swordbayonets that were used in the FrancoGerman war
They are very bright when you get them bright but the sheaths are hard to polish
Each swordbayonet has the name on the blade of the warrior who once wielded it
I wonder where they are now
Perhaps some of them died in the war
Poor chaps
But it is a very long time ago
I should like to be a soldier
It is better than going to the best schools and to Oxford afterwards even if it is Balliol you go to
Oswald wanted to go to South Africa for a bugler but father would not let him
And it is true that Oswald does not yet know how to bugle though he can play the infantry advance and the charge and the halt on a penny whistle
Alice taught them to him with the piano out of the red book Fathers cousin had when he was in the Fighting Fifth
Oswald cannot play the retire and he would scorn to do so
But I suppose a bugler has to play what he is told no matter how galling to the young boys proud spirit
The next day being thoroughly armed we put on everything red white and blue that we could think of nightshirts are good for white and you dont know what you can do with red socks and blue jerseys till you tryand we waited by the churchyard wall for the soldiers
When the advance guard or whatever you call it of artilleryits that for infantry I know came by we got ready and when the first man of the first battery was level with us Oswald played on his penny whistle the advance and the chargeand then shouted Three cheers for the Queen and the British Army
This time they had the guns with them
And every man of the battery cheered too
It was glorious
It made you tremble all over
The girls said it made them want to crybut no boy would own to this even if it were true
It is babyish to cry
But it was glorious and Oswald felt differently to what he ever did before
Then suddenly the officer in front said Battery
Halt
and all the soldiers pulled their horses up and the great guns stopped too
Then the officer said Sit at ease and something else and the sergeant repeated it and some of the men got off their horses and lit their pipes and some sat down on the grass edge of the road holding their horses bridles
We could see all the arms and accoutrements as plain as plain
Then the officer came up to us
We were all standing on the wall that day except Dora who had to sit because her foot was bad but we let her have the threeedged rapier to wear and the blunderbuss to hold as wellit has a brass mouth and is like in Mr Caldecotts pictures
He was a beautiful man the officer
Like a Viking
Very tall and fair with moustaches very long and bright blue eyes
He said Good morning
So did we
Then he said You seem to be a military lot
We said we wished we were
And patriotic said he
Alice said she should jolly well think so
Then he said he had noticed us there for several days and he had halted the battery because he thought we might like to look at the guns
Alas
there are but too few grownup people so far seeing and thoughtful as this brave and distinguished officer
We said Oh yes and then we got off the wall and that good and noble man showed us the string that moves the detonator and the breechblock when you take it out and carry it away the gun is in vain to the enemy even if he takes it and he let us look down the gun to see the rifling all clean and shinyand he showed us the ammunition boxes but there was nothing in them
He also told us how the gun was unlimbered this means separating the gun from the ammunition carriage and how quick it could be donebut he did not make the men do this then because they were resting
There were six guns
Each had painted on the carriage in white letters 15 Pr which the captain told us meant fifteenpounder
I should have thought the gun weighed more than fifteen pounds Dora said
It would if it was beef but I suppose wood and gun are lighter
And the officer explained to her very kindly and patiently that 15 Pr
meant the gun could throw a SHELL weighing fifteen pounds
When we had told him how jolly it was to see the soldiers go by so often he said You wont see us many more times
Were ordered to the front and we sail on Tuesday week and the guns will be painted mudcolour and the men will wear mudcolour too and so shall I
The men looked very nice though they were not wearing their busbies but only Tommy caps put on all sorts of ways
We were very sorry they were going but Oswald as well as others looked with envy on those who would soon be allowedbeing grown up and no nonsense about your educationto go and fight for their Queen and country
Then suddenly Alice whispered to Oswald and he said All right but tell him yourself
So Alice said to the captain Will you stop next time you pass
He said Im afraid I cant promise that
Alice said You might theres a particular reason
He said What
which was a natural remark not rude as it is with children
Alice said We want to give the soldiers a keepsake and will write to ask my father
He is very well off just now
Look hereif were not on the wall when you come by dont stop but if we are please PLEASE do
The officer pulled his moustache and looked as if he did not know but at last he said Yes and we were very glad though but Alice and Oswald knew the dark but pleasant scheme at present fermenting in their youthful nuts
The captain talked a lot to us
At last Noel said I think you are like Diarmid of the Golden Collar
But I should like to see your sword out and shining in the sun like burnished silver
The captain laughed and grasped the hilt of his good blade
But Oswald said hurriedly Dont
Not yet
We shant ever have a chance like this
If youd only show us the pursuing practice
Alberts uncle knows it but he only does it on an armchair because he hasnt a horse
And that brave and swagger captain did really do it
He rode his horse right into our gate when we opened it and showed us all the cuts thrusts and guards
There are four of each kind
It was splendid
The morning sun shone on his flashing blade and his good steed stood with all its legs far apart and stiff on the lawn
Then we opened the paddock gate and he did it again while the horse galloped as if upon the bloody battlefield among the fierce foes of his native land and this was far more ripping still
Then we thanked him very much and he went away taking his men with him
And the guns of course
Then we wrote to my father and he said Yes as we knew he would and next time the soldiers came by but they had no guns this time only the captive Arabs of the desertwe had the keepsakes ready in a wheelbarrow and we were on the churchyard wall
And the bold captain called an immediate halt
Then the girls had the splendid honour and pleasure of giving a pipe and four whole ounces of tobacco to each soldier
Then we shook hands with the captain and the sergeant and the corporals and the girls kissed the captainI cant think why girls will kiss everybody and we all cheered for the Queen
It was grand
And I wish my father had been there to see how much you can do with L12 if you order the things from the Stores
We have never seen those brave soldiers again
I have told you all this to show you how we got so keen about soldiers and why we sought to aid and abet the poor widow at the white cottage in her desolate and oppressedness
Her name was Simpkins and her cottage was just beyond the churchyard on the other side from our house
On the different military occasions which I have remarked upon this widow woman stood at her garden gate and looked on
And after the cheering she rubbed her eyes with her apron
Alice noticed this slight but signifying action
We feel quite sure Mrs Simpkins liked soldiers and so we felt friendly to her
But when we tried to talk to her she would not
She told us to go along with us do and not bother her
And Oswald with his usual delicacy and good breeding made the others do as she said
But we were not to be thus repulsed with impunity
We made complete but cautious inquiries and found out that the reason she cried when she saw soldiers was that she had only one son a boy
He was twentytwo and he had gone to the War last April
So that she thought of him when she saw the soldiers and that was why she cried
Because when your son is at the wars you always think he is being killed
I dont know why
A great many of them are not
If I had a son at the wars I should never think he was dead till I heard he was and perhaps not then considering everything
After we had found this out we held a council
Dora said We must do something for the soldiers widowed mother
We all agreed but added What
Alice said The gift of money might be deemed an insult by that proud patriotic spirit
Besides we havent more than eighteenpence among us
We had put what we had to fathers L12 to buy the baccy and pipes
The Mouse then said Couldnt we make her a flannel petticoat and leave it without a word upon her doorstep
But everyone said Flannel petticoats in this weather
so that was no go
Noel said he would write her a poem but Oswald had a deep inward feeling that Mrs Simpkins would not understand poetry
Many people do not
H O said Why not sing Rule Britannia under her window after she had gone to bed like waits but no one else thought so
Denny thought we might get up a subscription for her among the wealthy and affluent but we said again that we knew money would be no balm to the haughty mother of a brave British soldier
What we want Alice said is something that will be a good deal of trouble to us and some good to her
A little help is worth a deal of poetry said Denny
I should not have said that myself
Noel did look sick 
What DOES she do that we can help in
Dora asked
Besides she wont let us help
H O said She does nothing but work in the garden
At least if she does anything inside you cant see it because she keeps the door shut
Then at once we saw
And we agreed to get up the very next day ere yet the rosy dawn had flushed the east and have a go at Mrs Simpkinss garden
We got up
We really did
But too often when you mean to overnight it seems so silly to do it when you come to waking in the dewy morn
We crept downstairs with our boots in our hands
Denny is rather unlucky though a most careful boy
It was he who dropped his boot and it went blundering down the stairs echoing like thunderbolts and waking up Alberts uncle
But when we explained to him that we were going to do some gardening he let us and went back to bed
Everything is very pretty and different in the early morning before people are up
I have been told this is because the shadows go a different way from what they do in the awake part of the day
But I dont know
Noel says the fairies have just finished tidying up then
Anyhow it all feels quite otherwise
We put on our boots in the porch and we got our gardening tools and we went down to the white cottage
It is a nice cottage with a thatched roof like in the drawing copies you get at girls schools and you do the thatchif you canwith a BB
pencil
If you cannot you just leave it
It looks just as well somehow when it is mounted and framed
We looked at the garden
It was very neat
Only one patch was coming up thick with weeds
I could see groundsel and chickweed and others that I did not know
We set to work with a will
We used all our toolsspades forks hoes and rakesand Dora worked with the trowel sitting down because her foot was hurt
We cleared the weedy patch beautifully scraping off all the nasty weeds and leaving the nice clean brown dirt
We worked as hard as ever we could
And we were happy because it was unselfish toil and no one thought then of putting it in the Book of Golden Deeds where we had agreed to write down our virtuous actions and the good doings of each other when we happen to notice them
We had just done and we were looking at the beautiful production of our honest labour when the cottage door burst open and the soldiers widowed mother came out like a wild tornado and her eyes looked like upas treesdeath to the beholder
You wicked meddlesome nasty children
she said aint you got enough of your own good ground to runch up and spoil but you must come into MY little lot
Some of us were deeply alarmed but we stood firm
We have only been weeding your garden Dora said we wanted to do something to help you
Dratted little busybodies she said
It was indeed hard but everyone in Kent says dratted when they are cross
Its my turnips she went on youve hoed up and my cabbages
My turnips that my boy sowed afore he went
There get along with you do afore I come at you with my broomhandle
She did come at us with her broomhandle as she spoke and even the boldest turned and fled
Oswald was even the boldest
They looked like weeds right enough he said
And Dicky said It all comes of trying to do golden deeds
This was when we were out in the road
As we went along in a silence full of gloomy remorse we met the postman
He said Heres the letters for the Moat and passed on hastily
He was a bit late
When we came to look through the letters which were nearly all for Alberts uncle we found there was a postcard that had got stuck in a magazine wrapper
Alice pulled it out
It was addressed to Mrs Simpkins
We honourably only looked at the address although it is allowed by the rules of honourableness to read postcards that come to your house if you like even if they are not for you
After a heated discussion Alice and Oswald said they were not afraid whoever was and they retraced their steps Alice holding the postcard right way up so that we should not look at the lettery part of it but only the address
With quicklybeating heart but outwardly unmoved they walked up to the white cottage door
It opened with a bang when we knocked
Well
Mrs Simpkins said and I think she said it what people in books call sourly
Oswald said We are very very sorry we spoiled your turnips and we will ask my father to try and make it up to you some other way
She muttered something about not wanting to be beholden to anybody
We came back Oswald went on with his always unruffled politeness because the postman gave us a postcard in mistake with our letters and it is addressed to you
We havent read it Alice said quickly
I think she neednt have said that
Of course we hadnt
But perhaps girls know better than we do what women are likely to think you capable of
The soldiers mother took the postcard she snatched it really but took is a kinder word considering everything and she looked at the address a long time
Then she turned it over and read what was on the back
Then she drew her breath in as far as it would go and caught hold of the doorpost
Her face got awful
It was like the wax face of a dead king I saw once at Madame Tussauds
Alice understood
She caught hold of the soldiers mothers hand and said Oh NOits NOT your boy Bill
And the woman said nothing but shoved the postcard into Alices hand and we both read itand it WAS her boy Bill
Alice gave her back the card
She had held on to the womans hand all the time and now she squeezed the hand and held it against her face
But she could not say a word because she was crying so
The soldiers mother took the card again and she pushed Alice away but it was not an unkind push and she went in and shut the door and as Alice and Oswald went down the road Oswald looked back and one of the windows of the cottage had a white blind
Afterwards the other windows had too
There were no blinds really to the cottage
It was aprons and things she had pinned up
Alice cried most of the morning and so did the other girls
We wanted to do something for the soldiers mother but you can do nothing when peoples sons are shot
It is the most dreadful thing to want to do something for people who are unhappy and not to know what to do
It was Noel who thought of what we COIULD do at last
He said I suppose they dont put up tombstones to soldiers when they die in war
But thereI mean Oswald said Of course not
Noel said I daresay youll think its silly but I dont care
Dont you think shed like it if we put one up to HIM
Not in the churchyard of course because we shouldnt be let but in our garden just where it joins on to the churchyard
And we all thought it was a firstrate idea
This is what we meant to put on the tombstone Here lies BILL SIMPKINS Who died fighting for Queen and Country
A faithful son A son so dear A soldier brave Lies buried here
Then we remembered that poor brave Bill was really buried far away in the Southern hemisphere if at all
So we altered it to A soldier brave We weep for here
Then we looked out a nice flagstone in the stableyard and we got a cold chisel out of the Dentists toolbox and began
But stonecutting is difficult and dangerous work
Oswald went at it a bit but he chipped his thumb and it bled so he had to chuck it
Then Dicky tried and then Denny but Dicky hammered his finger and Denny took all day over every stroke so that by teatime we had only done the H and about half the Eand the E was awfully crooked
Oswald chipped his thumb over the H We looked at it the next morning and even the most sanguinary of us saw that it was a hopeless task
Then Denny said Why not wood and paint
and he showed us how
We got a board and two stumps from the carpenters in the village and we painted it all white and when that was dry Denny did the words on it
It was something like this IN MEMORY OF BILL SIMPKINS DEAD FOR QUEEN AND COUNTRY
HONOUR TO HIS NAME AND ALL OTHER BRAVE SOLDIERS
We could not get in what we meant to at first so we had to give up the poetry
We fixed it up when it was dry
We had to dig jolly deep to get the posts to stand up but the gardener helped us
Then the girls made wreaths of white flowers roses and Canterbury bells and lilies and pinks and sweetpeas and daisies and put them over the posts
And I think if Bill Simpkins had known how sorry we were he would have been glad
Oswald only hopes if he falls on the wild battlefield which is his highest ambition that somebody will be as sorry about him as he was about Bill thats all
When all was done and what flowers there were over from the wreaths scattered under the tombstone between the posts we wrote a letter to Mrs Simpkins and said DEAR MRS SIMPKINS We are very very sorry about the turnips and things and we beg your pardon humbly
We have put up a tombstone to your brave son
And we signed our names
Alice took the letter
The soldiers mother read it and said something about our oughting to know better than to make fun of peoples troubles with our tombstones and tomfoolery
Alice told me she could not help crying
She said Its not
its NOT
Dear DEAR Mrs Simpkins do come with me and see
You dont know how sorry we are about Bill
Do come and see
We can go through the churchyard and the others have all gone in so as to leave it quiet for you
Do come
And Mrs Simpkins did
And when she read what we had put up and Alice told her the verse we had not had room for she leant against the wall by the grave I mean the tombstoneand Alice hugged her and they both cried bitterly
The poor soldiers mother was very very pleased and she forgave us about the turnips and we were friends after that but she always liked Alice the best
A great many people do somehow
After that we used to put fresh flowers every day on Bills tombstone and I do believe his mother was pleased though she got us to move it away from the churchyard edge and put it in a corner of our garden under a laburnum where people could not see it from the church
But you could from the road though I think she thought you couldnt
She came every day to look at the new wreaths
When the white flowers gave out we put coloured and she liked it just as well
About a fortnight after the erecting of the tombstone the girls were putting fresh wreaths on it when a soldier in a red coat came down the road and he stopped and looked at us
He walked with a stick and he had a bundle in a blue cotton handkerchief and one arm in a sling
And he looked again and he came nearer and he leaned on the wall so that he could read the black printing on the white paint
And he grinned all over his face and he said Well I AM blessed
And he read it all out in a sort of half whisper and when he came to the end where it says and all such brave soldiers he said Well I really AM
I suppose he meant he really was blessed
Oswald thought it was like the soldiers cheek so he said I daresay you arent so very blessed as you think
Whats it to do with you anyway eh Tommy
Of course Oswald knew from Kipling that an infantry soldier is called that
The soldier said Tommy yourself young man
Thats ME
and he pointed to the tombstone
We stood rooted to the spot
Alice spoke first
Then youre Bill and youre not dead she said
Oh Bill I am so glad
Do let ME tell your mother
She started running and so did we all
Bill had to go slowly because of his leg but I tell you he went as fast as ever he could
We all hammered at the soldiers mothers door and shouted Come out
come out
and when she opened the door we were going to speak but she pushed us away and went tearing down the garden path like winking
I never saw a grownup woman run like it because she saw Bill coming
She met him at the gate running right into him and caught hold of him and she cried much more than when she thought he was dead
And we all shook his hand and said how glad we were
The soldiers mother kept hold of him with both hands and I couldnt help looking at her face
It was like wax that had been painted on both pink cheeks and the eyes shining like candles
And when we had all said how glad we were she said Thank the dear Lord for His mercies and she took her boy Bill into the cottage and shut the door
We went home and chopped up the tombstone with the woodaxe and had a blazing big bonfire and cheered till we could hardly speak
The postcard was a mistake he was only missing
There was a pipe and a whole pound of tobacco left over from our keepsake to the other soldiers
We gave it to Bill
Father is going to have him for undergardener when his wounds get well
Hell always be a bit lame so he cannot fight any more
CHAPTER 4 THE TOWER OF MYSTERY It was very rough on Dora having her foot bad but we took it in turns to stay in with her and she was very decent about it
Daisy was most with her
I do not dislike Daisy but I wish she had been taught how to play
Because Dora is rather like that naturally and sometimes I have thought that Daisy makes her worse
I talked to Alberts uncle about it one day when the others had gone to church and I did not go because of earache and he said it came from reading the wrong sort of books partlyshe has read Ministering Children and Anna Ross or The Orphan of Waterloo and Ready Work for Willing Hands and Elsie or Like a Little Candle and even a horrid little blue book about the something or other of Little Sins
After this conversation Oswald took care she had plenty of the right sort of books to read and he was surprised and pleased when she got up early one morning to finish Monte Cristo
Oswald felt that he was really being useful to a suffering fellowcreature when he gave Daisy books that were not all about being good
A few days after Dora was laid up Alice called a council of the Wouldbegoods and Oswald and Dicky attended with darklyclouded brows
Alice had the minutebook which was an exercisebook that had not much written in it
She had begun at the other end
I hate doing that myself because there is so little room at the top compared with right way up
Dora and a sofa had been carried out on to the lawn and we were on the grass
It was very hot and dry
We had sherbet
Alice read Society of the Wouldbegoods
We have not done much
Dicky mended a window and we got the milkpan out of the moat that dropped through where he mended it
Dora Oswald Dicky and me got upset in the moat
This was not goodness
Doras foot was hurt
We hope to do better next time
Then came Noels poem We are the Wouldbegoods Society We are not good yet but we mean to try And if we try and if we dont succeed It must mean we are very bad indeed
This sounded so much righter than Noels poetry generally does that Oswald said so and Noel explained that Denny had helped him
He seems to know the right length for lines of poetry
I suppose it comes of learning so much at school Noel said
Then Oswald proposed that anybody should be allowed to write in the book if they found out anything good that anyone else had done but not things that were public acts and nobody was to write about themselves or anything other people told them only what they found out
After a brief jaw the others agreed and Oswald felt not for the first time in his young life that he would have made a good diplomatic hero to carry despatches and outwit the other side
For now he had put it out of the minutebooks power to be the kind of thing readers of Ministering Children would have wished
And if anyone tells other people any good thing hes done he is to go to Coventry for the rest of the day
And Denny remarked We shall do good by stealth and blush to find it shame
After that nothing was written in the book for some time
I looked about and so did the others but I never caught anyone in the act of doing anything extra though several of the others have told me since of things they did at this time and really wondered nobody had noticed
I think I said before that when you tell a story you cannot tell everything
It would be silly to do it
Because ordinary kinds of play are dull to read about and the only other thing is meals and to dwell on what you eat is greedy and not like a hero at all
A hero is always contented with a venison pasty and a horn of sack
All the same the meals were very interesting with things you do not get at homeLent pies with custard and currants in them sausage rolls and fiede cakes and raisin cakes and apple turnovers and honeycomb and syllabubs besides as much new milk as you cared about and cream now and then and cheese always on the table for tea
Father told Mrs Pettigrew to get what meals she liked and she got these strange but attractive foods
In a story about Wouldbegoods it is not proper to tell of times when only some of us were naughty so I will pass lightly over the time when Noel got up the kitchen chimney and brought three bricks and an old starlings nest and about a ton of soot down with him when he fell
They never use the big chimney in the summer but cook in the washhouse
Nor do I wish to dwell on what H O did when he went into the dairy
I do not know what his motive was
But Mrs Pettigrew said SHE knew and she locked him in and said if it was cream he wanted he should have enough and she wouldnt let him out till teatime
The cat had also got into the dairy for some reason of her own and when H O was tired of whatever he went in for he poured all the milk into the churn and tried to teach the cat to swim in it
He must have been desperate
The cat did not even try to learn and H O had the scars on his hands for weeks
I do not wish to tell tales of H O for he is very young and whatever he does he always catches it for but I will just allude to our being told not to eat the greengages in the garden
And we did not
And whatever H O did was Noels faultfor Noel told H O that greengages would grow again all right if you did not bite as far as the stone just as wounds are not mortal except when you are pierced through the heart
So the two of them bit bites out of every greengage they could reach
And of course the pieces did not grow again
Oswald did not do things like these but then he is older than his brothers
The only thing he did just about then was making a boobytrap for Mrs Pettigrew when she had locked H O up in the dairy and unfortunately it was the day she was going out in her best things and part of the trap was a can of water
Oswald was not willingly vicious it was but a light and thoughtless act which he had every reason to be sorry for afterwards
And he is sorry even without those reasons because he knows it is ungentlemanly to play tricks on women
I remember Mother telling Dora and me when we were little that you ought to be very kind and polite to servants because they have to work very hard and do not have so many good times as we do
I used to think about Mother more at the Moat House than I did at Blackheath especially in the garden
She was very fond of flowers and she used to tell us about the big garden where she used to live and I remember Dora and I helped her to plant seeds
But it is no use wishing
She would have liked that garden though
The girls and the white mice did not do anything boldly wickedthough of course they used to borrow Mrs Pettigrews needles which made her very nasty
Needles that are borrowed might just as well be stolen
But I say no more
I have only told you these things to show the kind of events which occurred on the days I dont tell you about
On the whole we had an excellent time
It was on the day we had the pillowfight that we went for the long walk
Not the Pilgrimagethat is another story
We did not mean to have a pillowfight
It is not usual to have them after breakfast but Oswald had come up to get his knife out of the pocket of his Etons to cut some wire we were making rabbit snares of
It is a very good knife with a file in it as well as a corkscrew and other thingsand he did not come down at once because he was detained by having to make an applepie bed for Dicky
Dicky came up after him to see what he was up to and when he did see he buzzed a pillow at Oswald and the fight began
The others hearing the noise of battle from afar hastened to the field of action all except Dora who couldnt because of being laid up with her foot and Daisy because she is a little afraid of us still when we are all together
She thinks we are rough
This comes of having only one brother
Well the fight was a very fine one
Alice backed me up and Noel and H O backed Dicky and Denny heaved a pillow or two but he cannot shy straight so I dont know which side he was on
And just as the battle raged most fiercely Mrs Pettigrew came in and snatched the pillows away and shook those of the warriors who were small enough for it
SHE was rough if you like
She also used language I should have thought she would be above
She said Drat you
and Drabbit you
The last is a thing I have never heard said before
She said Theres no peace of your life with you children
Drat your antics
And that poor dear patient gentleman right underneath with his headache and his handwriting and you rampaging about over his head like young bullcalves
I wonder you havent more sense a great girl like you
She said this to Alice and Alice answered gently as we are told to do I really am awfully sorry we forgot about the headache
Dont be cross Mrs Pettigrew we didnt mean to we didnt think
You never do she said and her voice though grumpy was no longer violent
Why on earth you cant take yourselves off for the day I dont know
We all said But may we
She said Of course you may
Now put on your boots and go for a good long walk
And Ill tell you whatIll put you up a snack and you can have an egg to your tea to make up for missing your dinner
Now dont go clattering about the stairs and passages theres good children
See if you cant be quiet this once and give the good gentleman a chance with his copying
She went off
Her bark is worse than her bite
She does not understand anything about writing books though
She thinks Alberts uncle copies things out of printed books when he is really writing new ones
I wonder how she thinks printed books get made first of all
Many servants are like this
She gave us the snack in a basket and sixpence to buy milk with
She said any of the farms would let us have it only most likely it would be skim
We thanked her politely and she hurried us out of the front door as if wed been chickens on a pansy bed
I did not know till after I had left the farm gate open and the hens had got into the garden that these feathered bipeds display a great partiality for the young buds of plants of the genus viola to which they are extremely destructive
I was told that by the gardener
I looked it up in the gardening book afterwards to be sure he was right
You do learn a lot of things in the country
We went through the garden as far as the church and then we rested a bit in the porch and just looked into the basket to see what the snack was
It proved to be sausage rolls and queen cakes and a Lent pie in a round tin dish and some hardboiled eggs and some apples
We all ate the apples at once so as not to have to carry them about with us
The churchyard smells awfully good
It is the wild thyme that grows on the graves
This is another thing we did not know before we came into the country
Then the door of the church tower was ajar and we all went up it had always been locked before when we had tried it
We saw the ringers loft where the ends of the bellropes hang down with long furry handles to them like great caterpillars some red and some blue and white but we did not pull them
And then we went up to where the bells are very big and dusty among large dirty beams and four windows with no glass only shutters like Venetian blinds but they wont pull up
There were heaps of straws and sticks on the window ledges
We think they were owls nests but we did not see any owls
Then the tower stairs got very narrow and dark and we went on up and we came to a door and opened it suddenly and it was like being hit in the face the light was so sudden
And there we were on the top of the tower which is flat and people have cut their names on it and a turret at one corner and a low wall all round up and down like castle battlements
And we looked down and saw the roof of the church and the leads and the churchyard and our garden and the Moat House and the farm and Mrs Simpkinss cottage looking very small and other farms looking like toy things out of boxes and we saw cornfields and meadows and pastures
A pasture is not the same thing as a meadow whatever you may think
And we saw the tops of trees and hedges looking like the map of the United States and villages and a tower that did not look very far away standing by itself on the top of a hill
Alice pointed to it and said Whats that
Its not a church said Noel because theres no churchyard
Perhaps its a tower of mystery that covers the entrance to a subterranean vault with treasure in it
Dicky said Subterranean fiddlestick
and A waterworks more likely
Alice thought perhaps it was a ruined castle and the rest of its crumbling walls were concealed by ivy the growth of years
Oswald could not make his mind up what it was so he said Lets go and see
We may as well go there as anywhere
So we got down out of the church tower and dusted ourselves and set out
The Tower of Mystery showed quite plainly from the road now that we knew where to look for it because it was on the top of a hill
We began to walk
But the tower did not seem to get any nearer
And it was very hot
So we sat down in a meadow where there was a stream in the ditch and ate the snack
We drank the pure water from the brook out of our hands because there was no farm to get milk at just there and it was too much fag to look for oneand besides we thought we might as well save the sixpence
Then we started again and still the tower looked as far off as ever
Denny began to drag his feet though he had brought a walkingstick which none of the rest of us had and said I wish a cart would come along
We might get a lift
He knew all about getting lifts of course from having been in the country before
He is not quite the white mouse we took him for at first
Of course when you live in Lewisham or Blackheath you learn other things
If you asked for a lift in Lewisham High Street your only reply would be jeers
We sat down on a heap of stones and decided that we would ask for a lift from the next cart whichever way it was going
It was while we were waiting that Oswald found out about plantain seeds being good to eat
When the sound of wheels came we remarked with joy that the cart was going towards the Tower of Mystery
It was a cart a man was going to fetch a pig home in
Denny said I say you might give us a lift
Will you
The man who was going for the pig said What all that little lot
but he winked at Alice and we saw that he meant to aid us on our way
So we climbed up and he whipped up the horse and asked us where we were going
He was a kindly old man with a face like a walnut shell and white hair and beard like a jackinthebox
We want to get to the tower Alice said
Is it a ruin or not
It aint no ruin the man said no fear of that
The man wot built it he left so much a year to be spent on repairing of it
Money that might have put bread in honest folks mouths
We asked was it a church then or not
Church
he said
Not it
Its more of a tombstone from all I can make out
They do say there was a curse on him that built it and he wasnt to rest in earth or sea
So hes buried halfway up the towerif you can call it buried
Can you go up it
Oswald asked
Lord love you
yes a fine view from the top they say
Ive never been up myself though Ive lived in sight of it boy and man these sixtythree years come harvest
Alice asked whether you had to go past the dead and buried person to get to the top of the tower and could you see the coffin
No no the man said thats all hid away behind a slab of stone that is with reading on it
Youve no call to be afraid missy
Its daylight all the way up
But I wouldnt go there after dark so I wouldnt
Its always open day and night and they say tramps sleep there now and again
Anyone who likes can sleep there but it wouldnt be me
We thought that it would not be us either but we wanted to go more than ever especially when the man said My own greatuncle of the mothers side he was one of the masons that set up the stone slab
Before then it was thick glass and you could see the dead man lying inside as hed left it in his will
He was lying there in a glass coffin with his best clothesblue satin and silver my uncle said such as was all the go in his day with his wig on and his sword beside him what he used to wear
My uncle said his hair had grown out from under his wig and his beard was down to the toes of him
My uncle he always upheld that that dead man was no deader than you and me but was in a sort of fit a transit I think they call it and looked for him to waken into life again some day
But the doctor said not
It was only something done to him like Pharaoh in the Bible afore he was buried
Alice whispered to Oswald that we should be late for tea and wouldnt it be better to go back now directly
But he said If youre afraid say so and you neednt come in anywaybut Im going on
The man who was going for the pig put us down at a gate quite near the towerat least it looked so until we began to walk again
We thanked him and he said Quite welcome and drove off
We were rather quiet going through the wood
What we had heard made us very anxious to see the tower all except Alice who would keep talking about tea though not a greedy girl by nature
None of the others encouraged her but Oswald thought himself that we had better be home before dark
As we went up the path through the wood we saw a poor wayfarer with dusty bare feet sitting on the bank
He stopped us and said he was a sailor and asked for a trifle to help him to get back to his ship
I did not like the look of him much myself but Alice said Oh the poor man do lets help him Oswald
So we held a hurried council and decided to give him the milk sixpence
Oswald had it in his purse and he had to empty the purse into his hand to find the sixpence for that was not all the money he had by any means
Noel said afterwards that he saw the wayfarers eyes fastened greedily upon the shining pieces as Oswald returned them to his purse
Oswald has to own that he purposely let the man see that he had more money so that the man might not feel shy about accepting so large a sum as sixpence
The man blessed our kind hearts and we went on
The sun was shining very brightly and the Tower of Mystery did not look at all like a tomb when we got to it
The bottom Storey was on arches all open and ferns and things grew underneath
There was a round stone stair going up in the middle
Alice began to gather ferns while we went up but when we had called out to her that it was as the pigman had said and daylight all the way up she said All right
Im not afraid
Im only afraid of being late home and came up after us
And perhaps though not downright manly truthfulness this was as much as you could expect from a girl
There were holes in the little tower of the staircase to let light in
At the top of it was a thick door with iron bolts
We shot these back and it was not fear but caution that made Oswald push open the door so very slowly and carefully
Because of course a stray dog or cat might have got shut up there by accident and it would have startled Alice very much if it had jumped out on us
When the door was opened we saw that there was no such thing
It was a room with eight sides
Denny says it is the shape called octogenarian because a man named Octagius invented it
There were eight large arched windows with no glass only stonework like in churches
The room was full of sunshine and you could see the blue sky through the windows but nothing else because they were so high up
It was so bright we began to think the pigman had been kidding us
Under one of the windows was a door
We went through and there was a little passage and then a turrettwisting stair like in the church but quite light with windows
When we had gone some way up this we came to a sort of landing and there was a block of stone let into the wallpolishedDenny said it was Aberdeen graphite with gold letters cut in it
It said Here lies the body of Mr Richard Ravenal Born 1720
Died 1779
and a verse of poetry Here lie I between earth and sky Think upon me dear passers by And you who do my tombstone see Be kind to say a prayer for me
How horrid
Alice said
Do lets get home
We may as well go to the top Dicky said just to say weve been
And Alice is no funkso she agreed though I could see she did not like it
Up at the top it was like the top of the church tower only octogenarian in shape instead of square
Alice got all right there because you cannot think much about ghosts and nonsense when the sun is shining bang down on you at four oclock in the afternoon and you can see red farmroofs between the trees and the safe white roads with people in carts like black ants crawling
It was very jolly but we felt we ought to be getting back because tea is at five and we could not hope to find lifts both ways
So we started to go down
Dicky went first then Oswald then Aliceand H O had just stumbled over the top step and saved himself by Alices back which nearly upset Oswald and Dicky when the hearts of all stood still and then went on by leaps and bounds like the good work in missionary magazines
For down below us in the tower where the man whose beard grew down to his toes after he was dead was buried there was a noisea loud noise
And it was like a door being banged and bolts fastened
We tumbled over each other to get back into the open sunshine on the top of the tower and Alices hand got jammed between the edge of the doorway and H
O
s boot it was bruised black and blue and another part bled but she did not notice it till long after
We looked at each other and Oswald said in a firm voice at least I hope it was What was that
He HAS waked up Alice said
Oh I know he has
Of course there is a door for him to get out by when he wakes
Hell come up here
I know he will
Dicky said and his voice was not at all firm I noticed that at the time It doesnt matter if hes ALIVE
Unless hes come to life a raving lunatic Noel said and we all stood with our eyes on the doorway of the turretand held our breath to hear
But there was no more noise
Then Oswald saidand nobody ever put it in the Golden Deed book though they own that it was brave and noble of himhe said Perhaps it was only the wind blowing one of the doors to
Ill go down and see if you will Dick
Dicky only said The wind doesnt shoot bolts
A bolt from the blue said Denny to himself looking up at the sky
His father is a subeditor
He had gone very red and he was holding on to Alices hand
Suddenly he stood up quite straight and said Im not afraid
Ill go and see
THIS was afterwards put in the Golden Deed book
It ended in Oswald and Dicky and Denny going
Denny went first because he said he would rather and Oswald understood this and let him
If Oswald had pushed first it would have been like Sir Lancelot refusing to let a young knight win his spurs
Oswald took good care to go second himself though
The others never understood this
You dont expect it from girls but I did think father would have understood without Oswald telling him which of course he never could
We all went slowly
At the bottom of the turret stairs we stopped short
Because the door there was bolted fast and would not yield to shoves however desperate and united
Only now somehow we felt that Mr Richard Ravenal was all right and quiet but that some one had done it for a lark or perhaps not known about anyone being up there
So we rushed up and Oswald told the others in a few hasty but wellchosen words and we all leaned over between the battlements and shouted Hi
you there
Then from under the arches of the quitedownstairs part of the tower a figure came forthand it was the sailor who had had our milk sixpence
He looked up and he spoke to us
He did not speak loud but he spoke loud enough for us to hear every word quite plainly
He said Drop that
Oswald said Drop what
He said That row
Oswald said Why
He said Because if you dont Ill come up and make you and pretty quick too so I tell you
Dicky said Did you bolt the door
The man said I did so my young cock
Alice saidand Oswald wished to goodness she had held her tongue because he saw right enough the man was not friendlyOh do come and let us outdo please
While she was saying it Oswald suddenly saw that he did not want the man to come up
So he scurried down the stairs because he thought he had seen something on the door on the top side and sure enough there were two bolts and he shot them into their sockets
This bold act was not put in the Golden Deed book because when Alice wanted to the others said it was not GOOD of Oswald to think of this but only CLEVER
I think sometimes in moments of danger and disaster it is as good to be clever as it is to be good
But Oswald would never demean himself to argue about this
When he got back the man was still standing staring up
Alice said Oh Oswald he says he wont let us out unless we give him all our money
And we might be here for days and days and all night as well
No one knows where we are to come and look for us
Oh do lets give it him ALL
She thought the lion of the English nation which does not know when it is beaten would be ramping in her brothers breast
But Oswald kept calm
He said All right and he made the others turn out their pockets
Denny had a bad shilling with a head on both sides and three halfpence
H O had a halfpenny
Noel had a French penny which is only good for chocolate machines at railway stations
Dicky had tenpencehalfpenny and Oswald had a twoshilling piece of his own that he was saving up to buy a gun with
Oswald tied the whole lot up in his handkerchief and looking over the battlements he said You are an ungrateful beast
We gave you sixpence freely of our own will
The man did look a little bit ashamed but he mumbled something about having his living to get
Then Oswald said Here you are
Catch
and he flung down the handkerchief with the money in it
The man muffed the catchbutterfingered idiot but he picked up the handkerchief and undid it and when he saw what was in it he swore dreadfully
The cad
Look here he called out this wont do young shaver
I want those there shiners I see in your pus
Chuck em along
Then Oswald laughed
He said I shall know you again anywhere and youll be put in prison for this
Here are the SHINERS
And he was so angry he chucked down purse and all
The shiners were not real ones but only cardcounters that looked like sovereigns on one side
Oswald used to carry them in his purse so as to look affluent
He does not do this now
When the man had seen what was in the purse he disappeared under the tower and Oswald was glad of what he had done about the boltsand he hoped they were as strong as the ones on the other side of the door
They were
We heard the man kicking and pounding at the door and I am not ashamed to say that we were all holding on to each other very tight
I am proud however to relate that nobody screamed or cried
After what appeared to be long years the banging stopped and presently we saw the brute going away among the trees
Then Alice did cry and I do not blame her
Then Oswald said Its no use
Even if hes undone the door he may be in ambush
We must hold on here till somebody comes
Then Alice said speaking chokily because she had not quite done crying Lets wave a flag
By the most fortunate accident she had on one of her Sunday petticoats though it was Monday
This petticoat is white
She tore it out at the gathers and we tied it to Dennys stick and took turns to wave it
We had laughed at his carrying a stick before but we were very sorry now that we had done so
And the tin dish the Lent pie was baked in we polished with our handkerchiefs and moved it about in the sun so that the sun might strike on it and signal our distress to some of the outlying farms
This was perhaps the most dreadful adventure that had then ever happened to us
Even Alice had now stopped thinking of Mr Richard Ravenal and thought only of the lurker in ambush
We all felt our desperate situation keenly
I must say Denny behaved like anything but a white mouse
When it was the others turn to wave he sat on the leads of the tower and held Alices and Noels hands and said poetry to themyards and yards of it
By some strange fatality it seemed to comfort them
It wouldnt have me
He said The Battle of the Baltic and Grays Elegy right through though I think he got wrong in places and the Revenge and Macaulays thing about Lars Porsena and the Nine Gods
And when it was his turn he waved like a man
I will try not to call him a white mouse any more
He was a brick that day and no mouse
The sun was low in the heavens and we were sick of waving and very hungry when we saw a cart in the road below
We waved like mad and shouted and Denny screamed exactly like a railway whistle a thing none of us had known before that he could do
And the cart stopped
And presently we saw a figure with a white beard among the trees
It was our Pigman
We bellowed the awful truth to him and when he had taken it inhe thought at first we were kidding he came up and let us out
He had got the pig luckily it was a very small one and we were not particular
Denny and Alice sat on the front of the cart with the Pigman and the rest of us got in with the pig and the man drove us right home
You may think we talked it over on the way
Not us
We went to sleep among the pig and before long the Pigman stopped and got us to make room for Alice and Denny
There was a net over the cart
I never was so sleepy in my life though it was not more than bedtime
Generally after anything exciting you are punishedbut this could not be because we had only gone for a walk exactly as we were told
There was a new rule made though
No walks except on the highroads and we were always to take Pincher and either Lady the deerhound or Martha the bulldog
We generally hate rules but we did not mind this one
Father gave Denny a gold pencilcase because he was first to go down into the tower
Oswald does not grudge Denny this though some might think he deserved at least a silver one
But Oswald is above such paltry jealousies
CHAPTER 5 THE WATERWORKS This is the story of one of the most farreaching and influentially naughty things we ever did in our lives
We did not mean to do such a deed
And yet we did do it
These things will happen with the bestregulated consciences
The story of this rash and fatal act is intimately involvedwhich means all mixed up anyhowwith a private affair of Oswalds and the one cannot be revealed without the other
Oswald does not particularly want his story to be remembered but he wishes to tell the truth and perhaps it is what father calls a wholesome discipline to lay bare the awful facts
It was like this
On Alices and Noels birthday we went on the river for a picnic
Before that we had not known that there was a river so near us
Afterwards father said he wished we had been allowed to remain on our pristine ignorance whatever that is
And perhaps the dark hour did dawn when we wished so too
But a truce to vain regrets
It was rather a fine thing in birthdays
The uncle sent a box of toys and sweets things that were like a vision from another and a brighter world
Besides that Alice had a knife a pair of shutup scissors a silk handkerchief a bookit was The Golden Age and is Ai except where it gets mixed with grownup nonsense
Also a workcase lined with pink plush a bootbag which no one in their senses would use because it had flowers in wool all over it
And she had a box of chocolates and a musical box that played The Man who broke and two other tunes and two pairs of kid gloves for church and a box of writingpaperpinkwith Alice on it in gold writing and an egg coloured red that said A
Bastable in ink on one side
These gifts were the offerings of Oswald Dora Dicky Alberts uncle Daisy Mr Foulkes our own robber Noel H O father and Denny
Mrs Pettigrew gave the egg
It was a kindly housekeepers friendly token
I shall not tell you about the picnic on the river because the happiest times form but dull reading when they are written down
I will merely state that it was prime
Though happy the day was uneventful
The only thing exciting enough to write about was in one of the locks where there was a snakea viper
It was asleep in a warm sunny corner of the lock gate and when the gate was shut it fell off into the water
Alice and Dora screamed hideously
So did Daisy but her screams were thinner
The snake swam round and round all the time our boat was in the lock
It swam with four inches of itselfthe head endreared up out of the water exactly like Kaa in the Jungle Bookso we know Kipling is a true author and no rotter
We were careful to keep our hands well inside the boat
A snakes eyes strike terror into the boldest breast
When the lock was full father killed the viper with a boathook
I was sorry for it myself
It was indeed a venomous serpent
But it was the first we had ever seen except at the Zoo
And it did swim most awfully well
Directly the snake had been killed H O reached out for its corpse and the next moment the body of our little brother was seen wriggling conclusively on the boats edge
This exciting spectacle was not of a lasting nature
He went right in
Father clawed him out
He is very unlucky with water
Being a birthday but little was said
H O was wrapped in everybodys coats and did not take any cold at all
This glorious birthday ended with an iced cake and ginger wine and drinking healths
Then we played whatever we liked
There had been rounders during the afternoon
It was a day to be for ever marked by memorys brightest whatsitsname
I should not have said anything about the picnic but for one thing
It was the thin edge of the wedge
It was the allpowerful lever that moved but too many events
You see WE WERE NO LONGER STRANGERS TO THE RIVER
And we went there whenever we could
Only we had to take the dogs and to promise no bathing without grownups
But paddling in back waters was allowed
I say no more
I have not numerated Noels birthday presents because I wish to leave something to the imagination of my young readers
The best authors always do this
If you will take the large red catalogue of the Army and Navy Stores and just make a list of about fifteen of the things you would like bestprices from 2s
to 25syou will get a very good idea of Noels presents and it will help you to make up your mind in case you are asked just before your next birthday what you really NEED
One of Noels birthday presents was a cricket ball
He cannot bowl for nuts and it was a firstrate ball
So some days after the birthday Oswald offered him to exchange it for a coconut he had won at the fair and two pencils new and a brandnew notebook
Oswald thought and he still thinks that this was a fair exchange and so did Noel at the time and he agreed to it and was quite pleased till the girls said it wasnt fair and Oswald had the best of it
And then that young beggar Noel wanted the ball back but Oswald though not angry was firm
You said it was a bargain and you shook hands on it he said and he said it quite kindly and calmly
Noel said he didnt care
He wanted his cricket ball back
And the girls said it was a horrid shame
If they had not said that Oswald might yet have consented to let Noel have the beastly ball but now of course he was not going to
He said Oh yes I daresay
And then you would be wanting the coconut and things again the next minute
No I shouldnt Noel said
It turned out afterwards he and H O had eaten the coconut which only made it worse
And it made them worse toowhich is what the book calls poetic justice
Dora said I dont think it was fair and even Alice said Do let him have it back Oswald
I wish to be just to Alice
She did not know then about the coconut having been secretly wolfed up
We were in the garden
Oswald felt all the feelings of the hero when the opposing forces gathered about him are opposing as hard as ever they can
He knew he was not unfair and he did not like to be jawed at just because Noel had eaten the coconut and wanted the ball back
Though Oswald did not know then about the eating of the coconut but he felt the injustice in his soul all the same
Noel said afterwards he meant to offer Oswald something else to make up for the coconut but he said nothing about this at the time
Give it me I say Noel said
And Oswald said Shant
Then Noel called Oswald names and Oswald did not answer back but just kept smiling pleasantly and carelessly throwing up the ball and catching it again with an air of studied indifference
It was Marthas fault that what happened happened
She is the bulldog and very stout and heavy
She had just been let loose and she came bounding along in her clumsy way and jumped up on Oswald who is beloved by all dumb animals
You know how sagacious they are
Well Martha knocked the ball out of Oswalds hands and it fell on the grass and Noel pounced on it like a hooded falcon on its prey
Oswald would scorn to deny that he was not going to stand this and the next moment the two were rolling over on the grass and very soon Noel was made to bite the dust
And serve him right
He is old enough to know his own mind
Then Oswald walked slowly away with the ball and the others picked Noel up and consoled the beaten but Dicky would not take either side
And Oswald went up into his own room and lay on his bed and reflected gloomy reflections about unfairness
Presently he thought he would like to see what the others were doing without their knowing he cared
So he went into the linenroom and looked out of its window and he saw they were playing Kings and Queensand Noel had the biggest paper crown and the longest stick sceptre
Oswald turned away without a word for it really was sickening
Then suddenly his weary eyes fell upon something they had not before beheld
It was a square trapdoor in the ceiling of the linenroom
Oswald never hesitated
He crammed the cricket ball into his pocket and climbed up the shelves and unbolted the trapdoor and shoved it up and pulled himself up through it
Though above all was dark and smelt of spiders Oswald fearlessly shut the trapdoor down again before he struck a match
He always carries matches
He is a boy fertile in every subtle expedient
Then he saw he was in the wonderful mysterious place between the ceiling and the roof of the house
The roof is beams and tiles
Slits of light show through the tiles here and there
The ceiling on its other and top side is made of rough plaster and beams
If you walk on the beams it is all rightif you walk on the plaster you go through with your feet
Oswald found this out later but some fine instinct now taught the young explorer where he ought to tread and where not
It was splendid
He was still very angry with the others and he was glad he had found out a secret they jolly well didnt know
He walked along a dark narrow passage
Every now and then crossbeams barred his way and he had to creep under them
At last a small door loomed before him with cracks of light under and over
He drew back the rusty bolts and opened it
It opened straight on to the leads a flat place between two steep red roofs with a parapet two feet high back and front so that no one could see you
It was a place no one could have invented better than if they had tried for hiding in
Oswald spent the whole afternoon there
He happened to have a volume of Percys Anecdotes in his pocket the one about lawyers as well as a few apples
While he read he fingered the cricket ball and presently it rolled away and he thought he would get it byandby
When the teabell rang he forgot the ball and went hurriedly down for apples do not keep the inside from the pangs of hunger
Noel met him on the landing got red in the face and said It wasnt QUITE fair about the ball because H O and I had eaten the coconut
YOU can have it
I dont want your beastly ball Oswald said only I hate unfairness
However I dont know where it is just now
When I find it you shall have it to bowl with as often as you want
Then youre not waxy
And Oswald said No and they went in to tea together
So that was all right
There were raisin cakes for tea
Next day we happened to want to go down to the river quite early
I dont know why this is called Fate or Destiny
We dropped in at the Rose and Crown for some gingerbeer on our way
The landlady is a friend of ours and lets us drink it in her back parlour instead of in the bar which would be improper for girls
We found her awfully busy making pies and jellies and her two sisters were hurrying about with great hams and pairs of chickens and rounds of cold beef and lettuces and pickled salmon and trays of crockery and glasses
Its for the angling competition she said
We said Whats that
Why she said slicing cucumber like beautiful machinery while she said it a lot of anglers come down some particular day and fish one particular bit of the river
And the one that catches most fish gets the prize
Theyre fishing the pen above Stoneham Lock
And they all come here to dinner
So Ive got my hands full and a trifle over
We said Couldnt we help
But she said Oh no thank you
Indeed not please
I really am so I dont know which way to turn
Do run along like dears
So we ran along like these timid but graceful animals
Need I tell the intellectual reader that we went straight off to the pen above Stoneham Lock to see the anglers competing
Angling is the same thing as fishing
I am not going to try and explain locks to you
If youve never seen a lock you could never understand even if I wrote it in words of one syllable and pages and pages long
And if you have youll understand without my telling you
It is harder than Euclid if you dont know beforehand
But you might get a grownup person to explain it to you with books or wooden bricks
I will tell you what a pen is because that is easy
It is the bit of river between one lock and the next
In some rivers pens are called reaches but pen is the proper word
We went along the towingpath it is shady with willows aspens alders elders oaks and other trees
On the banks are flowersyarrow meadowsweet willow herb loosestrife and ladys bedstraw
Oswald learned the names of all these trees and plants on the day of the picnic
The others didnt remember them but Oswald did
He is a boy of what they call relenting memory
The anglers were sitting here and there on the shady bank among the grass and the different flowers I have named
Some had dogs with them and some umbrellas and some had only their wives and families
We should have liked to talk to them and ask how they liked their lot and what kinds of fish there were and whether they were nice to eat but we did not like to
Denny had seen anglers before and he knew they liked to be talked to but though he spoke to them quite like to equals he did not ask the things we wanted to know
He just asked whether theyd had any luck and what bait they used
And they answered him back politely
I am glad I am not an angler
It is an immovable amusement and as often as not no fish to speak of after all
Daisy and Dora had stayed at home Doras foot was nearly well but they seem really to like sitting still
I think Dora likes to have a little girl to order about
Alice never would stand it
When we got to Stoneham Lock Denny said he should go home and fetch his fishingrod
H O went with him
This left four of usOswald Alice Dicky and Noel
We went on down the towingpath
The lock shuts up that sounds as if it was like the lock on a door but it is very otherwise between one pen of the river and the next the pen where the anglers were was full right up over the roots of the grass and flowers
But the pen below was nearly empty
You can see the poor rivers bones Noel said
And so you could
Stones and mud and dried branches and here and there an old kettle or a tin pail with no bottom to it that some bargee had chucked in
From walking so much along the river we knew many of the bargees
Bargees are the captains and crews of the big barges that are pulled up and down the river by slow horses
The horses do not swim
They walk on the towingpath with a rope tied to them and the other end to the barge
So it gets pulled along
The bargees we knew were a good friendly sort and used to let us go all over the barges when they were in a good temper
They were not at all the sort of bullying cowardly fiends in human form that the young hero at Oxford fights a crowd of singlehanded in books
The river does not smell nice when its bones are showing
But we went along down because Oswald wanted to get some cobblers wax in Falding village for a birdnet he was making
But just above Falding Lock where the river is narrow and straight we saw a sad and gloomy sighta big barge sitting flat on the mud because there was not water enough to float her
There was no one on board but we knew by a red flannel waistcoat that was spread out to dry on top that the barge belonged to friends of ours
Then Alice said They have gone to find the man who turns on the water to fill the pen
I daresay they wont find him
Hes gone to his dinner I shouldnt wonder
What a lovely surprise it would be if they came back to find their barge floating high and dry on a lot of water
DO lets do it
Its a long time since any of us did a kind action deserving of being put in the Book of Golden Deeds
We had given that name to the minutebook of that beastly Society of the Wouldbegoods
Then you could think of the book if you wanted to without remembering the Society
I always tried to forget both of them
Oswald said But how
YOU dont know how
And if you did we havent got a crowbar
I cannot help telling you that locks are opened with crowbars
You push and push till a thing goes up and the water runs through
It is rather like the little sliding door in the big door of a henhouse
I know where the crowbar is Alice said
Dicky and I were down here yesterday when you were su She was going to say sulking I know but she remembered manners ere too late so Oswald bears her no malice
She went on Yesterday when you were upstairs
And we saw the watertender open the lock and the weir sluices
Its quite easy isnt it Dicky
As easy as kiss your hand said Dicky and whats more I know where he keeps the other thing he opens the sluices with
I votes we do
Do lets if we can Noel said and the bargees will bless the names of their unknown benefactors
They might make a song about us and sing it on winter nights as they pass round the wassail bowl in front of the cabin fire
Noel wanted to very much but I dont think it was altogether for generousness but because he wanted to see how the sluices opened
Yet perhaps I do but wrong the boy
We sat and looked at the barge a bit longer and then Oswald said well he didnt mind going back to the lock and having a look at the crowbars
You see Oswald did not propose this he did not even care very much about it when Alice suggested it
But when we got to Stoneham Lock and Dicky dragged the two heavy crowbars from among the elder bushes behind a fallen tree and began to pound away at the sluice of the lock Oswald felt it would not be manly to stand idly apart
So he took his turn
It was very hard work but we opened the lock sluices and we did not drop the crowbar into the lock either as I have heard of being done by older and sillier people
The water poured through the sluices all green and solid as if it had been cut with a knife and where it fell on the water underneath the white foam spread like a moving counterpane
When we had finished the lock we did the weirwhich is wheels and chains and the water pours through over the stones in a magnificent waterfall and sweeps out all round the weirpool
The sight of the foaming waterfalls was quite enough reward for our heavy labours even without the thought of the unspeakable gratitude that the bargees would feel to us when they got back to their barge and found her no longer a stickinthemud but bounding on the free bosom of the river
When we had opened all the sluices we gazed awhile on the beauties of Nature and then went home because we thought it would be more truly noble and good not to wait to be thanked for our kind and devoted actionand besides it was nearly dinnertime and Oswald thought it was going to rain
On the way home we agreed not to tell the others because it would be like boasting of our good acts
They will know all about it Noel said when they hear us being blessed by the grateful bargees and the tale of the Unknown Helpers is being told by every village fireside
And then they can write it in the Golden Deed book
So we went home
Denny and H O had thought better of it and they were fishing in the moat
They did not catch anything
Oswald is very weatherwiseat least so I have heard it said and he had thought there would be rain
There was
It came on while we were at dinnera great strong thundering rain coming down in sheetsthe first rain we had had since we came to the Moat House
We went to bed as usual
No presentiment of the coming awfulness clouded our young mirth
I remember Dicky and Oswald had a wrestling match and Oswald won
In the middle of the night Oswald was awakened by a hand on his face
It was a wet hand and very cold
Oswald hit out of course but a voice said in a hoarse hollow whisper Dont be a young ass
Have you got any matches
My beds full of water its pouring down from the ceiling
Oswalds first thoughts was that perhaps by opening those sluices we had flooded some secret passage which communicated with the top of Moat House but when he was properly awake he saw that this could not be on account of the river being so low
He had matches
He is as I said before a boy full of resources
He struck one and lit a candle and Dicky for it was indeed he gazed with Oswald at the amazing spectacle
Our bedroom floor was all wet in patches
Dickys bed stood in a pond and from the ceiling water was dripping in rich profusion at a dozen different places
There was a great wet patch in the ceiling and that was blue instead of white like the dry part and the water dripped from different parts of it
In a moment Oswald was quite unmanned
Krikey
he said in a heartbroken tone and remained an instant plunged in thought
What on earth are we to do
Dicky said
And really for a short time even Oswald did not know
It was a bloodcurdling event a regular facer
Alberts uncle had gone to London that day to stay till the next
Yet something must be done
The first thing was to rouse the unconscious others from their deep sleep because the water was beginning to drip on to their beds and though as yet they knew it not there was quite a pool on Noels bed just in the hollow behind where his knees were doubled up and one of H
O
s boots was full of water that surged wildly out when Oswald happened to kick it over
We woke thema difficult task but we did not shrink from it
Then we said Get up there is a flood
Wake up or you will be drowned in your beds
And its half past two by Oswalds watch
They awoke slowly and very stupidly
H O was the slowest and stupidest
The water poured faster and faster from the ceiling
We looked at each other and turned pale and Noel said Hadnt we better call Mrs Pettigrew
But Oswald simply couldnt consent to this
He could not get rid of the feeling that this was our fault somehow for meddling with the river though of course the clear star of reason told him it could not possibly be the case
We all devoted ourselves heart and soul to the work before us
We put the bath under the worst and wettest place and the jugs and basins under lesser streams and we moved the beds away to the dry end of the room
Ours is a long attic that runs right across the house
But the water kept coming in worse and worse
Our nightshirts were wet through so we got into our other shirts and knickerbockers but preserved bareness in our feet
And the floor kept on being half an inch deep in water however much we mopped it up
We emptied the basins out of the window as fast as they filled and we baled the bath with a jug without pausing to complain how hard the work was
All the same it was more exciting than you can think
But in Oswalds dauntless breast he began to see that they would HAVE to call Mrs Pettigrew
A new waterfall broke out between the firegrate and the mantelpiece and spread in devastating floods
Oswald is full of ingenious devices
I think I have said this before but it is quite true and perhaps even truer this time than it was last time I said it
He got a board out of the boxroom next door and rested one end in the chink between the fireplace and the mantelpiece and laid the other end on the back of a chair then we stuffed the rest of the chink with our nightgowns and laid a towel along the plank and behold a noble stream poured over the end of the board right into the bath we put there ready
It was like Niagara only not so round in shape
The first lot of water that came down the chimney was very dirty
The wind whistled outside
Noel said If its pipes burst and not the rain it will be nice for the waterrates
Perhaps it was only natural after this for Denny to begin with his everlasting poetry
He stopped mopping up the water to say By this the storm grew loud apace The waterrats were shrieking And in the howl of Heaven each face Grew black as they were speaking
Our faces were black and our hands too but we did not take any notice we only told him not to gas but to go on mopping
And he did
And we all did
But more and more water came pouring down
You would not believe so much could come off one roof
When at last it was agreed that Mrs Pettigrew must be awakened at all hazards we went and woke Alice to do the fatal errand
When she came back with Mrs Pettigrew in a nightcap and red flannel petticoat we held our breath
But Mrs Pettigrew did not even say What on earth have you children been up to NOW
as Oswald had feared
She simply sat down on my bed and said Oh dear
oh dear
oh dear
ever so many times
Then Denny said I once saw holes in a cottage roof
The man told me it was done when the water came through the thatch
He said if the water lies all about on the top of the ceiling it breaks it down but if you make holes the water will only come through the holes and you can put pails under the holes to catch it
So we made nine holes in the ceiling with the poker and put pails baths and tubs under and now there was not so much water on the floor
But we had to keep on working like niggers and Mrs Pettigrew and Alice worked the same
About five in the morning the rain stopped about seven the water did not come in so fast and presently it only dripped slowly
Our task was done
This is the only time I was ever up all night
I wish it happened oftener
We did not go back to bed then but dressed and went down
We all went to sleep in the afternoon though
Quite without meaning to
Oswald went up on the roof before breakfast to see if he could find the hole where the rain had come in
He did not find any hole but he found the cricket ball jammed in the top of a gutter pipe which he afterwards knew ran down inside the wall of the house and ran into the moat below
It seems a silly dodge but so it was
When the men went up after breakfast to see what had caused the flood they said there must have been a good halffoot of water on the leads the night before for it to have risen high enough to go above the edge of the lead and of course when it got above the lead there was nothing to stop it running down under it and soaking through the ceiling
The parapet and the roofs kept it from tumbling off down the sides of the house in the natural way
They said there must have been some obstruction in the pipe which ran down into the house but whatever it was the water had washed it away for they put wires down and the pipe was quite clear
While we were being told this Oswalds trembling fingers felt at the wet cricket ball in his pocket
And he KNEW but he COULD not tell
He heard them wondering what the obstruction could have been and all the time he had the obstruction in his pocket and never said a single word
I do not seek to defend him
But it really was an awful thing to have been the cause of and Mrs Pettigrew is but harsh and hasty
But this as Oswald knows too well is no excuse for his silent conduct
That night at tea Alberts uncle was rather silent too
At last he looked upon us with a glance full of intelligence and said There was a queer thing happened yesterday
You know there was an angling competition
The pen was kept full on purpose
Some mischievous busybody went and opened the sluices and let all the water out
The anglers holiday was spoiled
No the rain wouldnt have spoiled it anyhow Alice anglers LIKEe rain
The Rose and Crown dinner was half of it wasted because the anglers were so furious that a lot of them took the next train to town
And this is the worst of alla barge that was on the mud in the pen below was lifted and jammed across the river and the water tilted her over and her cargo is on the river bottom
It was coals
During this speech there were four of us who knew not where to turn our agitated glances
Some of us tried breadandbutter but it seemed dry and difficult and those who tried tea choked and spluttered and were sorry they had not let it alone
When the speech stopped Alice said It was us
And with deepest feelings she and the rest of us told all about it
Oswald did not say much
He was turning the obstruction round and round in his pocket and wishing with all his sentiments that he had owned up like a man when Alberts uncle asked him before tea to tell him all about what had happened during the night
When they had told all Alberts uncle told us four still more plainly and exactly what we had done and how much pleasure we had spoiled and how much of my fathers money we had wastedbecause he would have to pay for the coals being got up from the bottom of the river if they could be and if not for the price of the coals
And we saw it ALL
And when he had done Alice burst out crying over her plate and said Its no use
We HAVE tried to be good since weve been down here
You dont know how weve tried
And its all no use
I believe we are the wickedest children in the whole world and I wish we were all dead
This was a dreadful thing to say and of course the rest of us were all very shocked
But Oswald could not help looking at Alberts uncle to see how he would take it
He said very gravely My dear kiddie you ought to be sorry and I wish you to be sorry for what youve done
And you will be punished for it
We were our pocketmoney was stopped and we were forbidden to go near the river besides impositions miles long
But he went on you mustnt give up trying to be good
You are extremely naughty and tiresome as you know very well
Alice Dicky and Noel began to cry at about this time
But you are not the wickedest children in the world by any means
Then he stood up and straightened his collar and put his hands in his pockets
Youre very unhappy now he said and you deserve to be
But I will say one thing to you
Then he said a thing which Oswald at least will never forget though but little he deserved it with the obstruction in his pocket unowned up to all the time
He said I have known you all for four yearsand you know as well as I do how many scrapes Ive seen you in and out ofbut Ive never known one of you tell a lie and Ive never known one of you do a mean or dishonourable action
And when you have done wrong you are always sorry
Now this is something to stand firm on
Youll learn to be good in the other ways some day
He took his hands out of his pockets and his face looked different so that three of the four guilty creatures knew he was no longer adamant and they threw themselves into his arms
Dora Denny Daisy and H O of course were not in it and I think they thanked their stars
Oswald did not embrace Alberts uncle
He stood there and made up his mind he would go for a soldier
He gave the wet ball one last squeeze and took his hand out of his pocket and said a few words before going to enlist
He said The others may deserve what you say
I hope they do Im sure
But I dont because it was my rotten cricket ball that stopped up the pipe and caused the midnight flood in our bedroom
And I knew it quite early this morning
And I didnt own up
Oswald stood there covered with shame and he could feel the hateful cricket ball heavy and cold against the top of his leg through the pocket
Alberts uncle saidand his voice made Oswald hot all over but not with shamehe said I shall not tell you what he said
It is no ones business but Oswalds only I will own it made Oswald not quite so anxious to run away for a soldier as he had been before
That owning up was the hardest thing I ever did
They did put that in the Book of Golden Deeds though it was not a kind or generous act and did no good to anyone or anything except Oswalds own inside feelings
I must say I think they might have let it alone
Oswald would rather forget it
Especially as Dicky wrote it in and put this Oswald acted a lie which he knows is as bad as telling one
But he owned up when he neednt have and this condones his sin
We think he was a thorough brick to do it
Alice scratched this out afterwards and wrote the record of the incident in more flattering terms
But Dicky had used Fathers ink and she used Mrs Pettigrews so anyone can read his underneath the scratching outs
The others were awfully friendly to Oswald to show they agreed with Alberts uncle in thinking I deserved as much share as anyone in any praise there might be going
It was Dora who said it all came from my quarrelling with Noel about that rotten cricket ball but Alice gently yet firmly made her shut up
I let Noel have the ball
It had been thoroughly soaked but it dried all right
But it could never be the same to me after what it had done and what I had done
I hope you will try to agree with Alberts uncle and not think foul scorn of Oswald because of this story
Perhaps you have done things nearly as bad yourself sometimes
If you have you will know how owning up soothes the savage breast and alleviates the gnawings of remorse
If you have never done naughty acts I expect it is only because you never had the sense to think of anything
CHAPTER 6 THE CIRCUS The ones of us who had started the Society of the Wouldbegoods began at about this time to bother
They said we had not done anything really noble not worth speaking of that isfor over a week and that it was high time to begin againwith earnest endeavour Daisy said
So then Oswald said All right but there ought to be an end to everything
Lets each of us think of one really noble and unselfish act and the others shall help to work it out like we did when we were Treasure Seekers
Then when everybodys had their goin well write every single thing down in the Golden Deed book and well draw two lines in red ink at the bottom like Father does at the end of an account
And after that if anyone wants to be good they can jolly well be good on our own if at all
The ones who had made the Society did not welcome this wise idea but Dicky and Oswald were firm
So they had to agree
When Oswald is really firm opposingness and obstinacy have to give way
Dora said It would be a noble action to have all the schoolchildren from the village and give them tea and games in the paddock
They would think it so nice and good of us
But Dicky showed her that this would not be OUR good act but Fathers because he would have to pay for the tea and he had already stood us the keepsakes for the soldiers as well as having to stump up heavily over the coal barge
And it is in vain being noble and generous when someone else is paying for it all the time even if it happens to be your father
Then three others had ideas at the same time and began to explain what they were
We were all in the diningroom and perhaps we were making a bit of a row
Anyhow Oswald for one does not blame Alberts uncle for opening his door and saying I suppose I must not ask for complete silence
That were too much
But if you could whistle or stamp with your feet or shriek or howlanything to vary the monotony of your wellsustained conversation
Oswald said kindly Were awfully sorry
Are you busy
Busy
said Alberts uncle
My heroine is now hesitating on the verge of an act which for good or ill must influence her whole subsequent career
You wouldnt like her to decide in the middle of such a row that she cant hear herself think
We said No we wouldnt
Then he said If any outdoor amusement should commend itself to you this bright midsummer day
So we all went out
Then Daisy whispered to Dorathey always hang together
Daisy is not nearly so whitemicey as she was at first but she still seems to fear the deadly ordeal of public speaking
Dora said Daisys idea is a game thatll take us all day
She thinks keeping out of the way when hes making his heroine decide right would be a noble act and fit to write in the Golden Book and we might as well be playing something at the same time
We all said Yes but what
There was a silent interval
Speak up Daisy my child
Oswald said fear not to lay bare the utmost thoughts of that faithful heart
Daisy giggled
Our own girls never gigglethey laugh right out or hold their tongues
Their kind brothers have taught them this
Then Daisy said If we could have a sort of play to keep us out of the way
I once read a story about an animal race
Everybody had an animal and they had to go how they liked and the one that got in first got the prize
There was a tortoise in it and a rabbit and a peacock and sheep and dogs and a kitten
This proposal left us cold as Alberts uncle says because we knew there could not be any prize worth bothering about
And though you may be ever ready and willing to do anything for nothing yet if theres going to be a prize there must BE a prize and theres an end of it
Thus the idea was not followed up
Dicky yawned and said Lets go into the barn and make a fort
So we did with straw
It does not hurt straw to be messed about with like it does hay
The downstairsI mean downladderpart of the barn was fun too especially for Pincher
There was as good ratting there as you could wish to see
Martha tried it but she could not help running kindly beside the rat as if she was in double harness with it
This is the noble bulldogs gentle and affectionate nature coming out
We all enjoyed the ratting that day but it ended as usual in the girls crying because of the poor rats
Girls cannot help this we must not be waxy with them on account of it they have their nature the same as bulldogs have and it is this that makes them so useful in smoothing the pillows of the sickbed and tending wounded heroes
However the forts and Pincher and the girls crying and having to be thumped on the back passed the time very agreeably till dinner
There was roast mutton with onion sauce and a rolypoly pudding
Alberts uncle said we had certainly effaced ourselves effectually which means we hadnt bothered
So we determined to do the same during the afternoon for he told us his heroine was by no means out of the wood yet
And at first it was easy
Jam roly gives you a peaceful feeling and you do not at first care if you never play any runabout game ever any more
But after a while the torpor begins to pass away
Oswald was the first to recover from his
He had been lying on his front part in the orchard but now he turned over on his back and kicked his legs up and said I say look here lets do something
Daisy looked thoughtful
She was chewing the soft yellow parts of grass but I could see she was still thinking about that animal race
So I explained to her that it would be very poor fun without a tortoise and a peacock and she saw this though not willingly
It was H O who said Doing anything with animals is prime if they only will
Lets have a circus
At the word the last thought of the pudding faded from Oswalds memory and he stretched himself sat up and said Bully for H O
Lets
The others also threw off the heavy weight of memory and sat up and said Lets
too
Never never in all our lives had we had such a gay galaxy of animals at our command
The rabbits and the guineapigs and even all the bright glasseyed stuffed denizens of our latelamented jungle paled into insignificance before the number of live things on the farm
I hope you do not think that the words I use are getting too long
I know they are the right words
And Alberts uncle says your style is always altered a bit by what you read
And I have been reading the Vicomte de Bragelonne
Nearly all my new words come out of those
The worst of a circus is Dora said that youve got to teach the animals things
A circus where the performing creatures hadnt learned performing would be a bit silly
Lets give up a week to teaching them and then have the circus
Some people have no idea of the value of time
And Dora is one of those who do not understand that when you want to do a thing you do want to and not to do something else and perhaps your own thing a week later
Oswald said the first thing was to collect the performing animals
Then perhaps he said we may find that they have hidden talents hitherto unsuspected by their harsh masters
So Denny took a pencil and wrote a list of the animals required
This is it LIST OF ANIMALS REQUISITE FOR THE CIRCUS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 1 Bull for bullfight
1 Horse for ditto if possible
1 Goat to do Alpine feats of daring
1 Donkey to play seesaw
2 White pigsone to be Learned and the other to play with the clown
Turkeys as many as possible because they can make a noise that sounds like an audience applauding
The dogs for any odd parts
1 Large black pigto be the Elephant in the procession
Calves several to be camels and to stand on tubs
Daisy ought to have been captain because it was partly her idea but she let Oswald be because she is of a retiring character
Oswald said The first thing is to get all the creatures together the paddock at the side of the orchard is the very place because the hedge is good all round
When weve got the performers all there well make a programme and then dress for our parts
Its a pity there wont be any audience but the turkeys
We took the animals in their right order according to Dennys list
The bull was the first
He is black
He does not live in the cowhouse with the other horned people he has a house all to himself two fields away
Oswald and Alice went to fetch him
They took a halter to lead the bull by and a whip not to hurt the bull with but just to make him mind
The others were to try to get one of the horses while we were gone
Oswald as usual was full of bright ideas
I daresay he said the bull will be shy at first and hell have to be goaded into the arena
But goads hurt Alice said
They dont hurt the bull Oswald said his powerful hide is too thick
Then why does he attend to it Alice asked if it doesnt hurt
Properlybroughtup bulls attend because they know they ought Oswald said
I think I shall ride the bull the brave boy went on
A bullfight where an intrepid rider appears on the bull sharing its joys and sorrows
It would be something quite new
You cant ride bulls Alice said at least not if their backs are sharp like cows
But Oswald thought he could
The bull lives in a house made of wood and prickly furze bushes and he has a yard to his house
You cannot climb on the roof of his house at all comfortably
When we got there he was half in his house and half out in his yard and he was swinging his tail because of the flies which bothered
It was a very hot day
Youll see Alice said he wont want a goad
Hell be so glad to get out for a walk hell drop his head in my hand like a tame fawn and follow me lovingly all the way
Oswald called to him
He said Bull
Bull
Bull
Bull
because we did not know the animals real name
The bull took no notice then Oswald picked up a stone and threw it at the bull not angrily but just to make it pay attention
But the bull did not pay a farthings worth of it
So then Oswald leaned over the iron gate of the bulls yard and just flicked the bull with the whiplash
And then the bull DID pay attention
He started when the lash struck him then suddenly he faced round uttering a roar like that of the wounded King of Beasts and putting his head down close to his feet he ran straight at the iron gate where we were standing
Alice and Oswald mechanically turned away they did not wish to annoy the bull any more and they ran as fast as they could across the field so as not to keep the others waiting
As they ran across the field Oswald had a dreamlike fancy that perhaps the bull had rooted up the gate with one paralysing blow and was now tearing across the field after him and Alice with the broken gate balanced on its horns
We climbed the stile quickly and looked back the bull was still on the right side of the gate
Oswald said I think well do without the bull
He did not seem to want to come
We must be kind to dumb animals
Alice said between laughing and crying Oh Oswald how can you
But we did do without the bull and we did not tell the others how we had hurried to get back
We just said The bull didnt seem to care about coming
The others had not been idle
They had got old Clover the carthorse but she would do nothing but graze so we decided not to use her in the bullfight but to let her be the Elephant
The Elephants is a nice quiet part and she was quite big enough for a young one
Then the black pig could be Learned and the other two could be something else
They had also got the goat he was tethered to a young tree
The donkey was there
Denny was leading him in the halter
The dogs were there of coursethey always are
So now we only had to get the turkeys for the applause and the calves and pigs
The calves were easy to get because they were in their own house
There were five
And the pigs were in their houses too
We got them out after long and patient toil and persuaded them that they wanted to go into the paddock where the circus was to be
This is done by pretending to drive them the other way
A pig only knows two waysthe way you want him to go and the other
But the turkeys knew thousands of different ways and tried them all
They made such an awful row we had to drop all ideas of ever hearing applause from their lips so we came away and left them
Never mind H O said theyll be sorry enough afterwards nasty unobliging things because now they wont see the circus
I hope the other animals will tell them about it
While the turkeys were engaged in baffling the rest of us Dicky had found three sheep who seemed to wish to join the glad throng so we let them
Then we shut the gate of the paddock and left the dumb circus performers to make friends with each other while we dressed
Oswald and H O were to be clowns
It is quite easy with Alberts uncles pyjamas and flour on your hair and face and the red they do the brickfloors with
Alice had very short pink and white skirts and roses in her hair and round her dress
Her dress was the pink calico and white muslin stuff off the dressingtable in the girls room fastened with pins and tied round the waist with a small bath towel
She was to be the Dauntless Equestrienne and to give her enhancing act a barebacked daring riding either a pig or a sheep whichever we found was freshest and most skittish
Dora was dressed for the Haute ecole which means a ridinghabit and a high hat
She took Dicks topper that he wears with his Etons and a skirt of Mrs Pettigrews
Daisy dressed the same as Alice taking the muslin from Mrs Pettigrews dressingtable with out saying anything beforehand
None of us would have advised this and indeed we were thinking of trying to put it back when Denny and Noel who were wishing to look like highwaymen with brownpaper topboots and slouch hats and Turkish towel cloaks suddenly stopped dressing and gazed out of the window
Krikey
said Dick come on Oswald
and he bounded like an antelope from the room
Oswald and the rest followed casting a hasty glance through the window
Noel had got brownpaper boots too and a Turkish towel cloak
H O had been waiting for Dora to dress him up for the other clown
He had only his shirt and knickerbockers and his braces on
He came down as he wasas indeed we all did
And no wonder for in the paddock where the circus was to be a bloodthrilling thing had transpired
The dogs were chasing the sheep
And we had now lived long enough in the country to know the fell nature of our dogs improper conduct
We all rushed into the paddock calling to Pincher and Martha and Lady
Pincher came almost at once
He is a wellbroughtup dogOswald trained him
Martha did not seem to hear
She is awfully deaf but she did not matter so much because the sheep could walk away from her easily
She has no pace and no wind
But Lady is a deerhound
She is used to pursuing that fleet and antlered pride of the forestthe stagand she can go like billyo
She was now far away in a distant region of the paddock with a fat sheep just before her in full flight
I am sure if ever anybodys eyes did start out of their heads with horror like in narratives of adventure ours did then
There was a moments pause of speechless horror
We expected to see Lady pull down her quarry and we know what a lot of money a sheep costs to say nothing of its own personal feelings
Then we started to run for all we were worth
It is hard to run swiftly as the arrow from the bow when you happen to be wearing pyjamas belonging to a grownup personas I wasbut even so I beat Dicky
He said afterwards it was because his brownpaper boots came undone and tripped him up
Alice came in third
She held on the dressingtable muslin and ran jolly well
But ere we reached the fatal spot all was very nearly up with the sheep
We heard a plop Lady stopped and looked round
She must have heard us bellowing to her as we ran
Then she came towards us prancing with happiness but we said Down
and Bad dog
and ran sternly on
When we came to the brook which forms the northern boundary of the paddock we saw the sheep struggling in the water
It is not very deep and I believe the sheep could have stood up and been well in its depth if it had liked but it would not try
It was a steepish bank
Alice and I got down and stuck our legs into the water and then Dicky came down and the three of us hauled that sheep up by its shoulders till it could rest on Alice and me as we sat on the bank
It kicked all the time we were hauling
It gave one extra kick at last that raised it up and I tell you that sopping wet heavy panting silly donkey of a sheep sat there on our laps like a pet dog and Dicky got his shoulder under it at the back and heaved constantly to keep it from flumping off into the water again while the others fetched the shepherd
When the shepherd came he called us every name you can think of and then he said Good thing master didnt come along
He would ha called you some tidy names
He got the sheep out and took it and the others away
And the calves too
He did not seem to care about the other performing animals
Alice Oswald and Dick had had almost enough circus for just then so we sat in the sun and dried ourselves and wrote the programme of the circus
This was it PROGRAMME 1
Startling leap from the lofty precipice by the performing sheep
Real water and real precipice
The gallant rescue
O
A and D Bastable
We thought we might as well put that in though it was over and had happened accidentally
2
Graceful barebacked equestrienne act on the trained pig Eliza
A Bastable
3
Amusing clown interlude introducing trained dog Pincher and the other white pig
H O and O Bastable
4
The SeeSaw
Trained donkeys
H O said we had only one donkey so Dicky said H O could be the other
When peace was restored we went on to 5
5
Elegant equestrian act by D Bastable
Haute ecole on Clover the incomparative trained elephant from the plains of Venezuela
6
Alpine feat of daring
The climbing of the Andes by Billy the wellknown acrobatic goat
We thought we could make the Andes out of hurdles and things and so we could have but for what always happens
This is the unexpected
This is a saying Father told mebut I see I am three deep in brackets so I will close them before I get into any more
7
The Black but Learned Pig
I daresay he knows something Alice said if we can only find out what
We DID find out all too soon
We could not think of anything else and our things were nearly dryall except Dicks brownpaper topboots which were mingled with the gurgling waters of the brook
We went back to the seat of actionwhich was the iron trough where the sheep have their salt putand began to dress up the creatures
We had just tied the Union Jack we made out of Daisys flannel petticoat and cetera when we gave the soldiers the baccy round the waist of the Black and Learned Pig when we heard screams from the back part of the house and suddenly we saw that Billy the acrobatic goat had got loose from the tree we had tied him to
He had eaten all the parts of its bark that he could get at but we did not notice it until next day when led to the spot by a grownup
The gate of the paddock was open
The gate leading to the bridge that goes over the moat to the back door was open too
We hastily proceeded in the direction of the screams and guided by the sound threaded our way into the kitchen
As we went Noel ever fertile in melancholy ideas said he wondered whether Mrs Pettigrew was being robbed or only murdered
In the kitchen we saw that Noel was wrong as usual
It was neither
Mrs Pettigrew screaming like a steamsiren and waving a broom occupied the foreground
In the distance the maid was shrieking in a hoarse and monotonous way and trying to shut herself up inside a clotheshorse on which washing was being aired
On the dresserwhich he had ascended by a chairwas Billy the acrobatic goat doing his Alpine daring act
He had found out his Andes for himself and even as we gazed he turned and tossed his head in a way that showed us some mysterious purpose was hidden beneath his calm exterior
The next moment he put his offhorn neatly behind the end plate of the next to the bottom row and ran it along against the wall
The plates fell crashing on to the soup tureen and vegetable dishes which adorned the lower range of the Andes
Mrs Pettigrews screams were almost drowned in the discarding crash and crackle of the falling avalanche of crockery
Oswald though stricken with horror and polite regret preserved the most dauntless coolness
Disregarding the mop which Mrs Pettigrew kept on poking at the goat in a timid yet cross way he sprang forward crying out to his trusty followers Stand by to catch him
But Dick had thought of the same thing and ere Oswald could carry out his longcherished and generallike design Dicky had caught the goats legs and tripped it up
The goat fell against another row of plates righted itself hastily in the gloomy ruins of the soup tureen and the sauceboats and then fell again this time towards Dicky
The two fell heavily on the ground together
The trusty followers had been so struck by the daring of Dicky and his lionhearted brother that they had not stood by to catch anything
The goat was not hurt but Dicky had a sprained thumb and a lump on his head like a black marble doorknob
He had to go to bed
I will draw a veil and asterisks over what Mrs Pettigrew said
Also Alberts uncle who was brought to the scene of ruin by her screams
Few words escaped our lips
There are times when it is not wise to argue however little what has occurred is really our fault
When they had said what they deemed enough and we were let go we all went out
Then Alice said distractedly in a voice which she vainly strove to render firm Lets give up the circus
Lets put the toys back in the boxesno I dont mean thatthe creatures in their placesand drop the whole thing
I want to go and read to Dicky
Oswald has a spirit that no reverses can depreciate
He hates to be beaten
But he gave in to Alice as the others said so too and we went out to collect the performing troop and sort it out into its proper places
Alas
we came too late
In the interest we had felt about whether Mrs Pettigrew was the abject victim of burglars or not we had left both gates open again
The old horseI mean the trained elephant from Venezuelawas there all right enough
The dogs we had beaten and tied up after the first act when the intrepid sheep bounded as it says in the programme
The two white pigs were there but the donkey was gone
We heard his hoofs down the road growing fainter and fainter in the direction of the Rose and Crown
And just round the gatepost we saw a flash of red and white and blue and black that told us with dumb signification that the pig was off in exactly the opposite direction
Why couldnt they have gone the same way
But no one was a pig and the other was a donkey as Denny said afterwards
Daisy and H O started after the donkey the rest of us with one accord pursued the pigI dont know why
It trotted quietly down the road it looked very black against the white road and the ends on the top where the Union Jack was tied bobbed brightly as it trotted
At first we thought it would be easy to catch up to it
This was an error
When we ran faster it ran faster when we stopped it stopped and looked round at us and nodded
I daresay you wont swallow this but you may safely
Its as true as true and sos all that about the goat
I give you my sacred word of honour
I tell you the pig nodded as much as to say Oh yes
You think you will but you wont
and then as soon as we moved again off it went
That pig led us on and on oer miles and miles of strange country
One thing it did keep to the roads
When we met people which wasnt often we called out to them to help us but they only waved their arms and roared with laughter
One chap on a bicycle almost tumbled off his machine and then he got off it and propped it against a gate and sat down in the hedge to laugh properly
You remember Alice was still dressed up as the gay equestrienne in the dressingtable pink and white with rosy garlands now very droopy and she had no stockings on only white sandshoes because she thought they would be easier than boots for balancing on the pig in the graceful barebacked act
Oswald was attired in red paint and flour and pyjamas for a clown
It is really IMPOSSIBLE to run speedfully in another mans pyjamas so Oswald had taken them off and wore his own brown knickerbockers belonging to his Norfolks
He had tied the pyjamas round his neck to carry them easily
He was afraid to leave them in a ditch as Alice suggested because he did not know the roads and for aught he recked they might have been infested with footpads
If it had been his own pyjamas it would have been different
Im going to ask for pyjamas next winter they are so useful in many ways
Noel was a highwayman in brownpaper gaiters and bath towels and a cocked hat of newspaper
I dont know how he kept it on
And the pig was encircled by the dauntless banner of our country
All the same I think if I had seen a band of youthful travellers in bitter distress about a pig I should have tried to lend a helping hand and not sat roaring in the hedge no matter how the travellers and the pig might have been dressed
It was hotter than anyone would believe who has never had occasion to hunt the pig when dressed for quite another part
The flour got out of Oswalds hair into his eyes and his mouth
His brow was wet with what the village blacksmiths was wet with and not his fair brow alone
It ran down his face and washed the red off in streaks and when he rubbed his eyes he only made it worse
Alice had to run holding the equestrienne skirts on with both hands and I think the brownpaper boots bothered Noel from the first
Dora had her skirt over her arm and carried the topper in her hand
It was no use to tell ourselves it was a wild boar huntwe were long past that
At last we met a man who took pity on us
He was a kindhearted man
I think perhaps he had a pig of his ownor perhaps children
Honour to his name
He stood in the middle of the road and waved his arms
The pig rightwheeled through a gate into a private garden and cantered up the drive
We followed
What else were we to do I should like to know
The Learned Black Pig seemed to know its way
It turned first to the right and then to the left and emerged on a lawn
Now all together
cried Oswald mustering his failing voice to give the word of command
Surround himcut off his retreat
We almost surrounded him
He edged off towards the house
Now weve got him
cried the crafty Oswald as the pig got on to a bed of yellow pansies close against the red house wall
All would even then have been well but Denny at the last shrank from meeting the pig face to face in a manly way
He let the pig pass him and the next moment with a squeak that said There now
as plain as words the pig bolted into a French window
The pursuers halted not
This was no time for trivial ceremony
In another moment the pig was a captive
Alice and Oswald had their arms round him under the ruins of a table that had had teacups on it and around the hunters and their prey stood the startled members of a parish society for making clothes for the poor heathen that that pig had led us into the very midst of
They were reading a missionary report or something when we ran our quarry to earth under their table
Even as he crossed the threshold I heard something about black brothers being already white to the harvest
All the ladies had been sewing flannel things for the poor blacks while the curate read aloud to them
You think they screamed when they saw the Pig and Us
You are right
On the whole I cannot say that the missionary people behaved badly
Oswald explained that it was entirely the pigs doing and asked pardon quite properly for any alarm the ladies had felt and Alice said how sorry we were but really it was NOT our fault this time
The curate looked a bit nasty but the presence of ladies made him keep his hot blood to himself
When we had explained we said Might we go
The curate said The sooner the better
But the Lady of the House asked for our names and addresses and said she should write to our Father
She did and we heard of it too
They did not do anything to us as Oswald at one time believed to be the curates idea
They let us go
And we went after we had asked for a piece of rope to lead the pig by
In case it should come back into your nice room Alice said
And that would be such a pity wouldnt it
A little girl in a starched pinafore was sent for the rope
And as soon as the pig had agreed to let us tie it round his neck we came away
The scene in the drawingroom had not been long
The pig went slowly Like the meandering brook Denny said
just by the gate the shrubs rustled and opened and the little girl came out
Her pinafore was full of cake
Here she said
You must be hungry if youve come all that way
I think they might have given you some tea after all the trouble youve had
We took the cake with correct thanks
I wish I could play at circuses she said
Tell me about it
We told her while we ate the cake and when we had done she said perhaps it was better to hear about than do especially the goats part and Dickys
But I do wish auntie had given you tea she said
We told her not to be too hard on her aunt because you have to make allowances for grownup people
When we parted she said she would never forget us and Oswald gave her his pocket buttonhook and corkscrew combined for a keepsake
Dickys act with the goat which is true and no kid was the only thing out of that day that was put in the Golden Deed book and he put that in himself while we were hunting the pig
Alice and me capturing the pig was never put in
We would scorn to write our own good actions but I suppose Dicky was dull with us all away and you must pity the dull and not blame them
I will not seek to unfold to you how we got the pig home or how the donkey was caught that was poor sport compared to the pig
Nor will I tell you a word of all that was said and done to the intrepid hunters of the Black and Learned
I have told you all the interesting part
Seek not to know the rest
It is better buried in obliquity
CHAPTER 7 BEING BEAVERS OR THE YOUNG EXPLORERS ARCTIC OR OTHERWISE You read in books about the pleasures of London and about how people who live in the country long for the gay whirl of fashion in town because the country is so dull
I do not agree with this at all
In London or at any rate Lewisham nothing happens unless you make it happen or if it happens it doesnt happen to you and you dont know the people it does happen to
But in the country the most interesting events occur quite freely and they seem to happen to you as much as to anyone else
Very often quite without your doing anything to help
The natural and right ways of earning your living in the country are much jollier than town ones too sowing and reaping and doing things with animals are much better sport than fishmongering or bakering or oilshopping and those sort of things except of course a plumbers and gasfitters and he is the same in town or countrymost interesting and like an engineer
I remember what a nice man it was that came to cut the gas off once at our old house in Lewisham when my fathers business was feeling so poorly
He was a true gentleman and gave Oswald and Dicky over two yards and a quarter of good lead piping and a brass tap that only wanted a washer and a whole handful of screws to do what we liked with
We screwed the back door up with the screws I remember one night when Eliza was out without leave
There was an awful row
We did not mean to get her into trouble
We only thought it would be amusing for her to find the door screwed up when she came down to take in the milk in the morning
But I must not say any more about the Lewisham house
It is only the pleasures of memory and nothing to do with being beavers or any sort of exploring
I think Dora and Daisy are the kind of girls who will grow up very good and perhaps marry missionaries
I am glad Oswalds destiny looks at present as if it might be different
We made two expeditions to discover the source of the Nile or the North Pole and owing to their habit of sticking together and doing dull and praiseable things like sewing and helping with the cooking and taking invalid delicacies to the poor and indignant Daisy and Dora were wholly out of it both times though Doras foot was now quite well enough to have gone to the North Pole or the Equator either
They said they did not mind the first time because they like to keep themselves clean it is another of their queer ways
And they said they had had a better time than us
It was only a clergyman and his wife who called and hot cakes for tea
The second time they said they were lucky not to have been in it
And perhaps they were right
But let me to my narrating
I hope you will like it
I am going to try to write it a different way like the books they give you for a prize at a girls schoolI mean a young ladies school of coursenot a high school
High schools are not nearly so silly as some other kinds
Here goes Ah me
sighed a slender maiden of twelve summers removing her elegant hat and passing her tapery fingers lightly through her fair tresses how sad it isis it notto see ablebodied youths and young ladies wasting the precious summer hours in idleness and luxury
The maiden frowned reproachingly but yet with earnest gentleness at the group of youths and maidens who sat beneath an umbragipeaous beech tree and ate black currants
Dear brothers and sisters the blushing girl went on could we not even now at the eleventh hour turn to account these wasted lives of ours and seek some occupation at once improving and agreeable
I do not quite follow your meaning dear sister replied the cleverest of her brothers on whose brow Its no use
I cant write like these books
I wonder how the books authors can keep it up
What really happened was that we were all eating black currants in the orchard out of a cabbage leaf and Alice said I say look here lets do something
Its simply silly to waste a day like this
Its just on eleven
Come on
And Oswald said Where to
This was the beginning of it
The moat that is all round our house is fed by streams
One of them is a sort of open overflow pipe from a goodsized stream that flows at the other side of the orchard
It was this stream that Alice meant when she said Why not go and discover the source of the Nile
Of course Oswald knows quite well that the source of the real live Egyptian Nile is no longer buried in that mysteriousness where it lurked undisturbed for such a long time
But he was not going to say so
It is a great thing to know when not to say things
Why not have it an Arctic expedition
said Dicky then we could take an iceaxe and live on blubber and things
Besides it sounds cooler
Vote
vote
cried Oswald
So we did
Oswald Alice Noel and Denny voted for the river of the ibis and the crocodile
Dicky H O and the other girls for the region of perennial winter and rich blubber
So Alice said We can decide as we go
Lets start anyway
The question of supplies had now to be gone into
Everybody wanted to take something different and nobody thought the other peoples things would be the slightest use
It is sometimes thus even with grownup expeditions
So then Oswald who is equal to the hardest emergency that ever emerged yet said Lets each get what we like
The secret storehouse can be the shed in the corner of the stableyard where we got the door for the raft
Then the captain can decide whos to take what
This was done
You may think it but the work of a moment to fit out an expedition but this is not so especially when you know not whether your exploring party is speeding to Central Africa or merely to the world of icebergs and the Polar bear
Dicky wished to take the woodaxe the coal hammer a blanket and a mackintosh
H O brought a large faggot in case we had to light fires and a pair of old skates he had happened to notice in the boxroom in case the expedition turned out icy
Noel had nicked a dozen boxes of matches a spade and a trowel and had also obtainedI know not by what meansa jar of pickled onions
Denny had a walkingstickwe cant break him of walking with ita book to read in case he got tired of being a discoverer a butterfly net and a box with a cork in it a tennis ball if we happened to want to play rounders in the pauses of exploring two towels and an umbrella in the event of camping or if the river got big enough to bathe in or to be fallen into
Alice had a comforter for Noel in case we got late a pair of scissors and needle and cotton two whole candles in case of caves
And she had thoughtfully brought the tablecloth off the small table in the diningroom so that we could make all the things up into one bundle and take it in turns to carry it
Oswald had fastened his master mind entirely on grub
Nor had the others neglected this
All the stores for the expedition were put down on the tablecloth and the corners tied up
Then it was more than even Oswalds muscley arms could raise from the ground so we decided not to take it but only the bestselected grub
The rest we hid in the straw loft for there are many ups and downs in life and grub is grub at any time and so are stores of all kinds
The pickled onions we had to leave but not for ever
Then Dora and Daisy came along with their arms round each others necks as usual like a picture on a grocers almanac and said they werent coming
It was as I have said a blazing hot day and there were differences of opinion among the explorers about what eatables we ought to have taken and H O had lost one of his garters and wouldnt let Alice tie it up with her handkerchief which the gentle sister was quite willing to do
So it was a rather gloomy expedition that set off that bright sunny day to seek the source of the river where Cleopatra sailed in Shakespeare or the frozen plains Mr Nansen wrote that big book about
But the balmy calm of peaceful Nature soon made the others less crossOswald had not been cross exactly but only disinclined to do anything the others wantedand by the time we had followed the stream a little way and had seen a waterrat and shied a stone or two at him harmony was restored
We did not hit the rat
You will understand that we were not the sort of people to have lived so long near a stream without plumbing its depths
Indeed it was the same stream the sheep took its daring jump into the day we had the circus
And of course we had often paddled in itin the shallower parts
But now our hearts were set on exploring
At least they ought to have been but when we got to the place where the stream goes under a wooden sheepbridge Dicky cried A camp
a camp
and we were all glad to sit down at once
Not at all like real explorers who know no rest day or night till they have got there whether its the North Pole or the central point of the part marked Desert of Sahara on oldfashioned maps
The food supplies obtained by various members were good and plenty of it
Cake hard eggs sausagerolls currants lemon cheesecakes raisins and cold apple dumplings
It was all very decent but Oswald could not help feeling that the source of the Nile or North Pole was a long way off and perhaps nothing much when you got there
So he was not wholly displeased when Denny said as he lay kicking into the bank when the things to eat were all gone I believe this is clay did you ever make huge platters and bowls out of clay and dry them in the sun
Some people did in a book called Foul Play and I believe they baked turtles or oysters or something at the same time
He took up a bit of clay and began to mess it about like you do putty when you get hold of a bit
And at once the heavy gloom that had hung over the explorers became expelled and we all got under the shadow of the bridge and messed about with clay
It will be jolly
Alice said and we can give the huge platters to poor cottagers who are short of the usual sorts of crockery
That would really be a very golden deed
It is harder than you would think when you read about it to make huge platters with clay
It flops about as soon as you get it any size unless you keep it much too thick and then when you turn up the edges they crack
Yet we did not mind the trouble
And we had all got our shoes and stockings off
It is impossible to go on being cross when your feet are in cold water and there is something in the smooth messiness of clay and not minding how dirty you get that would soothe the savagest breast that ever beat
After a bit though we gave up the idea of the huge platter and tried little things
We made some plattersthey were like flowerpot saucers and Alice made a bowl by doubling up her fists and getting Noel to slab the clay on outside
Then they smoothed the thing inside and out with wet fingers and it was a bowlat least they said it was
When wed made a lot of things we set them in the sun to dry and then it seemed a pity not to do the thing thoroughly
So we made a bonfire and when it had burnt down we put our pots on the soft white hot ashes among the little red sparks and kicked the ashes over them and heaped more fuel over the top
It was a fine fire
Then teatime seemed as if it ought to be near and we decided to come back next day and get our pots
As we went home across the fields Dicky looked back and said The bonfires going pretty strong
We looked
It was
Great flames were rising to heaven against the evening sky
And we had left ita smouldering flat heap
The clay must have caught alight H O said
Perhaps its the kind that burns
I know Ive heard of fireclay
And theres another sort you can eat
Oh shut up
Dicky said with anxious scorn
With one accord we turned back
We all felt THE feelingthe one that means something fatal being up and it being your fault
Perhaps Alice said a beautiful young lady in a muslin dress was passing by and a spark flew on to her and now she is rolling in agony enveloped in flames
We could not see the fire now because of the corner of the wood but we hoped Alice was mistaken
But when we got in sight of the scene of our pottering industry we saw it was as bad nearly as Alices wild dream
For the wooden fence leading up to the bridge had caught fire and it was burning like billy oh
Oswald started to run so did the others
As he ran he said to himself This is no time to think about your clothes
Oswald be bold
And he was
Arrived at the site of the conflagration he saw that caps or straw hats full of water however quickly and perseveringly given would never put the bridge out and his eventful past life made him know exactly the sort of wigging you get for an accident like this
So he said Dicky soak your jacket and mine in the stream and chuck them along
Alice stand clear or your silly girls clothesll catch as sure as fate
Dicky and Oswald tore off their jackets so did Denny but we would not let him and H O wet theirs
Then the brave Oswald advanced warily to the end of the burning rails and put his wet jacket over the end bit like a linseed poultice on the throat of a suffering invalid who has got bronchitis
The burning wood hissed and smouldered and Oswald fell back almost choked with the smoke
But at once he caught up the other wet jacket and put it on another place and of course it did the trick as he had known it would do
But it was a long job and the smoke in his eyes made the young hero obliged to let Dicky and Denny take a turn as they had bothered to do from the first
At last all was safe the devouring element was conquered
We covered up the beastly bonfire with clay to keep it from getting into mischief again and then Alice said Now we must go and tell
Of course Oswald said shortly
He had meant to tell all the time
So we went to the farmer who has the Moat House Farm and we went at once because if you have any news like that to tell it only makes it worse if you wait about
When we had told him he said You little 
I shall not say what he said besides that because I am sure he must have been sorry for it next Sunday when he went to church if not before
We did not take any notice of what he said but just kept on saying how sorry we were and he did not take our apology like a man but only said he daresayed just like a woman does
Then he went to look at his bridge and we went in to our tea
The jackets were never quite the same again
Really great explorers would never be discouraged by the daresaying of a farmer still less by his calling them names he ought not to
Alberts uncle was away so we got no double slating and next day we started again to discover the source of the river of cataracts or the region of mountainlike icebergs
We set out heavily provisioned with a large cake Daisy and Dora had made themselves and six bottles of gingerbeer
I think real explorers most likely have their gingerbeer in something lighter to carry than stone bottles
Perhaps they have it by the cask which would come cheaper and you could make the girls carry it on their back like in pictures of the daughters of regiments
We passed the scene of the devouring conflagration and the thought of the fire made us so thirsty we decided to drink the gingerbeer and leave the bottles in a place of concealment
Then we went on determined to reach our destination Tropic or Polar that day
Denny and H O wanted to stop and try to make a fashionable wateringplace at that part where the stream spreads out like a smallsized sea but Noel said No
We did not like fashionableness
YOU ought to at any rate Denny said
A Mr Collins wrote an Ode to the Fashions and he was a great poet
The poet Milton wrote a long book about Satan Noel said but Im not bound to like HIM
I think it was smart of Noel
People arent obliged to like everything they write about even let alone read Alice said
Look at Ruin seize thee ruthless king
and all the pieces of poetry about war and tyrants and slaughtered saintsand the one you made yourself about the black beetle Noel
By this time we had got by the pondy place and the danger of delay was past but the others went on talking about poetry for quite a field and a half as we walked along by the banks of the stream
The stream was broad and shallow at this part and you could see the stones and gravel at the bottom and millions of baby fishes and a sort of skatingspiders walking about on the top of the water
Denny said the water must be ice for them to be able to walk on it and this showed we were getting near the North Pole
But Oswald had seen a kingfisher by the wood and he said it was an ibis so this was even
When Oswald had had as much poetry as he could bear he said Lets be beavers and make a dam
And everybody was so hot they agreed joyously and soon our clothes were tucked up as far as they could go and our legs looked green through the water though they were pink out of it
Making a dam is jolly good fun though laborious as books about beavers take care to let you know
Dicky said it must be Canada if we were beavers and so it was on the way to the Polar system but Oswald pointed to his heated brow and Dicky owned it was warm for Polar regions
He had brought the iceaxe it is called the wood chopper sometimes and Oswald ever ready and able to command set him and Denny to cut turfs from the bank while we heaped stones across the stream
It was clayey here or of course dam making would have been vain even for the besttrained beaver
When we had made a ridge of stones we laid turfs against themnearly across the stream leaving about two feet for the water to go throughthen more stones and then lumps of clay stamped down as hard as we could
The industrious beavers spent hours over it with only one easy to eat cake in
And at last the dam rose to the level of the bank
Then the beavers collected a great heap of clay and four of them lifted it and dumped it down in the opening where the water was running
It did splash a little but a truehearted beaver knows better than to mind a bit of a wetting as Oswald told Alice at the time
Then with more clay the work was completed
We must have used tons of clay there was quite a big long hole in the bank above the dam where we had taken it out
When our beaver task was performed we went on and Dicky was so hot he had to take his jacket off and shut up about icebergs
I cannot tell you about all the windings of the stream it went through fields and woods and meadows and at last the banks got steeper and higher and the trees overhead darkly arched their mysterious branches and we felt like the princes in a fairy tale who go out to seek their fortunes
And then we saw a thing that was well worth coming all that way for the stream suddenly disappeared under a dark stone archway and however much you stood in the water and stuck your head down between your knees you could not see any light at the other end
The stream was much smaller than where we had been beavers
Gentle reader you will guess in a moment who it was that said Alice youve got a candle
Lets explore
This gallant proposal met but a cold response
The others said they didnt care much about it and what about tea
I often think the way people try to hide their cowardliness behind their teas is simply beastly
Oswald took no notice
He just said with that dignified manner not at all like sulking which he knows so well how to put on All right
IM going
If you funk it youd better cut along home and ask your nurses to put you to bed
So then of course they agreed to go
Oswald went first with the candle
It was not comfortable the architect of that dark subterranean passage had not imagined anyone would ever be brave enough to lead a band of beavers into its inky recesses or he would have built it high enough to stand upright in
As it was we were bent almost at a right angle and this is very awkward if for long
But the leader pressed dauntlessly on and paid no attention to the groans of his faithful followers nor to what they said about their backs
It really was a very long tunnel though and even Oswald was not sorry to say I see daylight
The followers cheered as well as they could as they splashed after him
The floor was stone as well as the roof so it was easy to walk on
I think the followers would have turned back if it had been sharp stones or gravel
And now the spot of daylight at the end of the tunnel grew larger and larger and presently the intrepid leader found himself blinking in the full sun and the candle he carried looked simply silly
He emerged and the others too and they stretched their backs and the word krikey fell from more than one lip
It had indeed been a cramping adventure
Bushes grew close to the mouth of the tunnel so we could not see much landscape and when we had stretched our backs we went on upstream and nobody said theyd had jolly well enough of it though in more than one young heart this was thought
It was jolly to be in the sunshine again
I never knew before how cold it was underground
The stream was getting smaller and smaller
Dicky said This cant be the way
I expect there was a turning to the North Pole inside the tunnel only we missed it
It was cold enough there
But here a twist in the stream brought us out from the bushes and Oswald said Here is strange wild tropical vegetation in the richest profusion
Such blossoms as these never opened in a frigid whatsitsname
It was indeed true
We had come out into a sort of marshy swampy place like I think a jungle is that the stream ran through and it was simply crammed with queer plants and flowers we never saw before or since
And the stream was quite thin
It was torridly hot and softish to walk on
There were rushes and reeds and small willows and it was all tangled over with different sorts of grassesand pools here and there
We saw no wild beasts but there were more different kinds of wild flies and beetles than you could believe anybody could bear and dragonflies and gnats
The girls picked a lot of flowers
I know the names of some of them but I will not tell you them because this is not meant to be instructing
So I will only name meadowsweet yarrow loosestrife ladys bedstraw and willow herbboth the larger and the lesser
Everyone now wished to go home
It was much hotter there than in natural fields
It made you want to tear all your clothes off and play at savages instead of keeping respectable in your boots
But we had to bear the boots because it was so brambly
It was Oswald who showed the others how flat it would be to go home the same way we came and he pointed out the telegraph wires in the distance and said There must be a road there lets make for it which was quite a simple and ordinary thing to say and he does not ask for any credit for it
So we sloshed along scratching our legs with the brambles and the water squelched in our boots and Alices blue muslin frock was torn all over in those crisscross tears which are considered so hard to darn
We did not follow the stream any more
It was only a trickle now so we knew we had tracked it to its source
And we got hotter and hotter and hotter and the dews of agony stood in beads on our brows and rolled down our noses and off our chins
And the flies buzzed and the gnats stung and Oswald bravely sought to keep up Dickys courage when he tripped on a snag and came down on a bramble bush by saying You see it IS the source of the Nile weve discovered
What price North Poles now
Alice said Ah but think of ices
I expect Oswald wishes it HAD been the Pole anyway
Oswald is naturally the leader especially when following up what is his own idea but he knows that leaders have other duties besides just leading
One is to assist weak or wounded members of the expedition whether Polar or Equatorish
So the others had got a bit ahead through Oswald lending the tottering Denny a hand over the rough places
Dennys feet hurt him because when he was a beaver his stockings had dropped out of his pocket and boots without stockings are not a bed of luxuriousness
And he is often unlucky with his feet
Presently we came to a pond and Denny said Lets paddle
Oswald likes Denny to have ideas he knows it is healthy for the boy and generally he backs him up but just now it was getting late and the others were ahead so he said Oh rot
come on
Generally the Dentist would have but even worms will turn if they are hot enough and if their feet are hurting them
I dont care I shall
he said
Oswald overlooked the mutiny and did not say who was leader
He just said Well dont be all day about it for he is a kindhearted boy and can make allowances
So Denny took off his boots and went into the pool
Oh its ripping
he said
You ought to come in
It looks beastly muddy said his tolerating leader
It is a bit Denny said but the muds just as cool as the water and so soft it squeezes between your toes quite different to boots
And so he splashed about and kept asking Oswald to come along in
But some unseen influence prevented Oswald doing this or it may have been because both his bootlaces were in hard knots
Oswald had cause to bless the unseen influence or the bootlaces or whatever it was
Denny had got to the middle of the pool and he was splashing about and getting his clothes very wet indeed and altogether you would have thought his was a most envious and happy state
But alas
the brightest cloud had a waterproof lining
He was just saying You are a silly Oswald
Youd much better when he gave a bloodpiercing scream and began to kick about
Whats up
cried the ready Oswald he feared the worst from the way Denny screamed but he knew it could not be an old meat tin in this quiet and jungular spot like it was in the moat when the shark bit Dora
I dont know its biting me
Oh its biting me all over my legs
Oh what shall I do
Oh it does hurt
Oh
oh
oh
remarked Denny among his screams and he splashed towards the bank
Oswald went into the water and caught hold of him and helped him out
It is true that Oswald had his boots on but I trust he would not have funked the unknown terrors of the deep even without his boots I am almost sure he would not have
When Denny had scrambled and been hauled ashore we saw with horror and amaze that his legs were stuck all over with large black sluglooking things
Denny turned green in the faceand even Oswald felt a bit queer for he knew in a moment what the black dreadfulnesses were
He had read about them in a book called Magnet Stories where there was a girl called Theodosia and she could play brilliant trebles on the piano in duets but the other girl knew all about leeches which is much more useful and golden deedy
Oswald tried to pull the leeches off but they wouldnt and Denny howled so he had to stop trying
He remembered from the Magnet Stories how to make the leeches begin bitingthe girl did it with creambut he could not remember how to stop them and they had not wanted any showing how to begin
Oh what shall I do
What shall I do
Oh it does hurt
Oh oh
Denny observed and Oswald said Be a man
Buck up
If you wont let me take them off youll just have to walk home in them
At this thought the unfortunate youths tears fell fast
But Oswald gave him an arm and carried his boots for him and he consented to buck up and the two struggled on towards the others who were coming back attracted by Dennys yells
He did not stop howling for a moment except to breathe
No one ought to blame him till they have had eleven leeches on their right leg and six on their left making seventeen in all as Dicky said at once
It was lucky he did yell as it turned out because a man on the roadwhere the telegraph wires werewas interested by his howls and came across the marsh to us as hard as he could
When he saw Dennys legs he said Blest if I didnt think so and he picked Denny up and carried him under one arm where Denny went on saying Oh
and It does hurt as hard as ever
Our rescuer who proved to be a fine big young man in the bloom of youth and a farmlabourer by trade in corduroys carried the wretched sufferer to the cottage where he lived with his aged mother and then Oswald found that what he had forgotten about the leeches was SALT
The young man in the bloom of youths mother put salt on the leeches and they squirmed off and fell with sickening sluglike flops on the brick floor
Then the young man in corduroys and the bloom etc carried Denny home on his back after his legs had been bandaged up so that he looked like wounded warriors returning
It was not far by the road though such a long distance by the way the young explorers had come
He was a good young man and though of course acts of goodness are their own reward still I was glad he had the two halfcrowns Alberts uncle gave him as well as his own good act
But I am not sure Alice ought to have put him in the Golden Deed book which was supposed to be reserved for Us
Perhaps you will think this was the end of the source of the Nile or North Pole
If you do it only shows how mistaken the gentlest reader may be
The wounded explorer was lying with his wounds and bandages on the sofa and we were all having our tea with raspberries and white currants which we richly needed after our torrid adventures when Mrs Pettigrew the housekeeper put her head in at the door and said Please could I speak to you half a moment sir
to Alberts uncle
And her voice was the kind that makes you look at each other when the grownup has gone out and you are silent with your breadandbutter halfway to the next bite or your teacup in mid flight to your lips
It was as we suppose
Alberts uncle did not come back for a long while
We did not keep the breadandbutter on the wing all that time of course and we thought we might as well finish the raspberries and white currants
We kept some for Alberts uncle of course and they were the best ones too but when he came back he did not notice our thoughtful unselfishness
He came in and his face wore the look that means bed and very likely no supper
He spoke and it was the calmness of whitehot iron which is something like the calmness of despair
He said You have done it again
What on earth possessed you to make a dam
We were being beavers said H O in proud tones
He did not see as we did where Alberts uncles tone pointed to
No doubt said Alberts uncle rubbing his hands through his hair
No doubt
no doubt
Well my beavers you may go and build dams with your bolsters
Your dam stopped the stream the clay you took for it left a channel through which it has run down and ruined about seven pounds worth of freshlyreaped barley
Luckily the farmer found it out in time or you might have spoiled seventy pounds worth
And you burned a bridge yesterday
We said we were sorry
There was nothing else to say only Alice added We didnt MEAN to be naughty
Of course not said Alberts uncle you never do
Oh yes Ill kiss youbut its bed and its two hundred lines tomorrow and the line isBeware of Being Beavers and Burning Bridges
Dread Dams
It will be a capital exercise in capital Bs and Ds
We knew by that that though annoyed he was not furious we went to bed
I got jolly sick of capital Bs and Ds before sunset on the morrow
That night just as the others were falling asleep Oswald said I say
Well retorted his brother
There is one thing about it Oswald went on it does show it was a rattling good dam anyhow
And filled with this agreeable thought the weary beavers or explorers Polar or otherwise fell asleep
CHAPTER 8 THE HIGHBORN BABE It really was not such a bad babyfor a baby
Its face was round and quite clean which babies faces are not always as I daresay you know by your own youthful relatives and Dora said its cape was trimmed with real lace whatever that may beI dont see myself how one kind of lace can be realler than another
It was in a very swagger sort of perambulator when we saw it and the perambulator was standing quite by itself in the lane that leads to the mill
I wonder whose baby it is Dora said
Isnt it a darling Alice
Alice agreed to its being one and said she thought it was most likely the child of noble parents stolen by gipsies
These two as likely as not Noel said
Cant you see something crimelike in the very way theyre lying
They were two tramps and they were lying on the grass at the edge of the lane on the shady side fast asleep only a very little further on than where the Baby was
They were very ragged and their snores did have a sinister sound
I expect they stole the titled heir at dead of night and theyve been travelling hotfoot ever since so now theyre sleeping the sleep of exhaustedness Alice said
What a heartrending scene when the patrician mother wakes in the morning and finds the infant aristocrat isnt in bed with his mamma
The Baby was fast asleep or else the girls would have kissed it
They are strangely fond of kissing
The author never could see anything in it himself
If the gipsies DID steal it Dora said perhaps theyd sell it to us
I wonder what theyd take for it
What could you do with it if youd got it
H O asked
Why adopt it of course Dora said
Ive often thought I should enjoy adopting a baby
It would be a golden deed too
Weve hardly got any in the book yet
I should have thought there were enough of us Dicky said
Ah but youre none of you babies said Dora
Unless you count H O as a baby he behaves jolly like one sometimes
This was because of what had happened that morning when Dicky found H O going fishing with a box of worms and the box was the one Dicky keeps his silver studs in and the medal he got at school and what is left of his watch and chain
The box is lined with red velvet and it was not nice afterwards
And then H O said Dicky had hurt him and he was a beastly bully and he cried
We thought all this had been made up and were sorry to see it threaten to break out again
So Oswald said Oh bother the Baby
Come along do
And the others came
We were going to the millers with a message about some flour that hadnt come and about a sack of sharps for the pigs
After you go down the lane you come to a cloverfield and then a cornfield and then another lane and then it is the mill
It is a jolly fine mill in fact it is twowater and wind onesone of each kindwith a house and farm buildings as well
I never saw a mill like it and I dont believe you have either
If we had been in a storybook the millers wife would have taken us into the neat sanded kitchen where the old oak settle was black with time and rubbing and dusted chairs for usold brown Windsor chairsand given us each a glass of sweet scented cowslip wine and a thick slice of rich homemade cake
And there would have been fresh roses in an old china bowl on the table
As it was she asked us all into the parlour and gave us Eiffel Tower lemonade and Marie biscuits
The chairs in her parlour were bent wood and no flowers except some wax ones under a glass shade but she was very kind and we were very much obliged to her
We got out to the miller though as soon as we could only Dora and Daisy stayed with her and she talked to them about her lodgers and about her relations in London
The miller is a MAN
He showed us all over the millsboth kindsand let us go right up into the very top of the windmill and showed us how the top moved round so that the sails could catch the wind and the great heaps of corn some red and some yellow the red is English wheat and the heaps slice down a little bit at a time into a square hole and go down to the millstones
The corn makes a rustling soft noise that is very jollysomething like the noise of the seaand you can hear it through all the other mill noises
Then the miller let us go all over the watermill
It is fairy palaces inside a mill
Everything is powdered over white like sugar on pancakes when you are allowed to help yourself
And he opened a door and showed us the great waterwheel working on slow and sure like some great round dripping giant Noel said and then he asked us if we fished
Yes was our immediate reply
Then why not try the millpool
he said and we replied politely and when he was gone to tell his man something we owned to each other that he was a trump
He did the thing thoroughly
He took us out and cut us ash saplings for rods he found us in lines and hooks and several different sorts of bait including a handsome handful of mealworms which Oswald put loose in his pocket
When it came to bait Alice said she was going home with Dora and Daisy
Girls are strange mysterious silly things
Alice always enjoys a rat hunt until the rat is caught but she hates fishing from beginning to end
We boys have got to like it
We dont feel now as we did when we turned off the water and stopped the competition of the competing anglers
We had a grand days fishing that day
I cant think what made the miller so kind to us
Perhaps he felt a thrill of fellowfeeling in his manly breast for his fellowsportsmen for he was a noble fisherman himself
We had glorious sporteight roach six dace three eels seven perch and a young pike but he was so very young the miller asked us to put him back and of course we did
Hell live to bite another day said the miller
The millers wife gave us bread and cheese and more Eiffel Tower lemonade and we went home at last a little damp but full of successful ambition with our fish on a string
It had been a strikingly good timeone of those times that happen in the country quite by themselves
Country people are much more friendly than town people
I suppose they dont have to spread their friendly feelings out over so many persons so its thicker like a pound of butter on one loaf is thicker than on a dozen
Friendliness in the country is not scrape like it is in London
Even Dicky and H O forgot the affair of honour that had taken place in the morning
H O changed rods with Dicky because H
O
s was the best rod and Dicky baited H
O
s hook for him just like loving unselfish brothers in Sunday School magazines
We were talking fishlikely as we went along down the lane and through the cornfield and the cloverfield and then we came to the other lane where we had seen the Baby
The tramps were gone and the perambulator was gone and of course the Baby was gone too
I wonder if those gipsies HAD stolen the Baby
Noel said dreamily
He had not fished much but he had made a piece of poetry
It was this How I wish I was a fish
I would not look At your hook But lie still and be cool At the bottom of the pool And when you went to look At your cruel hook You would not find me there So there
If they did steal the Baby Noel went on they will be tracked by the lordly perambulator
You can disguise a baby in rags and walnut juice but there isnt any disguise dark enough to conceal a perambulators person
You might disguise it as a wheelbarrow said Dicky
Or cover it with leaves said H O like the robins
We told him to shut up and not gibber but afterwards we had to own that even a young brother may sometimes talk sense by accident
For we took the short cut home from the laneit begins with a large gap in the hedge and the grass and weeds trodden down by the hasty feet of persons who were late for church and in too great a hurry to go round by the road
Our house is next to the church as I think I have said before some time
The short cut leads to a stile at the edge of a bit of wood the Parsons Shave they call it because it belongs to him
The wood has not been shaved for some time and it has grown out beyond the stile and here among the hazels and chestnuts and young dogwood bushes we saw something white
We felt it was our duty to investigate even if the white was only the under side of the tail of a dead rabbit caught in a trap
It was notit was part of the perambulator
I forget whether I said that the perambulator was enamelled whitenot the kind of enamelling you do at home with Aspinalls and the hairs of the brush come out and it is grittylooking but smooth like the handles of ladies very best lace parasols
And whoever had abandoned the helpless perambulator in that lonely spot had done exactly as H O said and covered it with leaves only they were green and some of them had dropped off
The others were wild with excitement
Now or never they thought was a chance to be real detectives
Oswald alone retained a calm exterior
It was he who would not go straight to the police station
He said Lets try and ferret out something for ourselves before we tell the police
They always have a clue directly they hear about the finding of the body
And besides we might as well let Alice be in anything there is going
And besides we havent had our dinners yet
This argument of Oswalds was so strong and powerfulhis arguments are often that as I daresay you have noticedthat the others agreed
It was Oswald too who showed his artless brothers why they had much better not take the deserted perambulator home with them
The dead body or whatever the clue is is always left exactly as it is found he said till the police have seen it and the coroner and the inquest and the doctor and the sorrowing relations
Besides suppose someone saw us with the beastly thing and thought we had stolen it then they would say What have you done with the Baby
and then where should we be
Oswalds brothers could not answer this question but once more Oswalds native eloquence and farseeing discerningness conquered
Anyway Dicky said lets shove the derelict a little further under cover
So we did
Then we went on home
Dinner was ready and so were Alice and Daisy but Dora was not there
Shes got a well shes not coming to dinner anyway Alice said when we asked
She can tell you herself afterwards what it is shes got
Oswald thought it was headache or pain in the temper or in the pinafore so he said no more but as soon as Mrs Pettigrew had helped us and left the room he began the thrilling tale of the forsaken perambulator
He told it with the greatest thrillingness anyone could have but Daisy and Alice seemed almost unmoved
Alice said Yes very strange and things like that but both the girls seemed to be thinking of something else
They kept looking at each other and trying not to laugh so Oswald saw they had got some silly secret and he said Oh all right
I dont care about telling you
I only thought youd like to be in it
Its going to be a really big thing with policemen in it and perhaps a judge
In what
H O said the perambulator
Daisy choked and then tried to drink and spluttered and got purple and had to be thumped on the back
But Oswald was not appeased
When Alice said Do go on Oswald
Im sure we all like it very much he said Oh no thank you very politely
As it happens he went on Id just as soon go through with this thing without having any girls in it
In the perambulator
said H O again
Its a mans job Oswald went on without taking any notice of H O
Do you really think so said Alice when theres a baby in it
But there isnt said H O if you mean in the perambulator
Blow you and your perambulator said Oswald with gloomy forbearance
Alice kicked Oswald under the table and said Dont be waxy Oswald
Really and truly Daisy and I HAVE got a secret only its Doras secret and she wants to tell you herself
If it was mine or Daisys wed tell you this minute wouldnt we Mouse
This very second said the White Mouse
And Oswald consented to take their apologies
Then the pudding came in and no more was said except asking for things to be passedsugar and water and bread and things
Then when the pudding was all gone Alice said Come on
And we came on
We did not want to be disagreeable though really we were keen on being detectives and sifting that perambulator to the very dregs
But boys have to try to take an interest in their sisters secrets however silly
This is part of being a good brother
Alice led us across the field where the sheep once fell into the brook and across the brook by the plank
At the other end of the next field there was a sort of wooden house on wheels that the shepherd sleeps in at the time of year when lambs are being born so that he can see that they are not stolen by gipsies before the owners have counted them
To this hut Alice now led her kind brothers and Daisys kind brother
Dora is inside she said with the Secret
We were afraid to have it in the house in case it made a noise
The next moment the Secret was a secret no longer for we all beheld Dora sitting on a sack on the floor of the hut with the Secret in her lap
It was the Highborn Babe
Oswald was so overcome that he sat down suddenly just like Betsy Trotwood did in David Copperfield which just shows what a true author Dickens is
Youve done it this time he said
I suppose you know youre a babystealer
Im not Dora said
Ive adopted him
Then it was you Dicky said who scuttled the perambulator in the wood
Yes Alice said we couldnt get it over the stile unless Dora put down the Baby and we were afraid of the nettles for his legs
His name is to be Lord Edward
But Dorareally dont you think If youd been there youd have done the same said Dora firmly
The gipsies had gone
Of course something had frightened them and they fled from justice
And the little darling was awake and held out his arms to me
No he hasnt cried a bit and I know all about babies Ive often nursed Mrs Simpkinss daughters baby when she brings it up on Sundays
They have bread and milk to eat
You take him Alice and Ill go and get some bread and milk for him
Alice took the noble brat
It was horribly lively and squirmed about in her arms and wanted to crawl on the floor
She could only keep it quiet by saying things to it a boy would be ashamed even to think of saying such as Goo goo and Did ums was and Ickle ducksums then
When Alice used these expressions the Baby laughed and chuckled and replied Daddadda Bababa or Glueglue
But if Alice stopped her remarks for an instant the thing screwed its face up as if it was going to cry but she never gave it time to begin
It was a rummy little animal
Then Dora came back with the bread and milk and they fed the noble infant
It was greedy and slobbery but all three girls seemed unable to keep their eyes and hands off it
They looked at it exactly as if it was pretty
We boys stayed watching them
There was no amusement left for us now for Oswald saw that Doras Secret knocked the bottom out of the perambulator
When the infant aristocrat had eaten a hearty meal it sat on Alices lap and played with the amber heart she wears that Alberts uncle brought her from Hastings after the business of the bad sixpence and the nobleness of Oswald
Now said Dora this is a council so I want to be businesslike
The Duckums Darling has been stolen away its wicked stealers have deserted the Precious
Weve got it
Perhaps its ancestral halls are miles and miles away
I vote we keep the little Lovey Duck till its advertised for
If Alberts uncle lets you said Dicky darkly
Oh dont say you like that Dora said I want it to be all of our baby
It will have five fathers and three mothers and a grandfather and a great Alberts uncle and a great granduncle
Im sure Alberts uncle will let us keep itat any rate till its advertised for
And suppose it never is Noel said
Then so much the better said Dora the little Duckyux
She began kissing the baby again
Oswald ever thoughtful said Well what about your dinner
Bother dinner
Dora saidso like a girl
Will you all agree to be his fathers and mothers
Anything for a quiet life said Dicky and Oswald said Oh yes if you like
But youll see we shant be allowed to keep it
You talk as if he was rabbits or white rats said Dora and hes nothes a little man he is
All right hes no rabbit but a man
Come on and get some grub Dora rejoined the kindhearted Oswald and Dora did with Oswald and the other boys
Only Noel stayed with Alice
He really seemed to like the baby
When I looked back he was standing on his head to amuse it but the baby did not seem to like him any better whichever end of him was up
Dora went back to the shepherds house on wheels directly she had had her dinner
Mrs Pettigrew was very cross about her not being in to it but she had kept her some mutton hot all the same
She is a decent sort
And there were stewed prunes
We had some to keep Dora company
Then we boys went fishing again in the moat but we caught nothing
Just before teatime we all went back to the hut and before we got half across the last field we could hear the howling of the Secret
Poor little beggar said Oswald with manly tenderness
They must be sticking pins in it
We found the girls and Noel looking quite pale and breathless
Daisy was walking up and down with the Secret in her arms
It looked like Alice in Wonderland nursing the baby that turned into a pig
Oswald said so and added that its screams were like it too
What on earth is the matter with it
he said
I dont know said Alice
Daisys tired and Dora and I are quite worn out
Hes been crying for hours and hours
YOU take him a bit
Not me replied Oswald firmly withdrawing a pace from the Secret
Dora was fumbling with her waistband in the furthest corner of the hut
I think hes cold she said
I thought Id take off my flannelette petticoat only the horrid strings got into a hard knot
Here Oswald lets have your knife
With the word she plunged her hand into Oswalds jacket pocket and next moment she was rubbing her hand like mad on her dress and screaming almost as loud as the Baby
Then she began to laugh and to cry at the same time
This is called hysterics
Oswald was sorry but he was annoyed too
He had forgotten that his pocket was half full of the mealworms the miller had kindly given him
And anyway Dora ought to have known that a man always carries his knife in his trousers pocket and not in his jacket one
Alice and Daisy rushed to Dora
She had thrown herself down on the pile of sacks in the corner
The titled infant delayed its screams for a moment to listen to Doras but almost at once it went on again
Oh get some water
said Alice
Daisy run
The White Mouse ever docile and obedient shoved the baby into the arms of the nearest person who had to take it or it would have fallen a wreck to the ground
This nearest person was Oswald
He tried to pass it on to the others but they wouldnt
Noel would have but he was busy kissing Dora and begging her not to
So our hero for such I may perhaps term him found himself the degraded nursemaid of a small but furious kid
He was afraid to lay it down for fear in its rage it should beat its brains out against the hard earth and he did not wish however innocently to be the cause of its hurting itself at all
So he walked earnestly up and down with it thumping it unceasingly on the back while the others attended to Dora who presently ceased to yell
Suddenly it struck Oswald that the Highborn also had ceased to yell
He looked at it and could hardly believe the glad tidings of his faithful eyes
With bated breath he hastened back to the sheephouse
The others turned on him full of reproaches about the mealworms and Dora but he answered without anger
Shut up he said in a whisper of imperial command
Cant you see its GONE TO SLEEP
As exhausted as if they had all taken part in all the events of a very long Athletic Sports the youthful Bastables and their friends dragged their weary limbs back across the fields
Oswald was compelled to go on holding the titled infant for fear it should wake up if it changed hands and begin to yell again
Doras flannelette petticoat had been got off somehowhow I do not seek to inquireand the Secret was covered with it
The others surrounded Oswald as much as possible with a view to concealment if we met Mrs Pettigrew
But the coast was clear
Oswald took the Secret up into his bedroom
Mrs Pettigrew doesnt come there much its too many stairs
With breathless precaution Oswald laid it down on his bed
It sighed but did not wake
Then we took it in turns to sit by it and see that it did not get up and fling itself out of bed which in one of its furious fits it would just as soon have done as not
We expected Alberts uncle every minute
At last we heard the gate but he did not come in so we looked out and saw that there he was talking to a distractedlooking man on a piebald horseone of the millers horses
A shiver of doubt coursed through our veins
We could not remember having done anything wrong at the millers
But you never know
And it seemed strange his sending a man up on his own horse
But when we had looked a bit longer our fears went down and our curiosity got up
For we saw that the distracted one was a gentleman
Presently he rode off and Alberts uncle came in
A deputation met him at the doorall the boys and Dora because the baby was her idea
Weve found something Dora said and we want to know whether we may keep it
The rest of us said nothing
We were not so very extra anxious to keep it after we had heard how much and how long it could howl
Even Noel had said he had no idea a baby could yell like it
Dora said it only cried because it was sleepy but we reflected that it would certainly be sleepy once a day if not oftener
What is it
said Alberts uncle
Lets see this treasuretrove
Is it a wild beast
Come and see said Dora and we led him to our room
Alice turned down the pink flannelette petticoat with silly pride and showed the youthful heir fatly and pinkly sleeping
A baby
said Alberts uncle
THE Baby
Oh my cats alive
That is an expression which he uses to express despair unmixed with anger
Where did you but that doesnt matter
Well talk of this later
He rushed from the room and in a moment or two we saw him mount his bicycle and ride off
Quite shortly he returned with the distracted horse man
It was HIS baby and not titled at all
The horseman and his wife were the lodgers at the mill
The nursemaid was a girl from the village
She SAID she only left the Baby five minutes while she went to speak to her sweetheart who was gardener at the Red House
But we knew she left it over an hour and nearly two
I never saw anyone so pleased as the distracted horseman
When we were asked we explained about having thought the Baby was the prey of gipsies and the distracted horseman stood hugging the Baby and actually thanked us
But when he had gone we had a brief lecture on minding our own business
But Dora still thinks she was right
As for Oswald and most of the others they agreed that they would rather mind their own business all their lives than mind a baby for a single hour
If you have never had to do with a baby in the frenzied throes of sleepiness you can have no idea what its screams are like
If you have been through such a scene you will understand how we managed to bear up under having no baby to adopt
Oswald insisted on having the whole thing written in the Golden Deed book
Of course his share could not be put in without telling about Doras generous adopting of the forlorn infant outcast and Oswald could not and cannot forget that he was the one who did get that baby to sleep
What a time Mr and Mrs Distracted Horseman must have of it thoughespecially now theyve sacked the nursemaid
If Oswald is ever marriedI suppose he must be some dayhe will have ten nurses to each baby
Eight is not enough
We know that because we tried and the whole eight of us were not enough for the needs of that deserted infant who was not so extra highborn after all
CHAPTER 9 HUNTING THE FOX It is idle to expect everyone to know everything in the world without being told
If we had been brought up in the country we should have known that it is not doneto hunt the fox in August
But in the Lewisham Road the most observing boy does not notice the dates when it is proper to hunt foxes
And there are some things you cannot bear to think that anybody would think you would do that is why I wish to say plainly at the very beginning that none of us would have shot a fox on purpose even to save our skins
Of course if a man were at bay in a cave and had to defend girls from the simultaneous attack of a herd of savage foxes it would be different
A man is bound to protect girls and take care of themthey can jolly well take care of themselves really it seems to mestill this is what Alberts uncle calls one of the rules of the game so we are bound to defend them and fight for them to the death if needful
Denny knows a quotation which says What dire offence from harmless causes springs What mighty contests rise from trefoil things
He says this means that all great events come from three thingsthreefold like the clover or trefoil and the causes are always harmless
Trefoil is short for threefold
There were certainly three things that led up to the adventure which is now going to be told you
The first was our Indian uncle coming down to the country to see us
The second was Dennys tooth
The third was only our wanting to go hunting but if you count it in it makes the thing about the trefoil come right
And all these causes were harmless
It is a flattering thing to say and it was not Oswald who said it but Dora
She said she was certain our uncle missed us and that he felt he could no longer live without seeing his dear ones that was us
Anyway he came down without warning which is one of the few bad habits that excellent Indian man has and this habit has ended in unpleasantness more than once as when we played jungles
However this time it was all right
He came on rather a dull kind of day when no one had thought of anything particularly amusing to do
So that as it happened to be dinnertime and we had just washed our hands and faces we were all spotlessly clean com pared with what we are sometimes I mean of course
We were just sitting down to dinner and Alberts uncle was just plunging the knife into the hot heart of the steak pudding when there was the rumble of wheels and the station fly stopped at the garden gate
And in the fly sitting very upright with his hands on his knees was our Indian relative so much beloved
He looked very smart with a rose in his buttonhole
How different from what he looked in other days when he helped us to pretend that our currant pudding was a wild boar we were killing with our forks
Yet though tidier his heart still beat kind and true
You should not judge people harshly because their clothes are tidy
He had dinner with us and then we showed him round the place and told him everything we thought he would like to hear and about the Tower of Mystery and he said It makes my blood boil to think of it
Noel said he was sorry for that because everyone else we had told it to had owned when we asked them that it froze their blood
Ah said the Uncle but in India we learn how to freeze our blood and boil it at the same time
In those hot longitudes perhaps the blood is always near boilingpoint which accounts for Indian tempers though not for the curry and pepper they eat
But I must not wander there is no curry at all in this story
About temper I will not say
Then Uncle let us all go with him to the station when the fly came back for him and when we said goodbye he tipped us all half a quid without any insidious distinctions about age or considering whether you were a boy or a girl
Our Indian uncle is a trueborn Briton with no nonsense about him
We cheered him like one man as the train went off and then we offered the flydriver a shilling to take us back to the four crossroads and the grateful creature did it for nothing because he said the gent had tipped him something like
How scarce is true gratitude
So we cheered the driver too for this rare virtue and then went home to talk about what we should do with our money
I cannot tell you all that we did with it because money melts away like snowwreaths in thawjean as Denny says and somehow the more you have the more quickly it melts
We all went into Maidstone and came back with the most beautiful lot of brown paper parcels with things inside that supplied longfelt wants
But none of them belongs to this narration except what Oswald and Denny clubbed to buy
This was a pistol and it took all the money they both had but when Oswald felt the uncomfortable inside sensation that reminds you who it is and his money that are soon parted he said to himself I dont care
We ought to have a pistol in the house and one that will go off toonot those rotten flintlocks
Suppose there should be burglars and us totally unarmed
We took it in turns to have the pistol and we decided always to practise with it far from the house so as not to frighten the grownups who are always much nervouser about firearms than we are
It was Dennys idea getting it and Oswald owns it surprised him but the boy was much changed in his character
We got it while the others were grubbing at the pastrycooks in the High Street and we said nothing till after tea though it was hard not to fire at the birds on the telegraph wires as we came home in the train
After tea we called a council in the strawloft and Oswald said Denny and I have got a secret
I know what it is Dicky said contemptibly
Youve found out that shop in Maidstone where peppermint rock is four ounces a penny
H O and I found it out before you did
Oswald said You shutup
If you dont want to hear the secret youd better bunk
Im going to administer the secret oath
This is a very solemn oath and only used about real things and never for pretending ones so Dicky said Oh all right go ahead
I thought you were only rotting
So they all took the secret oath
Noel made it up long before when he had found the first thrushs nest we ever saw in the Blackheath garden I will not tell I will not reveal I will not touch or try to steal And may I be called a beastly sneak If this great secret I ever repeat
It is a little wrong about the poetry but it is a very binding promise
They all repeated it down to H O
Now then Dicky said whats up
Oswald in proud silence drew the pistol from his breast and held it out and there was a murmur of awful amazement and respect from every one of the council
The pistol was not loaded so we let even the girls have it to look at
And then Dicky said Lets go hunting
And we decided that we would
H O wanted to go down to the village and get penny horns at the shop for the huntsmen to wind like in the song but we thought it would be more modest not to wind horns or anything noisy at any rate not until we had run down our prey
But his talking of the song made us decide that it was the fox we wanted to hunt
We had not been particular which animal we hunted before that
Oswald let Denny have first go with the pistol and when we went to bed he slept with it under his pillow but not loaded for fear he should have a nightmare and draw his fell weapon before he was properly awake
Oswald let Denny have it because Denny had toothache and a pistol is consoling though it does not actually stop the pain of the tooth
The toothache got worse and Alberts uncle looked at it and said it was very loose and Denny owned he had tried to crack a peachstone with it
Which accounts
He had creosote and camphor and went to bed early with his tooth tied up in red flannel
Oswald knows it is right to be very kind when people are ill and he forbore to wake the sufferer next morning by buzzing a pillow at him as he generally does
He got up and went over to shake the invalid but the bird had flown and the nest was cold
The pistol was not in the nest either but Oswald found it afterwards under the lookingglass on the dressingtable
He had just awakened the others with a hair brush because they had not got anything the matter with their teeth when he heard wheels and looking out beheld Denny and Alberts uncle being driven from the door in the farmers high cart with the red wheels
We dressed extra quick so as to get downstairs to the bottom of the mystery
And we found a note from Alberts uncle
It was addressed to Dora and said Dennys toothache got him up in the small hours
Hes off to the dentist to have it out with him man to man
Home to dinner
Dora said Dennys gone to the dentist
I expect its a relation H O said
Denny must be short for Dentist
I suppose he was trying to be funnyhe really does try very hard
He wants to be a clown when he grows up
The others laughed
I wonder said Dicky whether hell get a shilling or halfacrown for it
Oswald had been meditating in gloomy silence now he cheered up and said Of course
Id forgotten that
Hell get his tooth money and the drive too
So its quite fair for us to have the foxhunt while hes gone
I was thinking we should have to put it off
The others agreed that it would not be unfair
We can have another one another time if he wants to Oswald said
We know foxes are hunted in red coats and on horsebackbut we could not do thisbut H O had the old red football jersey that was Alberts uncles when he was at Loretto
He was pleased
But I do wish wed had horns he said grievingly
I should have liked to wind the horn
We can pretend horns Dora said but he answered I didnt want to pretend
I wanted to wind something
Wind your watch Dicky said
And that was unkind because we all know H
O
s watch is broken and when you wind it it only rattles inside without going in the least
We did not bother to dress up much for the hunting expeditionjust cocked hats and lath swords and we tied a card on to H
O
s chest with Moat House FoxHunters on it and we tied red flannel round all the dogs necks to show they were foxhounds
Yet it did not seem to show it plainly somehow it made them look as if they were not foxhounds but their own natural breedsonly with sore throats
Oswald slipped the pistol and a few cartridges into his pocket
He knew of course that foxes are not shot but as he said Who knows whether we may not meet a bear or a crocodile
We set off gaily
Across the orchard and through two cornfields and along the hedge of another field and so we got into the wood through a gap we had happened to make a day or two before playing follow my leader
The wood was very quiet and green the dogs were happy and most busy
Once Pincher started a rabbit
We said View Halloo
and immediately started in pursuit but the rabbit went and hid so that even Pincher could not find him and we went on
But we saw no foxes
So at last we made Dicky be a fox and chased him down the green rides
A wide walk in a wood is called a ride even if people never do anything but walk in it
We had only three houndsLady Pincher and Marthaso we joined the glad throng and were being hounds as hard as we could when we suddenly came barking round a corner in full chase and stopped short for we saw that our fox had stayed his hasty flight
The fox was stooping over something reddish that lay beside the path and he cried I say look here
in tones that thrilled us throughout
Our foxwhom we must now call Dicky so as not to muddle the narrationpointed to the reddy thing that the dogs were sniffing at
Its a real live fox he said
And so it was
At least it was realonly it was quite deadand when Oswald lifted it up its head was bleeding
It had evidently been shot through the brain and expired instantly
Oswald explained this to the girls when they began to cry at the sight of the poor beast I do not say he did not feel a bit sorry himself
The fox was cold but its fur was so pretty and its tail and its little feet
Dicky strung the dogs on the leash they were so much interested we thought it was better
It does seem horrid to think itll never see again out of its poor little eyes Dora said blowing her nose
And never run about through the wood again lend me your hanky Dora said Alice
And never be hunted or get into a henroost or a trap or anything exciting poor little thing said Dicky
The girls began to pick green chestnut leaves to cover up the poor foxs fatal wound and Noel began to walk up and down making faces the way he always does when hes making poetry
He cannot make one without the other
It works both ways which is a comfort
What are we going to do now
H O said the huntsman ought to cut off its tail Im quite certain
Only Ive broken the big blade of my knife and the other never was any good
The girls gave H O a shove and even Oswald said Shut up for somehow we all felt we did not want to play foxhunting any more that day
When his deadly wound was covered the fox hardly looked dead at all
Oh I wish it wasnt true
Alice said
Daisy had been crying all the time and now she said I should like to pray God to make it not true
But Dora kissed her and told her that was no good only she might pray God to take care of the foxs poor little babies if it had had any which I believe she has done ever since
If only we could wake up and find it was a horrid dream Alice said
It seems silly that we should have cared so much when we had really set out to hunt foxes with dogs but it is true
The foxs feet looked so helpless
And there was a dusty mark on its side that I know would not have been there if it had been alive and able to wash itself
Noel now said This is the piece of poetry Here lies poor Reynard who is slain He will not come to life again
I never will the huntsmans horn Wind since the day that I was born Until the day I die For I dont like hunting and this is why
Lets have a funeral said H O
This pleased everybody and we got Dora to take off her petticoat to wrap the fox in so that we could carry it to our garden and bury it without bloodying our jackets
Girls clothes are silly in one way but I think they are useful too
A boy cannot take off more than his jacket and waistcoat in any emergency or he is at once entirely undressed
But I have known Dora take off two petticoats for useful purposes and look just the same outside afterwards
We boys took it in turns to carry the fox
It was very heavy
When we got near the edge of the wood Noel said It would be better to bury it here where the leaves can talk funeral songs over its grave for ever and the other foxes can come and cry if they want to
He dumped the fox down on the moss under a young oak tree as he spoke
If Dicky fetched the spade and fork we could bury it here and then he could tie up the dogs at the same time
Youre sick of carrying it Dicky remarked thats what it is
But he went on condition the rest of us boys went too
While we were gone the girls dragged the fox to the edge of the wood it was a different edge to the one we went in byclose to a laneand while they waited for the digging or fatigue party to come back they collected a lot of moss and green things to make the foxs long home soft for it to lie in
There are no flowers in the woods in August which is a pity
When we got back with the spade and fork we dug a hole to bury the fox in
We did not bring the dogs back because they were too interested in the funeral to behave with real respectable calmness
The ground was loose and soft and easy to dig when we had scraped away the broken bits of sticks and the dead leaves and the wild honeysuckle Oswald used the fork and Dicky had the spade
Noel made faces and poetryhe was struck so that morningand the girls sat stroking the clean parts of the foxs fur till the grave was deep enough
At last it was then Daisy threw in the leaves and grass and Alice and Dora took the poor dead fox by his two ends and we helped to put him in the grave
We could not lower him slowlyhe was dropped in really
Then we covered the furry body with leaves and Noel said the Burial Ode he had made up
He says this was it but it sounds better now than it did then so I think he must have done something to it since THE FOXS BURIAL ODE Dear Fox sleep here and do not wake We picked these leaves for your sake You must not try to rise or move We give you this with our love
Close by the wood where once you grew Your mourning friends have buried you
If you had lived youd not have been Been proper friends with us I mean But now youre laid upon the shelf Poor fox you cannot help yourself So as I say we are your loving friends And here your Burial Ode dear Foxy ends
P SWhen in the moonlight bright The foxes wander of a night Theyll pass your grave and fondly think of you Exactly like we mean to always do
So now dear fox adieu
Your friends are few But true To you
Adieu
When this had been said we filled in the grave and covered the top of it with dry leaves and sticks to make it look like the rest of the wood
People might think it was a treasure and dig it up if they thought there was anything buried there and we wished the poor fox to sleep sound and not to be disturbed
The interring was over
We folded up Doras bloodstained pink cotton petticoat and turned to leave the sad spot
We had not gone a dozen yards down the lane when we heard footsteps and a whistle behind us and a scrabbling and whining and a gentleman with two foxterriers had called a halt just by the place where we had laid low the little red rover
The gentleman stood in the lane but the dogs were diggingwe could see their tails wagging and see the dust fly
And we SAW WHERE
We ran back
Oh please do stop your dogs digging there
Alice said
The gentleman said Why
Because weve just had a funeral and thats the grave
The gentleman whistled but the foxterriers were not trained like Pincher who was brought up by Oswald
The gentleman took a stride through the hedge gap
What have you been buryingpet dicky bird eh
said the gentleman kindly
He had riding breeches and white whiskers
We did not answer because now for the first time it came over all of us in a rush of blushes and uncomfortableness that burying a fox is a suspicious act
I dont know why we felt this but we did
Noel said dreamily We found his murdered body in the wood And dug a grave by which the mourners stood
But no one heard him except Oswald because Alice and Dora and Daisy were all jumping about with the jumps of unrestrained anguish and saying Oh call them off
Do
dooh dont dont
Dont let them dig
Alas
Oswald was as usual right
The ground of the grave had not been trampled down hard enough and he had said so plainly at the time but his prudent counsels had been overruled
Now these busybodying meddling mischiefmaking foxterriers how different from Pincher who minds his own business unless told otherwise had scratched away the earth and laid bare the reddish tip of the poor corpses tail
We all turned to go without a word it seemed to be no use staying any longer
But in a moment the gentleman with the whiskers had got Noel and Dicky each by an earthey were nearest him
H O hid in the hedge
Oswald to whose noble breast sneakishness is I am thankful to say a stranger would have scorned to escape but he ordered his sisters to bunk in a tone of command which made refusal impossible
And bunk sharp too he added sternly
Cut along home
So they cut
The whitewhiskered gentleman now encouraged his angry foxterriers by every means at his command to continue their vile and degrading occupation holding on all the time to the ears of Dicky and Noel who scorned to ask for mercy
Dicky got purple and Noel got white
It was Oswald who said Dont hang on to them sir
We wont cut
I give you my word of honour
YOUR word of honour said the gentleman in tones for which in happier days when people drew their bright blades and fought duels I would have had his hearts dearest blood
But now Oswald remained calm and polite as ever
Yes on my honour he said and the gentleman dropped the ears of Oswalds brothers at the sound of his firm unswerving tones
He dropped the ears and pulled out the body of the fox and held it up
The dogs jumped up and yelled
Now he said you talk very big about words of honour
Can you speak the truth
Dickie said If you think we shot it youre wrong
We know better than that
The whitewhiskered one turned suddenly to H O and pulled him out of the hedge
And what does that mean
he said and he was pink with fury to the ends of his large ears as he pointed to the card on H
O
s breast which said Moat House FoxHunters
Then Oswald said We WERE playing at foxhunting but we couldnt find anything but a rabbit that hid so my brother was being the fox and then we found the fox shot dead and I dont know who did it and we were sorry for it and we buried itand thats all
Not quite said the ridingbreeches gentleman with what I think you call a bitter smile not quite
This is my land and Ill have you up for trespass and damage
Come along now no nonsense
Im a magistrate and Im Master of the Hounds
A vixen too
What did you shoot her with
Youre too young to have a gun
Sneaked your Fathers revolver I suppose
Oswald thought it was better to be goldenly silent
But it was vain
The Master of the Hounds made him empty his pockets and there was the pistol and the cartridges
The magistrate laughed a harsh laugh of successful disagreeableness
All right said he wheres your licence
You come with me
A week or two in prison
I dont believe now he could have done it but we all thought then he could and would whats more
So H O began to cry but Noel spoke up
His teeth were chattering yet he spoke up like a man
He said You dont know us
Youve no right not to believe us till youve found us out in a lie
We dont tell lies
You ask Alberts uncle if we do
Hold your tongue said the WhiteWhiskered
But Noels blood was up
If you do put us in prison without being sure he said trembling more and more you are a horrible tyrant like Caligula and Herod or Nero and the Spanish Inquisition and I will write a poem about it in prison and people will curse you for ever
Upon my word said White Whiskers
Well see about that and he turned up the lane with the fox hanging from one hand and Noels ear once more reposing in the other
I thought Noel would cry or faint
But he bore up noblyexactly like an early Christian martyr
The rest of us came along too
I carried the spade and Dicky had the fork
H O had the card and Noel had the magistrate
At the end of the lane there was Alice
She had bunked home obeying the orders of her thoughtful brother but she had bottled back again like a shot so as not to be out of the scrape
She is almost worthy to be a boy for some things
She spoke to Mr Magistrate and said Where are you taking him
The outraged majesty of the magistrate said To prison you naughty little girl
Alice said Noel will faint
Somebody once tried to take him to prison beforeabout a dog
Do please come to our house and see our uncleat least hes notbut its the same thing
We didnt kill the fox if thats what you thinkindeed we didnt
Oh dear I do wish youd think of your own little boys and girls if youve got any or else about when you were little
You wouldnt be so horrid if you did
I dont know which if either of these objects the foxhound master thought of but he said Well lead on and he let go Noels ear and Alice snuggled up to Noel and put her arm round him
It was a frightened procession whose cheeks were pale with alarmexcept those between white whiskers and they were redthat wound in at our gate and into the hall among the old oak furniture and black and white marble floor and things
Dora and Daisy were at the door
The pink petticoat lay on the table all stained with the gore of the departed
Dora looked at us all and she saw that it was serious
She pulled out the big oak chair and said Wont you sit down
very kindly to the white whiskered magistrate
He grunted but did as she said
Then he looked about him in a silence that was not comforting and so did we
At last he said Come you didnt try to bolt
Speak the truth and Ill say no more
We said we had
Then he laid the fox on the table spreading out the petticoat under it and he took out a knife and the girls hid their faces
Even Oswald did not care to look
Wounds in battle are all very well but its different to see a dead fox cut into with a knife
Next moment the magistrate wiped something on his handkerchief and then laid it on the table and put one of my cartridges beside it
It was the bullet that had killed the fox
Look here
he said
And it was too true
The bullets were the same
A thrill of despair ran through Oswald
He knows now how a hero feels when he is innocently accused of a crime and the judge is putting on the black cap and the evidence is convulsive and all human aid is despaired of
I cant help it he said we didnt kill it and thats all there is to it
The whitewhiskered magistrate may have been master of the foxhounds but he was not master of his temper which is more important I should think than a lot of beastly dogs
He said several words which Oswald would never repeat much less in his own conversing and besides that he called us obstinate little beggars
Then suddenly Alberts uncle entered in the midst of a silence freighted with despairing reflections
The MFH
got up and told his tale it was mainly lies or to be more polite it was hardly any of it true though I supposed he believed it
I am very sorry sir said Alberts uncle looking at the bullets
Youll excuse my asking for the childrens version
Oh certainly sir certainly fuming the foxhound magistrate replied
Then Alberts uncle said Now Oswald I know I can trust you to speak the exact truth
So Oswald did
Then the whitewhiskered foxmaster laid the bullets before Alberts uncle and I felt this would be a trial to his faith far worse than the rack or the thumbscrew in the days of the Armada
And then Denny came in
He looked at the fox on the table
You found it then
he said
The MFH
would have spoken but Alberts uncle said One moment Denny youve seen this fox before
Rather said Denny I But Alberts uncle said Take time
Think before you speak and say the exact truth
No dont whisper to Oswald
This boy he said to the injured foxmaster has been with me since seven this morning
His tale whatever it is will be independent evidence
But Denny would not speak though again and again Alberts uncle told him to
I cant till Ive asked Oswald something he said at last
White Whiskers said That looks badeh
But Oswald said Dont whisper old chap
Ask me whatever you like but speak up
So Denny said I cant without breaking the secret oath
So then Oswald began to see and he said Break away for all youre worth its all right
And Denny said drawing reliefs deepest breath Well then Oswald and I have got a pistolsharesand I had it last night
And when I couldnt sleep last night because of the toothache I got up and went out early this morning
And I took the pistol
And I loaded it just for fun
And down in the wood I heard a whining like a dog and I went and there was the poor fox caught in an iron trap with teeth
And I went to let it out and it bit melook heres the placeand the pistol went off and the fox died and I am so sorry
But why didnt you tell the others
They werent awake when I went to the dentists
But why didnt you tell your uncle if youve been with him all the morning
It was the oath H O said May I be called a beastly sneak If this great secret I ever repeat
White Whiskers actually grinned
Well he said I see it was an accident my boy
Then he turned to us and said I owe you an apology for doubting your wordall of you
I hope its accepted
We said it was all right and he was to never mind
But all the same we hated him for it
He tried to make up for his unbelievingness afterwards by asking Alberts uncle to shoot rabbits but we did not really forgive him till the day when he sent the foxs brush to Alice mounted in silver with a note about her plucky conduct in standing by her brothers
We got a lecture about not playing with firearms but no punishment because our conduct had not been exactly sinful Alberts uncle said but merely silly
The pistol and the cartridges were confiscated
I hope the house will never be attacked by burglars
When it is Alberts uncle will only have himself to thank if we are rapidly overpowered because it will be his fault that we shall have to meet them totally unarmed and be their almost unresisting prey
CHAPTER 10 THE SALE OF ANTIQUITIES It began one morning at breakfast
It was the fifteenth of Augustthe birthday of Napoleon the Great Oswald Bastable and another very nice writer
Oswald was to keep his birthday on the Saturday so that his Father could be there
A birthday when there are only many happy returns is a little like Sunday or Christmas Eve
Oswald had a birthdaycard or twothat was all but he did not repine because he knew they always make it up to you for putting off keeping your birthday and he looked forward to Saturday
Alberts uncle had a whole stack of letters as usual and presently he tossed one over to Dora and said What do you say little lady
Shall we let them come
But Dora butterfingered as ever missed the catch and Dick and Noel both had a try for it so that the letter went into the place where the bacon had been and where now only a frozenlooking lake of bacon fat was slowly hardening and then somehow it got into the marmalade and then H O got it and Dora said I dont want the nasty thing nowall grease and stickiness
So H O read it aloud MAIDSTONE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUITIES AND FIELD CLUB Aug 14 1900 DEAR SIRAt a meeting of the H O stuck fast here and the writing was really very bad like a spider that has been in the inkpot crawling in a hurry over the paper without stopping to rub its feet properly on the mat
So Oswald took the letter
He is above minding a little marmalade or bacon
He began to read
It ran thus Its not Antiquities you little silly he said its Antiquaries
The others a very good word said Alberts uncle and I never call names at breakfast myselfit upsets the digestion my egregious Oswald
Thats a name though said Alice and you got it out of Stalky too
Go on Oswald
So Oswald went on where he had been interrupted MAIDSTONE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES AND FIELD CLUB Aug 141900
DEAR SIRAt a meeting of the Committee of this Society it was agreed that a field day should be held on Aug 20 when the Society proposes to visit the interesting church of Ivybridge and also the Roman remains in the vicinity
Our president Mr Longchamps FRS has obtained permission to open a barrow in the Three Trees pasture
We venture to ask whether you would allow the members of the Society to walk through your grounds and to inspectfrom without of courseyour beautiful house which is as you are doubtless aware of great historic interest having been for some years the residence of the celebrated Sir Thomas WyattI am dear Sir yours faithfully EDWARD K TURNBULL Hon
Sec
Just so said Alberts uncle well shall we permit the eye of the Maidstone Antiquities to profane these sacred solitudes and the foot of the Field Club to kick up a dust on our gravel
Our gravel is all grass H O said
And the girls said Oh do let them come
It was Alice who said Why not ask them to tea
Theyll be very tired coming all the way from Maidstone
Would you really like it
Alberts uncle asked
Im afraid theyll be but dull dogs the Antiquities stuffy old gentlemen with amphorae in their buttonholes instead of orchids and pedigrees poking out of all their pockets
We laughedbecause we knew what an amphorae is
If you dont you might look it up in the dicker
Its not a flower though it sounds like one out of the gardening book the kind you never hear of anyone growing
Dora said she thought it would be splendid
And we could have out the best china she said and decorate the table with flowers
We could have tea in the garden
Weve never had a party since weve been here
I warn you that your guests may be boresome however have it your own way Alberts uncle said and he went off to write the invitation to tea to the Maidstone Antiquities
I know that is the wrong word but somehow we all used it whenever we spoke of them which was often
In a day or two Alberts uncle came in to tea with a lightlyclouded brow
Youve let me in for a nice thing he said
I asked the Antiquities to tea and I asked casually how many we might expect
I thought we might need at least the full dozen of the best teacups
Now the secretary writes accepting my kind invitation Oh good
we cried
And how many are coming
Oh only about sixty was the groaning rejoinder
Perhaps more should the weather be exceptionally favourable
Though stunned at first we presently decided that we were pleased
We had never never given such a big party
The girls were allowed to help in the kitchen where Mrs Pettigrew made cakes all day long without stopping
They did not let us boys be there though I cannot see any harm in putting your finger in a cake before it is baked and then licking your finger if you are careful to put a different finger in the cake next time
Cake before it is baked is deliciouslike a sort of cream
Alberts uncle said he was the prey of despair
He drove in to Maidstone one day
When we asked him where he was going he said To get my hair cut if I keep it this length I shall certainly tear it out by double handfuls in the extremity of my anguish every time I think of those innumerable Antiquities
But we found out afterwards that he really went to borrow china and things to give the Antiquities their tea out of though he did have his hair cut too because he is the soul of truth and honour
Oswald had a very good sort of birthday with bows and arrows as well as other presents
I think these were meant to make up for the pistol that was taken away after the adventure of the foxhunting
These gave us boys something to do between the birthdaykeeping which was on the Saturday and the Wednesday when the Antiquities were to come
We did not allow the girls to play with the bows and arrows because they had the cakes that we were cut off from there was little or no unpleasantness over this
On the Tuesday we went down to look at the Roman place where the Antiquities were going to dig
We sat on the Roman wall and ate nuts
And as we sat there we saw coming through the beetfield two labourers with picks and shovels and a very young man with thin legs and a bicycle
It turned out afterwards to be a freewheel the first we had ever seen
They stopped at a mound inside the Roman wall and the men took their coats off and spat on their hands
We went down at once of course
The thinlegged bicyclist explained his machine to us very fully and carefully when we asked him and then we saw the men were cutting turfs and turning them over and rolling them up and putting them in a heap
So we asked the gentleman with the thin legs what they were doing
He said They are beginning the preliminary excavation in readiness for tomorrow
Whats up tomorrow
H O asked
Tomorrow we propose to open this barrow and examine it
Then YOURE the Antiquities
said H O
Im the secretary said the gentleman smiling but narrowly
Oh youre all coming to tea with us Dora said and added anxiously how many of you do you think therell be
Oh not more than eighty or ninety I should think replied the gentleman
This took our breath away and we went home
As we went Oswald who notices many things that would pass unobserved by the light and careless saw Denny frowning hard
So he said Whats up
Ive got an idea the Dentist said
Lets call a council
The Dentist had grown quite used to our ways now
We had called him Dentist ever since the foxhunt day
He called a council as if he had been used to calling such things all his life and having them come too whereas we all know that his former existing was that of a white mouse in a trap with that cat of a Murdstone aunt watching him through the bars
That is what is called a figure of speech
Alberts uncle told me
Councils are held in the strawloft
As soon as we were all there and the straw had stopped rustling after our sitting down Dicky said I hope its nothing to do with the Wouldbegoods
No said Denny in a hurry quite the opposite
I hope its nothing wrong said Dora and Daisy together
Itsits Hail to thee blithe spiritbird thou never wert said Denny
I mean I think its what is called a lark
You never know your luck
Go on Dentist said Dicky
Well then do you know a book called The Daisy Chain
We didnt
Its by Miss Charlotte M Yonge Daisy interrupted and its about a family of poor motherless children who tried so hard to be good and they were confirmed and had a bazaar and went to church at the Minster and one of them got married and wore black watered silk and silver ornaments
So her baby died and then she was sorry she had not been a good mother to it
And Here Dicky got up and said hed got some snares to attend to and hed receive a report of the Council after it was over
But he only got as far as the trapdoor and then Oswald the fleet of foot closed with him and they rolled together on the floor while all the others called out Come back
Come back
like guineahens on a fence
Through the rustle and bustle and hustle of the struggle with Dicky Oswald heard the voice of Denny murmuring one of his everlasting quotations Come back come back
he cried in Greek Across the stormy water And Ill forgive your Highland cheek My daughter O my daughter
When quiet was restored and Dicky had agreed to go through with the Council Denny said The Daisy Chain is not a bit like that really
Its a ripping book
One of the boys dresses up like a lady and comes to call and another tries to hit his little sister with a hoe
Its jolly fine I tell you
Denny is learning to say what he thinks just like other boys
He would never have learnt such words as ripping and jolly fine while under the auntal tyranny
Since then I have read The Daisy Chain
It is a firstrate book for girls and little boys
But we did not want to talk about The Daisy Chain just then so Oswald said But whats your lark
Denny got pale pink and said Dont hurry me
Ill tell you directly
Let me think a minute
Then he shut his pale pink eyelids a moment in thought and then opened them and stood up on the straw and said very fast Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears or if not ears pots
You know Alberts uncle said they were going to open the barrow to look for Roman remains tomorrow
Dont you think it seems a pity they shouldnt find any
Perhaps they will Dora said
But Oswald saw and he said Primus
Go ahead old man
The Dentist went ahead
In The Daisy Chain he said they dug in a Roman encampment and the children went first and put some pottery there theyd made themselves and Harrys old medal of the Duke of Wellington
The doctor helped them to some stuff to partly efface the inscription and all the grownups were sold
I thought we might You may break you may shatter The vase if you will But the scent of the Romans Will cling round it still
Denny sat down amid applause
It really was a great idea at least for HIM
It seemed to add just what was wanted to the visit of the Maidstone Antiquities
To sell the Antiquities thoroughly would be indeed splendiferous
Of course Dora made haste to point out that we had not got an old medal of the Duke of Wellington and that we hadnt any doctor who would help us to stuff to efface and etcetera but we sternly bade her stow it
We werent going to do EXACTLY like those Daisy Chain kids
The pottery was easy
We had made a lot of it by the streamwhich was the Nile when we discovered its sourceand dried it in the sun and then baked it under a bonfire like in Foul Play
And most of the things were such queer shapes that they should have done for almost anythingRoman or Greek or even Egyptian or antediluvian or household milkjugs of the cavemen Alberts uncle said
The pots were fortunately quite ready and dirty because we had already buried them in mixed sand and river mud to improve the colour and not remembered to wash it off
So the Council at once collected it alland some rusty hinges and some brass buttons and a file without a handle and the girl Councillors carried it all concealed in their pinafores while the men members carried digging tools
H O and Daisy were sent on ahead as scouts to see if the coast was clear
We have learned the true usefulness of scouts from reading about the Transvaal War
But all was still in the hush of evening sunset on the Roman ruin
We posted sentries who were to lie on their stomachs on the walls and give a long low signifying whistle if aught approached
Then we dug a tunnel like the one we once did after treasure when we happened to bury a boy
It took some time but never shall it be said that a Bastable grudged time or trouble when a lark was at stake
We put the things in as naturally as we could and shoved the dirt back till everything looked just as before
Then we went home late for tea
But it was in a good cause and there was no hot toast only breadandbutter which does not get cold with waiting
That night Alice whispered to Oswald on the stairs as we went up to bed Meet me outside your door when the others are asleep
Hist
Not a word
Oswald said No kid
And she replied in the affirmation
So he kept awake by biting his tongue and pulling his hairfor he shrinks from no pain if it is needful and right
And when the others all slept the sleep of innocent youth he got up and went out and there was Alice dressed
She said Ive found some broken things that look ever so much more Romanthey were on top of the cupboard in the library
If youll come with me well bury them just to see how surprised the others will be
It was a wild and daring act but Oswald did not mind
He said Wait half a shake
And he put on his knickerbockers and jacket and slipped a few peppermints into his pocket in case of catching cold
It is these thoughtful expedients which mark the born explorer and adventurer
It was a little cold but the white moonlight was very fair to see and we decided wed do some other daring moonlight act some other day
We got out of the front door which is never locked till Alberts uncle goes to bed at twelve or one and we ran swiftly and silently across the bridge and through the fields to the Roman ruin
Alice told me afterwards she should have been afraid if it had been dark
But the moonlight made it as bright as day is in your dreams
Oswald had taken the spade and a sheet of newspaper
We did not take all the pots Alice had foundbut just the two that werent brokentwo crooked jugs made of stuff like flowerpots are made of
We made two long cuts with the spade and lifted the turf up and scratched the earth under and took it out very carefully in handfuls on to the newspaper till the hole was deepish
Then we put in the jugs and filled it up with earth and flattened the turf over
Turf stretches like elastic
This we did a couple of yards from the place where the mound was dug into by the men and we had been so careful with the newspaper that there was no loose earth about
Then we went home in the wet moonlightat least the grass was very wetchuckling through the peppermint and got up to bed without anyone knowing a single thing about it
The next day the Antiquities came
It was a jolly hot day and the tables were spread under the trees on the lawn like a large and very grand Sundayschool treat
There were dozens of different kinds of cake and breadandbutter both white and brown and gooseberries and plums and jam sandwiches
And the girls decorated the tables with flowersblue larkspur and white Canterbury bells
And at about three there was a noise of people walking in the road and presently the Antiquities began to come in at the front gate and stood about on the lawn by twos and threes and sixes and sevens looking shy and uncomfy exactly like a Sundayschool treat
Presently some gentlemen came who looked like the teachers they were not shy and they came right up to the door
So Alberts uncle who had not been too proud to be up in our room with us watching the people on the lawn through the netting of our short blinds said I suppose thats the Committee
Come on
So we all went downwe were in our Sunday thingsand Alberts uncle received the Committee like a feudal system baron and we were his retainers
He talked about dates and king posts and gables and mullions and foundations and records and Sir Thomas Wyatt and poetry and Julius Caesar and Roman remains and lych gates and churches and dogstooth moulding till the brain of Oswald reeled
I suppose that Alberts uncle remarked that all our mouths were open which is a sign of reels in the brain for he whispered Go hence and mingle unsuspected with the crowd
So we went out on to the lawn which was now crowded with men and women and one child
This was a girl she was fat and we tried to talk to her though we did not like her
She was covered in red velvet like an armchair
But she wouldnt
We thought at first she was from a deafanddumb asylum where her kind teachers had only managed to teach the afflicted to say Yes and No
But afterwards we knew better for Noel heard her say to her mother I wish you hadnt brought me mamma
I didnt have a pretty teacup and I havent enjoyed my tea one bit
And she had had five pieces of cake besides little cakes and nearly a whole plate of plums and there were only twelve pretty teacups altogether
Several grownups talked to us in a most uninterested way and then the President read a paper about the Moat House which we couldnt understand and other people made speeches we couldnt understand either except the part about kind hospitality which made us not know where to look
Then Dora and Alice and Daisy and Mrs Pettigrew poured out the tea and we handed cups and plates
Alberts uncle took me behind a bush to see him tear what was left of his hair when he found there were one hundred and twentythree Antiquities present and I heard the President say to the Secretary that tea always fetched them
Then it was time for the Roman ruin and our hearts beat high as we took our hatsit was exactly like Sundayand joined the crowded procession of eager Antiquities
Many of them had umbrellas and overcoats though the weather was fiery and without a cloud
That is the sort of people they were
The ladies all wore stiff bonnets and no one took their gloves off though of course it was quite in the country and it is not wrong to take your gloves off there
We had planned to be quite close when the digging went on but Alberts uncle made us a mystic sign and drew us apart
Then he said The stalls and dress circle are for the guests
The hosts and hostesses retire to the gallery whence I am credibly informed an excellent view may be obtained
So we all went up on the Roman walls and thus missed the cream of the lark for we could not exactly see what was happening
But we saw that things were being taken from the ground as the men dug and passed round for the Antiquities to look at
And we knew they must be our Roman remains but the Antiquities did not seem to care for them much though we heard sounds of pleased laughter
And at last Alice and I exchanged meaning glances when the spot was reached where we had put in the extras
Then the crowd closed up thick and we heard excited talk and we knew we really HAD sold the Antiquities this time
Presently the bonnets and coats began to spread out and trickle towards the house and we were aware that all would soon be over
So we cut home the back way just in time to hear the President saying to Alberts uncle A genuine findmost interesting
Oh really you ought to have ONE
Well if you insist And so by slow and dull degrees the thick sprinkling of Antiquities melted off the lawn the party was over and only the dirty teacups and plates and the trampled grass and the pleasures of memory were left
We had a very beautiful supperout of doors too with jam sandwiches and cakes and things that were over and as we watched the setting monarch of the skiesI mean the sunAlice said Lets tell
We let the Dentist tell because it was he who hatched the lark but we helped him a little in the narrating of the fell plot because he has yet to learn how to tell a story straight from the beginning
When he had done and we had done Alberts uncle said Well it amused you and youll be glad to learn that it amused your friends the Antiquities
Didnt they think they were Roman
Daisy said they did in The Daisy Chain
Not in the least said Alberts uncle but the Treasurer and Secretary were charmed by your ingenious preparations for their reception
We didnt want them to be disappointed said Dora
They werent said Alberts uncle
Steady on with those plums HO
A little way beyond the treasure you had prepared for them they found two specimens of REAL Roman pottery which sent every manjack of them home thanking his stars he had been born a happy little Antiquary child
Those were our jugs said Alice and we really HAVE sold the Antiquities
She unfolded the tale about our getting the jugs and burying them in the moonlight and the mound and the others listened with deeply respectful interest
We really have done it this time havent we
she added in tones of welldeserved triumph
But Oswald had noticed a queer look about Alberts uncle from almost the beginning of Alices recital and he now had the sensation of something being up which has on other occasions frozen his noble blood
The silence of Alberts uncle now froze it yet more Arcticly
Havent we
repeated Alice unconscious of what her sensitive brothers delicate feelings had already got hold of
We have done it this time havent we
Since you ask me thus pointedly answered Alberts uncle at last I cannot but confess that I think you have indeed done it
Those pots on the top of the library cupboard ARE Roman pottery
The amphorae which you hid in the mound are probablyI cant say for certain mindpriceless
They are the property of the owner of this house
You have taken them out and buried them
The President of the Maidstone Antiquarian Society has taken them away in his bag
Now what are you going to do
Alice and I did not know what to say or where to look
The others added to our pained position by some ungenerous murmurs about our not being so jolly clever as we thought ourselves
There was a very far from pleasing silence
Then Oswald got up
He said Alice come here a sec I want to speak to you
As Alberts uncle had offered no advice Oswald disdained to ask him for any
Alice got up too and she and Oswald went into the garden and sat down on the bench under the quince tree and wished they had never tried to have a private lark of their very own with the Antiquities A Private Sale Alberts uncle called it afterwards
But regrets as nearly always happens were vain
Something had to be done
But what
Oswald and Alice sat in silent desperateness and the voices of the gay and careless others came to them from the lawn where heartless in their youngness they were playing tag
I dont know how they could
Oswald would not like to play tag when his brother and sister were in a hole but Oswald is an exception to some boys
But Dicky told me afterwards he thought it was only a joke of Alberts uncles
The dusk grew dusker till you could hardly tell the quinces from the leaves and Alice and Oswald still sat exhausted with hard thinking but they could not think of anything
And it grew so dark that the moonlight began to show
Then Alice jumped upjust as Oswald was opening his mouth to say the same thingand said Of coursehow silly
I know
Come on in Oswald
And they went on in
Oswald was still far too proud to consult anyone else
But he just asked carelessly if Alice and he might go into Maidstone the next day to buy some wirenetting for a rabbithutch and to see after one or two things
Alberts uncle said certainly
And they went by train with the bailiff from the farm who was going in about some sheepdip and too buy pigs
At any other time Oswald would not have been able to bear to leave the bailiff without seeing the pigs bought
But now it was different
For he and Alice had the weight on their bosoms of being thieves without having meant itand nothing not even pigs had power to charm the young but honourable Oswald till that stain had been wiped away
So he took Alice to the Secretary of the Maidstone Antiquities house and Mr Turnbull was out but the maidservant kindly told us where the President lived and ere long the trembling feet of the unfortunate brother and sister vibrated on the spotless gravel of Camperdown Villa
When they asked they were told that Mr Longchamps was at home
Then they waited paralysed with undescribed emotions in a large room with books and swords and glass bookcases with rottenlooking odds and ends in them
Mr Longchamps was a collector
That means he stuck to anything no matter how ugly and silly if only it was old
He came in rubbing his hands and very kind
He remembered us very well he said and asked what he could do for us
Oswald for once was dumb
He could not find words in which to own himself the ass he had been
But Alice was less delicately moulded
She said Oh if you please we are most awfully sorry and we hope youll forgive us but we thought it would be such a pity for you and all the other poor dear Antiquities to come all that way and then find nothing Romanso we put some pots and things in the barrow for you to find
So I perceived said the President stroking his white beard and smiling most agreeably at us a harmless joke my dear
Youths the season for jesting
Theres no harm donepray think no more about it
Its very honourable of you to come and apologize Im sure
His brow began to wear the furrowed anxious look of one who would fain be rid of his guests and get back to what he was doing before they interrupted him
Alice said We didnt come for that
Its MUCH worse
Those were two REAL true Roman jugs you took away we put them there they arent ours
We didnt know they were real Roman
We wanted to sell the AntiquitiesI mean Antiquariesand we were sold ourselves
This is serious said the gentleman
I suppose youd know thethe jugs if you saw them again
Anywhere said Oswald with the confidential rashness of one who does not know what he is talking about
Mr Longchamps opened the door of a little room leading out of the one we were in and beckoned us to follow
We found ourselves amid shelves and shelves of pottery of all sorts and two whole shelves small oneswere filled with the sort of jug we wanted
Well said the President with a veiled menacing sort of smile like a wicked cardinal which is it
Oswald said I dont know
Alice said I should know if I had it in my hand
The President patiently took the jugs down one after another and Alice tried to look inside them
And one after another she shook her head and gave them back
At last she said You didnt WASH them
Mr Longchamps shuddered and said No
Then said Alice there is something written with leadpencil inside both the jugs
I wish I hadnt
I would rather you didnt read it
I didnt know it would be a nice old gentleman like you would find it
I thought it would be the younger gentleman with the thin legs and the narrow smile
Mr Turnbull
The President seemed to recognize the description unerringly
Well wellboys will be boysgirls I mean
I wont be angry
Look at all the jugs and see if you can find yours
Alice didand the next one she looked at she said This is oneand two jugs further on she said This is the other
Well the President said these are certainly the specimens which I obtained yesterday
If your uncle will call on me I will return them to him
But its a disappointment
Yes I think you must let me look inside
He did
And at the first one he said nothing
At the second he laughed
Well well he said we cant expect old heads on young shoulders
Youre not the first who went forth to shear and returned shorn
Nor it appears am I
Next time you have a Sale of Antiquities take care that you yourself are not sold
Goodday to you my dear
Dont let the incident prey on your mind he said to Alice
Bless your heart I was a boy once myself unlikely as you may think it
Goodbye
We were in time to see the pigs bought after all
I asked Alice what on earth it was shed scribbled inside the beastly jugs and she owned that just to make the lark complete she had written Sucks in one of the jugs and Sold again silly in the other
But we know well enough who it was that was sold
And if ever we have any Antiquities to tea again they shant find so much as a Greek waistcoat button if we can help it
Unless its the President for he did not behave at all badly
For a man of his age I think he behaved exceedingly well
Oswald can picture a very different scene having been enacted over those rotten pots if the President had been an otherwise sort of man
But that picture is not pleasing so Oswald will not distress you by drawing it for you
You can most likely do it easily for yourself
CHAPTER 11 THE BENEVOLENT BAR The tramp was very dusty about the feet and legs and his clothes were very ragged and dirty but he had cheerful twinkly grey eyes and he touched his cap to the girls when he spoke to us though a little as though he would rather not
We were on the top of the big wall of the Roman ruin in the Three Tree pasture
We had just concluded a severe siege with bows and arrowsthe ones that were given us to make up for the pistol that was confiscated after the sad but not sinful occasion when it shot a fox
To avoid accidents that you would be sorry for afterwards Oswald in his thoughtfulness had decreed that everyone was to wear wire masks
Luckily there were plenty of these because a man who lived in the Moat House once went to Rome where they throw hundreds and thousands at each other in play and call it a Comfit Battle or Battaglia di Confetti thats real Italian
And he wanted to get up that sort of thing among the village peoplebut they were too beastly slack so he chucked it
And in the attic were the wire masks he brought home with him from Rome which people wear to prevent the nasty comfits getting in their mouths and eyes
So we were all armed to the teeth with masks and arrows but in attacking or defending a fort your real strength is not in your equipment but in your power of Shove
Oswald Alice Noel and Denny defended the fort
We were much the strongest side but that was how Dicky and Oswald picked up
The others got in it is true but that was only because an arrow hit Dicky on the nose and it bled quarts as usual though hit only through the wire mask
Then he put into dock for repairs and while the defending party werent looking he sneaked up the wall at the back and shoved Oswald off and fell on top of him so that the fort now that it had lost its gallant young leader the life and soul of the besieged party was of course soon overpowered and had to surrender
Then we sat on the top and ate some peppermints Alberts uncle brought us a bag of from Maidstone when he went to fetch away the Roman pottery we tried to sell the Antiquities with
The battle was over and peace raged among us as we sat in the sun on the big wall and looked at the fields all blue and swimming in the heat
We saw the tramp coming through the beetfield
He made a dusty blot on the fair scene
When he saw us he came close to the wall and touched his cap as I have said and remarked Excuse me interrupting of your sports young gentlemen and ladies but if you could so far oblige as to tell a labouring man the way to the nearest pub
Its a dry day and no error
The Rose and Crown is the best pub said Dicky and the landlady is a friend of ours
Its about a mile if you go by the field path
Lor love a duck
said the tramp a miles a long way and walkings a dry job this ere weather
We said we agreed with him
Upon my sacred said the tramp if there was a pump handy I believe Id take a turn at itI would indeed so help me if I wouldnt
Though water always upsets me and makes my and shaky
We had not cared much about tramps since the adventure of the villainous sailorman and the Tower of Mystery but we had the dogs on the wall with us Lady was awfully difficult to get up on account of her long deerhound legs and the position was a strong one and easy to defend
Besides the tramp did not look like that bad sailor nor talk like it
And we considerably outnumbered the tramp anyway
Alice nudged Oswald and said something about Sir Philip Sidney and the tramps need being greater than his so Oswald was obliged to go to the hole in the top of the wall where we store provisions during sieges and get out the bottle of gingerbeer which he had gone without when the others had theirs so as to drink it when he got really thirsty
Meanwhile Alice said Weve got some gingerbeer my brothers getting it
I hope you wont mind drinking out of our glass
We cant wash it you knowunless we rinse it out with a little gingerbeer
Dont ye do it miss he said eagerly never waste good liquor on washing
The glass was beside us on the wall
Oswald filled it with gingerbeer and handed down the foaming tankard to the tramp
He had to lie on his young stomach to do this
The tramp was really quite politeone of Natures gentlemen and a man as well we found out afterwards
He said Heres to you
before he drank
Then he drained the glass till the rim rested on his nose
Swelp me but I WAS dry he said
Dont seem to matter much what it is this weather do itso long as its suthink wet
Well heres thanking you
Youre very welcome said Dora Im glad you liked it
Like it
said he
I dont suppose you know what its like to have a thirst on you
Talk of free schools and free libraries and free baths and washhouses and such
Why dont someone start free DRINKS
Hed be a ero he would
Id vote for him any day of the week and one over
Ef yer dont objec Ill set down a bit and put on a pipe
He sat down on the grass and began to smoke
We asked him questions about himself and he told us many of his secret sorrowsespecially about there being no work nowadays for an honest man
At last he dropped asleep in the middle of a story about a vestry he worked for that hadnt acted fair and square by him like he had by them or it I dont know if vestry is singular or plural and we went home
But before we went we held a hurried council and collected what money we could from the little we had with us it was ninepencehalfpenny and wrapped it in an old envelope Dicky had in his pocket and put it gently on the billowing middle of the poor tramps sleeping waistcoat so that he would find it when he woke
None of the dogs said a single syllable while we were doing this so we knew they believed him to be poor but honest and we always find it safe to take their word for things like that
As we went home a brooding silence fell upon us we found out afterwards that those words of the poor tramps about free drinks had sunk deep in all our hearts and rankled there
After dinner we went out and sat with our feet in the stream
People tell you it makes your grub disagree with you to do this just after meals but it never hurts us
There is a fallen willow across the stream that just seats the eight of us only the ones at the end cant get their feet into the water properly because of the bushes so we keep changing places
We had got some liquorice root to chew
This helps thought
Dora broke a peaceful silence with this speech Free drinks
The words awoke a response in every breast
I wonder someone doesnt H O said leaning back till he nearly toppled in and was only saved by Oswald and Alice at their own deadly peril
Do for goodness sake sit still H O observed Alice
It would be a glorious act
I wish WE could
What sit still
asked H O
No my child replied Oswald most of us can do that when we try
Your angel sister was only wishing to set up free drinks for the poor and thirsty
Not for all of them Alice said just a few
Change places now Dicky
My feet arent properly wet at all
It is very difficult to change places safely on the willow
The changers have to crawl over the laps of the others while the rest sit tight and hold on for all theyre worth
But the hard task was accomplished and then Alice went on And we couldnt do it for always only a day or twojust while our money held out
Eiffel Tower lemonades the best and you get a jolly lot of it for your money too
There must be a great many sincerely thirsty persons go along the Dover Road every day
It wouldnt be bad
Weve got a little chink between us said Oswald
And then think how the poor grateful creatures would linger and tell us about their inmost sorrows
It would be most frightfully interesting
We could write all their agonied life histories down afterwards like All the Year Round Christmas numbers
Oh do lets
Alice was wriggling so with earnestness that Dicky thumped her to make her calm
We might do it just for one day Oswald said but it wouldnt be muchonly a drop in the ocean compared with the enormous dryness of all the people in the whole world
Still every little helps as the mermaid said when she cried into the sea
I know a piece of poetry about that Denny said
Small things are best
Care and unrest To wealth and rank are given But little things On little wings do something or other I forget what but it means the same as Oswald was saying about the mermaid
What are you going to call it
asked Noel coming out of a dream
Call what
The Free Drinks game
Its a horrid shame If the Free Drinks game Doesnt have a name
You would be to blame If anyone came And Oh shut up
remarked Dicky
Youve been making that rot up all the time weve been talking instead of listening properly
Dicky hates poetry
I dont mind it so very much myself especially Macaulays and Kiplings and Noels
There was a lot morelame and dame and name and game and thingsand now Ive forgotten it Noel said in gloom
Never mind Alice answered itll come back to you in the silent watches of the night you see if it doesnt
But really Noels right it OUGHT to have a name
Free Drinks Company
Thirsty Travellers Rest
The Travellers joy
These names were suggested but not cared for extra
Then someone saidI think it was Oswald Why not The House Beautiful
It cant be a house it must be in the road
Itll only be a stall
The Stall Beautiful is simply silly Oswald said
The Bar Beautiful then said Dicky who knows what the Rose and Crown bar is like inside which of course is hidden from girls
Oh wait a minute cried the Dentist snapping his fingers like he always does when he is trying to remember things
I thought of something only Daisy tickled me and its goneI knowlets call it the Benevolent Bar
It was exactly right and told the whole truth in two words
Benevolent showed it was free and Bar showed what was free eg
things to drink
The Benevolent Bar it was
We went home at once to prepare for the morrow for of course we meant to do it the very next day
Procrastination is you know whatand delays are dangerous
If we had waited long we might have happened to spend our money on something else
The utmost secrecy had to be observed because Mrs Pettigrew hates tramps
Most people do who keep fowls
Alberts uncle was in London till the next evening so we could not consult him but we know he is always chock full of intelligent sympathy with the poor and needy
Acting with the deepest disguise we made an awning to cover the Benevolent Bar keepers from the searching rays of the monarch of the skies
We found some old striped sunblinds in the attic and the girls sewed them together
They were not very big when they were done so we added the girls striped petticoats
I am sorry their petticoats turn up so constantly in my narrative but they really are very useful especially when the band is cut off
The girls borrowed Mrs Pettigrews sewingmachine they could not ask her leave without explanations which we did not wish to give just then and she had lent it to them before
They took it into the cellar to work it so that she should not hear the noise and ask bothering questions
They had to balance it on one end of the beerstand
It was not easy
While they were doing the sewing we boys went out and got willow poles and chopped the twigs off and got ready as well as we could to put up the awning
When we returned a detachment of us went down to the shop in the village for Eiffel Tower lemonade
We bought sevenandsixpence worth then we made a great label to say what the bar was for
Then there was nothing else to do except to make rosettes out of a blue sash of Daisys to show we belonged to the Benevolent Bar
The next day was as hot as ever
We rose early from our innocent slumbers and went out to the Dover Road to the spot we had marked down the day before
It was at a crossroads so as to be able to give drinks to as many people as possible
We hid the awning and poles behind the hedge and went home to brekker
After break we got the big zinc bath they wash clothes in and after filling it with clean water we just had to empty it again because it was too heavy to lift
So we carried it vacant to the trystingspot and left H O and Noel to guard it while we went and fetched separate pails of water very heavy work and no one who wasnt really benevolent would have bothered about it for an instant
Oswald alone carried three pails
So did Dicky and the Dentist
Then we rolled down some empty barrels and stood up three of them by the roadside and put planks on them
This made a very firstclass table and we covered it with the best tablecloth we could find in the linen cupboard
We brought out several glasses and some teacupsnot the best ones Oswald was firm about thatand the kettle and spiritlamp and the teapot in case any weary trampwoman fancied a cup of tea instead of Eiffel Tower
H O and Noel had to go down to the shop for tea they need not have grumbled they had not carried any of the water
And their having to go the second time was only because we forgot to tell them to get some real lemons to put on the bar to show what the drink would be like when you got it
The man at the shop kindly gave us tick for the lemons and we cashed up out of our next weeks pocketmoney
Two or three people passed while we were getting things ready but no one said anything except the man who said Bloomin Sundayschool treat and as it was too early in the day for anyone to be thirsty we did not stop the wayfarers to tell them their thirst could be slaked without cost at our Benevolent Bar
But when everything was quite ready and our blue rosettes fastened on our breasts over our benevolent hearts we stuck up the great placard we had made with Benevolent Bar
Free Drinks to all Weary Travellers in white wadding on red calico like Christmas decorations in church
We had meant to fasten this to the edge of the awning but we had to pin it to the front of the tablecloth because I am sorry to say the awning went wrong from the first
We could not drive the willow poles into the road it was much too hard
And in the ditch it was too soft besides being no use
So we had just to cover our benevolent heads with our hats and take it in turns to go into the shadow of the tree on the other side of the road
For we had pitched our table on the sunny side of the way of course relying on our brokenreedlike awning and wishing to give it a fair chance
Everything looked very nice and we longed to see somebody really miserable come along so as to be able to allieve their distress
A man and woman were the first they stopped and stared but when Alice said Free drinks
Free drinks
Arent you thirsty
they said No thank you and went on
Then came a person from the villagehe didnt even say Thank you when we asked him and Oswald began to fear it might be like the awful time when we wandered about on Christmas Day trying to find poor persons and persuade them to eat our Conscience pudding
But a man in a blue jersey and a red bundle eased Oswalds fears by being willing to drink a glass of lemonade and even to say Thank you Im sure quite nicely
After that it was better
As we had foreseen there were plenty of thirsty people walking along the Dover Road and even some from the crossroad
We had had the pleasure of seeing nineteen tumblers drained to the dregs ere we tasted any ourselves
Nobody asked for tea
More people went by than we gave lemonade to
Some wouldnt have it because they were too grand
One man told us he could pay for his own liquor when he was dry which praise be he wasnt over and above at present and others asked if we hadnt any beer and when we said No they said it showed what sort we wereas if the sort was not a good one which it is
And another man said Slops again
You never get nothing for nothing not this side of heaven you dont
Look at the bloomin blue ribbon on em
Oh Lor
and went on quite sadly without having a drink
Our Pigman who helped us on the Tower of Mystery day went by and we hailed him and explained it all to him and gave him a drink and asked him to call as he came back
He liked it all and said we were a real good sort
How different from the man who wanted the beer
Then he went on
One thing I didnt like and that was the way boys began to gather
Of course we could not refuse to give drinks to any traveller who was old enough to ask for it but when one boy had had three glasses of lemonade and asked for another Oswald said I think youve had jolly well enough
You cant be really thirsty after all that lot
The boy said Oh cant I
Youll just see if I cant and went away
Presently he came back with four other boys all bigger than Oswald and they all asked for lemonade
Oswald gave it to the four new ones but he was determined in his behaviour to the other one and wouldnt give him a drop
Then the five of them went and sat on a gate a little way off and kept laughing in a nasty way and whenever a boy went by they called out I say eres a go and as often as not the new boy would hang about with them
It was disquieting for though they had nearly all had lemonade we could see it had not made them friendly
A great glorious glow of goodness gladdened those go all together and are called alliteration our hearts when we saw our own tramp coming down the road
The dogs did not growl at him as they had at the boys or the beerman
I did not say before that we had the dogs with us but of course we had because we had promised never to go out without them
Oswald said Hullo and the tramp said Hullo
Then Alice said You see weve taken your advice were giving free drinks
Doesnt it all look nice
It does that said the tramp
I dont mind if I do
So we gave him two glasses of lemonade succeedingly and thanked him for giving us the idea
He said we were very welcome and if wed no objection hed sit down a bit and put on a pipe
He did and after talking a little more he fell asleep
Drinking anything seemed to end in sleep with him
I always thought it was only beer and things made people sleepy but he was not so
When he was asleep he rolled into the ditch but it did not wake him up
The boys were getting very noisy and they began to shout things and to make silly noises with their mouths and when Oswald and Dicky went over to them and told them to just chuck it they were worse than ever
I think perhaps Oswald and Dicky might have fought and settled themthough there were eleven yet back to back you can always do it against overwhelming numbers in a bookonly Alice called out Oswald heres some more come back
We went
Three big men were coming down the road very red and hot and not amiablelooking
They stopped in front of the Benevolent Bar and slowly read the wadding and redstuff label
Then one of them said he was blessed or something like that and another said he was too
The third one said Blessed or not a drinks a drink
Blue ribbon though by  a word you ought not to say though it is in the Bible and the catechism as well
Lets have a liquor little missy
The dogs were growling but Oswald thought it best not to take any notice of what the dogs said but to give these men each a drink
So he did
They drank but not as if they cared about it very much and then they set their glasses down on the table a liberty no one else had entered into and began to try and chaff Oswald
Oswald said in an undervoice to H
O Just take charge
I want to speak to the girls a sec
Call if you want anything
And then he drew the others away to say he thought thered been enough of it and considering the boys and new three men perhaps wed better chuck it and go home
Wed been benevolent nearly four hours anyway
While this conversation and the objections of the others were going on H O perpetuated an act which nearly wrecked the Benevolent Bar
Of course Oswald was not an eye or ear witness of what happened but from what H O said in the calmer moments of later life I think this was about what happened
One of the big disagreeable men said to H
O Aint got such a thing as a drop o spirit ave yer
H O said no we hadnt only lemonade and tea
Lemonade and tea
blank bad word I told you about and blazes replied the bad character for such he afterwards proved to be
Whats THAT then
He pointed to a bottle labelled Dewars whisky which stood on the table near the spiritkettle
Oh is THAT what you want
said H O kindly
The man is understood to have said he should bloomin well think so but H O is not sure about the bloomin
He held out his glass with about half the lemonade in it and H O generously filled up the tumbler out of the bottle labelled Dewars whisky
The man took a great drink and then suddenly he spat out what happened to be left in his mouth just then and began to swear
It was then that Oswald and Dicky rushed upon the scene
The man was shaking his fist in H
O
s face and H O was still holding on to the bottle we had brought out the methylated spirit in for the lamp in case of anyone wanting tea which they hadnt
If I was Jim said the second ruffian for such indeed they were when he had snatched the bottle from H O and smelt it Id chuck the whole show over the hedge so I would and you young gutter snipes after it so I wouldnt
Oswald saw in a moment that in point of strength if not numbers he and his party were outmatched and the unfriendly boys were drawing gladly near
It is no shame to signal for help when in distressthe best ships do it every day
Oswald shouted Help help
Before the words were out of his brave yet trembling lips our own tramp leapt like an antelope from the ditch and said Now then whats up
The biggest of the three men immediately knocked him down
He lay still
The biggest then said Come onany more of you
Come on
Oswald was so enraged at this cowardly attack that he actually hit out at the big manand he really got one in just above the belt
Then he shut his eyes because he felt that now all was indeed up
There was a shout and a scuffle and Oswald opened his eyes in astonishment at finding himself still whole and unimpaired
Our own tramp had artfully simulated insensibleness to get the men off their guard and then had suddenly got his arms round a leg each of two of the men and pulled them to the ground helped by Dicky who saw his game and rushed in at the same time exactly like Oswald would have done if he had not had his eyes shut ready to meet his doom
The unpleasant boys shouted and the third man tried to help his unrespectable friends now on their backs involved in a desperate struggle with our own tramp who was on top of them accompanied by Dicky
It all happened in a minute and it was all mixed up
The dogs were growling and barkingMartha had one of the men by the trouser leg and Pincher had another the girls were screaming like mad and the strange boys shouted and laughed little beasts
 and then suddenly our Pigman came round the corner and two friends of his with him
He had gone and fetched them to take care of us if anything unpleasant occurred
It was a very thoughtful and just like him
Fetch the police
cried the Pigman in noble tones and H O started running to do it
But the scoundrels struggled from under Dicky and our tramp shook off the dogs and some bits of trouser and fled heavily down the road
Our Pigman said Get along home
to the disagreeable boys and Shood them as if they were hens and they went
H O ran back when they began to go up the road and there we were all standing breathless in tears on the scene of the late desperate engagement
Oswald gives you his word of honour that his and Dickys tears were tears of pure rage
There are such things as tears of pure rage
Anyone who knows will tell you so
We picked up our own tramp and bathed the lump on his forehead with lemonade
The water in the zinc bath had been upset in the struggle
Then he and the Pigman and his kind friends helped us carry our things home
The Pigman advised us on the way not to try these sort of kind actions without getting a grownup to help us
Weve been advised this before but now I really think we shall never try to be benevolent to the poor and needy again
At any rate not unless we know them very well first
We have seen our own tramp often since
The Pigman gave him a job
He has got work to do at last
The Pigman says he is not such a very bad chap only he will fall asleep after the least drop of drink
We know that is his failing
We saw it at once
But it was lucky for us he fell asleep that day near our benevolent bar
I will not go into what my father said about it all
There was a good deal in it about minding your own businessthere generally is in most of the talkingsto we get
But he gave our tramp a sovereign and the Pigman says he went to sleep on it for a solid week
CHAPTER 12 THE CANTERBURY PILGRIMS The author of these few lines really does hope to goodness that no one will be such an owl as to think from the number of things we did when we were in the country that we were wretched neglected little children whose grownup relations sparkled in the bright haunts of pleasure and whirled in the giddy whatsitsname of fashion while we were left to weep forsaken at home
It was nothing of the kind and I wish you to know that my father was with us a good dealand Alberts uncle who is really no uncle of ours but only of Albert next door when we lived in Lewisham gave up a good many of his valuable hours to us
And the father of Denny and Daisy came now and then and other people quite as many as we wished to see
And we had some very decent times with them and enjoyed ourselves very much indeed thank you
In some ways the good times you have with grownups are better than the ones you have by yourselves
At any rate they are safer
It is almost impossible then to do anything fatal without being pulled up short by a grownup ere yet the deed is done
And if you are careful anything that goes wrong can be looked on as the grownups fault
But these secure pleasures are not so interesting to tell about as the things you do when there is no one to stop you on the edge of the rash act
It is curious too that many of our most interesting games happened when grownups were far away
For instance when we were pilgrims
It was just after the business of the Benevolent Bar and it was a wet day
It is not easy to amuse yourself indoors on a wet day as older people seem to think especially when you are far removed from your own home and havent got all your own books and things
The girls were playing Halmawhich is a beastly gameNoel was writing poetry H O was singing I dont know what to do to the tune of Canaans happy shore
It goes like this and is very tiresome to listen to I dont know what to dooooooo
I dont know what to dooooo
It IS a beastly rainy day And I dont know what to do
The rest of us were trying to make him shut up
We put a carpet bag over his head but he went on inside it and then we sat on him but he sang under us we held him upside down and made him crawl head first under the sofa but when even there he kept it up we saw that nothing short of violence would induce him to silence so we let him go
And then he said we had hurt him and we said we were only in fun and he said if we were he wasnt and ill feeling might have grown up even out of a playful brotherly act like ours had been only Alice chucked the Halma and said Let dogs delight
Come onlets play something
Then Dora said Yes but look here
Now were together I do want to say something
What about the Wouldbegoods Society
Many of us groaned and one said Hear
hear
I will not say which one but it was not Oswald
No but really Dora said I dont want to be preachybut you know we DID say wed try to be good
And it says in a book I was reading only yesterday that NOT being naughty is not enough
You must BE good
And weve hardly done anything
The Golden Deed books almost empty
Couldnt we have a book of leaden deeds
said Noel coming out of his poetry then thered be plenty for Alice to write about if she wants to or brass or zinc or aluminium deeds
We shant ever fill the book with golden ones
H O had rolled himself in the red tablecloth and said Noel was only advising us to be naughty and again peace waved in the balance
But Alice said Oh H O DONThe didnt mean that but really and truly I wish wrong things werent so interesting
You begin to do a noble act and then it gets so exciting and before you know where you are you are doing something wrong as hard as you can lick
And enjoying it too Dick said
Its very curious Denny said but you dont seem to be able to be certain inside yourself whether what youre doing is right if you happen to like doing it but if you dont like doing it you know quite well
I only thought of that just now
I wish Noel would make a poem about it
I am Noel said it began about a crocodile but it is finishing itself up quite different from what I meant it to at first
just wait a minute
He wrote very hard while his kind brothers and sisters and his little friends waited the minute he had said and then he read The crocodile is very wise He lives in the Nile with little eyes He eats the hippopotamus too And if he could he would eat up you
The lovely woods and starry skies He looks upon with glad surprise
He sees the riches of the east And the tiger and lion kings of beast
So let all be good and beware Of saying shant and wont and dont care For doing wrong is easier far Than any of the right things I know about are
And I couldnt make it king of beasts because of it not rhyming with east so I put the s off beasts on to king
It comes even in the end
We all said it was a very nice piece of poetry
Noel gets really ill if you dont like what he writes and then he said If its trying thats wanted I dont care how hard we TRY to be good but we may as well do it some nice way
Lets be Pilgrims Progress like I wanted to at first
And we were all beginning to say we didnt want to when suddenly Dora said Oh look here
I know
Well be the Canterbury Pilgrims
People used to go pilgrimages to make themselves good
With peas in their shoes the Dentist said
Its in a piece of poetryonly the man boiled his peaswhich is quite unfair
Oh yes said H O and cocked hats
Not cockedcockledit was Alice who said this
And they had staffs and scrips and they told each other tales
We might as well
Oswald and Dora had been reading about the Canterbury Pilgrims in a book called A Short History of the English People
It is not at all short reallythree fat volumesbut it has jolly good pictures
It was written by a gentleman named Green
So Oswald said All right
Ill be the Knight
Ill be the wife of Bath Dora said
What will you be Dicky
Oh I dont care Ill be Mr Bath if you like
We dont know much about the people Alice said
How many were there
Thirty Oswald replied but we neednt be all of them
Theres a NunPriest
Is that a man or a woman
Oswald said he could not be sure by the picture but Alice and Noel could be it between them
So that was settled
Then we got the book and looked at the dresses to see if we could make up dresses for the parts
At first we thought we would because it would be something to do and it was a very wet day but they looked difficult especially the Millers
Denny wanted to be the Miller but in the end he was the Doctor because it was next door to Dentist which is what we call him for short
Daisy was to be the Prioressbecause she is good and has a soft little red mouth and H O
WOULD be the Manciple I dont know what that is because the picture of him is bigger than most of the others and he said Manciple was a nice portmanteau wordhalf mandarin and half disciple
Lets get the easiest parts of the dresses ready first
Alice saidthe pilgrims staffs and hats and the cockles
So Oswald and Dicky braved the fury of the elements and went into the wood beyond the orchard to cut ashsticks
We got eight jolly good long ones
Then we took them home and the girls bothered till we changed our clothes which were indeed sopping with the elements we had faced
Then we peeled the sticks
They were nice and white at first but they soon got dirty when we carried them
It is a curious thing however often you wash your hands they always seem to come off on anything white
And we nailed paper rosettes to the tops of them
That was the nearest we could get to cockleshells
And we may as well have them there as on our hats Alice said
And lets call each other by our right names today just to get into it
Dont you think so Knight
Yea NunPriest Oswald was replying but Noel said she was only half the NunPriest and again a threat of unpleasantness darkened the air
But Alice said Dont be a piggywiggy Noel dear you can have it all I dont want it
Ill just be a plain pilgrim or Henry who killed Becket
So she was called the Plain Pilgrim and she did not mind
We thought of cocked hats but they are warm to wear and the big garden hats that make you look like pictures on the covers of plantation songs did beautifully
We put cockleshells on them
Sandals we did try with pieces of oilcloth cut the shape of soles and fastened with tape but the dust gets into your toes so and we decided boots were better for such a long walk
Some of the pilgrims who were very earnest decided to tie their boots with white tape crossed outside to pretend sandals
Denny was one of these earnest palmers
As for dresses there was no time to make them properly and at first we thought of nightgowns but we decided not to in case people in Canterbury were not used to that sort of pilgrim nowadays
We made up our minds to go as we wereor as we might happen to be next day
You will be ready to believe we hoped next day would be fine
It was
Fair was the morn when the pilgrims arose and went down to breakfast
Alberts uncle had had brekker early and was hard at work in his study
We heard his quill pen squeaking when we listened at the door
It is not wrong to listen at doors when there is only one person inside because nobody would tell itself secrets aloud when it was alone
We got lunch from the housekeeper Mrs Pettigrew
She seems almost to LIKE us all to go out and take our lunch with us
Though I should think it must be very dull for her all alone
I remember though that Eliza our late general at Lewisham was just the same
We took the dear dogs of course
Since the Tower of Mystery happened we are not allowed to go anywhere without the escort of these faithful friends of man
We did not take Martha because bulldogs do not like walks
Remember this if you ever have one of those valuable animals
When we were all ready with our big hats and cockleshells and our staves and our tape sandals the pilgrims looked very nice
Only we havent any scrips Dora said
What is a scrip
I think its something to read
A roll of parchment or something
So we had old newspapers rolled up and carried them in our hands
We took the Globe and the Westminster Gazette because they are pink and green
The Dentist wore his white sandshoes sandalled with black tape and bare legs
They really looked almost as good as bare feet
We OUGHT to have peas in our shoes he said
But we did not think so
We knew what a very little stone in your boot will do let alone peas
Of course we knew the way to go to Canterbury because the old Pilgrims Road runs just above our house
It is a very pretty road narrow and often shady
It is nice for walking but carts do not like it because it is rough and rutty so there is grass growing in patches on it
I have said that it was a fine day which means that it was not raining but the sun did not shine all the time
Tis well O Knight said Alice that the orb of day shines not in undiwhatsitsnamesplendour
Thou sayest sooth Plain Pilgrim replied Oswald
Tis jolly warm even as it is
I wish I wasnt two people Noel said it seems to make me hotter
I think Ill be a Reeve or something
But we would not let him and we explained that if he hadnt been so beastly particular Alice would have been half of him and he had only himself to thank if being all of a NunPriest made him hot
But it WAS warm certainly and it was some time since wed gone so far in boots
Yet when H O complained we did our duty as pilgrims and made him shut up
He did as soon as Alice said that about whining and grizzling being below the dignity of a Manciple
It was so warm that the Prioress and the wife of Bath gave up walking with their arms round each other in their usual silly way Alberts uncle calls it Laura Matildaing and the Doctor and Mr Bath had to take their jackets off and carry them
I am sure if an artist or a photographer or any person who liked pilgrims had seen us he would have been very pleased
The paper cockleshells were firstrate but it was awkward having them on the top of the staffs because they got in your way when you wanted the staff to use as a walkingstick
We stepped out like a man all of us and kept it up as well as we could in booktalk and at first all was merry as a dinnerbell but presently Oswald who was the very perfect gentle knight could not help noticing that one of us was growing very silent and rather pale like people are when they have eaten something that disagrees with them before they are quite sure of the fell truth
So he said Whats up Dentist old man
quite kindly and like a perfect knight though of course he was annoyed with Denny
It is sickening when people turn pale in the middle of a game and everything is spoiled and you have to go home and tell the spoiler how sorry you are that he is knocked up and pretend not to mind about the game being spoiled
Denny said Nothing but Oswald knew better
Then Alice said Lets rest a bit Oswald it IS hot
Sir Oswald if you please Plain Pilgrim returned her brother dignifiedly
Remember Im a knight
So then we sat down and had lunch and Denny looked better
We played adverbs and twenty questions and apprenticing your son for a bit in the shade and then Dicky said it was time to set sail if we meant to make the port of Canterbury that night
Of course pilgrims reck not of ports but Dicky never does play the game thoughtfully
We went on
I believe we should have got to Canterbury all right and quite early only Denny got paler and paler and presently Oswald saw beyond any doubt that he was beginning to walk lame
Shoes hurt you Dentist
he said still with kind striving cheerfulness
Not muchits all right returned the other
So on we wentbut we were all a bit tired nowand the sun was hotter and hotter the clouds had gone away
We had to begin to sing to keep up our spirits
We sang The British Grenadiers and John Browns Body which is grand to march to and a lot of others
We were just starting on Tramp tramp tramp the boys are marching when Denny stopped short
He stood first on one foot and then on the other and suddenly screwed up his face and put his knuckles in his eyes and sat down on a heap of stones by the roadside
When we pulled his hands down he was actually crying
The author does not wish to say it is babyish to cry
Whatever is up
we all asked and Daisy and Dora petted him to get him to say but he only went on howling and said it was nothing only would we go on and leave him and call for him as we came back
Oswald thought very likely something had given Denny the stomachache and he did not like to say so before all of us so he sent the others away and told them to walk on a bit
Then he said Now Denny dont be a young ass
What is it
Is it stomachache
And Denny stopped crying to say No
as loud as he could
Well then Oswald said look here youre spoiling the whole thing
Dont be a jackape Denny
What is it
You wont tell the others if I tell you
Not if you say not Oswald answered in kindly tones
Well its my shoes
Take them off man
You wont laugh
NO
cried Oswald so impatiently that the others looked back to see why he was shouting
He waved them away and with humble gentleness began to undo the blacktape sandals
Denny let him crying hard all the time
When Oswald had got off the first shoe the mystery was made plain to him
Well
Of all the he said in proper indignation
Denny quailedthough he said he did notbut then he doesnt know what quailing is and if Denny did not quail then Oswald does not know what quailing is either
For when Oswald took the shoe off he naturally chucked it down and gave it a kick and a lot of little pinky yellow things rolled out
And Oswald look closer at the interesting sight
And the little things were SPLIT peas
Perhaps youll tell me said the gentle knight with the politeness of despair why on earth youve played the goat like this
Oh dont be angry Denny said and now his shoes were off he curled and uncurled his toes and stopped crying
I KNEW pilgrims put peas in their shoesandoh I wish you wouldnt laugh
Im not said Oswald still with bitter politeness
I didnt want to tell you I was going to because I wanted to be better than all of you and I thought if you knew I was going to youd want to too and you wouldnt when I said it first
So I just put some peas in my pocket and dropped one or two at a time into my shoes when you werent looking
In his secret heart Oswald said Greedy young ass
For it IS greedy to want to have more of anything than other people even goodness
Outwardly Oswald said nothing
You seeDenny went onI do want to be good
And if pilgriming is to do you good you ought to do it properly
I shouldnt mind being hurt in my feet if it would make me good for ever and ever
And besides I wanted to play the game thoroughly
You always say I dont
The breast of the kind Oswald was touched by these last words
I think youre quite good enough he said
Ill fetch back the othersno they wont laugh
And we all went back to Denny and the girls made a fuss with him
But Oswald and Dicky were grave and stood aloof
They were old enough to see that being good was all very well but after all you had to get the boy home somehow
When they said this as agreeably as they could Denny said Its all rightsomeone will give me a lift
You think everything in the world can be put right with a lift Dicky said and he did not speak lovingly
So it can said Denny when its your feet
I shall easily get a lift home
Not here you wont said Alice
No one goes down this road but the high roads just round the corner where you see the telegraph wires
Dickie and Oswald made a sedan chair and carried Denny to the high road and we sat down in a ditch to wait
For a long time nothing went by but a brewers dray
We hailed it of course but the man was so sound asleep that our hails were vain and none of us thought soon enough about springing like a flash to the horses heads though we all thought of it directly the dray was out of sight
So we had to keep on sitting there by the dusty road and more than one pilgrim was heard to say it wished we had never come
Oswald was not one of those who uttered this useless wish
At last just when despair was beginning to eat into the vital parts of even Oswald there was a quick taptapping of horses feet on the road and a dogcart came in sight with a lady in it all alone
We hailed her like the desperate shipwrecked mariners in the longboat hail the passing sail
She pulled up
She was not a very old ladytwentyfive we found out afterwards her age wasand she looked jolly
Well she said whats the matter
Its this poor little boy Dora said pointing to the Dentist who had gone to sleep in the dry ditch with his mouth open as usual
His feet hurt him so and will you give him a lift
But why are you all rigged out like this
asked the lady looking at our cockleshells and sandals and things
We told her
And how has he hurt his feet
she asked
And we told her that
She looked very kind
Poor little chap she said
Where do you want to go
We told her that too
We had no concealments from this lady
Well she said I have to go on towhat is its name
Canterbury said H O
Well yes Canterbury she said its only about half a mile
Ill take the poor little pilgrimand yes the three girls
You boys must walk
Then well have tea and see the sights and Ill drive you homeat least some of you
How will that do
We thanked her very much indeed and said it would do very nicely
Then we helped Denny into the cart and the girls got up and the red wheels of the cart spun away through the dust
I wish it had been an omnibus the lady was driving said H O then we could all have had a ride
Dont you be so discontented Dicky said
And Noel said You ought to be jolly thankful you havent got to carry Denny all the way home on your back
Youd have had to if youd been out alone with him
When we got to Canterbury it was much smaller than we expected and the cathedral not much bigger than the Church that is next to the Moat House
There seemed to be only one big street but we supposed the rest of the city was hidden away somewhere
There was a large inn with a green before it and the redwheeled dogcart was standing in the stableyard and the lady with Denny and the others sitting on the benches in the porch looking out for us
The inn was called the George and Dragon and it made me think of the days when there were coaches and highwaymen and footpads and jolly landlords and adventures at country inns like you read about
Weve ordered tea said the lady
Would you like to wash your hands
We saw that she wished us to so we said yes we would
The girls and Denny were already much cleaner than when we parted from them
There was a courtyard to the inn and a wooden staircase outside the house
We were taken up this and washed our hands in a big room with a fourpost wooden bed and dark red hangingsjust the sort of hangings that would not show the stains of gore in the dear old adventurous times
Then we had tea in a great big room with wooden chairs and tables very polished and old
It was a very nice tea with lettuces and cold meat and three kinds of jam as well as cake and new bread which we are not allowed at home
While tea was being had the lady talked to us
She was very kind
There are two sorts of people in the world besides others one sort understand what youre driving at and the other dont
This lady was the one sort
After everyone had had as much to eat as they could possibly want the lady said What was it you particularly wanted to see at Canterbury
The cathedral Alice said and the place where Thomas A Becket was murdered
And the Danejohn said Dicky
Oswald wanted to see the walls because he likes the Story of St Alphege and the Danes
Well well said the lady and she put on her hat it was a really sensible onenot a blob of fluffy stuff and feathers put on sideways and stuck on with long pins and no shade to your face but almost as big as ours with a big brim and red flowers and black strings to tie under your chin to keep it from blowing off
Then we went out all together to see Canterbury
Dicky and Oswald took it in turns to carry Denny on their backs
The lady called him The Wounded Comrade
We went first to the church
Oswald whose quick brain was easily aroused to suspicions was afraid the lady might begin talking in the church but she did not
The church door was open
I remember mother telling us once it was right and good for churches to be left open all day so that tired people could go in and be quiet and say their prayers if they wanted to
But it does not seem respectful to talk out loud in church
See Note A
When we got outside the lady said You can imagine how on the chancel steps began the mad struggle in which Becket after hurling one of his assailants armour and all to the ground It would have been much cleverer H O interrupted to hurl him without his armour and leave that standing up
Go on said Alice and Oswald when they had given H O a withering glance
And the lady did go on
She told us all about Becket and then about St Alphege who had bones thrown at him till he died because he wouldnt tax his poor people to please the beastly rotten Danes
And Denny recited a piece of poetry he knows called The Ballad of Canterbury
It begins about Danish warships snakeshaped and ends about doing as youd be done by
It is long but it has all the beefbones in it and all about St Alphege
Then the lady showed us the Danejohn and it was like an oasthouse
And Canterbury walls that Alphege defied the Danes from looked down on a quite common farmyard
The hospital was like a barn and other things were like other things but we went all about and enjoyed it very much
The lady was quite amusing besides sometimes talking like a real cathedral guide I met afterwards
See Note B
When at last we said we thought Canterbury was very small considering the lady said Well it seemed a pity to come so far and not at least hear something about Canterbury
And then at once we knew the worst and Alice said What a horrid sell
But Oswald with immediate courteousness said I dont care
You did it awfully well
And he did not say though he owns he thought of it I knew it all the time though it was a great temptation
Because really it was more than half true
He had felt from the first that this was too small for Canterbury
See Note C The real name of the place was Hazelbridge and not Canterbury at all
We went to Canterbury another time
See Note D We were not angry with the lady for selling us about it being Canterbury because she had really kept it up firstrate
And she asked us if we minded very handsomely and we said we liked it
But now we did not care how soon we got home
The lady saw this and said Come our chariots are ready and our horses caparisoned
That is a firstrate word out of a book
It cheered Oswald up and he liked her for using it though he wondered why she said chariots
When we got back to the inn I saw her dogcart was there and a grocers cart too with B Munn grocer Hazelbridge on it
She took the girls in her cart and the boys went with the grocer
His horse was a very good one to go only you had to hit it with the wrong end of the whip
But the cart was very bumpety
The evening dews were fallingat least I suppose so but you do not feel dew in a grocers cartwhen we reached home
We all thanked the lady very much and said we hoped we should see her again some day
She said she hoped so
The grocer drove off and when we had all shaken hands with the lady and kissed her according as we were boys or girls or little boys she touched up her horse and drove away
She turned at the corner to wave to us and just as we had done waving and were turning into the house Alberts uncle came into our midst like a whirling wind
He was in flannels and his shirt had no stud in at the neck and his hair was all rumpled up and his hands were inky and we knew he had left off in the middle of a chapter by the wildness of his eye
Who was that lady
he said
Where did you meet her
Mindful as ever of what he was told Oswald began to tell the story from the beginning
The other day protector of the poor he began Dora and I were reading about the Canterbury pilgrims  Oswald thought Alberts uncle would be pleased to find his instructions about beginning at the beginning had borne fruit but instead he interrupted
Stow it you young duffer
Where did you meet her
Oswald answered briefly in wounded accents Hazelbridge
Then Alberts uncle rushed upstairs three at a time and as he went he called out to Oswald Get out my bike old man and blow up the back tyre
I am sure Oswald was as quick as anyone could have been but long ere the tyre was thoroughly blowed Alberts uncle appeared with a collarstud and tie and blazer and his hair tidy and wrenching the unoffending machine from Oswalds surprised fingers
Alberts uncle finished pumping up the tyre and then flinging himself into the saddle he set off scorching down the road at a pace not surpassed by any highwayman however black and highmettled his steed
We were left looking at each other
He must have recognized her Dicky said
Perhaps Noel said she is the old nurse who alone knows the dark secret of his highborn birth
Not old enough by chalks Oswald said
I shouldnt wonder said Alice if she holds the secret of the will that will make him rolling in longlost wealth
I wonder if hell catch her Noel said
Im quite certain all his future depends on it
Perhaps shes his longlost sister and the estate was left to them equally only she couldnt be found so it couldnt be shared up
Perhaps hes only in love with her Dora said parted by cruel Fate at an early age he has ranged the wide world ever since trying to find her
I hope to goodness he hasntanyway hes not ranged since we knew himnever further than Hastings Oswald said
We dont want any of that rot
What rot
Daisy asked
And Oswald said Getting married and all that sort of rubbish
And Daisy and Dora were the only ones that didnt agree with him
Even Alice owned that being bridesmaids must be fairly good fun
Its no good
You may treat girls as well as you like and give them every comfort and luxury and play fair just as if they were boys but there is something unmanly about the best of girls
They go silly like milk goes sour without any warning
When Alberts uncle returned he was very hot with a beaded brow but pale as the Dentist when the peas were at their worst
Did you catch her
H O asked
Alberts uncles brow looked black as the cloud that thunder will presently break from
Nohe said
Is she your longlost nurse
H O went on before we could stop him
Longlost grandmother
I knew the lady long ago in India said Alberts uncle as he left the room slamming the door in a way we should be forbidden to
And that was the end of the Canterbury Pilgrimage
As for the lady we did not then know whether she was his longlost grandmother that he had known in India or not though we thought she seemed youngish for the part
We found out afterwards whether she was or not but that comes in another part
His manner was not the one that makes you go on asking questions
The Canterbury Pilgriming did not exactly make us good but then as Dora said we had not done anything wrong that day
So we were twentyfour hours to the good
Note AAfterwards we went and saw real Canterbury
It is very large
A disagreeable man showed us round the cathedral and jawed all the time quite loud as if it wasnt a church
I remember one thing he said
It was this This is the Deans Chapel it was the Lady Chapel in the wicked days when people used to worship the Virgin Mary
And H O said I suppose they worship the Dean now
Some strange people who were there laughed out loud
I think this is worse in church than not taking your cap off when you come in as H O forgot to do because the cathedral was so big he didnt think it was a church

This ends the Canterbury Pilgrims
CHAPTER 13 THE DRAGONS TEETH OR ARMYSEED Alberts uncle was out on his bicycle as usual
After the day when we became Canterbury Pilgrims and were brought home in the dogcart with red wheels by the lady he told us was his longlost grandmother he had known years ago in India he spent not nearly so much of his time in writing and he used to shave every morning instead of only when requisite as in earlier days
And he was always going out on his bicycle in his new Norfolk suit
We are not so unobserving as grownup people make out
We knew well enough he was looking for the longlost
And we jolly well wished he might find her
Oswald always full of sympathy with misfortune however undeserved had himself tried several times to find the lady
So had the others
But all this is what they call a digression it has nothing to do with the dragons teeth I am now narrating
It began with the pig dyingit was the one we had for the circus but it having behaved so badly that day had nothing to do with its illness and death though the girls said they felt remorse and perhaps if we hadnt made it run so that day it might have been spared to us
But Oswald cannot pretend that people were right just because they happen to be dead and as long as that pig was alive we all knew well enough that it was it that made us runand not us it
The pig was buried in the kitchen garden
Bill that we made the tombstone for dug the grave and while he was away at his dinner we took a turn at digging because we like to be useful and besides when you dig you never know what you may turn up
I knew a man once that found a gold ring on the point of his fork when he was digging potatoes and you know how we found two halfcrowns ourselves once when we were digging for treasure
Oswald was taking his turn with the spade and the others were sitting on the gravel and telling him how to do it
Work with a will Dicky said yawning
Alice said I wish we were in a book
People in books never dig without finding something
I think Id rather it was a secret passage than anything
Oswald stopped to wipe his honest brow ere replying
A secrets nothing when youve found it out
Look at the secret staircase
Its no good not even for hideandseek because of its squeaking
Id rather have the pot of gold we used to dig for when we were little
It was really only last year but you seem to grow old very quickly after you have once passed the prime of your youth which is at ten I believe
How would you like to find the mouldering bones of Royalist soldiers foully done to death by nasty Ironsides
Noel asked with his mouth full of plum
If they were really dead it wouldnt matter Dora said
What Im afraid of is a skeleton that can walk about and catch at your legs when youre going upstairs to bed
Skeletons cant walk Alice said in a hurry you know they cant Dora
And she glared at Dora till she made her sorry she had said what she had
The things you are frightened of or even those you would rather not meet in the dark should never be mentioned before the little ones or else they cry when it comes to bedtime and say it was because of what you said
We shant find anything
No jolly fear said Dicky
And just then my spade I was digging with struck on something hard and it felt hollow
I did really think for one joyful space that we had found that pot of gold
But the thing whatever it was seemed to be longish longer that is than a pot of gold would naturally be
And as I uncovered it I saw that it was not at all potofgoldcolour but like a bone Pincher has buried
So Oswald said It IS the skeleton
The girls all drew back and Alice said Oswald I wish you wouldnt
A moment later the discovery was unearthed and Oswald lifted it up with both hands
Its a dragons head Noel said and it certainly looked like it
It was long and narrowish and bony and with great yellow teeth sticking in the jaw
Bill came back just then and said it was a horses head but H O and Noel would not believe it and Oswald owns that no horse he has ever seen had a head at all that shape
But Oswald did not stop to argue because he saw a keeper who showed me how to set snares going by and he wanted to talk to him about ferrets so he went off and Dicky and Denny and Alice with him
Also Daisy and Dora went off to finish reading Ministering Children
So H O and Noel were left with the bony head
They took it away
The incident had quite faded from the mind of Oswald next day
But just before breakfast Noel and H O came in looking hot and anxious
They had got up early and had not washed at allnot even their hands and faces
Noel made Oswald a secret signal
All the others saw it and with proper delicate feeling pretended not to have
When Oswald had gone out with Noel and H O in obedience to the secret signal Noel said You know that dragons head yesterday
Well
Oswald said quickly but not crosslythe two things are quite different
Well you know what happened in Greek history when some chap sowed dragons teeth
They came up armed men said H O but Noel sternly bade him shut up and Oswald said Well again
If he spoke impatiently it was because he smelt the bacon being taken in to breakfast
Well Noel went on what do you suppose would have come up if wed sowed those dragons teeth we found yesterday
Why nothing you young duffer said Oswald who could now smell the coffee
All that isnt History its Humbug
Come on in to brekker
Its NOT humbug H O cried it is history
We DID sow Shut up said Noel again
Look here Oswald
We did sow those dragons teeth in Randalls tenacre meadow and what do you think has come up
Toadstools I should think was Oswalds contemptible rejoinder
They have come up a camp of soldiers said NoelARMED MEN
So you see it WAS history
We have sowed armyseed just like Cadmus and it has come up
It was a very wet night
I daresay that helped it along
Oswald could not decide which to disbelievehis brother or his ears
So disguising his doubtful emotions without a word he led the way to the bacon and the banqueting hall
He said nothing about the armyseed then neither did Noel and H O
But after the bacon we went into the garden and then the good elder brother said Why dont you tell the others your cockandbull story
So they did and their story was received with warm expressions of doubt
It was Dicky who observed Lets go and have a squint at Randalls tenacre anyhow
I saw a hare there the other day
We went
It is some little way and as we went disbelief reigned superb in every breast except Noels and H
O
s so you will see that even the ready pen of the present author cannot be expected to describe to you his variable sensations when he got to the top of the hill and suddenly saw that his little brothers had spoken the truth
I do not mean that they generally tell lies but people make mistakes sometimes and the effect is the same as lies if you believe them
There WAS a camp there with real tents and soldiers in grey and red tunics
I daresay the girls would have said coats
We stood in ambush too astonished even to think of lying in it though of course we know that this is customary
The ambush was the wood on top of the little hill between Randalls tenacre meadow and Sugdens Waste Wake pasture
There would be cover here for a couple of regiments whispered Oswald who was I think gifted by Fate with the farseeingness of a born general
Alice merely said Hist and we went down to mingle with the troops as though by accident and seek for information
The first man we came to at the edge of the camp was cleaning a sort of cauldron thing like witches brew bats in
We went up to him and said Who are you
Are you English or are you the enemy
Were the enemy he said and he did not seem ashamed of being what he was
And he spoke English with quite a good accent for a foreigner
The enemy
Oswald echoed in shocked tones
It is a terrible thing to a loyal and patriotic youth to see an enemy cleaning a pot in an English field with English sand and looking as much at home as if he was in his foreign fastnesses
The enemy seemed to read Oswalds thoughts with deadly unerringness
He said The English are somewhere over on the other side of the hill
They are trying to keep us out of Maidstone
After this our plan of mingling with the troops did not seem worth going on with
This soldier in spite of his unerringness in reading Oswalds innermost heart seemed not so very sharp in other things or he would never have given away his secret plans like this for he must have known from our accents that we were Britons to the backbone
Or perhaps Oswald thought this and it made his blood at once boil and freeze which our uncle had told us was possible but only in India perhaps he thought that Maidstone was already as good as taken and it didnt matter what he said
While Oswald was debating within his intellect what to say next and how to say it so as to discover as many as possible of the enemys dark secrets Noel said How did you get here
You werent here yesterday at teatime
The soldier gave the pot another sandy rub and said I daresay it does seem quick workthe camp seems as if it had sprung up in the night doesnt itlike a mushroom
Alice and Oswald looked at each other and then at the rest of us
The words sprung up in the night seemed to touch a string in every heart
You see whispered Noel he wont tell us how he came here
NOW is it humbug or history
Oswald after whisperedly requesting his young brother to dry up and not bother remarked Then youre an invading army
Well said the soldier were a skeleton battalion as a matter of fact but were invading all right enough
And now indeed the blood of the stupidest of us froze just as the quickwitted Oswalds had done earlier in the interview
Even H O opened his mouth and went the colour of mottled soap he is so fat that this is the nearest he can go to turning pale
Denny said But you dont look like skeletons
The soldier stared then he laughed and said Ah thats the padding in our tunics
You should see us in the grey dawn taking our morning bath in a bucket
It was a dreadful picture for the imagination
A skeleton with its bones all loose most likely bathing anyhow in a pail
There was a silence while we thought it over
Now ever since the cleaningcauldron soldier had said that about taking Maidstone Alice had kept on pulling at Oswalds jacket behind and he had kept on not taking any notice
But now he could not stand it any longer so he said Well what is it
Alice drew him aside or rather she pulled at his jacket so that he nearly fell over backwards and then she whispered Come along dont stay parlaying with the foe
Hes only talking to you to gain time
What for
said Oswald
Why so that we shouldnt warn the other army you silly Alice said and Oswald was so upset by what she said that he forgot to be properly angry with her for the wrong word she used
But we ought to warn them at home she said suppose the Moat House was burned down and all the supplies commandeered for the foe
Alice turned boldly to the soldier
DO you burn down farms
she asked
Well not as a rule he said and he had the cheek to wink at Oswald but Oswald would not look at him
Weve not burned a farm sinceoh not for years
A farm in Greek history it was I expect Denny murmured
Civilized warriors do not burn farms nowadays Alice said sternly whatever they did in Greek times
You ought to know that
The soldier said things had changed a good deal since Greek times
So we said good morning as quickly as we could it is proper to be polite even to your enemy except just at the moments when it has really come to rifles and bayonets or other weapons
The soldier said So long
in quite a modern voice and we retraced our footsteps in silence to the ambushI mean the wood
Oswald did think of lying in the ambush then but it was rather wet because of the rain the night before that H O said had brought the armyseed up
And Alice walked very fast saying nothing but Hurry up cant you
and dragging H O by one hand and Noel by the other
So we got into the road
Then Alice faced round and said This is all our fault
If we hadnt sowed those dragons teeth there wouldnt have been any invading army
I am sorry to say Daisy said Never mind Alice dear
WE didnt sow the nasty things did we Dora
But Denny told her it was just the same
It was WE had done it so long as it was any of us especially if it got any of us into trouble
Oswald was very pleased to see that the Dentist was beginning to understand the meaning of true manliness and about the honour of the house of Bastable though of course he is only a Foulkes
Yet it is something to know he does his best to learn
If you are very grownup or very clever I daresay you will now have thought of a great many things
If you have you need not say anything especially if youre reading this aloud to anybody
Its no good putting in what you think in this part because none of us thought anything of the kind at the time
We simply stood in the road without any of your clever thoughts filled with shame and distress to think of what might happen owing to the dragons teeth being sown
It was a lesson to us never to sow seed without being quite sure what sort it is
This is particularly true of the penny packets which sometimes do not come up at all quite unlike dragons teeth
Of course H O and Noel were more unhappy than the rest of us
This was only fair
How can we possibly prevent their getting to Maidstone
Dickie said
Did you notice the red cuffs on their uniforms
Taken from the bodies of dead English soldiers I shouldnt wonder
If theyre the old Greek kind of dragonsteeth soldiers they ought to fight each other to death Noel said at least if we had a helmet to throw among them
But none of us had and it was decided that it would be of no use for H O to go back and throw his straw hat at them though he wanted to
Denny said suddenly Couldnt we alter the signposts so that they wouldnt know the way to Maidstone
Oswald saw that this was the time for true generalship to be shown
He said Fetch all the tools out of your chestDicky go too theres a good chap and dont let him cut his legs with the saw
He did once tumbling over it
Meet us at the crossroads you know where we had the Benevolent Bar
Courage and dispatch and look sharp about it
When they had gone we hastened to the crossroads and there a great idea occurred to Oswald
He used the forces at his command so ably that in a very short time the board in the field which says No thoroughfare
Trespassers will be prosecuted was set up in the middle of the road to Maidstone
We put stones from a heap by the road behind it to make it stand up
Then Dicky and Denny came back and Dicky shinned up the signpost and sawed off the two arms and we nailed them up wrong so that it said To Maidstone on the Dover Road and To Dover on the road to Maidstone
We decided to leave the Trespassers board on the real Maidstone road as an extra guard
Then we settled to start at once to warn Maidstone
Some of us did not want the girls to go but it would have been unkind to say so
However there was at least one breast that felt a pang of joy when Dora and Daisy gave out that they would rather stay where they were and tell anybody who came by which was the real road
Because it would be so dreadful if someone was going to buy pigs or fetch a doctor or anything in a hurry and then found they had got to Dover instead of where they wanted to go to Dora said
But when it came to dinnertime they went home so that they were entirely out of it
This often happens to them by some strange fatalism
We left Martha to take care of the two girls and Lady and Pincher went with us
It was getting late in the day but I am bound to remember no one said anything about their dinners whatever they may have thought
We cannot always help our thoughts
We happened to know it was roast rabbits and currant jelly that day
We walked two and two and sang the British Grenadiers and Soldiers of the queen so as to be as much part of the British Army as possible
The CauldronMan had said the English were the other side of the hill
But we could not see any scarlet anywhere though we looked for it as carefully as if we had been fierce bulls
But suddenly we went round a turn in the road and came plump into a lot of soldiers
Only they were not redcoats
They were dressed in grey and silver
And it was a sort of furzycommon place and three roads branching out
The men were lying about with some of their belts undone smoking pipes and cigarettes
Its not British soldiers Alice said
Oh dear oh dear Im afraid its more enemy
You didnt sow the armyseed anywhere else did you H O
dear
H O was positive he hadnt
But perhaps lots more came up where we did sow them he said theyre all over England by now very likely
I dont know how many men can grow out of one dragons tooth
Then Noel said It was my doing anyhow and Im not afraid and he walked straight up to the nearest soldier who was cleaning his pipe with a piece of grass and said Please are you the enemy
The man said No young CommanderinChief were the English
Then Oswald took command
Where is the General
he said
Were out of generals just now FieldMarshal the man said and his voice was a gentlemans voice
Not a single one in stock
We might suit you in majors now and captains are quite cheap
Competent corporals going for a song
And we have a very nice colonel too quiet to ride or drive
Oswald does not mind chaff at proper times
But this was not one
You seem to be taking it very easy he said with disdainful expression
This IS an easy said the grey soldier sucking at his pipe to see if it would draw
I suppose YOU dont care if the enemy gets into Maidstone or not
exclaimed Oswald bitterly
If I were a soldier Id rather die than be beaten
The soldier saluted
Good old patriotic sentiment he said smiling at the heartfelt boy
But Oswald could bear no more
Which is the Colonel
he asked
Over therenear the grey horse
The one lighting a cigarette
H O asked
Yesbut I say kiddie he wont stand any jaw
Theres not an ounce of vice about him but hes peppery
He might kick out
Youd better bunk
Better what
asked H O
Bunk bottle scoot skip vanish exit said the soldier
Thats what youd do when the fighting begins said H O
He is often rude like thatbut it was what we all thought all the same
The soldier only laughed
A spirited but hasty altercation among ourselves in whispers ended in our allowing Alice to be the one to speak to the Colonel
It was she who wanted to
However peppery he is he wont kick a girl she said and perhaps this was true
But of course we all went with her
So there were six of us to stand in front of the Colonel
And as we went along we agreed that we would salute him on the word three
So when we got near Dick said One two three and we all saluted very wellexcept H O who chose that minute to trip over a rifle a soldier had left lying about and was only saved from falling by a man in a cocked hat who caught him deftly by the back of his jacket and stood him on his legs
Let go cant you said H O
Are you the General
Before the Cocked Hat had time to frame a reply Alice spoke to the Colonel
I knew what she meant to say because she had told me as we threaded our way among the resting soldiery
What she really said was Oh how CAN you
How can I WHAT
said the Colonel rather crossly
Why SMOKE
said Alice
My good children if youre an infant Band of Hope let me recommend you to play in some other backyard said the CockHatted Man
H O said Band of Hope yourselfbut no one noticed it
Were NOT a Band of Hope said Noel
Were British and the man over there told us you are
And Maidstones in danger and the enemy not a mile off and you stand SMOKING
Noel was standing crying himself or something very like it
Its quite true Alice said
The Colonel said Fiddlededee
But the CockedHatted Man said What was the enemy like
We told him exactly
And even the Colonel then owned there might be something in it
Can you show me the place where they are on the map
he asked
Not on the map we cant said Dickyat least I dont think so but on the ground we could
We could take you there in a quarter of an hour
The CockedHatted One looked at the Colonel who returned his scrutiny then he shrugged his shoulders
Well weve got to do something he said as if to himself
Lead on Macduff
The Colonel roused his soldiery from their stupor of pipes by words of command which the present author is sorry he cant remember
Then he bade us boys lead the way
I tell you it felt fine marching at the head of a regiment
Alice got a lift on the CockedHatted Ones horse
It was a redroan steed of might exactly as if it had been in a ballad
They call a greyroan a blue in South Africa the CockedHatted One said
We led the British Army by unfrequented lanes till we got to the gate of Sugdens Waste Wake pasture
Then the Colonel called a whispered halt and choosing two of us to guide him the dauntless and discerning commander went on on foot with an orderly
He chose Dicky and Oswald as guides
So we led him to the ambush and we went through it as quietly as we could
But twigs do crackle and snap so when you are reconnoitring or anxious to escape detection for whatever reason
Our Colonels orderly crackled most
If youre not near enough to tell a colonel by the crown and stars on his shoulderstrap you can tell him by the orderly behind him like follow my leader
Look out
said Oswald in a low but commanding whisper the camps down in that field
You can see if you take a squint through this gap
The speaker took a squint himself as he spoke and drew back baffled beyond the power of speech
While he was struggling with his baffledness the British Colonel had his squint
He also drew back and said a word that he must have known was not rightat least when he was a boy
I dont care said Oswald they were there this morning
White tents like mushrooms and an enemy cleaning a cauldron
With sand said Dicky
Thats most convincing said the Colonel and I did not like the way he said it
I say Oswald said lets get to the top corner of the ambushthe wood I mean
You can see the crossroads from there
We did and quickly for the crackling of branches no longer dismayed our almost despairing spirits
We came to the edge of the wood and Oswalds patriotic heart really did give a jump and he cried There they are on the Dover Road
Our miscellaneous signboard had done its work
By Jove young un youre right
And in quarter column too
Weve got em on toaston toastegad
I never heard anyone not in a book say egad before so I saw something really out of the way was indeed up
The Colonel was a man of prompt and decisive action
He sent the orderly to tell the Major to advance two companies on the left flank and take cover
Then we led him back through the wood the nearest way because he said he must rejoin the main body at once
We found the main body very friendly with Noel and H O and the others and Alice was talking to the CockedHatted One as if she had known him all her life
I think hes a general in disguise Noel said
Hes been giving us chocolate out of a pocket in his saddle
Oswald thought about the roast rabbit thenand he is not ashamed to own ityet he did not say a word
But Alice is really not a bad sort
She had saved two bars of chocolate for him and Dicky
Even in war girls can sometimes be useful in their humble way
The Colonel fussed about and said Take cover there
and everybody hid in the ditch and the horses and the Cocked Hat with Alice retreated down the road out of sight
We were in the ditch too
It was muddybut nobody thought of their boots in that perilous moment
It seemed a long time we were crouching there
Oswald began to feel the water squelching in his boots so we held our breath and listened
Oswald laid his ear to the road like a Red Indian
You would not do this in time of peace but when your country is in danger you care but little about keeping your ears clean
His backwoods strategy was successful
He rose and dusted himself and said Theyre coming
It was true
The footsteps of the approaching foe were now to be heard quite audibly even by ears in their natural position
The wicked enemy approached
They were marching with a careless swaggeringness that showed how little they suspected the horrible doom which was about to teach them Englands might and supremeness
Just as the enemy turned the corner so that we could see them the Colonel shouted Right section fire
and there was a deafening banging
The enemys officer said something and then the enemy got confused and tried to get into the fields through the hedges
But all was vain
There was firing now from our men on the left as well as the right
And then our Colonel strode nobly up to the enemys Colonel and demanded surrender
He told me so afterwards
His exact words are only known to himself and the other Colonel
But the enemys Colonel said I would rather die than surrender or words to that effect
Our Colonel returned to his men and gave the order to fix bayonets and even Oswald felt his manly cheek turn pale at the thought of the amount of blood to be shed
What would have happened can never now be revealed
For at this moment a man on a piebald horse came clattering over a hedgeas carelessly as if the air was not full of lead and steel at all
Another man rode behind him with a lance and a red pennon on it
I think he must have been the enemys General coming to tell his men not to throw away their lives on a forlorn hope for directly he said they were captured the enemy gave in and owned that they were
The enemys Colonel saluted and ordered his men to form quarter column again
I should have thought he would have had about enough of that myself
He had now given up all thought of sullen resistance to the bitter end
He rolled a cigarette for himself and had the foreign cheek to say to our Colonel By Jove old man you got me clean that time
Your scouts seem to have marked us down uncommonly neatly
It was a proud moment when our Colonel laid his military hand on Oswalds shoulder and said This is my chief scout which were high words but not undeserved and Oswald owns he felt red with gratifying pride when he heard them
So you are the traitor young man said the wicked Colonel going on with his cheek
Oswald bore it because our Colonel had and you should be generous to a fallen foe but it is hard to be called a traitor when you havent
He did not treat the wicked Colonel with silent scorn as he might have done but he said We arent traitors
We are the Bastables and one of us is a Foulkes
We only mingled unsuspected with the enemys soldiery and learned the secrets of their acts which is what BadenPowell always does when the natives rebel in South Africa and Denis Foulkes thought of altering the signposts to lead the foe astray
And if we did cause all this fighting and get Maidstone threatened with capture and all that it was only because we didnt believe Greek things could happen in Great Britain and Ireland even if you sow dragons teeth and besides some of us were not as e a out sowing them
Then the CockedHatted One led his horse and walked with us and made us tell him all about it and so did the Colonel
The wicked Colonel listened too which was only another proof of his cheek
And Oswald told the tale in the modest yet manly way that some people think he has and gave the others all the credit they deserved
His narration was interrupted no less than four times by shouts of Bravo
in which the enemys Colonel once more showed his cheek by joining
By the time the story was told we were in sight of another camp
It was the British one this time
The Colonel asked us to have tea in his tent and it only shows the magnanimosity of English chivalry in the field of battle that he asked the enemys Colonel too
With his usual cheek he accepted
We were jolly hungry
When everyone had had as much tea as they possibly could the Colonel shook hands with us all and to Oswald he said Well goodbye my brave scout
I must mention your name in my dispatches to the War Office
H O interrupted him to say His names Oswald Cecil Bastable and mine is Horace Octavius
I wish H O would learn to hold his tongue
No one ever knows Oswald was christened Cecil as well if he can possibly help it
YOU didnt know it till now
Mr Oswald Bastable the Colonel went onhe had the decency not to take any notice of the Cecil you would be a credit to any regiment
No doubt the War Office will reward you properly for what you have done for your country
But meantime perhaps youll accept five shillings from a grateful comradeinarms
Oswald felt heartfelt sorry to wound the good Colonels feelings but he had to remark that he had only done his duty and he was sure no British scout would take five bob for doing that
And besides he said with that feeling of justice which is part of his young character it was the others just as much as me
Your sentiments Sir said the Colonel who was one of the politest and most discerning colonels I ever saw your sentiments do you honour
But Bastables all andand nonBastables he couldnt remember Foulkes its not such an interesting name as Bastable of course at least youll accept a soldiers pay
Lucky to touch it a shilling a day
Alice and Denny said together
And the CockedHatted Man said something about knowing your own mind and knowing your own Kipling
A soldier said the Colonel would certainly be lucky to touch it
You see there are deductions for rations
Five shillings is exactly right deducting twopence each for six teas
This seemed cheap for the three cups of tea and the three eggs and all the strawberry jam and breadandbutter Oswald had had as well as what the others ate and Ladys and Pinchers teas but I suppose soldiers get things cheaper than civilians which is only right
Oswald took the five shillings then there being no longer any scruples why he should not
Just as we had parted from the brave Colonel and the rest we saw a bicycle coming
It was Alberts uncle
He got off and said What on earth have you been up to
What were you doing with those volunteers
We told him the wild adventures of the day and he listened and then he said he would withdraw the word volunteers if we liked
But the seeds of doubt were sown in the breast of Oswald
He was now almost sure that we had made jolly fools of ourselves without a moments pause throughout the whole of this eventful day
He said nothing at the time but after supper he had it out with Alberts uncle about the word which had been withdrawn
Alberts uncle said of course no one could be sure that the dragons teeth hadnt come up in the good oldfashioned way but that on the other hand it was barely possible that both the British and the enemy were only volunteers having a fieldday or sham fight and he rather thought the CockedHatted Man was not a general but a doctor
And the man with a red pennon carried behind him MIGHT have been the umpire
Oswald never told the others a word of this
Their young breasts were all panting with joy because they had saved their country and it would have been but heartless unkindness to show them how silly they had been
Besides Oswald felt he was much too old to have been so taken inif he HAD been
Besides Alberts uncle did say that no one could be sure about the dragons teeth
The thing that makes Oswald feel most that perhaps the whole thing was a beastly sell was that we didnt see any wounded
But he tries not to think of this
And if he goes into the army when he grows up he will not go quite green
He has had experience of the arts of war and the tented field
And a real colonel has called him ComradeinArms which is exactly what Lord Roberts called his own soldiers when he wrote home about them
CHAPTER 14 ALBERTS UNCLEs GRANDMOTHER OR THE LONGLOST The shadw of the termination now descended in sable thunderclouds upon our devoted nobs
As Alberts uncle said School now gaped for its prey
In a very short space of time we should be wending our way back to Blackheath and all the variegated delightfulness of the country would soon be only preserved in memorys faded flowers
I dont care for that way of writing very much
It would be an awful swot to keep it uplooking out the words and all that
To speak in the language of everyday life our holiday was jolly nearly up
We had had a ripping time but it was all but over
We really did feel sorry though of course it was rather decent to think of getting back to Father and being able to tell the other chaps about our raft and the dam and the Tower of Mystery and things like that
When but a brief time was left to us Oswald and Dicky met by chance in an appletree
That sounds like consequences but it is mere truthfulness
Dicky said Only four more days
Oswald said Yes
Theres one thing Dickie said that beastly society
We dont want that swarming all over everything when we get home
We ought to dissolve it before we leave here
The following dialogue now took place OswaldRight you are
I always said it was piffling rot
DickySo did I
OswaldLets call a council
But dont forget weve jolly well got to put our foot down
Dicky assented and the dialogue concluded with apples
The council when called was in but low spirits
This made Oswalds and Dickys task easier
When people are sunk in gloomy despair about one thing they will agree to almost anything about something else
Remarks like this are called philosophic generalizations Alberts uncle says
Oswald began by saying Weve tried the society for being good in and perhaps its done us good
But now the time has come for each of us to be good or bad on his own without hanging on to the others
The race is run by one and one But never by two and two the Dentist said
The others said nothing
Oswald went on I move that we chuckI mean dissolve the Wouldbegoods Society its appointed task is done
If its not well done thats ITS fault and not ours
Dicky said Hear
hear
I second this prop
The unexpected Dentist said I third it
At first I thought it would help but afterwards I saw it only made you want to be naughty just because you were a Wouldbegood
Oswald owns he was surprised
We put it to the vote at once so as not to let Denny cool
H O and Noel and Alice voted with us so Daisy and Dora were what is called a hopeless minority
We tried to cheer their hopelessness by letting them read the things out of the Golden Deed book aloud
Noel hid his face in the straw so that we should not see the faces he made while he made poetry instead of listening and when the Wouldbegoods was by vote dissolved for ever he sat up straws in his hair and said THE EPITAPH The Wouldbegoods are dead and gone But not the golden deeds they have done These will remain upon Glorys page To be an example to every age And by this we have got to know How to be good upon our owN N is for Noel that makes the rhyme and the sense both right
O W N own do you see
We saw it and said so and the gentle poet was satisfied
And the council broke up
Oswald felt that a weight had been lifted from his expanding chest and it is curious that he never felt so inclined to be good and a model youth as he did then
As he went down the ladder out of the loft he said Theres one thing we ought to do though before we go home
We ought to find Alberts uncles long lost grandmother for him
Alices heart beat true and steadfast
She said Thats just exactly what Noel and I were saying this morning
Look out Oswald you wretch youre kicking chaff into my eyes
She was going down the ladder just under me
Oswalds younger sisters thoughtful remark ended in another council
But not in the straw loft
We decided to have a quite new place and disregarded H
O
s idea of the dairy and Noels of the cellars
We had the new council on the secret staircase and there we settled exactly what we ought to do
This is the same thing if you really wish to be good as what you are going to do
It was a very interesting council and when it was over Oswald was so pleased to think that the Wouldbegoods was unrecoverishly dead that he gave Denny and Noel who were sitting on the step below him a goodhumoured playful gentle loving brotherly shove and said Get along down its teatime
No reader who understands justice and the real rightness of things and who is to blame for what will ever think it could have been Oswalds fault that the two other boys got along down by rolling over and over each other and bursting the door at the bottom of the stairs open by their revolving bodies
And I should like to know whose fault it was that Mrs Pettigrew was just on the other side of that door at that very minute
The door burst open and the Impetuous bodies of Noel and Denny rolled out of it into Mrs Pettigrew and upset her and the teatray
Both revolving boys were soaked with tea and milk and there were one or two cups and things smashed
Mrs Pettigrew was knocked over but none of her bones were broken
Noel and Denny were going to be sent to bed but Oswald said it was all his fault
He really did this to give the others a chance of doing a refined golden deed by speaking the truth and saying it was not his fault
But you cannot really count on anyone
They did not say anything but only rubbed the lumps on their laterevolving heads
So it was bed for Oswald and he felt the injustice hard
But he sat up in bed and read The Last of the Mohicans and then he began to think
When Oswald really thinks he almost always thinks of something
He thought of something now and it was miles better than the idea we had decided on in the secret staircase of advertising in the Kentish Mercury and saying if Alberts uncles longlost grandmother would call at the Moat House she might hear of something much to her advantage
What Oswald thought of was that if we went to Hazelbridge and asked Mr B Munn Grocer that drove us home in the cart with the horse that liked the wrong end of the whip best he would know who the lady was in the red hat and red wheels that paid him to drive us home that Canterbury night
He must have been paid of course for even grocers are not generous enough to drive perfect strangers and five of them too about the country for nothing
Thus we may learn that even unjustness and sending the wrong people to bed may bear useful fruit which ought to be a great comfort to everyone when they are unfairly treated
Only it most likely wont be
For if Oswalds brothers and sisters had nobly stood by him as he expected he would not have had the solitary reflections that led to the great scheme for finding the grandmother
Of course when the others came up to roost they all came and squatted on Oswalds bed and said how sorry they were
He waived their apologies with noble dignity because there wasnt much time and said he had an idea that would knock the councils plan into a cocked hat
But he would not tell them what it was
He made them wait till next morning
This was not sulks but kind feeling
He wanted them to have something else to think of besides the way they hadnt stood by him in the bursting of the secret staircase door and the teatray and the milk
Next morning Oswald kindly explained and asked who would volunteer for a forced march to Hazelbridge
The word volunteer cost the young Oswald a pang as soon as he had said it but I hope he can bear pangs with any man living
And mind he added hiding the pang under a generallike severeness I wont have anyone in the expedition who has anything in his shoes except his feet
This could not have been put more delicately and decently
But Oswald is often misunderstood
Even Alice said it was unkind to throw the peas up at Denny
When this little unpleasantness had passed away it took some time because Daisy cried and Dora said There now Oswald
there were seven volunteers which with Oswald made eight and was indeed all of us
There were no cockleshells or tapesandals or staves or scrips or anything romantic and pious about the eight persons who set out for Hazelbridge that morning more earnestly wishful to be good and deedfulat least Oswald I know wasthan ever they had been in the days of the beastly Wouldbegood Society
It was a fine day
Either it was fine nearly all last summer which is how Oswald remembers it or else nearly all the interesting things we did came on fine days
With hearts light and gay and no peas in anyones shoes the walk to Hazelbridge was perseveringly conducted
We took our lunch with us and the dear dogs
Afterwards we wished for a time that we had left one of them at home
But they did so want to come all of them and Hazelbridge is not nearly as far as Canterbury really so even Martha was allowed to put on her thingsI mean her collarand come with us
She walks slowly but we had the day before us so there was no extra hurry
At Hazelbridge we went into B Munns grocers shop and asked for gingerbeer to drink
They gave it us but they seemed surprised at us wanting to drink it there and the glass was warmit had just been washed
We only did it really so as to get into conversation with B Munn grocer and extract information without rousing suspicion
You cannot be too careful
However when we had said it was firstclass ginger beer and paid for it we found it not so easy to extract anything more from B Munn grocer and there was an anxious silence while he fiddled about behind the counter among the tinned meats and sauce bottles with a fringe of hobnailed boots hanging over his head
H O spoke suddenly
He is like the sort of person who rushes in where angels fear to tread as Denny says say what sort of person that is
He said I say you remember driving us home that day
Who paid for the cart
Of course B Munn grocer was not such a nincompoop I like that word it means so many people I know as to say right off
He said I was paid all right young gentleman
Dont you terrify yourself
People in Kent say terrify when they mean worry
So Dora shoved in a gentle oar
She said We want to know the kind ladys name and address so that we can write and thank her for being so jolly that day
B Munn grocer muttered something about the ladys address being goods he was often asked for
Alice said But do tell us
We forgot to ask her
Shes a relation of a secondhand uncle of ours and I do so want to thank her properly
And if youve got any extrastrong peppermints at a penny an ounce we should like a quarter of a pound
This was a masterstroke
While he was weighing out the peppermints his heart got soft and just as he was twisting up the corner of the paper bag Dora said What lovely fat peppermints
Do tell us
And B Munns heart was now quite melted he said Its Miss Ashleigh and she lives at The Cedarsabout a mile down the Maidstone Road
We thanked him and Alice paid for the peppermints
Oswald was a little anxious when she ordered such a lot but she and Noel had got the money all right and when we were outside on Hazelbridge Green a good deal of it is gravel really we stood and looked at each other
Then Dora said Lets go home and write a beautiful letter and all sign it
Oswald looked at the others
Writing is all very well but its such a beastly long time to wait for anything to happen afterwards
The intelligent Alice divined his thoughts and the Dentist divined hershe is not clever enough yet to divine Oswaldsand the two said together Why not go and see her
She did say she would like to see us again some day Dora replied
So after we had argued a little about it we went
And before we had gone a hundred yards down the dusty road Martha began to make us wish with all our hearts we had not let her come
She began to limp just as a pilgrim who I will not name did when he had the split peas in his silly palmering shoes
So we called a halt and looked at her feet
One of them was quite swollen and red
Bulldogs almost always have something the matter with their feet and it always comes on when least required
They are not the right breed for emergencies
There was nothing for it but to take it in turns to carry her
She is very stout and you have no idea how heavy she is
A halfhearted unadventurous person name no names but Oswald Alice Noel H O Dicky Daisy and Denny will understand me said why not go straight home and come another day without Martha
But the rest agreed with Oswald when he said it was only a mile and perhaps we might get a lift home with the poor invalid
Martha was very grateful to us for our kindness
She put her fat white arms round the persons neck who happened to be carrying her
She is very affectionate but by holding her very close to you you can keep her from kissing your face all the time
As Alice said Bulldogs do give you such large wet pink kisses
A mile is a good way when you have to take your turn at carrying Martha
At last we came to a hedge with a ditch in front of it and chains swinging from posts to keep people off the grass and out of the ditch and a gate with The Cedars on it in gold letters
All very neat and tidy and showing plainly that more than one gardener was kept
There we stopped
Alice put Martha down grunting with exhaustedness and said Look here Dora and Daisy I dont believe a bit that its his grandmother
Im sure Dora was right and its only his horrid sweetheart
I feel it in my bones
Now dont you really think wed better chuck it were sure to catch it for interfering
We always do
The cross of true love never did come smooth said the Dentist
We ought to help him to bear his cross
But if we find her for him and shes not his grandmother hell MARRY her Dicky said in tones of gloominess and despair
Oswald felt the same but he said Never mind
We should all hate it but perhaps Alberts uncle MIGHT like it
You can never tell
If you want to do a really unselfish action and no kid nows your time my late Wouldbegoods
No one had the face to say right out that they didnt want to be unselfish
But it was with sad hearts that the unselfish seekers opened the long gate and went up the gravel drive between the rhododendrons and other shrubberies towards the house
I think I have explained to you before that the eldest son of anybody is called the representative of the family if his father isnt there
This was why Oswald now took the lead
When we got to the last turn of the drive it was settled that the others were to noiselessly ambush in the rhododendrons and Oswald was to go on alone and ask at the house for the grandmother from IndiaI mean Miss Ashleigh
So he did but when he got to the front of the house and saw how neat the flowerbeds were with red geraniums and the windows all bright and speckless with muslin blinds and brass rods and a green parrot in a cage in the porch and the doorstep newly whited lying clean and untrodden in the sunshine he stood still and thought of his boots and how dusty the roads were and wished he had not gone into the farmyard after eggs before starting that morning
As he stood there in anxious uncertainness he heard a low voice among the bushes
It said Hist
Oswald here
and it was the voice of Alice
So he went back to the others among the shrubs and they all crowded round their leader full of importable news
Shes not in the house shes HERE Alice said in a low whisper that seemed nearly all Ss
Close byshe went by just this minute with a gentleman
And theyre sitting on a seat under a tree on a little lawn and shes got her head on his shoulder and hes holding her hand
I never saw anyone look so silly in all my born Dicky said
Its sickening Denny said trying to look very manly with his legs wide apart
I dont know Oswald whispered
I suppose it wasnt Alberts uncle
Not much Dicky briefly replied
Then dont you see its all right
If shes going on like that with this fellow shell want to marry him and Alberts uncle is safe
And weve really done an unselfish action without having to suffer for it afterwards
With a stealthy movement Oswald rubbed his hands as he spoke in real joyfulness
We decided that we had better bunk unnoticed
But we had reckoned without Martha
She had strolled off limping to look about her a bit in the shrubbery
Wheres Martha
Dora suddenly said
She went that way pointingly remarked H O
Then fetch her back you young duffer
What did you let her go for
Oswald said
And look sharp
Dont make a row
He went
A minute later we heard a hoarse squeak from Marthathe one she always gives when suddenly collared from behindand a little squeal in a ladylike voice and a man say Hallo
and then we knew that H O had once more rushed in where angels might have thought twice about it
We hurried to the fatal spot but it was too late
We were just in time to hear H O say Im sorry if she frightened you
But weve been looking for you
Are you Alberts uncles longlost grandmother
NO said our lady unhesitatingly
It seemed vain to add seven more agitated actors to the scene now going on
We stood still
The man was standing up
He was a clergyman and I found out afterwards he was the nicest we ever knew except our own Mr Briston at Lewisham who is now a canon or a dean or something grand that no one ever sees
At present I did not like him
He said No this lady is nobodys grandmother
May I ask in return how long it is since you escaped from the lunatic asylum my poor child and whence your keeper is
H O took no notice of this at all except to say I think you are very rude and not at all funny if you think you are
The lady said My dear I remember you now perfectly
How are all the others and are you pilgrims again today
H O does not always answer questions
He turned to the man and said Are you going to marry the lady
Margaret said the clergyman I never thought it would come to this he asks me my intentions
If you ARE said H O its all right because if you do Alberts uncle cantat least not till youre dead
And we dont want him to
Flattering upon my word said the clergyman putting on a deep frown
Shall I call him out Margaret for his poor opinion of you or shall I send for the police
Alice now saw that H O though firm was getting muddled and rather scared
She broke cover and sprang into the middle of the scene
Dont let him rag H O any more she said its all our faults
You see Alberts uncle was so anxious to find you we thought perhaps you were his longlost heiress sister or his old nurse who alone knew the secret of his birth or something and we asked him and he said you were his longlost grandmother he had known in India
And we thought that must be a mistake and that really you were his longlost sweetheart
And we tried to do a really unselfish act and find you for him
Because we dont want him to be married at all
It isnt because we dont like YOU Oswald cut in now emerging from the bushes and if he must marry wed sooner it was you than anyone
Really we would
A generous concession Margaret the strange clergyman uttered most generous but the plot thickens
Its almost peasouplike now
One or two points clamour for explanation
Who are these visitors of yours
Why this Red Indian method of paying morning calls
Why the lurking attitude of the rest of the tribe which I now discern among the undergrowth
Wont you ask the rest of the tribe to come out and join the glad throng
Then I liked him better
I always like people who know the same songs we do and books and tunes and things
The others came out
The lady looked very uncomfy and partly as if she was going to cry
But she couldnt help laughing too as more and more of us came out
And who the clergyman went on who in fortunes name is Albert
And who is his uncle
And what have they or you to do in this galereI mean garden
We all felt rather silly and I dont think I ever felt more than then what an awful lot there were of us
Three years absence in Calcutta or elsewhere may explain my ignorance of these details but still I think wed better go said Dora
Im sorry if weve done anything rude or wrong
We didnt mean to
Goodbye
I hope youll be happy with the gentleman Im sure
I HOPE so too said Noel and I know he was thinking how much nicer Alberts uncle was
We turned to go
The lady had been very silent compared with what she was when she pretended to show us Canterbury
But now she seemed to shake off some dreamy silliness and caught hold of Dora by the shoulder
No dear no she said its all right and you must have some teawell have it on the lawn
John dont tease them any more
Alberts uncle is the gentleman I told you about
And my dear children this is my brother that I havent seen for three years
Then hes a longlost too said H O
The lady said Not now and smiled at him
And the rest of us were dumb with confounding emotions
Oswald was particularly dumb
He might have known it was her brother because in rotten grownup books if a girl kisses a man in a shrubbery that is not the man you think shes in love with it always turns out to be a brother though generally the disgrace of the family and not a respectable chaplain from Calcutta
The lady now turned to her reverend and surprising brother and said John go and tell them well have tea on the lawn
When he was gone she stood quite still a minute
Then she said Im going to tell you something but I want to put you on your honour not to talk about it to other people
You see it isnt everyone I would tell about it
He Alberts uncle I mean has told me a lot about you and I know I can trust you
We said Yes Oswald with a brooding sentiment of knowing all too well what was coming next
The lady then said Though I am not Alberts uncles grandmother I did know him in India once and we were going to be married but we had aamisunderstanding
Quarrel
Row
said Noel and H O at once
Well yes a quarrel and he went away
He was in the Navy then
And then  well we were both sorry but well anyway when his ship came back wed gone to Constantinople then to England and he couldnt find us
And he says hes been looking for me ever since
Not you for him
said Noel
Well perhaps said the lady
And the girls said Ah
with deep interest
The lady went on more quickly And then I found you and then he found me and now I must break it to you
Try to bear up
She stopped
The branches cracked and Alberts uncle was in our midst
He took off his hat
Excuse my tearing my hair he said to the lady but has the pack really hunted you down
Its all right she said and when she looked at him she got miles prettier quite suddenly
I was just breaking to them  Dont take that proud privilege from me he said
Kiddies allow me to present you to the future Mrs Alberts uncle or shall we say Alberts new aunt
   There was a good deal of explaining done before teaabout how we got there I mean and why
But after the first bitterness of disappointment we felt not nearly so sorry as we had expected to
For Alberts uncles lady was very jolly to us and her brother was awfully decent and showed us a lot of firstclass native curiosities and things unpacking them on purpose skins of beasts and beads and brass things and shells from different savage lands besides India
And the lady told the girls that she hoped they would like her as much as she liked them and if they wanted a new aunt she would do her best to give satisfaction in the new situation
And Alice thought of the Murdstone aunt belonging to Daisy and Denny and how awful it would have been if Alberts uncle had married HER
And she decided she told me afterwards that we might think ourselves jolly lucky it was no worse
Then the lady led Oswald aside pretending to show him the parrot which he had explored thoroughly before and told him she was not like some people in books
When she was married she would never try to separate her husband from his bachelor friends she only wanted them to be her friends as well
Then there was tea and thus all ended in amicableness and the reverend and friendly drove us home in a wagonette
But for Martha we shouldnt have had tea or explanations or lift or anything
So we honoured her and did not mind her being so heavy and walking up and down constantly on our laps as we drove home
And that is all the story of the longlost grandmother and Alberts uncle
I am afraid it is rather dull but it was very important to him so I felt it ought to be narrated
Stories about lovers and getting married are generally slow
I like a lovestory where the hero parts with the girl at the gardengate in the gloaming and goes off and has adventures and you dont see her any more till he comes home to marry her at the end of the book
And I suppose people have to marry
Alberts uncle is awfully oldmore than thirty and the lady is advanced in yearstwentysix next Christmas
They are to be married then
The girls are to be bridesmaids in white frocks with fur
This quite consoles them
If Oswald repines sometimes he hides it
Whats the use
We all have to meet our fell destiny and Alberts uncle is not extirpated from this awful law
Now the finding of the longlost was the very last thing we did for the sake of its being a noble act so that is the end of the Wouldbegoods and there are no more chapters after this
But Oswald hates books that finish up without telling you the things you might want to know about the people in the book
So here goes
We went home to the beautiful Blackheath house
It seemed very stately and mansionlike after the Moat House and everyone was most frightfully pleased to see us
Mrs Pettigrew CRIED when we went away
I never was so astonished in my life
She made each of the girls a fat red pincushion like a heart and each of us boys had a knife bought out of the housekeeping I mean housekeepers own money
Bill Simpkins is happy as subundergardener to Alberts uncles ladys mother
They do keep three gardenersI knew they did
And our tramp still earns enough to sleep well on from our dear old Pigman
Our last three days were entirely filled up with visits of farewell sympathy to all our many friends who were so sorry to lose us
We promised to come and see them next year
I hope we shall
Denny and Daisy went back to live with their father at Forest Hill
I dont think theyll ever be again the victims of the Murdstone auntwho is really a greataunt and about twice as much in the autumn of her days as our new Albertsuncle aunt
I think they plucked up spirit enough to tell their father they didnt like herwhich theyd never thought of doing before
Our own robber says their holidays in the country did them both a great deal of good
And he says us Bastables have certainly taught Daisy and Denny the rudiments of the art of making home happy
I believe they have thought of several quite new naughty things entirely on their ownand done them toosince they came back from the Moat House
I wish you didnt grow up so quickly
Oswald can see that ere long he will be too old for the kind of games we can all play and he feels grownupness creeping inordiously upon him
But enough of this
And now gentle reader farewell
If anything in these chronicles of the Wouldbegoods should make you try to be good yourself the author will be very glad of course
But take my advice and dont make a society for trying in
It is much easier without
And do try to forget that Oswald has another name besides Bastable
The one beginning with C I mean
Perhaps you have not noticed what it was
If so dont look back for it
It is a name no manly boy would like to be called byif he spoke the truth
Oswald is said to be a very manly boy and he despises that name and will never give it to his own son when he has one
Not if a rich relative offered to leave him an immense fortune if he did
Oswald would still be firm
He would on the honour of the House of Bastable
