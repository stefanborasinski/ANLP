The End of the Treasureseeking CHAPTER 1 THE COUNCIL OF WAYS AND MEANS This is the story of the different ways we looked for treasure and I think when you have read it you will see that we were not lazy about the looking
There are some things I must tell before I begin to tell about the treasureseeking because I have read books myself and I know how beastly it is when a story begins Alas
said Hildegarde with a deep sigh we must look our last on this ancestral home  and then some one else says something  and you dont know for pages and pages where the home is or who Hildegarde is or anything about it
Our ancestral home is in the Lewisham Road
It is semidetached and has a garden not a large one
We are the Bastables
There are six of us besides Father
Our Mother is dead and if you think we dont care because I dont tell you much about her you only show that you do not understand people at all
Dora is the eldest
Then Oswald  and then Dicky
Oswald won the Latin prize at his preparatory school  and Dicky is good at sums
Alice and Noel are twins they are ten and Horace Octavius is my youngest brother
It is one of us that tells this story  but I shall not tell you which only at the very end perhaps I will
While the story is going on you may be trying to guess only I bet you dont
It was Oswald who first thought of looking for treasure
Oswald often thinks of very interesting things
And directly he thought of it he did not keep it to himself as some boys would have done but he told the others and said  Ill tell you what we must go and seek for treasure it is always what you do to restore the fallen fortunes of your House
Dora said it was all very well
She often says that
She was trying to mend a large hole in one of Noels stockings
He tore it on a nail when we were playing shipwrecked mariners on top of the chickenhouse the day H O fell off and cut his chin he has the scar still
Dora is the only one of us who ever tries to mend anything
Alice tries to make things sometimes
Once she knitted a red scarf for Noel because his chest is delicate but it was much wider at one end than the other and he wouldnt wear it
So we used it as a pennon and it did very well because most of our things are black or grey since Mother died and scarlet was a nice change
Father does not like you to ask for new things
That was one way we had of knowing that the fortunes of the ancient House of Bastable were really fallen
Another way was that there was no more pocketmoney  except a penny now and then to the little ones and people did not come to dinner any more like they used to with pretty dresses driving up in cabs  and the carpets got holes in them  and when the legs came off things they were not sent to be mended and we gave UP having the gardener except for the front garden and not that very often
And the silver in the big oak platechest that is lined with green baize all went away to the shop to have the dents and scratches taken out of it and it never came back
We think Father hadnt enough money to pay the silver man for taking out the dents and scratches
The new spoons and forks were yellowywhite and not so heavy as the old ones and they never shone after the first day or two
Father was very ill after Mother died and while he was ill his businesspartner went to Spain  and there was never much money afterwards
I dont know why
Then the servants left and there was only one a General
A great deal of your comfort and happiness depends on having a good General
The last but one was nice she used to make jolly good currant puddings for us and let us have the dish on the floor and pretend it was a wild boar we were killing with our forks
But the General we have now nearly always makes sago puddings and they are the watery kind and you cannot pretend anything with them not even islands like you do with porridge
Then we left off going to school and Father said we should go to a good school as soon as he could manage it
He said a holiday would do us all good
We thought he was right but we wished he had told us he couldnt afford it
For of course we knew
Then a great many people used to come to the door with envelopes with no stamps on them and sometimes they got very angry and said they were calling for the last time before putting it in other hands
I asked Eliza what that meant and she kindly explained to me and I was so sorry for Father
And once a long blue paper came a policeman brought it and we were so frightened
But Father said it was all right only when he went up to kiss the girls after they were in bed they said he had been crying though Im sure thats not true
Because only cowards and snivellers cry and my Father is the bravest man in the world
So you see it was time we looked for treasure and Oswald said so and Dora said it was all very well
But the others agreed with Oswald
So we held a council
Dora was in the chair  the big diningroom chair that we let the fireworks off from the Fifth of November when we had the measles and couldnt do it in the garden
The hole has never been mended so now we have that chair in the nursery and I think it was cheap at the blowingup we boys got when the hole was burnt
We must do something said Alice because the exchequer is empty
She rattled the moneybox as she spoke and it really did rattle because we always keep the bad sixpence in it for luck
Yes  but what shall we do
said Dicky
Its so jolly easy to say lets do something
Dicky always wants everything settled exactly
Father calls him the Definite Article
Lets read all the books again
We shall get lots of ideas out of them
It was Noel who suggested this but we made him shut up because we knew well enough he only wanted to get back to his old books
Noel is a poet
He sold some of his poetry once  and it was printed but that does not come in this part of the story
Then Dicky said Look here
Well be quite quiet for ten minutes by the clock  and each think of some way to find treasure
And when weve thought well try all the ways one after the other beginning with the eldest
I shant be able to think in ten minutes make it half an hour said H O
His real name is Horace Octavius but we call him H O because of the advertisement and its not so very long ago he was afraid to pass the hoarding where it says Eat H
O
in big letters
He says it was when he was a little boy but I remember last Christmas but one he woke in the middle of the night crying and howling and they said it was the pudding
But he told me afterwards he had been dreaming that they really had come to eat H O and it couldnt have been the pudding when you come to think of it because it was so very plain
Well we made it half an hour  and we all sat quiet and thought and thought
And I made up my mind before two minutes were over and I saw the others had all but Dora who is always an awful time over everything
I got pins and needles in my leg from sitting still so long and when it was seven minutes H O cried out  Oh it must be more than half an hour
H O is eight years old but he cannot tell the clock yet
Oswald could tell the clock when he was six
We all stretched ourselves and began to speak at once but Dora put up her hands to her ears and said  One at a time please
We arent playing Babel
It is a very good game
Did you ever play it
So Dora made us all sit in a row on the floor in ages and then she pointed at us with the finger that had the brass thimble on
Her silver one got lost when the last General but two went away
We think she must have forgotten it was Doras and put it in her box by mistake
She was a very forgetful girl
She used to forget what she had spent money on so that the change was never quite right
Oswald spoke first
I think we might stop people on Blackheath  with crape masks and horsepistols  and say Your money or your life
Resistance is useless we are armed to the teeth  like Dick Turpin and Claude Duval
It wouldnt matter about not having horses because coaches have gone out too
Dora screwed up her nose the way she always does when she is going to talk like the good elder sister in books and said That would be very wrong its like pickpocketing or taking pennies out of Fathers greatcoat when its hanging in the hall
I must say I dont think she need have said that especially before the little ones  for it was when I was only four
But Oswald was not going to let her see he cared so he said  Oh very well
I can think of lots of other ways
We could rescue an old gentleman from deadly Highwaymen
There arent any said Dora
Oh well its all the same  from deadly peril then
Theres plenty of that
Then he would turn out to be the Prince of Wales and he would say My noble my cherished preserver
Here is a million pounds a year
Rise up Sir Oswald Bastable
But the others did not seem to think so and it was Alices turn to say
She said I think we might try the divining rod
Im sure I could do it
Ive often read about it
You hold a stick in your hands and when you come to where there is gold underneath the stick kicks about
So you know
And you dig
Oh said Dora suddenly I have an idea
But Ill say last
I hope the diviningrod isnt wrong
I believe its wrong in the Bible
So is eating pork and ducks said Dicky
You cant go by that
Anyhow well try the other ways first said Dora
Now H
O
Lets be Bandits said H O
I dare say its wrong but it would be fun pretending
Im sure its wrong said Dora
And Dicky said she thought everything wrong
She said she didnt and Dicky was very disagreeable
So Oswald had to make peace and he said  Dora neednt play if she doesnt want to
Nobody asked her
And Dicky dont be an idiot do dry up and lets hear what Noels idea is
Dora and Dicky did not look pleased but I kicked Noel under the table to make him hurry up and then he said he didnt think he wanted to play any more
Thats the worst of it
The others are so jolly ready to quarrel
I told Noel to be a man and not a snivelling pig and at last he said he had not made up his mind whether he would print his poetry in a book and sell it or find a princess and marry her
Whichever it is he added none of you shall want for anything though Oswald did kick me and say I was a snivelling pig
I didnt said Oswald I told you not to be
And Alice explained to him that that was quite the opposite of what he thought
So he agreed to drop it
Then Dicky spoke
You must all of you have noticed the advertisements in the papers telling you that ladies and gentlemen can easily earn two pounds a week in their spare time and to send two shillings for sample and instructions carefully packed free from observation
Now that we dont go to school all our time is spare time
So I should think we could easily earn twenty pounds a week each
That would do us very well
Well try some of the other things first and directly we have any money well send for the sample and instructions
And I have another idea but I must think about it before I say
We all said Out with it  whats the other idea
But Dicky said No
That is Dicky all over
He never will show you anything hes making till its quite finished and the same with his inmost thoughts
But he is pleased if you seem to want to know so Oswald said  Keep your silly old secret then
Now Dora drive ahead
Weve all said except you
Then Dora jumped up and dropped the stocking and the thimble it rolled away and we did not find it for days and said  Lets try my way now
Besides Im the eldest so its only fair
Lets dig for treasure
Not any tiresome diviningrod  but just plain digging
People who dig for treasure always find it
And then we shall be rich and we neednt try your ways at all
Some of them are rather difficult and Im certain some of them are wrong  and we must always remember that wrong things  But we told her to shut up and come on and she did
I couldnt help wondering as we went down to the garden why Father had never thought of digging there for treasure instead of going to his beastly office every day
CHAPTER 2 DIGGING FOR TREASURE I am afraid the last chapter was rather dull
It is always dull in books when people talk and talk and dont do anything but I was obliged to put it in or else you wouldnt have understood all the rest
The best part of books is when things are happening
That is the best part of real things too
This is why I shall not tell you in this story about all the days when nothing happened
You will not catch me saying thus the sad days passed slowly by  or the years rolled on their weary course  or time went on  because it is silly of course time goes on  whether you say so or not
So I shall just tell you the nice interesting parts  and in between you will understand that we had our meals and got up and went to bed and dull things like that
It would be sickening to write all that down though of course it happens
I said so to Albertnextdoors uncle who writes books and he said Quite right thats what we call selection a necessity of true art
And he is very clever indeed
So you see
I have often thought that if the people who write books for children knew a little more it would be better
I shall not tell you anything about us except what I should like to know about if I was reading the story and you were writing it
Alberts uncle says I ought to have put this in the preface but I never read prefaces and it is not much good writing things just for people to skip
I wonder other authors have never thought of this
Well when we had agreed to dig for treasure we all went down into the cellar and lighted the gas
Oswald would have liked to dig there but it is stone flags
We looked among the old boxes and broken chairs and fenders and empty bottles and things and at last we found the spades we had to dig in the sand with when we went to the seaside three years ago
They are not silly babyish wooden spades that split if you look at them but good iron with a blue mark across the top of the iron part and yellow wooden handles
We wasted a little time getting them dusted because the girls wouldnt dig with spades that had cobwebs on them
Girls would never do for African explorers or anything like that they are too beastly particular
It was no use doing the thing by halves
We marked out a sort of square in the mouldy part of the garden about three yards across and began to dig
But we found nothing except worms and stones  and the ground was very hard
So we thought wed try another part of the garden and we found a place in the big round flower bed where the ground was much softer
We thought wed make a smaller hole to begin with and it was much better
We dug and dug and dug and it was jolly hard work
We got very hot digging but we found nothing
Presently Albertnextdoor looked over the wall
We do not like him very much but we let him play with us sometimes because his father is dead and you must not be unkind to orphans even if their mothers are alive
Albert is always very tidy
He wears frilly collars and velvet knickerbockers
I cant think how he can bear to
So we said Hallo
And he said What are you up to
Were digging for treasure said Alice an ancient parchment revealed to us the place of concealment
Come over and help us
When we have dug deep enough we shall find a great pot of red clay full of gold and precious jewels
Albertnextdoor only sniggered and said What silly nonsense
He cannot play properly at all
It is very strange because he has a very nice uncle
You see Albertnextdoor doesnt care for reading and he has not read nearly so many books as we have so he is very foolish and ignorant but it cannot be helped and you just have to put up with it when you want him to do anything
Besides it is wrong to be angry with people for not being so clever as you are yourself
It is not always their faults
So Oswald said Come and dig
Then you shall share the treasure when weve found it
But he said I shant  I dont like digging  and Im just going in to my tea
Come along and dig theres a good boy Alice said
You can use my spade
Its much the best  So he came along and dug and when once he was over the wall we kept him at it and we worked as well of course and the hole got deep
Pincher worked too  he is our dog and he is very good at digging
He digs for rats in the dustbin sometimes and gets very dirty
But we love our dog even when his face wants washing
I expect we shall have to make a tunnel Oswald said to reach the rich treasure
So he jumped into the hole and began to dig at one side
After that we took it in turns to dig at the tunnel and Pincher was most useful in scraping the earth out of the tunnel  he does it with his back feet when you say Rats
and he digs with his front ones and burrows with his nose as well
At last the tunnel was nearly a yard long and big enough to creep along to find the treasure if only it had been a bit longer
Now it was Alberts turn to go in and dig but he funked it
Take your turn like a man said Oswald  nobody can say that Oswald doesnt take his turn like a man
But Albert wouldnt
So we had to make him because it was only fair
Its quite easy Alice said
You just crawl in and dig with your hands
Then when you come out we can scrape out what youve done with the spades
Come  be a man
You wont notice it being dark in the tunnel if you shut your eyes tight
Weve all been in except Dora  and she doesnt like worms
I dont like worms neither
Albertnextdoor said this but we remembered how he had picked a fat red and black worm up in his fingers and thrown it at Dora only the day before
So we put him in
But he would not go in head first the proper way and dig with his hands as we had done and though Oswald was angry at the time for he hates snivellers yet afterwards he owned that perhaps it was just as well
You should never be afraid to own that perhaps you were mistaken  but it is cowardly to do it unless you are quite sure you are in the wrong
Let me go in feet first said Albertnextdoor
Ill dig with my boots  I will truly honour bright
So we let him get in feet first  and he did it very slowly and at last he was in and only his head sticking out into the hole and all the rest of him in the tunnel
Now dig with your boots said Oswald and Alice do catch hold of Pincher hell be digging again in another minute and perhaps it would be uncomfortable for Albert if Pincher threw the mould into his eyes
You should always try to think of these little things
Thinking of other peoples comfort makes them like you
Alice held Pincher and we all shouted Kick
dig with your feet for all youre worth
So Albertnextdoor began to dig with his feet and we stood on the ground over him waiting  and all in a minute the ground gave way and we tumbled together in a heap and when we got up there was a little shallow hollow where we had been standing and Albertnextdoor was under neath stuck quite fast because the roof of the tunnel had tumbled in on him
He is a horribly unlucky boy to have anything to do with
It was dreadful the way he cried and screamed though he had to own it didnt hurt only it was rather heavy and he couldnt move his legs
We would have dug him out all right enough in time but he screamed so we were afraid the police would come so Dicky climbed over the wall to tell the cook there to tell Albertnextdoors uncle he had been buried by mistake and to come and help dig him out
Dicky was a long time gone
We wondered what had become of him and all the while the screaming went on and on for we had taken the loose earth off Alberts face so that he could scream quite easily and comfortably
Presently Dicky came back and Albertnextdoors uncle came with him
He has very long legs and his hair is light and his face is brown
He has been to sea but now he writes books
I like him
He told his nephew to stow it so Albert did and then he asked him if he was hurt  and Albert had to say he wasnt for though he is a coward and very unlucky he is not a liar like some boys are
This promises to be a protracted if agreeable task said Albertnextdoors uncle rubbing his hands and looking at the hole with Alberts head in it
I will get another spade so he fetched the big spade out of the nextdoor garden toolshed and began to dig his nephew out
Mind you keep very still he said or I might chunk a bit out of you with the spade
Then after a while he said  I confess that I am not absolutely insensible to the dramatic interest of the situation
My curiosity is excited
I own that I should like to know how my nephew happened to be buried
But dont tell me if youd rather not
I suppose no force was used
Only moral force said Alice
They used to talk a lot about moral force at the High School where she went and in case you dont know what it means Ill tell you that it is making people do what they dont want to just by slanging them or laughing at them or promising them things if theyre good
Only moral force eh
said Albertnextdoors uncle
Well
Well Dora said Im very sorry it happened to Albert  Id rather it had been one of us
It would have been my turn to go into the tunnel only I dont like worms so they let me off
You see we were digging for treasure
Yes said Alice and I think we were just coming to the underground passage that leads to the secret hoard when the tunnel fell in on Albert
He is so unlucky and she sighed
Then Albertnextdoor began to scream again and his uncle wiped his face  his own face not Alberts  with his silk handkerchief and then he put it in his trousers pocket
It seems a strange place to put a handkerchief but he had his coat and waistcoat off and I suppose he wanted the handkerchief handy
Digging is warm work
He told Albertnextdoor to drop it or he wouldnt proceed further in the matter so Albert stopped screaming and presently his uncle finished digging him out
Albert did look so funny with his hair all dusty and his velvet suit covered with mould and his face muddy with earth and crying
We all said how sorry we were but he wouldnt say a word back to us
He was most awfully sick to think hed been the one buried when it might just as well have been one of us
I felt myself that it was hard lines
So you were digging for treasure said Albertnextdoors uncle wiping his face again with his handkerchief
Well I fear that your chances of success are small
I have made a careful study of the whole subject
What I dont know about buried treasure is not worth knowing
And I never knew more than one coin buried in any one garden  and that is generally  Hullo  whats that
He pointed to something shining in the hole he had just dragged Albert out of
Oswald picked it up
It was a halfcrown
We looked at each other speechless with surprise and delight like in books
Well thats lucky at all events said Albertnextdoors uncle
Lets see thats fivepence each for you
Its fourpence  something I cant do fractions said Dicky there are seven of us you see
Oh you count Albert as one of yourselves on this occasion eh
Of course said Alice and I say he was buried after all
Why shouldnt we let him have the odd somethings and well have fourpence each
We all agreed to do this and told Albertnextdoor we would bring his share as soon as we could get the halfcrown changed
He cheered up a little at that and his uncle wiped his face again  he did look hot  and began to put on his coat and waistcoat
When he had done it he stooped and picked up something
He held it up and you will hardly believe it but it is quite true  it was another halfcrown
To think that there should be two
he said in all my experience of buried treasure I never heard of such a thing
I wish Albertnextdoors uncle would come treasureseeking with us regularly he must have very sharp eyes for Dora says she was looking just the minute before at the very place where the second halfcrown was picked up from and she never saw it
CHAPTER 3 BEING DETECTIVES The next thing that happened to us was very interesting
It was as real as the halfcrowns  not just pretending
I shall try to write it as like a real book as I can
Of course we have read Mr Sherlock Holmes as well as the yellowcovered books with pictures outside that are so badly printed and you get them for fourpencehalfpenny at the bookstall when the corners of them are beginning to curl up and get dirty with people looking to see how the story ends when they are waiting for trains
I think this is most unfair to the boy at the bookstall
The books are written by a gentleman named Gaboriau and Alberts uncle says they are the worst translations in the world  and written in vile English
Of course theyre not like Kipling but theyre jolly good stories
And we had just been reading a book by Dick Diddlington  thats not his right name but I know all about libel actions so I shall not say what his name is really because his books are rot
Only they put it into our heads to do what I am going to narrate
It was in September and we were not to go to the seaside because it is so expensive even if you go to Sheerness where it is all tin cans and old boots and no sand at all
But every one else went even the people next door  not Alberts side but the other
Their servant told Eliza they were all going to Scarborough and next day sure enough all the blinds were down and the shutters up and the milk was not left any more
There is a big horsechestnut tree between their garden and ours very useful for getting conkers out of and for making stuff to rub on your chilblains
This prevented our seeing whether the blinds were down at the back as well but Dicky climbed to the top of the tree and looked and they were
It was jolly hot weather and very stuffy indoors  we used to play a good deal in the garden
We made a tent out of the kitchen clotheshorse and some blankets off our beds and though it was quite as hot in the tent as in the house it was a very different sort of hotness
Alberts uncle called it the Turkish Bath
It is not nice to be kept from the seaside but we know that we have much to be thankful for
We might be poor little children living in a crowded alley where even at summer noon hardly a ray of sunlight penetrates clothed in rags and with bare feet  though I do not mind holes in my clothes myself and bare feet would not be at all bad in this sort of weather
Indeed we do sometimes when we are playing at things which require it
It was shipwrecked mariners that day I remember and we were all in the blanket tent
We had just finished eating the things we had saved at the peril of our lives from the stsinking vessel
They were rather nice things
Twopennyworth of coconut candy  it was got in Greenwich where it is four ounces a penny  three apples some macaroni  the straight sort that is so useful to suck things through  some raw rice and a large piece of cold suet pudding that Alice nicked from the larder when she went to get the rice and macaroni
And when we had finished some one said  I should like to be a detective
I wish to be quite fair but I cannot remember exactly who said it
Oswald thinks he said it and Dora says it was Dicky but Oswald is too much of a man to quarrel about a little thing like that
I should like to be a detective said  perhaps it was Dicky but I think not  and find out strange and hidden crimes
You have to be much cleverer than you are said H O
Not so very Alice said because when youve read the books you know what the things mean the red hair on the handle of the knife or the grains of white powder on the velvet collar of the villains overcoat
I believe we could do it
I shouldnt like to have anything to do with murders said Dora somehow it doesnt seem safe  And it always ends in the poor murderer being hanged said Alice
We explained to her why murderers have to be hanged but she only said I dont care
Im sure no one would ever do murdering twice
Think of the blood and things and what you would see when you woke up in the night
I shouldnt mind being a detective to lie in wait for a gang of coiners now and spring upon them unawares and secure them  singlehanded you know or with only my faithful bloodhound
She stroked Pinchers ears but he had gone to sleep because he knew well enough that all the suet pudding was finished
He is a very sensible dog
You always get hold of the wrong end of the stick Oswald said
You cant choose what crimes youll be a detective about
You just have to get a suspicious circumstance and then you look for a clue and follow it up
Whether it turns out a murder or a missing will is just a fluke
Thats one way Dicky said
Another is to get a paper and find two advertisements or bits of news that fit
Like this Young Lady Missing and then it tells about all the clothes she had on and the gold locket she wore and the colour of her hair and all that and then in another piece of the paper you see Gold locket found and then it all comes out
We sent H O for the paper at once but we could not make any of the things fit in
The two best were about how some burglars broke into a place in Holloway where they made preserved tongues and invalid delicacies and carried off a lot of them
And on another page there was Mysterious deaths in Holloway
Oswald thought there was something in it and so did Alberts uncle when we asked him but the others thought not so Oswald agreed to drop it
Besides Holloway is a long way off
All the time we were talking about the paper Alice seemed to be thinking about something else and when we had done she said  I believe we might be detectives ourselves but I should not like to get anybody into trouble
Not murderers or robbers
Dicky asked
It wouldnt be murderers she said but I have noticed something strange
Only I feel a little frightened
Lets ask Alberts uncle first
Alice is a jolly sight too fond of asking grownUP people things
And we all said it was tommyrot and she was to tell us
Well promise you wont do anything without me Alice said and we promised
Then she said  This is a dark secret and any one who thinks it is better not to be involved in a career of crime discovery had better go away ere yet it be too late
So Dora said she had had enough of tents and she was going to look at the shops
H O went with her because he had twopence to spend
They thought it was only a game of Alices but Oswald knew by the way she spoke
He can nearly always tell
And when people are not telling the truth Oswald generally knows by the way they look with their eyes
Oswald is not proud of being able to do this
He knows it is through no merit of his own that he is much cleverer than some people
When they had gone the rest of us got closer together and said  Now then
Well Alice said you know the house next door
The people have gone to Scarborough
And the house is shut up
But last night I saw a light in the windows
We asked her how and when because her room is in the front and she couldnt possibly have seen
And then she said  Ill tell you if you boys will promise not ever to go fishing again without me
So we had to promise
Then she said  It was last night
I had forgotten to feed my rabbits and I woke up and remembered it
And I was afraid I should find them dead in the morning like Oswald did
It wasnt my fault Oswald said there was something the matter with the beasts
I fed them right enough
Alice said she didnt mean that and she went on  I came down into the garden and I saw a light in the house and dark figures moving about
I thought perhaps it was burglars but Father hadnt come home and Eliza had gone to bed so I couldnt do anything
Only I thought perhaps I would tell the rest of you
Why didnt you tell us this morning
Noel asked
And Alice explained that she did not want to get any one into trouble even burglars
But we might watch tonight she said and see if we see the light again
They might have been burglars Noel said
He was sucking the last bit of his macaroni
You know the people next door are very grand
They wont know us  and they go out in a real private carriage sometimes
And they have an At Home day and people come in cabs
I daresay they have piles of plate and jewellery and rich brocades and furs of price and things like that
Let us keep watch tonight
Its no use watching tonight Dicky said if its only burglars they wont come again
But there are other things besides burglars that are discovered in empty houses where lights are seen moving
You mean coiners said Oswald at once
I wonder what the reward is for setting the police on their track
Dicky thought it ought to be something fat because coiners are always a desperate gang and the machinery they make the coins with is so heavy and handy for knocking down detectives
Then it was teatime and we went in and Dora and H O had clubbed their money together and bought a melon quite a big one and only a little bit squashy at one end
It was very good and then we washed the seeds and made things with them and with pins and cotton
And nobody said any more about watching the house next door
Only when we went to bed Dicky took off his coat and waistcoat but he stopped at his braces and said  What about the coiners
Oswald had taken off his collar and tie and he was just going to say the same so he said Of course I meant to watch only my collars rather tight so I thought Id take it off first
Dicky said he did not think the girls ought to be in it because there might be danger but Oswald reminded him that they had promised Alice and that a promise is a sacred thing even when youd much rather not
So Oswald got Alice alone under pretence of showing her a caterpillar  Dora does not like them and she screamed and ran away when Oswald offered to show it her
Then Oswald explained and Alice agreed to come and watch if she could
This made us later than we ought to have been because Alice had to wait till Dora was quiet and then creep out very slowly for fear of the boards creaking
The girls sleep with their roomdoor open for fear of burglars
Alice had kept on her clothes under her nightgown when Dora wasnt looking and presently we got down creeping past Fathers study and out at the glass door that leads on to the veranda and the iron steps into the garden
And we went down very quietly and got into the chestnuttree and then I felt that we had only been playing what Alberts uncle calls our favourite instrument  I mean the Fool
For the house next door was as dark as dark
Then suddenly we heard a sound  it came from the gate at the end of the garden
All the gardens have gates they lead into a kind of lane that runs behind them
It is a sort of back way very convenient when you dont want to say exactly where you are going
We heard the gate at the end of the next garden click and Dicky nudged Alice so that she would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswalds extraordinary presence of mind
Oswald squeezed Alices arm tight and we all looked and the others were rather frightened because really we had not exactly expected anything to happen except perhaps a light
But now a muffled figure shrouded in a dark cloak came swiftly up the path of the nextdoor garden
And we could see that under its cloak the figure carried a mysterious burden
The figure was dressed to look like a woman in a sailor hat
We held our breath as it passed under the tree where we were and then it tapped very gently on the back door and was let in and then a light appeared in the window of the downstairs back breakfastroom
But the shutters were up
Dicky said My eye
and wouldnt the others be sick to think they hadnt been in this
But Alice didnt half like it  and as she is a girl I do not blame her
Indeed I thought myself at first that perhaps it would be better to retire for the present and return later with a strongly armed force
Its not burglars Alice whispered the mysterious Stranger was bringing things in not taking them out
They must be coiners  and oh Oswald
 dont lets
The things they coin with must hurt very much
Do lets go to bed
But Dicky said he was going to see if there was a reward for finding out things like this he would like to have the reward
They locked the back door he whispered I heard it go
And I could look in quite well through the holes in the shutters and be back over the wall long before theyd got the door open even if they started to do it at once
There were holes at the top of the shutters the shape of hearts and the yellow light came out through them as well as through the chinks of the shutters
Oswald said if Dicky went he should because he was the eldest and Alice said If any one goes it ought to be me because I thought of it
So Oswald said Well go then and she said Not for anything
And she begged us not to and we talked about it in the tree till we were all quite hoarse with whispering
At last we decided on a plan of action
Alice was to stay in the tree and scream Murder
if anything happened
Dicky and I were to get down into the next garden and take it in turns to peep
So we got down as quietly as we could but the tree made much more noise than it does in the day and several times we paused fearing that all was discovered
But nothing happened
There was a pile of red flowerpots under the window and one very large one was on the windowledge
It seemed as if it was the hand of Destiny had placed it there and the geranium in it was dead and there was nothing to stop your standing on it  so Oswald did
He went first because he is the eldest and though Dicky tried to stop him because he thought of it first it could not be on account of not being able to say anything
So Oswald stood on the flowerpot and tried to look through one of the holes
He did not really expect to see the coiners at their fell work though he had pretended to when we were talking in the tree
But if he had seen them pouring the base molten metal into tin moulds the shape of halfcrowns he would not have been half so astonished as he was at the spectacle now revealed
At first he could see little because the hole had unfortunately been made a little too high so that the eye of the detective could only see the Prodigal Son in a shiny frame on the opposite wall
But Oswald held on to the windowframe and stood on tiptoe and then he saw
There was no furnace and no base metal no bearded men in leathern aprons with tongs and things but just a table with a tablecloth on it for supper and a tin of salmon and a lettuce and some bottled beer
And there on a chair was the cloak and the hat of the mysterious stranger and the two people sitting at the table were the two youngest grownup daughters of the lady next door and one of them was saying  So I got the salmon threehalfpence cheaper and the lettuces are only six a penny in the Broad way just fancy
We must save as much as ever we can on our housekeeping money if we want to go away decent next year
And the other said I wish we could all go every year or else  Really I almost wish  And all the time Oswald was looking Dicky was pulling at his jacket to make him get down and let Dicky have a squint
And just as she said I almost Dicky pulled too hard and Oswald felt himself toppling on the giddy verge of the big flowerpots
Putting forth all his strength our hero strove to recover his equi whatsitsname but it was now lost beyond recall
Youve done it this time
he said then he fell heavily among the flowerpots piled below
He heard them crash and rattle and crack and then his head struck against an iron pillar used for holding up the nextdoor veranda
His eyes closed and he knew no more
Now you will perhaps expect that at this moment Alice would have cried Murder
If you think so you little know what girls are
Directly she was left alone in that tree she made a bolt to tell Alberts uncle all about it and bring him to our rescue in case the coiners gang was a very desperate one
And just when I fell Alberts uncle was getting over the wall
Alice never screamed at all when Oswald fell but Dicky thinks he heard Alberts uncle say Confound those kids
which would not have been kind or polite so I hope he did not say it
The people next door did not come out to see what the row was
Alberts uncle did not wait for them to come out
He picked up Oswald and carried the insensible body of the gallant young detective to the wall laid it on the top and then climbed over and bore his lifeless burden into our house and put it on the sofa in Fathers study
Father was out so we neednt have crept so when we were getting into the garden
Then Oswald was restored to consciousness and his head tied up and sent to bed and next day there was a lump on his young brow as big as a turkeys egg and very uncomfortable
Alberts uncle came in next day and talked to each of us separately
To Oswald he said many unpleasant things about ungentlemanly to spy on ladies and about minding your own business and when I began to tell him what I had heard he told me to shut up and altogether he made me more uncomfortable than the bump did
Oswald did not say anything to any one but next day as the shadows of eve were falling he crept away and wrote on a piece of paper I want to speak to you and shoved it through the hole like a heart in the top of the nextdoor shutters
And the youngest young lady put an eye to the heartshaped hole and then opened the shutter and said Well
very crossly
Then Oswald said  I am very sorry and I beg your pardon
We wanted to be detectives and we thought a gang of coiners infested your house so we looked through your window last night
I saw the lettuce and I heard what you said about the salmon being threehalfpence cheaper and I know it is very dishonourable to pry into other peoples secrets especially ladies and I never will again if you will forgive me this once
Then the lady frowned and then she laughed and then she said  So it was you tumbling into the flowerpots last night
We thought it was burglars
It frightened us horribly
Why what a bump on your poor head
And then she talked to me a bit and presently she said she and her sister had not wished people to know they were at home because  And then she stopped short and grew very red and I said I thought you were all at Scarborough your servant told Eliza so
Why didnt you want people to know you were at home
The lady got redder still and then she laughed and said  Never mind the reason why
I hope your head doesnt hurt much
Thank you for your nice manly little speech
Youve nothing to be ashamed of at any rate
Then she kissed me and I did not mind
And then she said Run away now dear
Im going to  Im going to pull up the blinds and open the shutters and I want to do it at once before it gets dark so that every one can see were at home and not at Scarborough
CHAPTER 4 GOOD HUNTING When we had got that four shillings by digging for treasure we ought by rights to have tried Dickys idea of answering the advertisement about ladies and gentlemen and spare time and two pounds a week but there were several things we rather wanted
Dora wanted a new pair of scissors and she said she was going to get them with her eightpence
But Alice said  You ought to get her those Oswald because you know you broke the points off hers getting the marble out of the brass thimble
It was quite true though I had almost forgotten it but then it was H O who jammed the marble into the thimble first of all
So I said  Its H
O
s fault as much as mine anyhow
Why shouldnt he pay
Oswald didnt so much mind paying for the beastly scissors but he hates injustice of every kind
Hes such a little kid said Dicky and of course H O said he wasnt a little kid and it very nearly came to being a row between them
But Oswald knows when to be generous so he said  Look here
Ill pay sixpence of the scissors and H O shall pay the rest to teach him to be careful
H O agreed he is not at all a mean kid but I found out afterwards that Alice paid his share out of her own money
Then we wanted some new paints and NoEl wanted a pencil and a halfpenny accountbook to write poetry with and it does seem hard never to have any apples
So somehow or other nearly all the money got spent and we agreed that we must let the advertisement run loose a little longer
I only hope Alice said that they wont have got all the ladies and gentlemen they want before we have got the money to write for the sample and instructions
And I was a little afraid myself because it seemed such a splendid chance but we looked in the paper every day and the advertisement was always there so we thought it was all right
Then we had the detective tryon  and it proved no go and then when all the money was gone except a halfpenny of mine and twopence of Noels and threepence of Dickys and a few pennies that the girls had left we held another council
Dora was sewing the buttons on H
O
s Sunday things
He got himself a knife with his money and he cut every single one of his best buttons off
Youve no idea how many buttons there are on a suit
Dora counted them
There are twentyfour counting the little ones on the sleeves that dont undo
Alice was trying to teach Pincher to beg but he has too much sense when he knows youve got nothing in your hands and the rest of us were roasting potatoes under the fire
We had made a fire on purpose though it was rather warm
They are very good if you cut away the burnt parts  but you ought to wash them first or you are a dirty boy
Well what can we do
said Dicky
You are so fond of saying Lets do something
and never saying what
We cant try the advertisement yet
Shall we try rescuing some one
said Oswald
It was his own idea but he didnt insist on doing it though he is next to the eldest for he knows it is bad manners to make people do what you want when they would rather not
What was Noels plan
Alice asked
A Princess or a poetry book said Noel sleepily
He was lying on his back on the sofa kicking his legs
Only I shall look for the Princess all by myself
But Ill let you see her when were married
Have you got enough poetry to make a book
Dicky asked that and it was rather sensible of him because when Noel came to look there were only seven of his poems that any of us could understand
There was the Wreck of the Malabar and the poem he wrote when Eliza took us to hear the Reviving Preacher and everybody cried and Father said it must have been the Preachers Eloquence
So Noel wrote O Eloquence and what art thou
Ay what art thou
because we cried And everybody cried inside When they came out their eyes were red  And it was your doing Father said
But Noel told Alice he got the first line and a half from a book a boy at school was going to write when he had time
Besides this there were the Lines on a Dead Black Beetle that was poisoned Beetle how I weep to see Thee lying on thy poor back
It is so very sad indeed
You were so shiny and black
I wish you were alive again But Eliza says wishing it is nonsense and a shame
It was very good beetle poison and there were hundreds of them lying dead  but Noel only wrote a piece of poetry for one of them
He said he hadnt time to do them all and the worst of it was he didnt know which one hed written it to  so Alice couldnt bury the beetle and put the lines on its grave though she wanted to very much
Well it was quite plain that there wasnt enough poetry for a book
We might wait a year or two said Noel
I shall be sure to make some more some time
I thought of a piece about a fly this morning that knew condensed milk was sticky
But we want the money now said Dicky and you can go on writing just the same
It will come in some time or other
Theres poetry in newspapers said Alice
Down Pincher
youll never be a clever dog so its no good trying
Do they pay for it
Dicky thought of that he often thinks of things that are really important even if they are a little dull
I dont know
But I shouldnt think any one would let them print their poetry without
I wouldnt I know
That was Dora but Noel said he wouldnt mind if he didnt get paid so long as he saw his poetry printed and his name at the end
We might try anyway said Oswald
He is always willing to give other peoples ideas a fair trial
So we copied out The Wreck of the Malabar and the other six poems on drawingpaper  Dora did it she writes best  and Oswald drew a picture of the Malabar going down with all hands
It was a fullrigged schooner and all the ropes and sails were correct because my cousin is in the Navy and he showed me
We thought a long time whether wed write a letter and send it by post with the poetry  and Dora thought it would be best
But NoEl said he couldnt bear not to know at once if the paper would print the poetry So we decided to take it
I went with Noel because I am the eldest and he is not old enough to go to London by himself
Dicky said poetry was rot  and he was glad he hadnt got to make a fool of himself
that was because there was not enough money for him to go with us
H O couldnt come either but he came to the station to see us off and waved his cap and called out Good hunting
as the train started
There was a lady in spectacles in the corner
She was writing with a pencil on the edges of long strips of paper that had print all down them
When the train started she asked  What was that he said
So Oswald answered  It was Good hunting  its out of the jungle book
Thats very pleasant to hear the lady said I am very pleased to meet people who know their jungle book
And where are you off to  the Zoological Gardens to look for Bagheera
We were pleased too to meet some one who knew the jungle book
So Oswald said  We are going to restore the fallen fortunes of the House of Bastable  and we have all thought of different ways  and were going to try them all
Noels way is poetry
I suppose great poets get paid
The lady laughed  she was awfully jolly  and said she was a sort of poet too and the long strips of paper were the proofs of her new book of stories
Because before a book is made into a real book with pages and a cover they sometimes print it all on strips of paper and the writer make marks on it with a pencil to show the printers what idiots they are not to understand what a writer means to have printed
We told her all about digging for treasure and what we meant to do
Then she asked to see Noels poetry  and he said he didnt like  so she said Look here  if youll show me yours Ill show you some of mine
So he agreed
The jolly lady read NoEls poetry and she said she liked it very much
And she thought a great deal of the picture of the Malabar
And then she said I write serious poetry like yours myself too but I have a piece here that I think you will like because its about a boy
She gave it to us  and so I can copy it down and I will for it shows that some grownup ladies are not so silly as others
I like it better than NoEls poetry though I told him I did not because he looked as if he was going to cry
This was very wrong for you should always speak the truth however unhappy it makes people
And I generally do
But I did not want him crying in the railway carriage
The ladys piece of poetry Oh when I wake up in my bed And see the sun all fat and red Im glad to have another day For all my different kinds of play
There are so many things to do  The things that make a man of you If grownups did not get so vexed And wonder what you will do next
I often wonder whether they Ever made up our kinds of play  If they were always good as gold And only did what they were told
They like you best to play with tops And toys in boxes bought in shops They do not even know the names Of really interesting games
They will not let you play with fire Or trip your sister up with wire They grudge the teatray for a drum Or boobytraps when callers come
They dont like fishing and its true You sometimes soak a suit or two They look on fireworks though theyre dry With quite a disapproving eye
They do not understand the way To get the most out of your day They do not know how hunger feels Nor what you need between your meals
And when youre sent to bed at night Theyre happy but theyre not polite
For through the door you hear them say Hes done his mischief for the day
She told us a lot of other pieces but I cannot remember them and she talked to us all the way up and when we got nearly to Cannon Street she said  Ive got two new shillings here
Do you think they would help to smooth the path to Fame
Noel said Thank you and was going to take the shilling
But Oswald who always remembers what he is told said  Thank you very much but Father told us we ought never to take anything from strangers
Thats a nasty one said the lady  she didnt talk a bit like a real lady but more like a jolly sort of grownup boy in a dress and hat  a very nasty one
But dont you think as Noel and I are both poets I might be considered a sort of relation
Youve heard of brother poets havent you
Dont you think NoEl and I are aunt and nephew poets or some relationship of that kind
I didnt know what to say and she went on  Its awfully straight of you to stick to what your Father tells you but look here you take the shillings and heres my card
When you get home tell your Father all about it and if he says No you can just bring the shillings back to me
So we took the shillings and she shook hands with us and said Goodbye and good hunting
We did tell Father about it and he said it was all right and when he looked at the card he told us we were highly honoured for the lady wrote better poetry than any other lady alive now
We had never heard of her and she seemed much too jolly for a poet
Good old Kipling
We owe him those two shillings as well as the jungle books
CHAPTER 5 THE POET AND THE EDITOR It was not bad sport  being in London entirely on our own hook
We asked the way to Fleet Street where Father says all the newspaper offices are
They said straight on down Ludgate Hill  but it turned out to be quite another way
At least we didnt go straight on
We got to St Pauls
Noel WOULD go in and we saw where Gordon was buried  at least the monument
It is very flat considering what a man he was
When we came out we walked a long way and when we asked a policeman he said wed better go back through Smithfield
So we did
They dont burn people any more there now so it was rather dull besides being a long way and Noel got very tired
Hes a peaky little chap it comes of being a poet I think
We had a bun or two at different shops  out of the shillings  and it was quite late in the afternoon when we got to Fleet Street
The gas was lighted and the electric lights
There is a jolly Bovril sign that comes off and on in different coloured lamps
We went to the Daily Recorder office and asked to see the Editor
It is a big office very bright with brass and mahogany and electric lights
They told us the Editor wasnt there but at another office
So we went down a dirty street to a very dulllooking place
There was a man there inside in a glass case as if he was a museum and he told us to write down our names and our business
So Oswald wrote  OSWALD BASTABLE
NOEL BASTABLE
Business very private indeed
Then we waited on the stone stairs it was very draughty
And the man in the glass case looked at us as if we were the museum instead of him
We waited a long time and then a boy came down and said  The Editor cant see you
Will you please write your business
And he laughed
I wanted to punch his head
But Noel said Yes Ill write it if youll give me a pen and ink and a sheet of paper and an envelope
The boy said hed better write by post
But Noel is a bit pigheaded its his worst fault
So he said  No Ill write it now
So I backed him up by saying  Look at the price penny stamps are since the coal strike
So the boy grinned and the man in the glass case gave us pen and paper and Noel wrote
Oswald writes better than he does but Noel would do it and it took a very long time and then it was inky
DEAR MR EDITOR I want you to print my poetry and pay for it and I am a friend of Mrs Leslies she is a poet too
Your affectionate friend NOEL BASTABLE
He licked the envelope a good deal so that that boy shouldnt read it going upstairs and he wrote Very private outside and gave the letter to the boy
I thought it wasnt any good but in a minute the grinning boy came back and he was quite respectful and said  The Editor says please will you step up
We stepped up
There were a lot of stairs and passages and a queer sort of humming hammering sound and a very funny smell
The boy was now very polite and said it was the ink we smelt and the noise was the printing machines
After going through a lot of cold passages we came to a door the boy opened it and let us go in
There was a large room with a big soft blueandred carpet and a roaring fire though it was only October and a large table with drawers and littered with papers just like the one in Fathers study
A gentleman was sitting at one side of the table he had a light moustache and light eyes and he looked very young to be an editor  not nearly so old as Father
He looked very tired and sleepy as if he had got up very early in the morning but he was kind and we liked him
Oswald thought he looked clever
Oswald is considered a judge of faces
Well said he so you are Mrs Leslies friends
I think so said Noel at least she gave us each a shilling and she wished us good hunting
Good hunting eh
Well what about this poetry of yours
Which is the poet
I cant think how he could have asked
Oswald is said to be a very manlylooking boy for his age
However I thought it would look duffing to be offended so I said  This is my brother Noel
He is the poet
Noel had turned quite pale
He is disgustingly like a girl in some ways
The Editor told us to sit down and he took the poems from Noel and began to read them
Noel got paler and paler I really thought he was going to faint like he did when I held his hand under the coldwater tap after I had accidentally cut him with my chisel
When the Editor had read the first poem  it was the one about the beetle  he got up and stood with his back to us
It was not manners but Noel thinks he did it to conceal his emotion as they do in books
He read all the poems and then he said  I like your poetry very much young man
Ill give you  let me see how much shall I give you for it
As much as ever you can said Noel
You see I want a good deal of money to restore the fallen fortunes of the house of Bastable
The gentleman put on some eyeglasses and looked hard at us
Then he sat down
Thats a good idea said he
Tell me how you came to think of it
And I say have you had any tea
Theyve just sent out for mine
He rang a tingly bell and the boy brought in a tray with a teapot and a thick cup and saucer and things and he had to fetch another tray for us when he was told to and we had tea with the Editor of the Daily Recorder
I suppose it was a very proud moment for Noel though I did not think of that till afterwards
The Editor asked us a lot of questions and we told him a good deal though of course I did not tell a stranger all our reasons for thinking that the family fortunes wanted restoring
We stayed about half an hour and when we were going away he said again  I shall print all your poems my poet and now what do you think theyre worth
I dont know Noel said
You see I didnt write them to sell
Why did you write them then
he asked
Noel said he didnt know he supposed because he wanted to
Art for Arts sake eh
said the Editor and he seemed quite delighted as though Noel had said something clever
Well would a guinea meet your views
he asked
I have read of people being at a loss for words and dumb with emotion and Ive read of people being turned to stone with astonishment or joy or something but I never knew how silly it looked till I saw Noel standing staring at the Editor with his mouth open
He went red and he went white and then he got crimson as if you were rubbing more and more crimson lake on a palette
But he didnt say a word so Oswald had to say  I should jolly well think so
So the Editor gave Noel a sovereign and a shilling and he shook hands with us both but he thumped Noel on the back and said  Buck up old man
Its your first guinea but it wont be your last
Now go along home and in about ten years you can bring me some more poetry
Not before  see
Im just taking this poetry of yours because I like it very much but we dont put poetry in this paper at all
I shall have to put it in another paper I know of
What do you put in your paper
I asked for Father always takes the Daily Chronicle and I didnt know what the Recorder was like
We chose it because it has such a glorious office and a clock outside lighted up
Oh news said he and dull articles and things about Celebrities
If you know any Celebrities now
Noel asked him what Celebrities were
Oh the Queen and the Princes and people with titles and people who write or sing or act  or do something clever or wicked
I dont know anybody wicked said Oswald wishing he had known Dick Turpin or Claude Duval so as to be able to tell the Editor things about them
But I know some one with a title  Lord Tottenham
The mad old Protectionist eh
How did you come to know him
We dont know him to speak to
But he goes over the Heath every day at three and he strides along like a giant  with a black cloak like Lord Tennysons flying behind him and he talks to himself like one oclock
What does he say
The Editor had sat down again and he was fiddling with a blue pencil
We only heard him once close enough to understand and then he said The curse of the country sir  ruin and desolation
And then he went striding along again hitting at the furzebushes as if they were the heads of his enemies
Excellent descriptive touch said the Editor
Well go on
Thats all I know about him except that he stops in the middle of the Heath every day and he looks all round to see if theres any one about and if there isnt he takes his collar off
The Editor interrupted  which is considered rude  and said  Youre not romancing
I beg your pardon
said Oswald
Drawing the long bow I mean said the Editor
Oswald drew himself up and said he wasnt a liar
The Editor only laughed and said romancing and lying were not at all the same only it was important to know what you were playing at
So Oswald accepted his apology and went on
We were hiding among the furzebushes one day and we saw him do it
He took off his collar and he put on a clean one and he threw the other among the furzebushes
We picked it up afterwards and it was a beastly paper one
Thank you said the Editor and he got up and put his hand in his pocket
Thats well worth five shillings and there they are
Would you like to see round the printing offices before you go home
I pocketed my five bob and thanked him and I said we should like it very much
He called another gentleman and said something we couldnt hear
Then he said goodbye again and all this time Noel hadnt said a word
But now he said Ive made a poem about you
It is called Lines to a Noble Editor
Shall I write it down
The Editor gave him the blue pencil and he sat down at the Editors table and wrote
It was this he told me afterwards as well as he could remember  May Lifes choicest blessings be your lot I think you ought to be very blest For you are going to print my poems  And you may have this one as well as the rest
Thank you said the Editor
I dont think I ever had a poem addressed to me before
I shall treasure it I assure you
Then the other gentleman said something about Maecenas and we went off to see the printing office with at least one pound seven in our pockets
It was good hunting and no mistake
But he never put Noels poetry in the Daily Recorder
It was quite a long time afterwards we saw a sort of story thing in a magazine on the station bookstall and that kind sleepylooking Editor had written it I suppose
It was not at all amusing
It said a lot about Noel and me describing us all wrong and saying how we had tea with the Editor and all Noels poems were in the story thing
I think myself the Editor seemed to make game of them but Noel was quite pleased to see them printed  so thats all right
It wasnt my poetry anyhow I am glad to say
CHAPTER 6 NOELS PRINCESS She happened quite accidentally
We were not looking for a Princess at all just then but Noel had said he was going to find a Princess all by himself and marry her  and he really did
Which was rather odd because when people say things are going to befall very often they dont
It was different of course with the prophets of old
We did not get any treasure by it except twelve chocolate drops but we might have done and it was an adventure anyhow
Greenwich Park is a jolly good place to play in especially the parts that arent near Greenwich
The parts near the Heath are firstrate
I often wish the Park was nearer our house but I suppose a Park is a difficult thing to move
Sometimes we get Eliza to put lunch in a basket and we go up to the Park
She likes that  it saves cooking dinner for us and sometimes she says of her own accord Ive made some pasties for you and you might as well go into the Park as not
Its a lovely day
She always tells us to rinse out the cup at the drinkingfountain and the girls do but I always put my head under the tap and drink
Then you are an intrepid hunter at a mountain stream  and besides youre sure its clean
Dicky does the same and so does H O
But Noel always drinks out of the cup
He says it is a golden goblet wrought by enchanted gnomes
The day the Princess happened was a fine hot day last October and we were quite tired with the walk up to the Park
We always go in by the little gate at the top of Crooms Hill
It is the postern gate that things always happen at in stories
It was dusty walking but when we got in the Park it was ripping so we rested a bit and lay on our backs and looked up at the trees and wished we could play monkeys
I have done it before now but the Parkkeeper makes a row if he catches you
When wed rested a little Alice said  It was a long way to the enchanted wood but it is very nice now we are there
I wonder what we shall find in it
We shall find deer said Dicky if we go to look but they go on the other side of the Park because of the people with buns
Saying buns made us think of lunch so we had it and when we had done we scratched a hole under a tree and buried the papers because we know it spoils pretty places to leave beastly greasy papers lying about
I remember Mother teaching me and Dora that when we were quite little
I wish everybodys parents would teach them this useful lesson and the same about orange peel
When wed eaten everything there was Alice whispered  I see the white witch bear yonder among the trees
Lets track it and slay it in its lair
I am the bear said NoEl so he crept away and we followed him among the trees
Often the witch bear was out of sight and then you didnt know where it would jump out from but sometimes we saw it and just followed
When we catch it therell be a great fight said Oswald and I shall be Count Folko of Mont Faucon
Ill be Gabrielle said Dora
She is the only one of us who likes doing girls parts
Ill be Sintram said Alice and H O can be the Little Master
What about Dicky
Oh I can be the Pilgrim with the bones
Hist
whispered Alice
See his white fairy fur gleaming amid yonder covert
And I saw a bit of white too
It was Noels collar and it had come undone at the back
We hunted the bear in and out of the trees and then we lost him altogether and suddenly we found the wall of the Park  in a place where Im sure there wasnt a wall before
Noel wasnt anywhere about and there was a door in the wall
And it was open so we went through
The bear has hidden himself in these mountain fastnesses Oswald said
I will draw my good sword and after him
So I drew the umbrella which Dora always will bring in case it rains because Noel gets a cold on the chest at the least thing  and we went on
The other side of the wall it was a stable yard all cobblestones
There was nobody about  but we could hear a man rubbing down a horse and hissing in the stable so we crept very quietly past and Alice whispered  Tis the lair of the Monster Serpent I hear his deadly hiss
Beware
Courage and despatch
We went over the stones on tiptoe and we found another wall with another door in it on the other side
We went through that too on tiptoe
It really was an adventure
And there we were in a shrubbery and we saw something white through the trees
Dora said it was the white bear
That is so like Dora
She always begins to take part in a play just when the rest of us are getting tired of it
I dont mean this unkindly because I am very fond of Dora
I cannot forget how kind she was when I had bronchitis and ingratitude is a dreadful vice
But it is quite true
It is not a bear said Oswald and we all went on still on tiptoe round a twisty path and on to a lawn and there was Noel
His collar had come undone as I said and he had an inky mark on his face that he made just before we left the house and he wouldnt let Dora wash it off and one of his bootlaces was coming down
He was standing looking at a little girl she was the funniest little girl you ever saw
She was like a china doll  the sixpenny kind she had a white face and long yellow hair done up very tight in two pigtails her forehead was very big and lumpy and her cheeks came high up like little shelves under her eyes
Her eyes were small and blue
She had on a funny black frock with curly braid on it and button boots that went almost up to her knees
Her legs were very thin
She was sitting in a hammock chair nursing a blue kitten  not a skyblue one of course but the colour of a new slate pencil
As we came up we heard her say to Noel  Who are you
Noel had forgotten about the bear and he was taking his favourite part so he said  Im Prince Camaralzaman
The funny little girl looked pleased
I thought at first you were a common boy she said
Then she saw the rest of us and said  Are you all Princesses and Princes too
Of course we said Yes and she said  I am a Princess also
She said it very well too exactly as if it were true
We were very glad because it is so seldom you meet any children who can begin to play right off without having everything explained to them
And even then they will say they are going to pretend to be a lion or a witch or a king
Now this little girl just said I am a Princess
Then she looked at Oswald and said I fancy Ive seen you at Baden
Of course Oswald said Very likely
The little girl had a funny voice and all her words were quite plain each word by itself she didnt talk at all like we do
H O asked her what the cats name was and she said Katinka
Then Dicky said  Lets get away from the windows if you play near windows some one inside generally knocks at them and says Dont
The Princess put down the cat very carefully and said  I am forbidden to walk off the grass
Thats a pity said Dora
But I will if you like said the Princess
You mustnt do things you are forbidden to do Dora said but Dicky showed us that there was some more grass beyond the shrubs with only a gravel path between
So I lifted the Princess over the gravel so that she should be able to say she hadnt walked off the grass
When we got to the other grass we all sat down and the Princess asked us if we liked dragees I know thats how you spell it for I asked Albertnextdoors uncle
We said we thought not but she pulled a real silver box out of her pocket and showed us they were just flat round chocolates
We had two each
Then we asked her her name and she began and when she began she went on and on and on till I thought she was never going to stop
H O said she had fifty names but Dicky is very good at figures and he says there were only eighteen
The first were Pauline Alexandra Alice and Mary was one and Victoria for we all heard that and it ended up with Hildegarde Cunigonde something or other Princess of something else
When shed done H O said Thats jolly good
Say it again
and she did but even then we couldnt remember it
We told her our names but she thought they were too short so when it was Noels turn he said he was Prince Noel Camaralzaman Ivan Constantine Charlemagne James John Edward Biggs Maximilian Bastable Prince of Lewisham but when she asked him to say it again of course he could only get the first two names right because hed made it up as he went on
So the Princess said You are quite old enough to know your own name
She was very grave and serious
She told us that she was the fifth cousin of Queen Victoria
We asked who the other cousins were but she did not seem to understand
She went on and said she was seven times removed
She couldnt tell us what that meant either but Oswald thinks it means that the Queens cousins are so fond of her that they will keep coming bothering so the Queens servants have orders to remove them
This little girl must have been very fond of the Queen to try so often to see her and to have been seven times removed
We could see that it is considered something to be proud of but we thought it was hard on the Queen that her cousins wouldnt let her alone
Presently the little girl asked us where our maids and governesses were
We told her we hadnt any just now
And she said  How pleasant
And did you come here alone
Yes said Dora we came across the Heath
You are very fortunate said the little girl
She sat very upright on the grass with her fat little hands in her lap
I should like to go on the Heath
There are donkeys there with white saddle covers
I should like to ride them but my governess will not permit
Im glad we havent a governess H O said
We ride the donkeys whenever we have any pennies and once I gave the man another penny to make it gallop
You are indeed fortunate
said the Princess again and when she looked sad the shelves on her cheeks showed more than ever
You could have laid a sixpence on them quite safely if you had had one
Never mind said Noel Ive got a lot of money
Come out and have a ride now
But the little girl shook her head and said she was afraid it would not be correct
Dora said she was quite right then all of a sudden came one of those uncomfortable times when nobody can think of anything to say so we sat and looked at each other
But at last Alice said we ought to be going
Do not go yet the little girl said
At what time did they order your carriage
Our carriage is a fairy one drawn by griffins and it comes when we wish for it said Noel
The little girl looked at him very queerly and said That is out of a picturebook
Then Noel said he thought it was about time he was married if we were to be home in time for tea
The little girl was rather stupid over it but she did what we told her and we married them with Doras pockethandkerchief for a veil and the ring off the back of one of the buttons on H
O
s blouse just went on her little finger
Then we showed her how to play crosstouch and puss in the corner and tag
It was funny she didnt know any games but battledore and shuttlecock and les graces
But she really began to laugh at last and not to look quite so like a doll
She was Puss and was running after Dicky when suddenly she stopped short and looked as if she was going to cry
And we looked too and there were two prim ladies with little mouths and tight hair
One of them said in quite an awful voice Pauline who are these children
and her voice was gruff with very curly Rs
The little girl said we were Princes and Princesses  which was silly to a grownup person that is not a great friend of yours
The gruff lady gave a short horrid laugh like a husky bark and said  Princes indeed
Theyre only common children
Dora turned very red and began to speak but the little girl cried out Common children
Oh I am so glad
When I am grown up Ill always play with common children
And she ran at us and began to kiss us one by one beginning with Alice she had got to H O when the horrid lady said  Your Highness  go indoors at once
The little girl answered I wont
Then the prim lady said  Wilson carry her Highness indoors
And the little girl was carried away screaming and kicking with her little thin legs and her buttoned boots and between her screams she shrieked Common children
I am glad glad glad
Common children
Common children
The nasty lady then remarked  Go at once or I will send for the police
So we went
H O made a face at her and so did Alice but Oswald took off his cap and said he was sorry if she was annoyed about anything for Oswald has always been taught to be polite to ladies however nasty
Dicky took his off too when he saw me do it he says he did it first but that is a mistake
If I were really a common boy I should say it was a lie
Then we all came away and when we got outside Dora said So she was really a Princess
Fancy a Princess living there
Even Princesses have to live somewhere said Dicky
And I thought it was play
And it was real
I wish Id known
I should have liked to ask her lots of things said Alice
H O said he would have liked to ask her what she had for dinner and whether she had a crown
I felt myself we had lost a chance of finding out a great deal about kings and queens
I might have known such a stupidlooking little girl would never have been able to pretend as well as that
So we all went home across the Heath and made dripping toast for tea
When we were eating it Noel said I wish I could give her some
It is very good
He sighed as he said it and his mouth was very full so we knew he was thinking of his Princess
He says now that she was as beautiful as the day but we remember her quite well and she was nothing of the kind
CHAPTER 7 BEING BANDITS Noel was quite tiresome for ever so long after we found the Princess
He would keep on wanting to go to the Park when the rest of us didnt and though we went several times to please him we never found that door open again and all of us except him knew from the first that it would be no go
So now we thought it was time to do something to rouse him from the stupor of despair which is always done to heroes when anything baffling has occurred
Besides we were getting very short of money again  the fortunes of your house cannot be restored not so that they will last that is even by the one pound eight we got when we had the good hunting
We spent a good deal of that on presents for Fathers birthday
We got him a paperweight like a glass bun with a picture of Lewisham Church at the bottom and a blottingpad and a box of preserved fruits and an ivory penholder with a view of Greenwich Park in the little hole where you look through at the top
He was most awfully pleased and surprised and when he heard how Noel and Oswald had earned the money to buy the things he was more surprised still
Nearly all the rest of our money went to get fireworks for the Fifth of November
We got six Catherine wheels and four rockets two handlights one red and one green a sixpenny maroon two Romancandles  they cost a shilling some Italian streamers a fairy fountain and a tourbillon that cost eighteenpence and was very nearly worth it
But I think crackers and squibs are a mistake
Its true you get a lot of them for the money and they are not bad fun for the first two or three dozen but you get jolly sick of them before youve let off your sixpennorth
And the only amusing way is not allowed it is putting them in the fire
It always seems a long time till the evening when you have got fireworks in the house and I think as it was a rather foggy day we should have decided to let them off directly after breakfast only Father had said he would help us to let them off at eight oclock after he had had his dinner and you ought never to disappoint your father if you can help it
You see we had three good reasons for trying H
O
s idea of restoring the fallen fortunes of our house by becoming bandits on the Fifth of November
We had a fourth reason as well and that was the best reason of the lot
You remember Dora thought it would be wrong to be bandits
And the Fifth of November came while Dora was away at Stroud staying with her godmother
Stroud is in Gloucestershire
We were determined to do it while she was out of the way because we did not think it wrong and besides we meant to do it anyhow
We held a Council of course and laid our plans very carefully
We let H O be Captain because it was his idea
Oswald was Lieutenant
Oswald was quite fair because he let H O call himself Captain but Oswald is the eldest next to Dora after all
Our plan was this
We were all to go up on to the Heath
Our house is in the Lewisham Road but its quite close to the Heath if you cut up the short way opposite the confectioners past the nursery gardens and the cottage hospital and turn to the left again and afterwards to the right
You come out then at the top of the hill where the big guns are with the iron fence round them and where the bands play on Thursday evenings in the summer
We were to lurk in ambush there and waylay an unwary traveller
We were to call upon him to surrender his arms and then bring him home and put him in the deepest dungeon below the castle moat then we were to load him with chains and send to his friends for ransom
You may think we had no chains but you are wrong because we used to keep two other dogs once besides Pincher before the fall of the fortunes of the ancient House of Bastable
And they were quite big dogs
It was latish in the afternoon before we started
We thought we could lurk better if it was nearly dark
It was rather foggy and we waited a good while beside the railings but all the belated travellers were either grown up or else they were Board School children
We werent going to get into a row with grownup people  especially strangers  and no true bandit would ever stoop to ask a ransom from the relations of the poor and needy
So we thought it better to wait
As I said it was Guy Fawkes Day and if it had not been we should never have been able to be bandits at all for the unwary traveller we did catch had been forbidden to go out because he had a cold in his head
But he would run out to follow a guy without even putting on a coat or a comforter and it was a very damp foggy afternoon and nearly dark so you see it was his own fault entirely and served him jolly well right
We saw him coming over the Heath just as we were deciding to go home to tea
He had followed that guy right across to the village we call Blackheath the village I dont know why and he was coming back dragging his feet and sniffing
Hist an unwary traveller approaches
whispered Oswald
Muffle your horses heads and see to the priming of your pistols muttered Alice
She always will play boys parts and she makes Ellis cut her hair short on purpose
Ellis is a very obliging hairdresser
Steal softly upon him said Noel for lo
tis dusk and no human eyes can mark our deeds
So we ran out and surrounded the unwary traveller
it turned out to be Albertnextdoor and he was very frightened indeed until he saw who we were
Surrender
hissed Oswald in a desperatesounding voice as he caught the arm of the Unwary
And Albertnextdoor said All right
Im surrendering as hard as I can
You neednt pull my arm off
We explained to him that resistance was useless and I think he saw that from the first
We held him tight by both arms and we marched him home down the hill in a hollow square of five
He wanted to tell us about the guy but we made him see that it was not proper for prisoners to talk to the guard especially about guys that the prisoner had been told not to go after because of his cold
When we got to where we live he said All right I dont want to tell you
Youll wish I had afterwards
You never saw such a guy
I can see you
said H O
It was very rude and Oswald told him so at once because it is his duty as an elder brother
But H O is very young and does not know better yet and besides it wasnt bad for H O Albertnextdoor said You havent any manners and I want to go in to my tea
Let go of me
But Alice told him quite kindly that he was not going in to his tea but coming with us
Im not said Albertnextdoor Im going home
Leave go
Ive got a bad cold
Youre making it worse
Then he tried to cough which was very silly because wed seen him in the morning and hed told us where the cold was that he wasnt to go out with
When he had tried to cough he said Leave go of me
You see my colds getting worse
You should have thought of that before said Dicky youre coming in with us
Dont be a silly said Noel you know we told you at the very beginning that resistance was useless
There is no disgrace in yielding
We are five to your one
By this time Eliza had opened the door and we thought it best to take him in without any more parlaying
To parley with a prisoner is not done by bandits
Directly we got him safe into the nursery H O began to jump about and say Now youre a prisoner really and truly
And Albertnextdoor began to cry
He always does
I wonder he didnt begin long before  but Alice fetched him one of the dried fruits we gave Father for his birthday
It was a green walnut
I have noticed the walnuts and the plums always get left till the last in the box the apricots go first and then the figs and pears and the cherries if there are any
So he ate it and shut up
Then we explained his position to him so that there should be no mistake and he couldnt say afterwards that he had not understood
There will be no violence said Oswald  he was now Captain of the Bandits because we all know H O likes to be Chaplain when we play prisoners  no violence
But you will be confined in a dark subterranean dungeon where toads and snakes crawl and but little of the light of day filters through the heavily mullioned windows
You will be loaded with chains
Now dont begin again Baby theres nothing to cry about straw will be your pallet beside you the gaoler will set a ewer  a ewer is only a jug stupid it wont eat you  a ewer with water and a mouldering crust will be your food
But Albertnextdoor never enters into the spirit of a thing
He mumbled something about teatime
Now Oswald though stern is always just and besides we were all rather hungry and tea was ready
So we had it at once Albertnextdoor and all  and we gave him what was left of the fourpound jar of apricot jam we got with the money Noel got for his poetry
And we saved our crusts for the prisoner
Albertnextdoor was very tiresome
Nobody could have had a nicer prison than he had
We fenced him into a corner with the old wire nursery fender and all the chairs instead of putting him in the coalcellar as we had first intended
And when he said the dogchains were cold the girls were kind enough to warm his fetters thoroughly at the fire before we put them on him
We got the straw cases of some bottles of wine someone sent Father one Christmas  it is some years ago but the cases are quite good
We unpicked them very carefully and pulled them to pieces and scattered the straw about
It made a lovely straw pallet and took ever so long to make  but Albertnextdoor has yet to learn what gratitude really is
We got the bread trencher for the wooden platter where the prisoners crusts were put  they were not mouldy but we could not wait till they got so and for the ewer we got the toilet jug out of the spareroom where nobody ever sleeps
And even then Albertnextdoor couldnt be happy like the rest of us
He howled and cried and tried to get out and he knocked the ewer over and stamped on the mouldering crusts
Luckily there was no water in the ewer because we had forgotten it only dust and spiders
So we tied him up with the clothesline from the back kitchen and we had to hurry up which was a pity for him
We might have had him rescued by a devoted page if he hadnt been so tiresome
In fact Noel was actually dressing up for the page when Albertnextdoor kicked over the prison ewer
We got a sheet of paper out of an old exercisebook and we made H O prick his own thumb because he is our little brother and it is our duty to teach him to be brave
We none of us mind pricking ourselves weve done it heaps of times
H O didnt like it but he agreed to do it and I helped him a little because he was so slow and when he saw the red bead of blood getting fatter and bigger as I squeezed his thumb he was very pleased just as I had told him he would be
This is what we wrote with H
O
s blood only the blood gave out when we got to Restored and we had to write the rest with crimson lake which is not the same colour though I always use it myself for painting wounds
While Oswald was writing it he heard Alice whispering to the prisoner that it would soon be over and it was only play
The prisoner left off howling so I pretended not to hear what she said
A Bandit Captain has to overlook things sometimes
This was the letter  Albert Morrison is held a prisoner by Bandits
On payment of three thousand pounds he will be restored to his sorrowing relatives and all will be forgotten and forgiven
I was not sure about the last part but Dicky was certain he had seen it in the paper so I suppose it must have been all right
We let H O take the letter it was only fair as it was his blood it was written with and told him to leave it next door for Mrs Morrison
H O came back quite quickly and Albertnextdoors uncle came with him
What is all this Albert
he cried
Alas alas my nephew
Do I find you the prisoner of a desperate band of brigands
Bandits said H O you know it says bandits
I beg your pardon gentlemen said Albertnextdoors uncle bandits it is of course
This Albert is the direct result of the pursuit of the guy on an occasion when your doting mother had expressly warned you to forgo the pleasures of the chase
Albert said it wasnt his fault and he hadnt wanted to play
So ho
said his uncle impenitent too
Wheres the dungeon
We explained the dungeon and showed him the straw pallet and the ewer and the mouldering crusts and other things
Very pretty and complete he said
Albert you are more highly privileged than ever I was
No one ever made me a nice dungeon when I was your age
I think I had better leave you where you are
Albert began to cry again and said he was sorry and he would be a good boy
And on this old familiar basis you expect me to ransom you do you
Honestly my nephew I doubt whether you are worth it
Besides the sum mentioned in this document strikes me as excessive Albert really is not worth three thousand pounds
Also by a strange and unfortunate chance I havent the money about me
Couldnt you take less
We said perhaps we could
Say eightpence suggested Albertnextdoors uncle which is all the small change I happen to have on my person
Thank you very much said Alice as he held it out but are you sure you can spare it
Because really it was only play
Quite sure
Now Albert the game is over
You had better run home to your mother and tell her how much youve enjoyed yourself
When Albertnextdoor had gone his uncle sat in the Guy Fawkes armchair and took Alice on his knee and we sat round the fire waiting till it would be time to let off our fireworks
We roasted the chestnuts he sent Dicky out for and he told us stories till it was nearly seven
His stories are firstrate  he does all the parts in different voices
At last he said  Look here younguns
I like to see you play and enjoy yourselves and I dont think it hurts Albert to enjoy himself too
I dont think he did much said H O
But I knew what Albertnextdoors uncle meant because I am much older than H O
He went on  But what about Alberts mother
Didnt you think how anxious she would be at his not coming home
As it happens I saw him come in with you so we knew it was all right
But if I hadnt eh
He only talks like that when he is very serious or even angry
Other times he talks like people in books  to us I mean
We none of us said anything
But I was thinking
Then Alice spoke
Girls seem not to mind saying things that we dont say
She put her arms round Albertnextdoors uncles neck and said  Were very very sorry
We didnt think about his mother
You see we try very hard not to think about other peoples mothers because  Just then we heard Fathers key in the door and Albertnextdoors uncle kissed Alice and put her down and we all went down to meet Father
As we went I thought I heard Albertnextdoors uncle say something that sounded like Poor little beggars
He couldnt have meant us when wed been having such a jolly time and chestnuts and fireworks to look forward to after dinner and everything
CHAPTER 8 BEING EDITORS It was Alberts uncle who thought of our trying a newspaper
He said he thought we should not find the bandit business a paying industry as a permanency and that journalism might be
We had sold Noels poetry and that piece of information about Lord Tottenham to the good editor so we thought it would not be a bad idea to have a newspaper of our own
We saw plainly that editors must be very rich and powerful because of the grand office and the man in the glass case like a museum and the soft carpets and big writingtable
Besides our having seen a whole handful of money that the editor pulled out quite carelessly from his trousers pocket when he gave me my five bob
Dora wanted to be editor and so did Oswald but he gave way to her because she is a girl and afterwards he knew that it is true what it says in the copybooks about Virtue being its own Reward
Because youve no idea what a bother it is
Everybody wanted to put in everything just as they liked no matter how much room there was on the page
It was simply awful
Dora put up with it as long as she could and then she said if she wasnt let alone she wouldnt go on being editor they could be the papers editors themselves so there
Then Oswald said like a good brother I will help you if you like Dora and she said Youre more trouble than all the rest of them
Come and be editor and see how you like it
I give it up to you
But she didnt and we did it together
We let Albertnextdoor be subeditor because he had hurt his foot with a nail in his boot that gathered
When it was done Albertnextdoors uncle had it copied for us in typewriting and we sent copies to all our friends and then of course there was no one left that we could ask to buy it
We did not think of that until too late
We called the paper the Lewisham Recorder Lewisham because we live there and Recorder in memory of the good editor
I could write a better paper on my head but an editor is not allowed to write all the paper
It is very hard but he is not
You just have to fill up with what you can get from other writers
If I ever have time I will write a paper all by myself
It wont be patchy
We had no time to make it an illustrated paper but I drew the ship going down with all hands for the first copy
But the typewriter cant draw ships so it was left out in the other copies
The time the first paper took to write out no one would believe
This was the Newspaper EDITORS DORA AND OSWALD BASTABLE Editorial Note Every paper is written for some reason
Ours is because we want to sell it and get money
If what we have written brings happiness to any sad heart we shall not have laboured in vain
But we want the money too
Many papers are content with the sad heart and the happiness but we are not like that and it is best not to be deceitful
EDITORS
There will be two serial stories One by Dicky and one by all of us
In a serial story you only put in one chapter at a time
But we shall put all our serial story at once if Dora has time to copy it
Dickys will come later on
Serial Story BY US ALL CHAPTER I  by Dora The sun was setting behind a romanticlooking tower when two strangers might have been observed descending the crest of the hill
The eldest a man in the prime of life the other a handsome youth who reminded everybody of Quentin Durward
They approached the Castle in which the fair Lady Alicia awaited her deliverers
She leaned from the castellated window and waved her lily hand as they approached
They returned her signal and retired to seek rest and refreshment at a neighbouring hostelry
CHAPTER II  by Alice The Princess was very uncomfortable in the tower because her fairy godmother had told her all sorts of horrid things would happen if she didnt catch a mouse every day and she had caught so many mice that now there were hardly any left to catch
So she sent her carrier pigeon to ask the noble Strangers if they could send her a few mice  because she would be of age in a few days and then it wouldnt matter
So the fairy godmother  Im very sorry but theres no room to make the chapters any longer
ED
CHAPTER III  by the SubEditor I cant  Id much rather not  I dont know how
CHAPTER IV  by Dicky I must now retrace my steps and tell you something about our hero
You must know he had been to an awfully jolly school where they had turkey and goose every day for dinner and never any mutton and as many helps of pudding as a fellow cared to send up his plate for  so of course they had all grown up very strong and before he left school he challenged the Head to have it out man to man and he gave it him I tell you
That was the education that made him able to fight Red Indians and to be the stranger who might have been observed in the first chapter
CHAPTER V  by Noel I think its time something happened in this story
So then the dragon he came out blowing fire out of his nose and he said  Come on you valiant man and true Id like to have a setto along of you
Thats bad English
ED
I dont care its what the dragon said
Who told you dragons didnt talk bad English
NOEL
So the hero whose name was Noeloninuris replied  My blade is sharp my axe is keen Youre not nearly as big as a good many dragons Ive seen
Dont put in so much poetry Noel
Its not fair because none of the others can do it
ED
And then they went at it and he beat the dragon just as he did the Head in Dickys part of the Story and so he married the Princess and they lived  No they didnt  not till the last chapter
ED
CHAPTER VI  by H O I think its a very nice Story  but what about the mice
I dont want to say any more
Dora can have whats left of my chapter
CHAPTER VII  by the Editors And so when the dragon was dead there were lots of mice because he used to kill them for his tea but now they rapidly multiplied and ravaged the country so the fair lady Alicia sometimes called the Princess had to say she would not marry any one unless they could rid the country of this plague of mice
Then the Prince whose real name didnt begin with N but was Osrawalddo waved his magic sword and the dragon stood before them bowing gracefully
They made him promise to be good and then they forgave him and when the wedding breakfast came all the bones were saved for him
And so they were married and lived happy ever after
What became of the other stranger
NOEL
The dragon ate him because he asked too many questions

A dreadful warning
A wicked boy told me a very instructive thing about ginger
They had opened one of the large jars and he happened to take out quite a lot and he made it all right by dropping marbles in till there was as much ginger as before
But he told me that on the Sunday when it was coming near the part where there is only juice generally I had no idea what his feelings were
I dont see what he could have said when they asked him
I should be sorry to act like it

Nobody shall learn anything they dont want to
And sometimes instead of having masters and mistresses we will have cats and we will dress up in cat skins and learn purring

She wont teach us to mew but we shall know how without teaching
Children do know some things without being taught

Sam Redfern or the Bush rangers Burial BY DICKY Well Annie I have bad news for you said Mr Ridgway as he entered the comfortable diningroom of his cabin in the Bush
Sam Redfern the Bushranger is about this part of the Bush just now
I hope he will not attack us with his gang
I hope not responded Annie a gentle maiden of some sixteen summers
just then came a knock at the door of the hut and a gruff voice asked them to open the door
It is Sam Redfern the Bushranger father said the girl
The same responded the voice and the next moment the hall door was smashed in and Sam Redfern sprang in followed by his gang
CHAPTER II Annies Father was at once overpowered and Annie herself lay bound with cords on the drawingroom sofa
Sam Redfern set a guard round the lonely hut and all human aid was despaired of
But you never know
Far away in the Bush a different scene was being enacted
Must be Injuns said a tall man to himself as he pushed his way through the brushwood
It was Jim Carlton the celebrated detective
I know them he added they are Apaches
just then ten Indians in full warpaint appeared
Carlton raised his rifle and fired and slinging their scalps on his arm he hastened towards the humble log hut where resided his affianced bride Annie Ridgway sometimes known as the Flower of the Bush
CHAPTER III The moon was low on the horizon and Sam Redfern was seated at a drinking bout with some of his boon companions
They had rifled the cellars of the hut and the rich wines flowed like water in the golden goblets of Mr Ridgway
But Annie had made friends with one of the gang a noble goodhearted man who had joined Sam Redfern by mistake and she had told him to go and get the police as quickly as possible
Ha
ha
cried Redfern now I am enjoying myself
He little knew that his doom was near upon him
Just then Annie gave a piercing scream and Sam Redfern got up seizing his revolver
Who are you
he cried as a man entered
I am Jim Carlton the celebrated detective said the new arrival
Sam Redferns revolver dropped from his nerveless fingers but the next moment he had sprung upon the detective with the wellknown activity of the mountain sheep and Annie shrieked for she had grown to love the rough Bushranger

Peppermint is a great help with arithmetic
The boy who was second in the Oxford Local always did it
He gave me two
The examiner said to him Are you eating peppermints
And he said No Sir
He told me afterwards it was quite true because he was only sucking one
Im glad I wasnt asked
I should never have thought of that and I could have had to say Yes
OSWALD
The Wreck of the Malabar BY NOEL Author of A Dream of Ancient Ancestors
He isnt really  but he put it in to make it seem more real
Hark
what is that noise of rolling Waves and thunder in the air
Tis the deathknell of the sailors And officers and passengers of the good ship Malabar
It was a fair and lovely noon When the good ship put out of port And people said ah little we think How soon she will be the elements sport
She was indeed a lovely sight Upon the billows with sails spread
But the captain folded his gloomy arms Ah  if she had been a lifeboat instead
See the captain stern yet gloomy Flings his son upon a rock Hoping that there his darling boy May escape the wreck
Alas in vain the loud winds roared And nobody was saved
That was the wreck of the Malabar Then let us toll for the brave
NOEL
Gardening Notes It is useless to plant cherrystones in the hope of eating the fruit because they dont
Alice wont lend her gardening tools again because the last time Noel left them out in the rain and I dont like it
He said he didnt
Seeds and Bulbs These are useful to play at shop with until you are ready
Not at dinnerparties for they will not grow unless uncooked
Potatoes are not grown with seed but with choppedup potatoes
Apple trees are grown from twigs which is less wasteful
Oak trees come from acorns
Every one knows this
When Noel says he could grow one from a peach stone wrapped up in oak leaves he shows that he knows nothing about gardening but marigolds and when I passed by his garden I thought they seemed just like weeds now the flowers have been picked
A boy once dared me to eat a bulb
Dogs are very industrious and fond of gardening
Pincher is always planting bones but they never grow up
There couldnt be a bone tree
I think this is what makes him bark so unhappily at night
He has never tried planting dogbiscuit but he is fonder of bones and perhaps he wants to be quite sure about them first
Sam Redfern or the Bushrangers Burial BY DICKY CHAPTER IV AND LAST This would have been a jolly good story if they had let me finish it at the beginning of the paper as I wanted to
But now I have forgotten how I meant it to end and I have lost my book about Red Indians and all my Boys of England have been sneaked
The girls say Good riddance
so I expect they did it
They want me just to put in which Annie married but I shant so they will never know
We have now put everything we can think of into the paper
It takes a lot of thinking about
I dont know how grownups manage to write all they do
It must make their heads ache especially lesson books
Albertnextdoor only wrote one chapter of the serial story but he could have done some more if he had wanted to
He could not write out any of the things because he cannot spell
He says he can but it takes him such a long time he might just as well not be able
There are one or two things more
I am sick of it but Dora says she will write them in
Legal answer wanted
A quantity of excellent string is offered if you know whether there really is a law passed about not buying gunpowder under thirteen
DICKY
The price of this paper is one shilling each and sixpence extra for the picture of the Malabar going down with all hands
If we sell one hundred copies we will write another paper
And so we would have done but we never did
Albertnextdoors uncle gave us two shillings that was all
You cant restore fallen fortunes with two shillings
CHAPTER 9 THE G B
Being editors is not the best way to wealth
We all feel this now and highwaymen are not respected any more like they used to be
I am sure we had tried our best to restore our fallen fortunes
We felt their fall very much because we knew the Bastables had been rich once
Dora and Oswald can remember when Father was always bringing nice things home from London and there used to be turkeys and geese and wine and cigars come by the carrier at Christmastime and boxes of candied fruit and French plums in ornamental boxes with silk and velvet and gilding on them
They were called prunes but the prunes you buy at the grocers are quite different
But now there is seldom anything nice brought from London and the turkey and the prune people have forgotten Fathers address
How can we restore those beastly fallen fortunes
said Oswald
Weve tried digging and writing and princesses and being editors
And being bandits said H O
When did you try that
asked Dora quickly
You know I told you it was wrong
It wasnt wrong the way we did it said Alice quicker still before Oswald could say Who asked you to tell us anything about it
which would have been rude and he is glad he didnt
We only caught Albertnextdoor
Oh Albertnextdoor
said Dora contemptuously and I felt more comfortable for even after I didnt say Who asked you and cetera I was afraid Dora was going to come the good elder sister over us
She does that a jolly sight too often
Dicky looked up from the paper he was reading and said This sounds likely and he read out  l100 secures partnership in lucrative business for sale of useful patent
l10 weekly
No personal attendance necessary
Jobbins 300 Old Street Road
I wish we could secure that partnership said Oswald
He is twelve and a very thoughtful boy for his age
Alice looked up from her painting
She was trying to paint a fairy queens frock with green bice and it wouldnt rub
There is something funny about green bice
It never will rub off no matter how expensive your paintbox is  and even boiling water is very little use
She said Bother the bice
And Oswald its no use thinking about that
Where are we to get a hundred pounds
Ten pounds a week is five pounds to us Oswald went on  he had done the sum in his head while Alice was talking  because partnership means halves
It would be l5
Noel sat sucking his pencil  he had been writing poetry as usual
I saw the first two lines  I wonder why Green Bice Is never very nice
Suddenly he said I wish a fairy would come down the chimney and drop a jewel on the table  a jewel worth just a hundred pounds
She might as well give you the hundred pounds while she was about it said Dora
Or while she was about it she might as well give us five pounds a week said Alice
Or fifty said I
Or five hundred said Dicky
I saw H O open his mouth and I knew he was going to say Or five thousand so I said Well she wont give us fivepence but if youd only do as I am always saying and rescue a wealthy old gentleman from deadly peril he would give us a pot of money and we could have the partnership and five pounds a week
Five pounds a week would buy a great many things
Then Dicky said Why shouldnt we borrow it
So we said Who from
and then he read this out of the paper  MONEY PRIVATELY WITHOUT FEEs THE BOND STREET BANK Manager Z Rosenbaum
Advances cash from l20 to l10000 on ladies or gentlemens note of hand alone without security
No fees
No inquiries
Absolute privacy guaranteed
What does it all mean
asked H O
It means that there is a kind gentleman who has a lot of money and he doesnt know enough poor people to help so he puts it in the paper that he will help them by lending them his money  thats it isnt it Dicky
Dora explained this and Dicky said Yes
And H O said he was a Generous Benefactor like in Miss Edgeworth
Then Noel wanted to know what a note of hand was and Dicky knew that because he had read it in a book and it was just a letter saying you will pay the money when you can and signed with your name
No inquiries
said Alice
Oh  Dicky  do you think he would
Yes I think so said Dicky
I wonder Father doesnt go to this kind gentleman
Ive seen his name before on a circular in Fathers study
Perhaps he has
said Dora
But the rest of us were sure he hadnt because of course if he had there would have been more money to buy nice things
just then Pincher jumped up and knocked over the paintingwater
He is a very careless dog
I wonder why paintingwater is always such an ugly colour
Dora ran for a duster to wipe it up and H O dropped drops of the water on his hands and said he had got the plague
So we played at the plague for a bit and I was an Arab physician with a bathtowel turban and cured the plague with magic aciddrops
After that it was time for dinner and after dinner we talked it all over and settled that we would go and see the Generous Benefactor the very next day
But we thought perhaps the G B
 it is short for Generous Benefactor  would not like it if there were so many of us
I have often noticed that it is the worst of our being six  people think six a great many when its children
That sentence looks wrong somehow
I mean they dont mind six pairs of boots or six pounds of apples or six oranges especially in equations but they seem to think you ought not to have five brothers and sisters
Of course Dicky was to go because it was his idea
Dora had to go to Blackheath to see an old lady a friend of Fathers so she couldnt go
Alice said she ought to go because it said Ladies and gentlemen and perhaps the G B wouldnt let us have the money unless there were both kinds of us
H O said Alice wasnt a lady and she said he wasnt going anyway
Then he called her a disagreeable cat and she began to cry
But Oswald always tries to make up quarrels so he said  Youre little sillies both of you
And Dora said Dont cry Alice he only meant you werent a grownup lady
Then H O said What else did you think I meant Disagreeable
So Dicky said Dont be disagreeable yourself H O
Let her alone and say youre sorry or Ill jolly well make you
So H O said he was sorry
Then Alice kissed him and said she was sorry too and after that H O gave her a hug and said Now Im really and truly sorry So it was all right
Noel went the last time any of us went to London so he was out of it and Dora said she would take him to Blackheath if wed take H O
So as thered been a little disagreeableness we thought it was better to take him and we did
At first we thought wed tear our oldest things a bit more and put some patches of different colours on them to show the G B how much we wanted money
But Dora said that would be a sort of cheating pretending we were poorer than we are
And Dora is right sometimes though she is our elder sister
Then we thought wed better wear our best things so that the G B might see we werent so very poor that he couldnt trust us to pay his money back when we had it
But Dora said that would be wrong too
So it came to our being quite honest as Dora said and going just as we were without even washing our faces and hands but when I looked at H O in the train I wished we had not been quite so particularly honest
Every one who reads this knows what it is like to go in the train so I shall not tell about it  though it was rather fun especially the part where the guard came for the tickets at Waterloo and H O was under the seat and pretended to be a dog without a ticket
We went to Charing Cross and we just went round to Whitehall to see the soldiers and then by St Jamess for the same reason  and when wed looked in the shops a bit we got to Brook Street Bond Street
It was a brass plate on a door next to a shop  a very grand place where they sold bonnets and hats  all very bright and smart and no tickets on them to tell you the price
We rang a bell and a boy opened the door and we asked for Mr Rosenbaum
The boy was not polite he did not ask us in
So then Dicky gave him his visiting card it was one of Fathers really but the name is the same Mr Richard Bastable and we others wrote our names underneath
I happened to have a piece of pink chalk in my pocket and we wrote them with that
Then the boy shut the door in our faces and we waited on the step
But presently he came down and asked our business
So Dicky said  Money advanced young shaver
and dont be all day about it
And then he made us wait again till I was quite stiff in my legs but Alice liked it because of looking at the hats and bonnets and at last the door opened and the boy said  Mr Rosenbaum will see you so we wiped our feet on the mat which said so and we went up stairs with soft carpets and into a room
It was a beautiful room
I wished then we had put on our best things or at least washed a little
But it was too late now
The room had velvet curtains and a soft soft carpet and it was full of the most splendid things
Black and gold cabinets and china and statues and pictures
There was a picture of a cabbage and a pheasant and a dead hare that was just like life and I would have given worlds to have it for my own
The fur was so natural I should never have been tired of looking at it but Alice liked the one of the girl with the broken jug best
Then besides the pictures there were clocks and candlesticks and vases and gilt lookingglasses and boxes of cigars and scent and things littered all over the chairs and tables
It was a wonderful place and in the middle of all the splendour was a little old gentleman with a very long black coat and a very long white beard and a hookey nose  like a falcon
And he put on a pair of gold spectacles and looked at us as if he knew exactly how much our clothes were worth
And then while we elder ones were thinking how to begin for we had all said Good morning as we came in of course H O began before we could stop him
He said Are you the G
B
The what
said the little old gentleman
The G B said H O and I winked at him to shut up but he didnt see me and the G B did
He waved his hand at me to shut up so I had to and H O went on  It stands for Generous Benefactor
The old gentleman frowned
Then he said Your Father sent you here I suppose
No he didnt said Dicky
Why did you think so
The old gentleman held out the card and I explained that we took that because Fathers name happens to be the same as Dickys
Doesnt he know youve come
No said Alice we shant tell him till weve got the partnership because his own business worries him a good deal and we dont want to bother him with ours till its settled and then we shall give him half our share
The old gentleman took off his spectacles and rumpled his hair with his hands then he said Then what did you come for
We saw your advertisement Dicky said and we want a hundred pounds on our note of hand and my sister came so that there should be both kinds of us and we want it to buy a partnership with in the lucrative business for sale of useful patent
No personal attendance necessary
I dont think I quite follow you said the G B
But one thing I should like settled before entering more fully into the matter why did you call me Generous Benefactor
Well you see said Alice smiling at him to show she wasnt frightened though I know really she was awfully we thought it was so very kind of you to try to find out the poor people who want money and to help them and lend them your money
Hum
said the G B
Sit down
He cleared the clocks and vases and candlesticks off some of the chairs and we sat down
The chairs were velvety with gilt legs
It was like a kings palace
Now he said you ought to be at school instead of thinking about money
Why arent you
We told him that we should go to school again when Father could manage it but meantime we wanted to do something to restore the fallen fortunes of the House of Bastable
And we said we thought the lucrative patent would be a very good thing
He asked a lot of questions and we told him everything we didnt think Father would mind our telling and at last he said  You wish to borrow money
When will you repay it
As soon as weve got it of course Dicky said
Then the G B said to Oswald You seem the eldest but I explained to him that it was Dickys idea so my being eldest didnt matter
Then he said to Dicky  You are a minor I presume
Dicky said he wasnt yet but he had thought of being a mining engineer some day and going to Klondike
Minor not miner said the G B
I mean youre not of age
I shall be in ten years though said Dicky
Then you might repudiate the loan said the G B and Dicky said What
Of course he ought to have said I beg your pardon
I didnt quite catch what you said  that is what Oswald would have said
It is more polite than What
Repudiate the loan the G B  repeated
I mean you might say you would not pay me back the money and the law could not compel you to do so
Oh well if you think were such sneaks said Dicky and he got up off his chair
But the G B said Sit down sit down I was only joking
Then he talked some more and at last he said  I dont advise you to enter into that partnership
Its a swindle
Many advertisements are
And I have not a hundred pounds by me today to lend you
But I will lend you a pound and you can spend it as you like
And when you are twentyone you shall pay me back
I shall pay you back long before that said Dicky
Thanks awfully
And what about the note of hand
Oh said the G B Ill trust to your honour
Between gentlemen you know  and ladies  he made a beautiful bow to Alice a word is as good as a bond
Then he took out a sovereign and held it in his hand while he talked to us
He gave us a lot of good advice about not going into business too young and about doing our lessons  just swatting a bit on our own hook so as not to be put in a low form when we went back to school
And all the time he was stroking the sovereign and looking at it as if he thought it very beautiful
And so it was for it was a new one
Then at last he held it out to Dicky and when Dicky put out his hand for it the G B suddenly put the sovereign back in his pocket
No he said I wont give you the sovereign
Ill give you fifteen shillings and this nice bottle of scent
Its worth far more than the five shillings Im charging you for it
And when you can you shall pay me back the pound and sixty per cent interest  sixty per cent sixty per cent
Whats that
said H O
The G B said hed tell us that when we paid back the sovereign but sixty per cent was nothing to be afraid of
He gave Dicky the money
And the boy was made to call a cab and the G B put us in and shook hands with us all and asked Alice to give him a kiss so she did and H O would do it too though his face was dirtier than ever
The G B paid the cabman and told him what station to go to and so we went home
That evening Father had a letter by the sevenoclock post
And when he had read it he came up into the nursery
He did not look quite so unhappy as usual but he looked grave
Youve been to Mr Rosenbaums he said
So we told him all about it
It took a long time and Father sat in the armchair
It was jolly
He doesnt often come and talk to us now
He has to spend all his time thinking about his business
And when wed told him all about it he said  You havent done any harm this time children rather good than harm indeed
Mr Rosenbaum has written me a very kind letter
Is he a friend of yours Father
Oswald asked
He is an acquaintance said my father frowning a little we have done some business together
And this letter  he stopped and then said No you didnt do any harm today but I want you for the future not to do anything so serious as to try to buy a partnership without consulting me thats all
I dont want to interfere with your plays and pleasures but you will consult me about business matters wont you
Of course we said we should be delighted but then Alice who was sitting on his knee said We didnt like to bother you
Father said I havent much time to be with you for my business takes most of my time
It is an anxious business  but I cant bear to think of your being left all alone like this
He looked so sad we all said we liked being alone
And then he looked sadder than ever
Then Alice said We dont mean that exactly Father
It is rather lonely sometimes since Mother died
Then we were all quiet a little while
Father stayed with us till we went to bed and when he said good night he looked quite cheerful
So we told him so and he said  Well the fact is that letter took a weight off my mind
I cant think what he meant  but I am sure the G B would be pleased if he could know he had taken a weight off somebodys mind
He is that sort of man I think
We gave the scent to Dora
It is not quite such good scent as we thought it would be but we had fifteen shillings  and they were all good so is the G B
And until those fifteen shillings were spent we felt almost as jolly as though our fortunes had been properly restored
You do not notice your general fortune so much as long as you have money in your pocket
This is why so many children with regular pocketmoney have never felt it their duty to seek for treasure
So perhaps our not having pocketmoney was a blessing in disguise
But the disguise was quite impenetrable like the villains in the books and it seemed still more so when the fifteen shillings were all spent
Then at last the others agreed to let Oswald try his way of seeking for treasure but they were not at all keen about it and many a boy less firm than Oswald would have chucked the whole thing
But Oswald knew that a hero must rely on himself alone
So he stuck to it and presently the others saw their duty and backed him up
CHAPTER 10 LORD TOTTENHAM Oswald is a boy of firm and unswerving character and he had never wavered from his first idea
He felt quite certain that the books were right and that the best way to restore fallen fortunes was to rescue an old gentleman in distress
Then he brings you up as his own son but if you preferred to go on being your own fathers son I expect the old gentleman would make it up to you some other way
In the books the least thing does it  you put up the railway carriage window  or you pick up his purse when he drops it  or you say a hymn when he suddenly asks you to and then your fortune is made
The others as I said were very slack about it and did not seem to care much about trying the rescue
They said there wasnt any deadly peril and we should have to make one before we could rescue the old gentleman from it but Oswald didnt see that that mattered
However he thought he would try some of the easier ways first by himself
So he waited about the station pulling up railway carriage windows for old gentlemen who looked likely  but nothing happened and at last the porters said he was a nuisance
So that was no go
No one ever asked him to say a hymn though he had learned a nice short one beginning New every morning  and when an old gentleman did drop a twoshilling piece just by Elliss the hairdressers and Oswald picked it up and was just thinking what he should say when he returned it the old gentleman caught him by the collar and called him a young thief
It would have been very unpleasant for Oswald if he hadnt happened to be a very brave boy and knew the policeman on that beat very well indeed
So the policeman backed him up and the old gentleman said he was sorry and offered Oswald sixpence
Oswald refused it with polite disdain and nothing more happened at all
When Oswald had tried by himself and it had not come off he said to the others Were wasting our time not trying to rescue the old gentleman in deadly peril
Come  buck up
Do lets do something
It was dinnertime and Pincher was going round getting the bits off the plates
There were plenty because it was coldmutton day
And Alice said  Its only fair to try Oswalds way  he has tried all the things the others thought of
Why couldnt we rescue Lord Tottenham
Lord Tottenham is the old gentleman who walks over the Heath every day in a paper collar at three oclock  and when he gets halfway if there is no one about he changes his collar and throws the dirty one into the furzebushes
Dicky said Lord Tottenhams all right  but wheres the deadly peril
And we couldnt think of any
There are no highwaymen on Blackheath now I am sorry to say
And though Oswald said half of us could be highwaymen and the other half rescue party Dora kept on saying it would be wrong to be a highwayman  and so we had to give that up
Then Alice said What about Pincher
And we all saw at once that it could be done
Pincher is very well bred and he does know one or two things though we never could teach him to beg
But if you tell him to hold on  he will do it even if you only say Seize him
in a whisper
So we arranged it all
Dora said she wouldnt play she said she thought it was wrong and she knew it was silly  so we left her out and she went and sat in the diningroom with a goodybook so as to be able to say she didnt have anything to do with it if we got into a row over it
Alice and H O were to hide in the furzebushes just by where Lord Tottenham changes his collar and they were to whisper Seize him
to Pincher and then when Pincher had seized Lord Tottenham we were to go and rescue him from his deadly peril
And he would say How can I reward you my noble young preservers
and it would be all right
So we went up to the Heath
We were afraid of being late
Oswald told the others what Procrastination was  so they got to the furzebushes a little after two oclock and it was rather cold
Alice and H O and Pincher hid but Pincher did not like it any more than they did and as we three walked up and down we heard him whining
And Alice kept saying I am so cold
Isnt he coming yet
And H O wanted to come out and jump about to warm himself
But we told him he must learn to be a Spartan boy and that he ought to be very thankful he hadnt got a beastly fox eating his inside all the time
H O is our little brother and we are not going to let it be our fault if he grows up a milksop
Besides it was not really cold
It was his knees  he wears socks
So they stayed where they were
And at last when even the other three who were walking about were beginning to feel rather chilly we saw Lord Tottenhams big black cloak coming along flapping in the wind like a great bird
So we said to Alice  Hist
he approaches
Youll know when to set Pincher on by hearing Lord Tottenham talking to himself  he always does while he is taking off his collar
Then we three walked slowly away whistling to show we were not thinking of anything
Our lips were rather cold but we managed to do it
Lord Tottenham came striding along talking to himself
People call him the mad Protectionist
I dont know what it means  but I dont think people ought to call a Lord such names
As he passed us he said Ruin of the country sir
Fatal error fatal error
And then we looked back and saw he was getting quite near where Pincher was and Alice and H O
We walked on  so that he shouldnt think we were looking  and in a minute we heard Pinchers bark and then nothing for a bit and then we looked round and sure enough good old Pincher had got Lord Tottenham by the trouser leg and was holding on like billyho so we started to run
Lord Tottenham had got his collar half off  it was sticking out sideways under his ear  and he was shouting Help help murder
exactly as if some one had explained to him beforehand what he was to do
Pincher was growling and snarling and holding on
When we got to him I stopped and said  Dicky we must rescue this good old man
Lord Tottenham roared in his fury Good old man be  something or othered
Call the dog off
So Oswald said
It is a dangerous task  but who would hesitate to do an act of true bravery
And all the while Pincher was worrying and snarling and Lord Tottenham shouting to us to get the dog away
He was dancing about in the road with Pincher hanging on like grim death and his collar flapping about where it was undone
Then Noel said Haste ere yet it be too late
So I said to Lord Tottenham  Stand still aged sir and I will endeavour to alleviate your distress
He stood still and I stooped down and caught hold of Pincher and whispered Drop it sir drop it
So then Pincher dropped it and Lord Tottenham fastened his collar again  he never does change it if theres any one looking  and he said  Im much obliged Im sure
Nasty vicious brute
Heres something to drink my health
But Dicky explained that we are teetotallers and do not drink peoples healths
So Lord Tottenham said Well Im much obliged any way
And now I come to look at you  of course youre not young ruffians but gentlemens sons eh
Still you wont be above taking a tip from an old boy  I wasnt when I was your age and he pulled out half a sovereign
It was very silly but now wed done it I felt it would be beastly mean to take the old boys chink after putting him in such a funk
He didnt say anything about bringing us up as his own sons  so I didnt know what to do
I let Pincher go and was just going to say he was very welcome and wed rather not have the money which seemed the best way out of it when that beastly dog spoiled the whole show
Directly I let him go he began to jump about at us and bark for joy and try to lick our faces
He was so proud of what hed done
Lord Tottenham opened his eyes and he just said The dog seems to know you
And then Oswald saw it was all up and he said Good morning and tried to get away
But Lord Tottenham said  Not so fast
And he caught Noel by the collar
Noel gave a howl and Alice ran out from the bushes
NoEl is her favourite
Im sure I dont know why
Lord Tottenham looked at her and he said  So there are more of you
And then H O came out
Do you complete the party
Lord Tottenham asked him
And H O said there were only five of us this time
Lord Tottenham turned sharp off and began to walk away holding Noel by the collar
We caught up with him and asked him where he was going and he said To the Police Station
So then I said quite politely Well dont take Noel hes not strong and he easily gets upset
Besides it wasnt his doing
If you want to take any one take me  it was my very own idea
Dicky behaved very well
He said If you take Oswald Ill go too but dont take Noel hes such a delicate little chap
Lord Tottenham stopped and he said You should have thought of that before
NoEl was howling all the time and his face was very white and Alice said  Oh do let Noel go dear good kind Lord Tottenham hell faint if you dont I know he will he does sometimes
Oh I wish wed never done it
Dora said it was wrong
Dora displayed considerable common sense said Lord Tottenham and he let Noel go
And Alice put her arm round Noel and tried to cheer him up but he was all trembly and as white as paper
Then Lord Tottenham said  Will you give me your word of honour not to try to escape
So we said we would
Then follow me he said and led the way to a bench
We all followed and Pincher too with his tail between his legs  he knew something was wrong
Then Lord Tottenham sat down and he made Oswald and Dicky and H O stand in front of him but he let Alice and NoEl sit down
And he said  You set your dog on me and you tried to make me believe you were saving me from it
And you would have taken my halfsovereign
Such conduct is most  No  you shall tell me what it is sir and speak the truth
So I had to say it was most ungentlemanly but I said I hadnt been going to take the halfsovereign
Then what did you do it for
he asked
The truth mind
So I said I see now it was very silly and Dora said it was wrong but it didnt seem so till we did it
We wanted to restore the fallen fortunes of our house and in the books if you rescue an old gentleman from deadly peril he brings you up as his own son  or if you prefer to be your fathers son he starts you in business so that you end in wealthy affluence and there wasnt any deadly peril so we made Pincher into one  and so  I was so ashamed I couldnt go on for it did seem an awfully mean thing
Lord Tottenham said  A very nice way to make your fortune  by deceit and trickery
I have a horror of dogs
If Id been a weak man the shock might have killed me
What do you think of yourselves eh
We were all crying except Oswald and the others say he was and Lord Tottenham went on  Well well I see youre sorry
Let this be a lesson to you and well say no more about it
Im an old man now but I was young once
Then Alice slid along the bench close to him and put her hand on his arm her fingers were pink through the holes in her woolly gloves and said I think youre very good to forgive us and we are really very very sorry
But we wanted to be like the children in the books  only we never have the chances they have
Everything they do turns out all right
But we are sorry very very
And I know Oswald wasnt going to take the halfsovereign
Directly you said that about a tip from an old boy I began to feel bad inside and I whispered to H O that I wished we hadnt
Then Lord Tottenham stood up and he looked like the Death of Nelson for he is clean shaved and it is a good face and he said  Always remember never to do a dishonourable thing for money or for anything else in the world
And we promised we would remember
Then he took off his hat and we took off ours and he went away and we went home
I never felt so cheap in all my life
Dora said I told you so but we didnt mind even that so much though it was indeed hard to bear
It was what Lord Tottenham had said about ungentlemanly
We didnt go on to the Heath for a week after that but at last we all went and we waited for him by the bench
When he came along Alice said Please Lord Tottenham we have not been on the Heath for a week to be a punishment because you let us off
And we have brought you a present each if you will take them to show you are willing to make it up
He sat down on the bench and we gave him our presents
Oswald gave him a sixpenny compass  he bought it with my own money on purpose to give him
Oswald always buys useful presents
The needle would not move after Id had it a day or two but Lord Tottenham used to be an admiral so he will be able to make that go all right
Alice had made him a shavingcase with a rose worked on it
And H O gave him his knife  the same one he once cut all the buttons off his best suit with
Dicky gave him his prize Naval Heroes because it was the best thing he had and Noel gave him a piece of poetry he had made himself When sin and shame bow down the brow Then people feel just like we do now
We are so sorry with grief and pain We never will be so ungentlemanly again
Lord Tottenham seemed very pleased
He thanked us and talked to us for a bit and when he said goodbye he said  Alls fair weather now mates and shook hands
And whenever we meet him he nods to us and if the girls are with us he takes off his hat so he cant really be going on thinking us ungentlemanly now
CHAPTER 11 CASTILIAN AMOROSO One day when we suddenly found that we had half a crown we decided that we really ought to try Dickys way of restoring our fallen fortunes while yet the deed was in our power
Because it might easily have happened to us never to have half a crown again
So we decided to dally no longer with being journalists and bandits and things like them but to send for sample and instructions how to earn two pounds a week each in our spare time
We had seen the advertisement in the paper and we had always wanted to do it but we had never had the money to spare before somehow
The advertisement says Any lady or gentleman can easily earn two pounds a week in their spare time
Sample and instructions two shillings
Packed free from observation
A good deal of the halfcrown was Doras
It came from her godmother but she said she would not mind letting Dicky have it if he would pay her back before Christmas and if we were sure it was right to try to make our fortune that way
Of course that was quite easy because out of two pounds a week in your spare time you can easily pay all your debts and have almost as much left as you began with and as to the right we told her to dry up
Dicky had always thought that this was really the best way to restore our fallen fortunes and we were glad that now he had a chance of trying because of course we wanted the two pounds a week each and besides we were rather tired of Dickys always saying when our ways didnt turn out well Why dont you try the sample and instructions about our spare time
When we found out about our halfcrown we got the paper
NoEl was playing admirals in it but he had made the cocked hat without tearing the paper and we found the advertisement and it said just the same as ever
So we got a twoshilling postal order and a stamp and what was left of the money it was agreed we would spend in gingerbeer to drink success to trade
We got some nice paper out of Fathers study and Dicky wrote the letter and we put in the money and put on the stamp and made H O post it
Then we drank the gingerbeer and then we waited for the sample and instructions
It seemed a long time coming and the postman got quite tired of us running out and stopping him in the street to ask if it had come
But on the third morning it came
It was quite a large parcel and it was packed as the advertisement said it would be free from observation
That means it was in a box and inside the box was some stiff browny cardboard crinkled like the galvanized iron on the tops of chickenhouses and inside that was a lot of paper some of it printed and some scrappy and in the very middle of it all a bottle not very large and black and sealed on the top of the cork with yellow sealingwax
We looked at it as it lay on the nursery table and while all the others grabbed at the papers to see what the printing said Oswald went to look for the corkscrew so as to see what was inside the bottle
He found the corkscrew in the dresser drawer  it always gets there though it is supposed to be in the sideboard drawer in the diningroom  and when he got back the others had read most of the printed papers
I dont think its much good and I dont think its quite nice to sell wine Dora said and besides its not easy to suddenly begin to sell things when you arent used to it
I dont know said Alice I believe I could
They all looked rather down in the mouth though and Oswald asked how you were to make your two pounds a week
Why youve got to get people to taste that stuff in the bottle
Its sherry  Castilian Amoroso its name is  and then you get them to buy it and then you write to the people and tell them the other people want the wine and then for every dozen you sell you get two shillings from the wine people so if you sell twenty dozen a week you get your two pounds
I dont think we shall sell as much as that said Dicky
We might not the first week Alice said but when people found out how nice it was they would want more and more
And if we only got ten shillings a week it would be something to begin with wouldnt it
Oswald said he should jolly well think it would and then Dicky took the cork out with the corkscrew
The cork broke a good deal and some of the bits went into the bottle
Dora got the medicine glass that has the teaspoons and tablespoons marked on it and we agreed to have a teaspoonful each to see what it was like
No one must have more than that Dora said however nice it is
Dora behaved rather as if it were her bottle
I suppose it was because she had lent the money for it
Then she measured Out the teaspoonful and she had first go because of being the eldest
We asked at once what it was like but Dora could not speak just then
Then she said Its like the tonic Noel had in the spring but perhaps sherry ought to be like that
Then it was Oswalds turn
He thought it was very burny but he said nothing
He wanted to see first what the others would say
Dicky said his was simply beastly and Alice said Noel could taste next if he liked
Noel said it was the golden wine of the gods but he had to put his handkerchief up to his mouth all the same and I saw the face he made
Then H O had his and he spat it out in the fire which was very rude and nasty and we told him so
Then it was Alices turn
She said Only half a teaspoonful for me Dora
We mustnt use it all up
And she tasted it and said nothing
Then Dicky said Look here I chuck this
Im not going to hawk round such beastly stuff
Any one who likes can have the bottle
Quis
And Alice got out Ego before the rest of us
Then she said I know whats the matter with it
It wants sugar
And at once we all saw that that was all there was the matter with the stuff
So we got two lumps of sugar and crushed it on the floor with one of the big wooden bricks till it was powdery and mixed it with some of the wine up to the tablespoon mark and it was quite different and not nearly so nasty
You see its all right when you get used to it Dicky said
I think he was sorry he had said Quis
in such a hurry
Of course Alice said its rather dusty
We must crush the sugar carefully in clean paper before we put it in the bottle
Dora said she was afraid it would be cheating to make one bottle nicer than what people would get when they ordered a dozen bottles but Alice said Dora always made a fuss about everything and really it would be quite honest
You see she said I shall just tell them quite truthfully what we have done to it and when their dozens come they can do it for themselves
So then we crushed eight more lumps very cleanly and carefully between newspapers and shook it up well in the bottle and corked it up with a screw of paper brown and not news for fear of the poisonous printing ink getting wet and dripping down into the wine and killing people
We made Pincher have a taste and he sneezed for ever so long and after that he used to go under the sofa whenever we showed him the bottle
Then we asked Alice who she would try and sell it to
She said I shall ask everybody who comes to the house
And while we are doing that we can be thinking of outside people to take it to
We must be careful theres not much more than half of it left even counting the sugar
We did not wish to tell Eliza  I dont know why
And she opened the door very quickly that day so that the Taxes and a man who came to our house by mistake for next door got away before Alice had a chance to try them with the Castilian Amoroso
But about five Eliza slipped out for half an hour to see a friend who was making her a hat for Sunday and while she was gone there was a knock
Alice went and we looked over the banisters
When she opened the door she said at once Will you walk in please
The person at the door said I called to see your Pa miss
Is he at home
Alice said again Will you walk in please
Then the person  it sounded like a man  said He is in then
But Alice only kept on saying Will you walk in please
so at last the man did rubbing his boots very loudly on the mat
Then Alice shut the front door and we saw that it was the butcher with an envelope in his hand
He was not dressed in blue like when he is cutting up the sheep and things in the shop and he wore knickerbockers
Alice says he came on a bicycle
She led the way into the diningroom where the Castilian Amoroso bottle and the medicine glass were standIng on the table all ready
The others stayed on the stairs but Oswald crept down and looked through the doorcrack
Please sit down said Alice quite calmly though she told me afterwards I had no idea how silly she felt
And the butcher sat down
Then Alice stood quite still and said nothing but she fiddled with the medicine glass and put the screw of brown paper straight in the Castilian bottle
Will you tell your Pa Id like a word with him
the butcher said when he got tired of saying nothing
Hell be in very soon I think Alice said
And then she stood still again and said nothing
It was beginning to look very idiotic of her and H O laughed
I went back and cuffed him for it quite quietly and I dont think the butcher heard
But Alice did and it roused her from her stupor
She spoke suddenly very fast indeed  so fast that I knew she had made up what she was going to say before
She had got most of it out of the circular
She said I want to call your attention to a sample of sherry wine I have here
It is called Castilian something or other and at the price it is unequalled for flavour and bouquet
The butcher said Well  I never
And Alice went on Would you like to taste it
Thank you very much Im sure miss said the butcher
Alice poured some out
The butcher tasted a very little
He licked his lips and we thought he was going to say how good it was
But he did not
He put down the medicine glass with nearly all the stuff left in it we put it back in the bottle afterwards to save waste and said Excuse me miss but isnt it a little sweet
 for sherry I mean
The real isnt said Alice
If you order a dozen it will come quite different to that  we like it best with sugar
I wish you would order some
The butcher asked why
Alice did not speak for a minute and then she said  I dont mind telling you you are in business yourself arent you
We are trying to get people to buy it because we shall have two shillings for every dozen we can make any one buy
Its called a purr something
A percentage
Yes I see said the butcher looking at the hole in the carpet
You see there are reasons Alice went on why we want to make our fortunes as quickly as we can
Quite so said the butcher and he looked at the place where the paper is coming off the wall
And this seems a good way Alice went on
We paid two shillings for the sample and instructions and it says you can make two pounds a week easily in your leisure time
Im sure I hope you may miss said the butcher
And Alice said again would he buy some
Sherry is my favourite wine he said
Alice asked him to have some more to drink
No thank you miss he said its my favourite wine but it doesnt agree with me not the least bit
But Ive an uncle drinks it
Suppose I ordered him half a dozen for a Christmas present
Well miss heres the shilling commission anyway and he pulled out a handful of money and gave her the shilling
But I thought the wine people paid that Alice said
But the butcher said not on halfdozens they didnt
Then he said he didnt think hed wait any longer for Father  but would Alice ask Father to write him
Alice offered him the sherry again but he said something about Not for worlds
 and then she let him out and came back to us with the shilling and said Hows that
And we said Ai
And all the evening we talked of our fortune that we had begun to make
Nobody came next day but the day after a lady came to ask for money to build an orphanage for the children of dead sailors
And we saw her
I went in with Alice
And when we had explained to her that we had only a shilling and we wanted it for something else Alice suddenly said Would you like some wine
And the lady said Thank you very much but she looked surprised
She was not a young lady and she had a mantle with beads and the beads had come off in places  leaving a browny braid showing and she had printed papers about the dead sailors in a sealskin bag and the seal had come off in places leaving the skin bare
We gave her a tablespoonful of the wine in a proper wineglass out of the sideboard because she was a lady
And when she had tasted it she got up in a very great hurry and shook out her dress and snapped her bag shut and said You naughty wicked children
What do you mean by playing a trick like this
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves
I shall write to your Mamma about it
You dreadful little girl
 you might have poisoned me
But your Mamma Then Alice said Im very sorry the butcher liked it only he said it was sweet
And please dont write to Mother
It makes Father so unhappy when letters come for her
 and Alice was very near crying
What do you mean you silly child
said the lady looking quite bright and interested
Why doesnt your Father like your Mother to have letters  eh
And Alice said Oh you 

and began to cry and bolted out of the room
Then I said Our Mother is dead and will you please go away now
The lady looked at me a minute and then she looked quite different and she said Im very sorry
I didnt know
Never mind about the wine
I daresay your little sister meant it kindly
And she looked round the room just like the butcher had done
Then she said again I didnt know  Im very sorry


So I said Dont mention it and shook hands with her and let her out
Of course we couldnt have asked her to buy the wine after what shed said
But I think she was not a bad sort of person
I do like a person to say theyre sorry when they ought to be  especially a grownup
They do it so seldom
I suppose thats why we think so much of it
But Alice and I didnt feel jolly for ever so long afterwards
And when I went back into the diningroom I saw how different it was from when Mother was here and we are different and Father is different and nothing is like it was
I am glad I am not made to think about it every day
I went and found Alice and told her what the lady had said and when she had finished crying we put away the bottle and said we would not try to sell any more to people who came
And we did not tell the others  we only said the lady did not buy any  but we went up on the Heath and some soldiers went by and there was a Punchandjudy show and when we came back we were better
The bottle got quite dusty where we had put it and perhaps the dust of ages would have laid thick and heavy on it only a clergyman called when we were all out
He was not our own clergyman  Mr Bristow is our own clergyman and we all love him and we would not try to sell sherry to people we like and make two pounds a week out of them in our spare time
It was another clergyman just a stray one and he asked Eliza if the dear children would not like to come to his little Sunday school
We always spend Sunday afternoons with Father
But as he had left the name of his vicarage with Eliza and asked her to tell us to come we thought we would go and call on him just to explain about Sunday afternoons and we thought we might as well take the sherry with us
I wont go unless you all go too Alice said and I wont do the talking
Dora said she thought we had much better not go but we said Rot
and it ended in her coming with us and I am glad she did
Oswald said he would do the talking if the others liked and he learned up what to say from the printed papers
We went to the Vicarage early on Saturday afternoon and rang at the bell
It is a new red house with no trees in the garden only very yellow mould and gravel
It was all very neat and dry
Just before we rang the bell we heard some one inside call Jane
Jane
and we thought we would not be Jane for anything
It was the sound of the voice that called that made us sorry for her
The door was opened by a very neat servant in black with a white apron we saw her tying the strings as she came along the hall through the differentcoloured glass in the door
Her face was red and I think she was Jane
We asked if we could see Mr Mallow
The servant said Mr Mallow was very busy with his sermon just then but she would see
But Oswald said Its all right
He asked us to come
So she let us all in and shut the front door and showed us into a very tidy room with a bookcase full of a lot of books covered in black cotton with white labels and some dull pictures and a harmonium
And Mr Mallow was writing at a desk with drawers copying something out of a book
He was stout and short and wore spectacles
He covered his writing up when we went in  I didnt know why
He looked rather cross and we heard Jane or somebody being scolded outside by the voice
I hope it wasnt for letting us in but I have had doubts
Well said the clergyman what is all this about
You asked us to call Dora said about your little Sunday school
We are the Bastables of Lewisham Road
Oh  ah yes he said and shall I expect you all tomorrow
He took up his pen and fiddled with it and he did not ask us to sit down
But some of us did
We always spend Sunday afternoon with Father said Dora but we wished to thank you for being so kind as to ask us
And we wished to ask you something else
said Oswald and he made a sign to Alice to get the sherry ready in the glass
She did  behind Oswalds back while he was speaking
My time is limited said Mr Mallow looking at his watch but still  Then he muttered something about the fold and went on Tell me what is troubling you my little man and I will try to give you any help in my power
What is it you want
Then Oswald quickly took the glass from Alice and held it out to him and said I want your opinion on that
On that he said
What is it
It is a shipment Oswald said but its quite enough for you to taste
Alice had filled the glass halffull I suppose she was too excited to measure properly
A shipment
said the clergyman taking the glass in his hand
Yes Oswald went On an exceptional opportunity
Fullbodied and nutty
It really does taste rather like one kind of Brazilnut
Alice put her oar in as usual
The Vicar looked from Alice to Oswald and back again and Oswald went on with what he had learned from the printing
The clergyman held the glass at halfarmslength stiffly as if he had caught cold
It is of a quality never before offered at the price
Old Delicate Amoro  whats its name  Amorolio said H O
Amoroso said Oswald
H
O you just shut up  Castilian Amoroso  its a true afterdinner wine stimulating and yet  Wine
said Mr Mallow holding the glass further off
Do you know he went on making his voice very thick and strong I expect he does it like that in church have you never been taught that it is the drinking of wine and spirits  yes and BEER which makes half the homes in England full of wretched little children and degraded MISERABLE parents
Not if you put sugar in it said Alice firmly eight lumps and shake the bottle
We have each had more than a teaspoonful of it and we were not ill at all
It was something else that upset H O
Most likely all those acorns he got out of the Park
The clergyman seemed to be speechless with conflicting emotions and just then the door opened and a lady came in
She had a white cap with lace and an ugly violet flower in it and she was tall and looked very strong though thin
And I do believe she had been listening at the door
But why the Vicar was saying why did you bring this dreadful fluid this curse of our country to me to taste
Because we thought you might buy some said Dora who never sees when a game is up
In books the parson loves his bottle of old port and new sherry is just as good  with sugar  for people who like sherry
And if you would order a dozen of the wine then we should get two shillings
The lady said and it was the voice Good gracious
Nasty sordid little things
Havent they any one to teach them better
And Dora got up and said No we are not those things you say but we are sorry we came here to be called names
We want to make our fortune just as much as Mr Mallow does  only no one would listen to us if we preached so its no use our copying out sermons like him
And I think that was smart of Dora even if it was rather rude
Then I said perhaps we had better go and the lady said I should think so
But when we were going to wrap up the bottle and glass the clergyman said No you can leave that and we were so upset we did though it wasnt his after all
We walked home very fast and not saying much and the girls went up to their rooms
When I went to tell them tea was ready and there was a teacake Dora was crying like anything and Alice hugging her
I am afraid there is a great deal of crying in this chapter but I cant help it
Girls will sometimes I suppose it is their nature and we ought to be sorry for their affliction
Its no good Dora was saying you all hate me and you think Im a prig and a busybody but I do try to do right  oh I do
Oswald go away dont come here making fun of me
So I said Im not making fun Sissy dont cry old girl
Mother taught me to call her Sissy when we were very little and before the others came but I dont often somehow now we are old
I patted her on the back and she put her head against my sleeve holding on to Alice all the time and she went on
She was in that laughycryey state when people say things they wouldnt say at other times
Oh dear oh dear  I do try I do
And when Mother died she said Dora take care of the others and teach them to be good and keep them out of trouble and make them happy
She said Take care of them for me Dora dear
And I have tried and all of you hate me for it and today I let you do this though I knew all the time it was silly
I hope you will not think I was a muff but I kissed Dora for some time
Because girls like it
And I will never say again that she comes the good elder sister too much
And I have put all this in though I do hate telling about it because I own I have been hard on Dora but I never will be again
She is a good old sort of course we never knew before about what Mother told her or we wouldnt have ragged her as we did
We did not tell the little ones but I got Alice to speak to Dicky and we three can sit on the others if requisite
This made us forget all about the sherry but about eight oclock there was a knock and Eliza went and we saw it was poor Jane if her name was Jane from the Vicarage
She handed in a brownpaper parcel and a letter
And three minutes later Father called us into his study
On the table was the brownpaper parcel open with our bottle and glass on it and Father had a letter in his hand
He Pointed to the bottle and sighed and said What have you been doing now
The letter in his hand was covered with little black writing all over the four large pages
So Dicky spoke up and he told Father the whole thing as far as he knew it for Alice and I had not told about the dead sailors lady
And when he had done Alice said Has Mr Mallow written to you to say he will buy a dozen of the sherry after all
It is really not half bad with sugar in it
Father said no he didnt think clergymen could afford such expensive wine and he said he would like to taste it
So we gave him what there was left for we had decided coming home that we would give up trying for the two pounds a week in our spare time
Father tasted it and then he acted just as H O had done when he had his teaspoonful but of course we did not say anything
Then he laughed till I thought he would never stop
I think it was the sherry because I am sure I have read somewhere about wine that maketh glad the heart of man
He had only a very little which shows that it was a good afterdinner wine stimulating and yet 
I forget the rest
But when he had done laughing he said Its all right kids
Only dont do it again
The wine trade is overcrowded and besides I thought you promised to consult me before going into business
Before buying one I thought you meant said Dicky
This was only on commission
And Father laughed again
I am glad we got the Castilian Amoroso because it did really cheer Father up and you cannot always do that however hard you try even if you make jokes or give him a comic paper
CHAPTER 12 THE NOBLENESS OF OSWALD The part about his nobleness only comes at the end but you would not understand it unless you knew how it began
It began like nearly everything about that time with treasureseeking
Of course as soon as we had promised to consult my Father about business matters we all gave up wanting to go into business
I dont know how it is but having to consult about a thing with grownup people even the bravest and the best seems to make the thing not worth doing afterwards
We dont mind Alberts uncle chipping in sometimes when the things going on but we are glad he never asked us to promise to consult him about anything
Yet Oswald saw that my Father was quite right and I daresay if we had had that hundred pounds we should have spent it on the share in that lucrative business for the sale of useful patent and then found out afterwards that we should have done better to spend the money in some other way
My Father says so and he ought to know
We had several ideas about that time but having so little chink always stood in the way
This was the case with H
O
s idea of setting up a coconutshy on this side of the Heath where there are none generally
We had no sticks or wooden balls and the greengrocer said he could not book so many as twelve dozen coconuts without Mr Bastables written order
And as we did not wish to consult my Father it was decided to drop it
And when Alice dressed up Pincher in some of the dolls clothes and we made up our minds to take him round with an organ as soon as we had taught him to dance we were stopped at once by Dickys remembering how he had once heard that an organ cost seven hundred pounds
Of course this was the big church kind but even the ones on three legs cant be got for oneandsevenpence which was all we had when we first thought of it
So we gave that up too
It was a wet day I remember and mutton hash for dinner  very tough with pale gravy with lumps in it
I think the others would have left a good deal on the sides of their plates although they know better only Oswald said it was a savoury stew made of the red deer that Edward shot
So then we were the Children of the New Forest and the mutton tasted much better
No one in the New Forest minds venison being tough and the gravy pale
Then after dinner we let the girls have a dolls teaparty on condition they didnt expect us boys to wash up and it was when we were drinking the last of the liquorice water out of the little cups that Dicky said  This reminds me
So we said What of
Dicky answered us at once though his mouth was full of bread with liquorice stuck in it to look like cake
You should not speak with your mouth full even to your own relations and you shouldnt wipe your mouth on the back of your hand but on your handkerchief if you have one
Dicky did not do this
He said  Why you remember when we first began about treasureseeking I said I had thought of something only I could not tell you because I hadnt finished thinking about it
We said Yes
Well this liquorice water  Tea said Alice softly
Well tea then  made me think
He was going on to say what it made him think but Noel interrupted and cried out I say lets finish off this old teaparty and have a council of war
So we got out the flags and the wooden sword and the drum and Oswald beat it while the girls washed up till Eliza came up to say she had the jumping toothache and the noise went through her like a knife
So of course Oswald left off at once
When you are polite to Oswald he never refuses to grant your requests
When we were all dressed up we sat down round the camp fire and Dicky began again
Every one in the world wants money
Some people get it
The people who get it are the ones who see things
I have seen one thing
Dicky stopped and smoked the pipe of peace
It is the pipe we did bubbles with in the summer and somehow it has not got broken yet
We put tealeaves in it for the pipe of peace but the girls are not allowed to have any
It is not right to let girls smoke
They get to think too much of themselves if you let them do everything the same as men
Oswald said Out with it
I see that glass bottles only cost a penny
H O if you dare to snigger Ill send you round selling old bottles and you shant have any sweets except out of the money you get for them
And the same with you Noel
NoEl wasnt sniggering said Alice in a hurry it is only his taking so much interest in what you were saying makes him look like that
Be quiet H O and dont you make faces either
Do go on Dicky dear
So Dicky went on
There must be hundreds of millions of bottles of medicines sold every year
Because all the different medicines say Thousands of cures daily and if you only take that as two thousand which it must be at least it mounts up
And the people who sell them must make a great deal of money by them because they are nearly always twoand ninepence the bottle and threeandsix for one nearly double the size
Now the bottles as I was saying dont cost anything like that
Its the medicine costs the money said Dora look how expensive jujubes are at the chemists and peppermints too
Thats only because theyre nice Dicky explained nasty things are not so dear
Look what a lot of brimstone you get for a penny and the same with alum
We would not put the nice kinds of chemists things in our medicine
Then he went on to tell us that when we had invented our medicine we would write and tell the editor about it and he would put it in the paper and then people would send their twoandninepence and threeandsix for the bottle nearly double the size and then when the medicine had cured them they would write to the paper and their letters would be printed saying how they had been suffering for years and never thought to get about again but thanks to the blessing of our ointment  Dora interrupted and said Not ointment  its so messy
And Alice thought so too
And Dicky said he did not mean it he was quite decided to let it be in bottles
So now it was all settled and we did not see at the time that this would be a sort of going into business but afterwards when Alberts uncle showed us we saw it and we were sorry
We only had to invent the medicine
You might think that was easy because of the number of them you see every day in the paper but it is much harder than you think
First we had to decide what sort of illness we should like to cure and a heated discussion ensued like in Parliament
Dora wanted it to be something to make the complexion of dazzling fairness but we remembered how her face came all red and rough when she used the Rosabella soap that was advertised to make the darkest complexion fair as the lily and she agreed that perhaps it was better not
Noel wanted to make the medicine first and then find out what it would cure but Dicky thought not because there are so many more medicines than there are things the matter with us so it would be easier to choose the disease first
Oswald would have liked wounds
I still think it was a good idea but Dicky said Who has wounds especially now there arent any wars
We shouldnt sell a bottle a day
So Oswald gave in because he knows what manners are and it was Dickys idea
H O wanted a cure for the uncomfortable feeling that they give you powders for but we explained to him that grownup people do not have this feeling however much they eat and he agreed
Dicky said he did not care a straw what the loathsome disease was as long as we hurried up and settled on something
Then Alice said  It ought to be something very common and only one thing
Not the pains in the back and all the hundreds of things the people have in somebodys syrup
Whats the commonest thing of all
And at once we said Colds
So that was settled
Then we wrote a label to go on the bottle
When it was written it would not go on the vinegar bottle that we had got but we knew it would go small when it was printed
It was like this BASTABLES CERTAIN CURE FOR COLDS Coughs Asthma Shortness of Breath and all infections of the Chest One dose gives immediate relief It will cure your cold in one bottle Especially the larger size at 3s
6d
Order at once of the Makers To prevent disappointment Makers D O R A N and H O BASTABLE 150 Lewisham Road S E A halfpenny for all bottles returned Of course the next thing was for one of us to catch a cold and try what cured it we all wanted to be the one but it was Dickys idea and he said he was not going to be done out of it so we let him
It was only fair
He left off his undershirt that very day and next morning he stood in a draught in his nightgown for quite a long time
And we damped his dayshirt with the nailbrush before he put it on
But all was vain
They always tell you that these things will give you cold but we found it was not so
So then we all went over to the Park and Dicky went right into the water with his boots on and stood there as long as he could bear it for it was rather cold and we stood and cheered him on
He walked home in his wet clothes which they say is a sure thing but it was no go though his boots were quite spoiled
And three days after Noel began to cough and sneeze
So then Dicky said it was not fair
I cant help it Noel said
You should have caught it yourself then it wouldnt have come to me
And Alice said she had known all along Noel oughtnt to have stood about on the bank cheering in the cold
Noel had to go to bed and then we began to make the medicines we were sorry he was out of it but he had the fun of taking the things
We made a great many medicines
Alice made herb tea
She got sage and thyme and savory and marjoram and boiled them all up together with salt and water but she WOULD put parsley in too
Oswald is sure parsley is not a herb
It is only put on the cold meat and you are not supposed to eat it
It kills parrots to eat parsley I believe
I expect it was the parsley that disagreed so with Noel
The medicine did not seem to do the cough any good
Oswald got a pennyworth of alum because it is so cheap and some turpentine which every one knows is good for colds and a little sugar and an aniseed ball
These were mixed in a bottle with water but Eliza threw it away and said it was nasty rubbish and I hadnt any money to get more things with
Dora made him some gruel and he said it did his chest good but of course that was no use because you cannot put gruel in bottles and say it is medicine
It would not be honest and besides nobody would believe you
Dick mixed up lemonjuice and sugar and a little of the juice of the red flannel that Noels throat was done up in
It comes out beautifully in hot water
NoEl took this and he liked it
NoEls own idea was liquoricewater and we let him have it but it is too plain and black to sell in bottles at the proper price
NoEl liked H
O
s medicine the best which was silly of him because it was only peppermints melted in hot water and a little cobalt to make it look blue
It was all right because H
O
s paintbox is the French kind with Couleurs non Vgngneuses on it
This means you may suck your brushes if you want to or even your paints if you are a very little boy
It was rather jolly while Noel had that cold
He had a fire in his bedroom which opens out of Dickys and Oswalds and the girls used to read aloud to Noel all day they will not read aloud to you when you are well
Father was away at Liverpool on business and Alberts uncle was at Hastings
We were rather glad of this because we wished to give all the medicines a fair trial and grownups are but too fond of interfering
As if we should have given him anything poisonous
His cold went on  it was bad in his head but it was not one of the kind when he has to have poultices and cant sit up in bed
But when it had been in his head nearly a week Oswald happened to tumble over Alice on the stairs
When we got up she was crying
Dont cry silly
said Oswald you know I didnt hurt you
I was very sorry if I had hurt her but you ought not to sit on the stairs in the dark and let other people tumble over you
You ought to remember how beastly it is for them if they do hurt you
Oh its not that Oswald Alice said
Dont be a pig
I am so miserable
Do be kind to me
So Oswald thumped her on the back and told her to shut up
Its about Noel she said
Im sure hes very ill and playing about with medicines is all very well but I know hes ill and Eliza wont send for the doctor she says its only a cold
And I know the doctors bills are awful
I heard Father telling Aunt Emily so in the summer
But he was  and perhaps hell die or something
Then she began to cry again
Oswald thumped her again because he knows how a good brother ought to behave and said Cheer up
If we had been in a book Oswald would have embraced his little sister tenderly and mingled his tears with hers
Then Oswald said Why not write to Father
And she cried more and said Ive lost the paper with the address
H O had it to draw on the back of and I cant find it now Ive looked everywhere
Ill tell you what Im going to do
No I wont
But Im going out
Dont tell the others
And I say Oswald do pretend Im in if Eliza asks
Promise
Tell me what youre going to do I said
But she said No and there was a good reason why not
So I said I wouldnt promise if it came to that
Of course I meant to all right
But it did seem mean of her not to tell me
So Alice went out by the side door while Eliza was setting tea and she was a long time gone she was not in to tea
When Eliza asked Oswald where she was he said he did not know but perhaps she was tidying her corner drawer
Girls often do this and it takes a long time
NoEl coughed a good bit after tea and asked for Alice
Oswald told him she was doing something and it was a secret
Oswald did not tell any lies even to save his sister
When Alice came back she was very quiet but she whispered to Oswald that it was all right
When it was rather late Eliza said she was going out to post a letter
This always takes her an hour because she WILL go to the postoffice across the Heath instead of the pillarbox because once a boy dropped fusees in our pillarbox and burnt the letters
It was not any of us Eliza told us about it
And when there was a knock at the door a long time after we thought it was Eliza come back and that she had forgotten the backdoor key
We made H O go down to open the door because it is his place to run about his legs are younger than ours
And we heard boots on the stairs besides H
O
s and we listened spellbound till the door opened and it was Alberts uncle
He looked very tired
I am glad youve come Oswald said
Alice began to think Noel  Alice stopped me and her face was very red her nose was shiny too with having cried so much before tea
She said I only said I thought Noel ought to have the doctor
Dont you think he ought
She got hold of Alberts uncle and held on to him
Lets have a look at you young man said Alberts uncle and he sat down on the edge of the bed
It is a rather shaky bed the bar that keeps it steady underneath got broken when we were playing burglars last winter
It was our crowbar
He began to feel Noels pulse and went on talking
It was revealed to the Arab physician as he made merry in his tents on the wild plains of Hastings that the Presence had a cold in its head
So he immediately seated himself on the magic carpet and bade it bear him hither only pausing in the flight to purchase a few sweetmeats in the bazaar
He pulled out a jolly lot of chocolate and some butterscotch and grapes for Noel
When we had all said thank you he went on
The physicians are the words of wisdom its high time this kid was asleep
I have spoken
Ye have my leave to depart
So we bunked and Dora and Alberts uncle made Noel comfortable for the night
Then they came to the nursery which we had gone down to and he sat down in the Guy Fawkes chair and said Now then
Alice said You may tell them what I did
I daresay theyll all be in a wax but I dont care
I think you were very wise said Alberts uncle pulling her close to him to sit on his knee
I am very glad you telegraphed
So then Oswald understood what Alices secret was
She had gone out and sent a telegram to Alberts uncle at Hastings
But Oswald thought she might have told him
Afterwards she told me what she had put in the telegram
It was Come home
We have given Noel a cold and I think we are killing him
With the address it came to tenpencehalfpenny
Then Alberts uncle began to ask questions and it all came out how Dicky had tried to catch the cold but the cold had gone to Noel instead and about the medicines and all
Alberts uncle looked very serious
Look here he said Youre old enough not to play the fool like this
Health is the best thing youve got you ought to know better than to risk it
You might have killed your little brother with your precious medicines
Youve had a lucky escape certainly
But poor Noel
Oh do you think hes going to die
Alice asked that and she was crying again
No no said Alberts uncle but look here
Do you see how silly youve been
And I thought you promised your Father  And then he gave us a long talkingto
He can make you feel most awfully Small
At last he stopped and we said we were very sorry and he said You know I promised to take you all to the pantomime
So we said Yes and knew but too well that now he wasnt going to
Then he went on  Well I will take you if you like or I will take Noel to the sea for a week to cure his cold
Which is it to be
Of course he knew we should say Take Noel and we did but Dicky told me afterwards he thought it was hard on H O Alberts uncle stayed till Eliza came in and then he said good night in a way that showed us that all was forgiven and forgotten
And we went to bed
It must have been the middle of the night when Oswald woke up suddenly and there was Alice with her teeth chattering shaking him to wake him
Oh Oswald
she said I am so unhappy
Suppose I should die in the night
Oswald told her to go to bed and not gas
But she said I must tell you I wish Id told Alberts uncle
Im a thief and if I die tonight I know where thieves go to
So Oswald saw it was no good and he sat up in bed and said  Go ahead
So Alice stood shivering and said  I hadnt enough money for the telegram so I took the bad sixpence out of the exchequer
And I paid for it with that and the fivepence I had
And I wouldnt tell you because if youd stopped me doing it I couldnt have borne it and if youd helped me youd have been a thief too
Oh what shall I do
Oswald thought a minute and then he said  Youd better have told me
But I think it will be all right if we pay it back
Go to bed
Cross with you
No stupid
Only another time youd better not keep secrets
So she kissed Oswald and he let her and she went back to bed
The next day Alberts uncle took Noel away before Oswald had time to persuade Alice that we ought to tell him about the sixpence
Alice was very unhappy but not so much as in the night you can be very miserable in the night if you have done anything wrong and you happen to be awake
I know this for a fact
None of us had any money except Eliza and she wouldnt give us any unless we said what for and of course we could not do that because of the honour of the family
And Oswald was anxious to get the sixpence to give to the telegraph people because he feared that the badness of that sixpence might have been found out and that the police might come for Alice at any moment
I dont think I ever had such an unhappy day
Of course we could have written to Alberts uncle but it would have taken a long time and every moment of delay added to Alices danger
We thought and thought but we couldnt think of any way to get that sixpence
It seems a small sum but you see Alices liberty depended on it
It was quite late in the afternoon when I met Mrs Leslie on the Parade
She had a brown fur coat and a lot of yellow flowers in her hands
She stopped to speak to me and asked me how the Poet was
I told her he had a cold and I wondered whether she would lend me sixpence if I asked her but I could not make up my mind how to begin to say it
It is a hard thing to say  much harder than you would think
She talked to me for a bit and then she suddenly got into a cab and said  Id no idea it was so late and told the man where to go
And just as she started she shoved the yellow flowers through the window and said For the sick poet with my love and was driven off
Gentle reader I will not conceal from you what Oswald did
He knew all about not disgracing the family and he did not like doing what I am going to say and they were really Noels flowers only he could not have sent them to Hastings and Oswald knew he would say Yes if Oswald asked him
Oswald sacrificed his family pride because of his little sisters danger
I do not say he was a noble boy  I just tell you what he did and you can decide for yourself about the nobleness
He put on his oldest clothes  theyre much older than any you would think he had if you saw him when he was tidy  and he took those yellow chrysanthemums and he walked with them to Greenwich Station and waited for the trains bringing people from London
He sold those flowers in penny bunches and got tenpence
Then he went to the telegraph office at Lewisham and said to the lady there A little girl gave you a bad sixpence yesterday
Here are six good pennies
The lady said she had not noticed it and never mind but Oswald knew that Honesty is the best Policy and he refused to take back the pennies
So at last she said she should put them in the plate on Sunday
She is a very nice lady
I like the way she does her hair
Then Oswald went home to Alice and told her and she hugged him and said he was a dear good kind boy and he said Oh its all right
We bought peppermint bullseyes with the fourpence I had over and the others wanted to know where we got the money but we would not tell
Only afterwards when Noel came home we told him because they were his flowers and he said it was quite right
He made some poetry about it
I only remember one bit of it
The noble youth of high degree Consents to play a menial part All for his sister Alices sake Who was so dear to his faithful heart
But Oswald himself has never bragged about it
We got no treasure out of this unless you count the peppermint bullseyes
CHAPTER 13 THE ROBBER AND THE BURGLAR A day or two after Noel came back from Hastings there was snow it was jolly
And we cleared it off the path
A man to do it is sixpence at least and you should always save when you can
A penny saved is a penny earned
And then we thought it would be nice to clear it off the top of the portico where it lies so thick and the edges as if they had been cut with a knife
And just as we had got out of the landingwindow on to the portico the Water Rates came up the path with his book that he tears the thing out of that says how much you have got to pay and the little inkbottle hung on to his buttonhole in case you should pay him
Father says the Water Rates is a sensible man and knows it is always well to be prepared for whatever happens however unlikely
Alice said afterwards that she rather liked the Water Rates really and Noel said he had a face like a good vizier or the man who rewards the honest boy for restoring the purse but we did not think about these things at the time and as the Water Rates came up the steps we shovelled down a great square slab of snow like an avalanche  and it fell right on his head 
Two of us thought of it at the same moment so it was quite a large avalanche
And when the Water Rates had shaken himself he rang the bell
It was Saturday and Father was at home
We know now that it is very wrong and ungentlemanly to shovel snow off porticoes on to the Water Rates or any other person and we hope he did not catch a cold and we are very sorry
We apologized to the Water Rates when Father told us to
We were all sent to bed for it
We all deserved the punishment because the others would have shovelled down snow just as we did if theyd thought of it  only they are not so quick at thinking of things as we are
And even quite wrong things sometimes lead to adventures as every one knows who has ever read about pirates or highwaymen
Eliza hates us to be sent to bed early because it means her having to bring meals up and it means lighting the fire in Noels room ever so much earlier than usual
He had to have a fire because he still had a bit of a cold
But this particular day we got Eliza into a good temper by giving her a horrid brooch with pretending amethysts in it that an aunt once gave to Alice so Eliza brought up an extra scuttle of coals and when the greengrocer came with the potatoes he is always late on Saturdays she got some chestnuts from him
So that when we heard Father go out after his dinner there was a jolly fire in Noels room and we were able to go in and be Red Indians in blankets most comfortably
Eliza had gone out she says she gets things cheaper on Saturday nights
She has a great friend who sells fish at a shop and he is very generous and lets her have herrings for less than half the natural price
So we were all alone in the house Pincher was out with Eliza and we talked about robbers
And Dora thought it would be a dreadful trade but Dicky said  I think it would be very interesting
And you would only rob rich people and be very generous to the poor and needy like Claude Duval
Dora said It is wrong to be a robber
Yes said Alice you would never know a happy hour
Think of trying to sleep with the stolen jewels under your bed and remembering all the quantities of policemen and detectives that there are in the world
There are ways of being robbers that are not wrong said Noel if you can rob a robber it is a right act
But you cant said Dora he is too clever and besides its wrong anyway
Yes you can and it isnt and murdering him with boiling oil is a right act too so there
said Noel
What about Ali Baba
Now then
And we felt it was a score for NoEl
What would you do if there was a robber
said Alice
H O said he would kill him with boiling oil but Alice explained that she meant a real robber  now  this minute  in the house
Oswald and Dicky did not say but Noel said he thought it would only be fair to ask the robber quite politely and quietly to go away and then if he didnt you could deal with him
Now what I am going to tell you is a very strange and wonderful thing and I hope you will be able to believe it
I should not if a boy told me unless I knew him to be a man of honour and perhaps not then unless he gave his sacred word
But it is true all the same and it only shows that the days of romance and daring deeds are not yet at an end
Alice was just asking Noel how he would deal with the robber who wouldnt go if he was asked politely and quietly when we heard a noise downstairs  quite a plain noise not the kind of noise you fancy you hear
It was like somebody moving a chair
We held our breath and listened and then came another noise like some one poking a fire
Now you remember there was no one to poke a fire or move a chair downstairs because Eliza and Father were both out
They could not have come in without our hearing them because the front door is as hard to shut as the back one and whichever you go in by you have to give a slam that you can hear all down the street
H O and Alice and Dora caught hold of each others blankets and looked at Dicky and Oswald and every one was quite pale
And Noel whispered  Its ghosts I know it is  and then we listened again but there was no more noise
Presently Dora said in a whisper  Whatever shall we do
Oh whatever shall we do  what shall we do
And she kept on saying it till we had to tell her to shut up
O reader have you ever been playing Red Indians in blankets round a bedroom fire in a house where you thought there was no one but you  and then suddenly heard a noise like a chair and a fire being poked downstairs
Unless you have you will not be able to imagine at all what it feels like
It was not like in books our hair did not stand on end at all and we never said Hist
once but our feet got very cold though we were in blankets by the fire and the insides of Oswalds hands got warm and wet and his nose was cold like a dogs and his ears were burning hot
The girls said afterwards that they shivered with terror and their teeth chattered but we did not see or hear this at the time
Shall we open the window and call police
said Dora and then Oswald suddenly thought of something and he breathed more freely and he said  I know its not ghosts and I dont believe its robbers
I expect its a stray cat got in when the coals came this morning and shes been hiding in the cellar and now shes moving about
Lets go down and see
The girls wouldnt of course but I could see that they breathed more freely too
But Dicky said All right I will if you will
H O said Do you think its really a cat
So we said he had better stay with the girls
And of course after that we had to let him and Alice both come
Dora said if we took Noel down with his cold she would scream Fire
and Murder
and she didnt mind if the whole street heard
So Noel agreed to be getting his clothes on and the rest of us said we would go down and look for the cat
Now Oswald said that about the cat and it made it easier to go down but in his inside he did not feel at all sure that it might not be robbers after all
Of course we had often talked about robbers before but it is very different when you sit in a room and listen and listen and listen and Oswald felt somehow that it would be easier to go down and see what it was than to wait and listen and wait and wait and listen and wait and then perhaps to hear It whatever it was come creeping slowly up the stairs as softly as It could with Its boots off and the stairs creaking towards the room where we were with the door open in case of Eliza coming back suddenly and all dark on the landings
And then it would have been just as bad and it would have lasted longer and you would have known you were a coward besides
Dicky says he felt all these same things
Many people would say we were young heroes to go down as we did so I have tried to explain because no young hero wishes to have more credit than he deserves
The landing gas was turned down low  just a blue bead  and we four went out very softly wrapped in our blankets and we stood on the top of the stairs a good long time before we began to go down
And we listened and listened till our ears buzzed
And Oswald whispered to Dicky and Dicky went into our room and fetched the large toy pistol that is a foot long and that has the trigger broken and I took it because I am the eldest and I dont think either of us thought it was the cat now
But Alice and H O did
Dicky got the poker out of Noels room and told Dora it was to settle the cat with when we caught her
Then Oswald whispered Lets play at burglars Dicky and I are armed to the teeth we will go first
You keep a flight behind us and be a reinforcement if we are attacked
Or you can retreat and defend the women and children in the fortress if youd rather
But they said they would be a reinforcement
Oswalds teeth chattered a little when he spoke
It was not with anything else except cold
So Dicky and Oswald crept down and when we got to the bottom of the stairs we saw Fathers study door just ajar and the crack of light
And Oswald was so pleased to see the light knowing that burglars prefer the dark or at any rate the dark lantern that he felt really sure it was the cat after all and then he thought it would be fun to make the others upstairs think it was really a robber
So he cocked the pistol  you can cock it but it doesnt go off  and he said Come on Dick
and he rushed at the study door and burst into the room crying Surrender
you are discovered
Surrender or I fire
Throw up your hands
And as he finished saying it he saw before him standing on the study hearthrug a Real Robber
There was no mistake about it
Oswald was sure it was a robber because it had a screwdriver in its hands and was standing near the cupboard door that H O broke the lock off and there were gimlets and screws and things on the floor
There is nothing in that cupboard but old ledgers and magazines and the tool chest but of course a robber could not know that beforehand
When Oswald saw that there really was a robber and that he was so heavily armed with the screwdriver he did not feel comfortable
But he kept the pistol pointed at the robber and  you will hardly believe it but it is true  the robber threw down the screwdriver clattering on the other tools and he did throw up his hands and said  I surrender dont shoot me
How many of you are there
So Dicky said You are outnumbered
Are you armed
And the robber said No not in the least
And Oswald said still pointing the pistol and feeling very strong and brave and as if he was in a book Turn out your pockets
The robber did and while he turned them Out we looked at him
He was of the middle height and clad in a black frockcoat and grey trousers
His boots were a little gone at the sides and his shirtcuffs were a bit frayed but otherwise he was of gentlemanly demeanour
He had a thin wrinkled face with big light eyes that sparkled and then looked soft very queerly and a short beard
In his youth it must have been of a fair golden colour but now it was tinged with grey
Oswald was sorry for him especially when he saw that one of his pockets had a large hole in it and that he had nothing in his pockets but letters and string and three boxes of matches and a pipe and a handkerchief and a thin tobacco pouch and two pennies
We made him put all the things on the table and then he said  Well youve caught me what are you going to do with me
Police
Alice and H O had come down to be reinforcements when they heard a shout and when Alice saw that it was a Real Robber and that he had surrendered she clapped her hands and said Bravo boys
and so did H O
And now she said If he gives his word of honour not to escape I shouldnt call the police it seems a pity
Wait till Father comes home
The robber agreed to this and gave his word of honour and asked if he might put on a pipe and we said Yes and he sat in Fathers armchair and warmed his boots which steamed and I sent H O and Alice to put on some clothes and tell the others and bring down Dickys and my knickerbockers and the rest of the chestnuts
And they all came and we sat round the fire and it was jolly
The robber was very friendly and talked to us a great deal
I wasnt always in this low way of business he said when Noel said something about the things he had turned out of his pockets
Its a great comedown to a man like me
But if I must be caught its something to be caught by brave young heroes like you
My stars
How you did bolt into the room  Surrender and up with your hands
You might have been born and bred to the thiefcatching
Oswald is sorry if it was mean but he could not own up just then that he did not think there was any one in the study when he did that brave if rash act
He has told since
And what made you think there was any one in the house
the robber asked when he had thrown his head back and laughed for quite half a minute
So we told him
And he applauded our valour and Alice and H O explained that they would have said Surrender too only they were reinforcements
The robber ate some of the chestnuts  and we sat and wondered when Father would come home and what he would say to us for our intrepid conduct
And the robber told us of all the things he had done before he began to break into houses
Dicky picked up the tools from the floor and suddenly he said  Why this is Fathers screwdriver and his gimlets and all
Well I do call it jolly cheek to pick a mans locks with his own tools
True true said the robber
It is cheek of the jolliest
But you see Ive come down in the world
I was a highway robber once but horses are so expensive to hire  five shillings an hour you know  and I couldnt afford to keep them
The highwayman business isnt what it was
What about a bike
said H O
But the robber thought cycles were low  and besides you couldnt go across country with them when occasion arose as you could with a trusty steed
And he talked of highwaymen as if he knew just how we liked hearing it
Then he told us how he had been a pirate captain  and how he had sailed over waves mountains high and gained rich prizes  and how he did begin to think that here he had found a profession to his mind
I dont say there are no ups and downs in it he said especially in stormy weather
But what a trade
And a sword at your side and the Jolly Roger flying at the peak and a prize in sight
And all the black mouths of your guns pointed at the laden trader  and the wind in your favour and your trusty crew ready to live and die for you
Oh  but its a grand life
I did feel so sorry for him
He used such nice words and he had a gentlemans voice
Im sure you werent brought up to be a pirate said Dora
She had dressed even to her collar  and made Noel do it too  but the rest of us were in blankets with just a few odd things put on anyhow underneath
The robber frowned and sighed
No he said I was brought up to the law
I was at Balliol bless your hearts and thats true anyway
He sighed again and looked hard at the fire
That was my Fathers college H O was beginning but Dicky said  Why did you leave off being a pirate
A pirate
he said as if he had not been thinking of such things
Oh yes why I gave it up because  because I could not get over the dreadful seasickness
Nelson was seasick said Oswald
Ah said the robber but I hadnt his luck or his pluck or something
He stuck to it and won Trafalgar didnt he
Kiss me Hardy  and all that eh
I couldnt stick to it  I had to resign
And nobody kissed me
I saw by his understanding about Nelson that he was really a man who had been to a good school as well as to Balliol
Then we asked him And what did you do then
And Alice asked if he was ever a coiner and we told him how we had thought wed caught the desperate gang next door and he was very much interested and said he was glad he had never taken to coining
Besides the coins are so ugly nowadays he said no one could really find any pleasure in making them
And its a holeandcorner business at the best isnt it
 and it must be a very thirsty one  with the hot metal and furnaces and things
And again he looked at the fire
Oswald forgot for a minute that the interesting stranger was a robber and asked him if he wouldnt have a drink
Oswald has heard Father do this to his friends so he knows it is the right thing
The robber said he didnt mind if he did
And that is right too
And Dora went and got a bottle of Fathers ale  the Light Sparkling Family  and a glass and we gave it to the robber
Dora said she would be responsible
Then when he had had a drink he told us about bandits but he said it was so bad in wet weather
Bandits caves were hardly ever properly weathertight
And bushranging was the same
As a matter of fact he said I was bushranging this afternoon among the furzebushes on the Heath but I had no luck
I stopped the Lord Mayor in his gilt coach with all his footmen in plush and gold lace smart as cockatoos
But it was no go
The Lord Mayor hadnt a stiver in his pockets
One of the footmen had six new pennies the Lord Mayor always pays his servants wages in new pennies
I spent fourpence of that in bread and cheese that on the tables the tuppence
Ah its a poor trade
And then he filled his pipe again
We had turned out the gas so that Father should have a jolly good surprise when he did come home and we sat and talked as pleasant as could be
I never liked a new man better than I liked that robber
And I felt so sorry for him
He told us he had been a warcorrespondent and an editor in happier days as well as a horsestealer and a colonel of dragoons
And quite suddenly just as we were telling him about Lord Tottenham and our being highwaymen ourselves he put up his hand and said Shish
and we were quiet and listened
There was a scrape scrape scraping noise it came from downstairs
Theyre filing something whispered the robber here  shut up give me that pistol and the poker
There is a burglar now and no mistake
Its only a toy one and it wont go off I said but you can cock it
Then we heard a snap
There goes the window bar said the robber softly
Jove
what an adventure
You kids stay here Ill tackle it
But Dicky and I said we should come
So he let us go as far as the bottom of the kitchen stairs and we took the tongs and shovel with us
There was a light in the kitchen a very little light
It is curious we never thought any of us that this might be a plant of our robbers to get away
We never thought of doubting his word of honour
And we were right
That noble robber dashed the kitchen door open and rushed in with the big toy pistol in one hand and the poker in the other shouting out just like Oswald had done  Surrender
You are discovered
Surrender or Ill fire
Throw up your hands
And Dicky and I rattled the tongs and shovel so that he might know there were more of us all bristling with weapons
And we heard a husky voice in the kitchen saying  All right governor
Stow that scent sprinkler
Ill give in
Blowed if I aint pretty well sick of the job anyway
Then we went in
Our robber was standing in the grandest manner with his legs very wide apart and the pistol pointing at the cowering burglar
The burglar was a large man who did not mean to have a beard I think but he had got some of one and a red comforter and a fur cap and his face was red and his voice was thick
How different from our own robber
The burglar had a dark lantern and he was standing by the platebasket
When we had lit the gas we all thought he was very like what a burglar ought to be
He did not look as if he could ever have been a pirate or a highwayman or anything really dashing or noble and he scowled and shuffled his feet and said Well go on why dont yer fetch the pleece
Upon my word I dont know said our robber rubbing his chin
Oswald why dont we fetch the police
It is not every robber that I would stand Christian names from I can tell you but just then I didnt think of that
I just said  Do you mean Im to fetch one
Our robber looked at the burglar and said nothing
Then the burglar began to speak very fast and to look different ways with his hard shiny little eyes
Lookee ere governor he said I was stony broke so help me I was
And blessed if Ive nicked a haporth of your little lot
You know yourself there aint much to tempt a bloke he shook the platebasket as if he was angry with it and the yellowy spoons and forks rattled
I was just alooking through this ere Bankollerday show when you come
Let me off sir
Come now Ive got kids of my own at home strike me if I aint  same as yours  Ive got a nipper just about is size and whatll come of them if Im lagged
I aint been in it long sir and I aint andy at it
No said our robber you certainly are not
Alice and the others had come down by now to see what was happening
Alice told me afterwards they thought it really was the cat this time
No I aint andy as you say sir and if you let me off this once Ill chuck the whole blooming bizz rake my civvy I will
Dont be hard on a cove mister think of the missis and the kids
Ive got one just the cut of little missy there bless er pretty eart
Your family certainly fits your circumstances very nicely said our robber
Then Alice said  Oh do let him go
If hes got a little girl like me whatever will she do
Suppose it was Father
I dont think hes got a little girl like you my dear said our robber and I think hell be safer under lock and key
You ask yer Father to let me go miss said the burglar e wont ave the art to refuse you
If I do said Alice will you promise never to come back
Not me miss the burglar said very earnestly and he looked at the platebasket again as if that alone would be enough to keep him away our robber said afterwards
And will you be good and not rob any more
said Alice
Ill turn over a noo leaf miss so help me
Then Alice said  Oh do let him go
Im sure hell be good
But our robber said no it wouldnt be right we must wait till Father came home
Then H O said very suddenly and plainly I dont think its at all fair when youre a robber yourself
The minute hed said it the burglar said Kidded by gum
 and then our robber made a step towards him to catch hold of him and before you had time to think Hullo
the burglar knocked the pistol up with one hand and knocked our robber down with the other and was off out of the window like a shot though Oswald and Dicky did try to stop him by holding on to his legs
And that burglar had the cheek to put his head in at the window and say Ill give yer love to the kids and the missis  and he was off like winking and there were Alice and Dora trying to pick up our robber and asking him whether he was hurt and where
He wasnt hurt at all except a lump at the back of his head
And he got up and we dusted the kitchen floor off him
Eliza is a dirty girl
Then he said Lets put up the shutters
It never rains but it pours
Now youve had two burglars I daresay youll have twenty
So we put up the shutters which Eliza has strict orders to do before she goes out only she never does and we went back to Fathers study and the robber said What a night we are having
and put his boots back in the fender to go on steaming and then we all talked at once
It was the most wonderful adventure we ever had though it wasnt treasureseeking  at least not ours
I suppose it was the burglars treasureseeking but he didnt get much  and our robber said he didnt believe a word about those kids that were so like Alice and me
And then there was the click of the gate and we said Heres Father and the robber said And now for the police
Then we all jumped up
We did like him so much and it seemed so unfair that he should be sent to prison and the horrid lumping big burglar not
And Alice said Oh no  run
Dicky will let you out at the back door
Oh do go go now
And we all said Yes go and pulled him towards the door and gave him his hat and stick and the things out of his pockets
But Fathers latchkey was in the door and it was too late
Father came in quickly purring with the cold and began to say Its all right Foulkes Ive got  And then he stopped short and stared at us
Then he said in the voice we all hate Children what is the meaning of all this
And for a minute nobody spoke
Then my Father said Foulkes I must really apologize for these very naughty  And then our robber rubbed his hands and laughed and cried out Youre mistaken my dear sir Im not Foulkes Im a robber captured by these young people in the most gallant manner
Hands up surrender or I fire and all the rest of it
My word Bastable but youve got some kids worth having
I wish my Denny had their pluck
Then we began to understand and it was like being knocked down it was so sudden
And our robber told us he wasnt a robber after all
He was only an old college friend of my Fathers and he had come after dinner when Father was just trying to mend the lock H O had broken to ask Father to get him a letter to a doctor about his little boy Denny who was ill And Father had gone over the Heath to Vanbrugh Park to see some rich people he knows and get the letter
And he had left Mr Foulkes to wait till he came back because it was important to know at once whether Father could get the letter and if he couldnt Mr Foulkes would have had to try some one else directly
We were dumb with amazement
Our robber told my Father about the other burglar and said he was sorry hed let him escape but my Father said Oh its all right poor beggar if he really had kids at home you never can tell  forgive us our debts dont you know but tell me about the first business
It must have been moderately entertaining
Then our robber told my Father how I had rushed into the room with a pistol crying out  but you know all about that
And he laid it on so thick and fat about plucky younguns and chips of old blocks and things like that that I felt I was purple with shame even under the blanket
So I swallowed that thing that tries to prevent you speaking when you ought to and I said Look here Father I didnt really think there was any one in the study
We thought it was a cat at first and then I thought there was no one there and I was just larking
And when I said surrender and all that it was just the game dont you know
Then our robber said Yes old chap but when you found there really was some one there you dropped the pistol and bunked didnt you eh
And I said No I thought Hullo
heres a robber
Well its all up I suppose but I may as well hold on and see what happens
And I was glad Id owned up for Father slapped me on the back and said I was a young brick and our robber said I was no funk anyway and though I got very hot under the blanket I liked it and I explained that the others would have done the same if they had thought of it
Then Father got up some more beer and laughed about Doras responsibility and he got out a box of figs he had bought for us only he hadnt given it to us because of the Water Rates and Eliza came in and brought up the bread and cheese and what there was left of the neck of mutton  cold wreck of mutton Father called it  and we had a feast  like a picnic  all sitting anywhere and eating with our fingers
It was prime
We sat up till past twelve oclock and I never felt so pleased to think I was not born a girl
It was hard on the others they would have done just the same if theyd thought of it
But it does make you feel jolly when your pater says youre a young brick
When Mr Foulkes was going he said to Alice Goodbye Hardy
And Alice understood of course and kissed him as hard as she could
And she said I wanted to when you said no one kissed you when you left off being a pirate
And he said I know you did my dear
And Dora kissed him too and said I suppose none of these tales were true
And our robber just said I tried to play the part properly my dear
And he jolly well did play it and no mistake
We have often seen him since and his boy Denny and his girl Daisy but that comes in another story
And if any of you kids who read this ever had two such adventures in one night you can just write and tell me
Thats all
CHAPTER 14 THE DIVININGROD You have no idea how uncomfortable the house was on the day when we sought for gold with the diviningrod
It was like a springcleaning in the wintertime
All the carpets were up because Father had told Eliza to make the place decent as there was a gentleman coming to dinner the next day
So she got in a charwoman and they slopped water about and left brooms and brushes on the stairs for people to tumble over
H O got a big bump on his head in that way and when he said it was too bad Eliza said he should keep in the nursery then and not be where hed no business
We bandaged his head with a towel and then he stopped crying and played at being Englands wounded hero dying in the cockpit while every man was doing his duty as the hero had told them to and Alice was Hardy and I was the doctor and the others were the crew
Playing at Hardy made us think of our own dear robber and we wished he was there and wondered if we should ever see him any more
We were rather astonished at Fathers having anyone to dinner because now he never seems to think of anything but business
Before Mother died people often came to dinner and Fathers business did not take up so much of his time and was not the bother it is now
And we used to see who could go furthest down in our nightgowns and get nice things to eat without being seen out of the dishes as they came out of the diningroom
Eliza cant cook very nice things
She told Father she was a good plain cook but he says it was a fancy portrait
We stayed in the nursery till the charwoman came in and told us to be off  she was going to make one job of it and have our carpet up as well as all the others now the man was here to beat them
It came up and it was very dusty  and under it we found my threepennybit that I lost ages ago which shows what Eliza is
H O had got tired of being the wounded hero and Dicky was so tired of doing nothing that Dora said she knew hed begin to tease Noel in a minute then of course Dicky said he wasnt going to tease anybody  he was going out to the Heath
He said hed heard that nagging women drove a man from his home and now he found it was quite true
Oswald always tries to be a peacemaker so he told Dicky to shut up and not make an ass of himself
And Alice said Well Dora began  And Dora tossed her chin up and said it wasnt any business of Oswalds any way and no one asked Alices opinion
So we all felt very uncomfortable till NoEl said Dont lets quarrel about nothing
You know let dogs delight  and I made up another piece while you were talking  Quarrelling is an evil thing It fills with gall lifes cup For when once you begin It takes such a long time to make it up
We all laughed then and stopped jawing at each other
Noel is very funny with his poetry
But that piece happened to come out quite true
You begin to quarrel and then you cant stop often long before the others are ready to cry and make it up I see how silly it is and I want to laugh but it doesnt do to say so  for it only makes the others crosser than they were before
I wonder why that is
Alice said Noel ought to be poet laureate and she actually went out in the cold and got some laurel leaves  the spotted kind  out of the garden and Dora made a crown and we put it on him
He was quite pleased but the leaves made a mess and Eliza said Dont
I believe thats a word grownups use more than any other
Then suddenly Alice thought of that old idea of hers for finding treasure and she said  Do lets try the diviningrod
So Oswald said Fair priestess we do greatly desire to find gold beneath our land therefore we pray thee practise with the diviningrod and tell us where we can find it
Do ye desire to fashion of it helms and hauberks
said Alice
Yes said Noel and chains and ouches
I bet you dont know what an ouch is said Dicky
Yes I do so there
said Noel
Its a carcanet
I looked it out in the dicker now then
We asked him what a carcanet was but he wouldnt say
And we want to make fair goblets of the gold said Oswald
Yes to drink coconut milk out of said H O
And we desire to build fair palaces of it said Dicky
And to buy things said Dora a great many things
New Sunday frocks and hats and kid gloves and  She would have gone on for ever so long only we reminded her that we hadnt found the gold yet
By this Alice had put on the nursery tablecloth which is green and tied the old blue and yellow antimacassar over her head and she said  If your intentions are correct fear nothing and follow me
And she went down into the hall
We all followed chanting Heroes
It is a gloomy thing the girls learnt at the High School and we always use it when we want a priestly chant
Alice stopped short by the hatstand and held up her hands as well as she could for the tablecloth and said  Now great altar of the golden idol yield me the diviningrod that I may use it for the good of the suffering people
The umbrellastand was the altar of the golden idol and it yielded her the old school umbrella
She carried it between her palms
Now she said I shall sing the magic chant
You mustnt say anything but just follow wherever I go  like follow my leader you know  and when there is gold underneath the magic rod will twist in the hand of the priestess like a live thing that seeks to be free
Then you will dig and the golden treasure will be revealed
H O if you make that clatter with your boots theyll come and tell us not to
Now come on all of you
So she went upstairs and down and into every room
We followed her on tiptoe and Alice sang as she went
What she sang is not out of a book  Noel made it up while she was dressing up for the priestess
Ashen rod cold That here I hold Teach me where to find the gold
When we came to where Eliza was she said Get along with you but Dora said it was only a game and we wouldnt touch anything and our boots were quite clean and Eliza might as well let us
So she did
It was all right for the priestess but it was a little dull for the rest of us because she wouldnt let us sing too so we said wed had enough of it and if she couldnt find the gold wed leave off and play something else
The priestess said All right wait a minute and went on singing
Then we all followed her back into the nursery where the carpet was up and the boards smelt of soft soap
Then she said It moves it moves
Once more the choral hymn
So we sang Heroes again and in the middle the umbrella dropped from her hands
The magic rod has spoken said Alice dig here and that with courage and despatch
We didnt quite see how to dig but we all began to scratch on the floor with our hands but the priestess said Dont be so silly
Its the place where they come to do the gas
The boards loose
Dig an you value your lives for ere sundown the dragon who guards this spoil will return in his fiery fury and make you his unresisting prey
So we dug  that is we got the loose board up
And Alice threw up her arms and cried  See the rich treasure  the gold in thick layers with silver and diamonds stuck in it
Like currants in cake said H O
Its a lovely treasure said Dicky yawning
Lets come back and carry it away another day
But Alice was kneeling by the hole
Let me feast my eyes on the golden splendour she said hidden these long centuries from the human eye
Behold how the magic rod has led us to treasures more  Oswald dont push so
 more bright than ever monarch  I say there is something down there really
I saw it shine
We thought she was kidding but when she began to try to get into the hole which was much too small we saw she meant it so I said Lets have a squint and I looked but I couldnt see anything even when I lay down on my stomach
The others lay down on their stomachs too and tried to see all but Noel who stood and looked at us and said we were the great serpents come down to drink at the magic pool
He wanted to be the knight and slay the great serpents with his good sword  he even drew the umbrella ready  but Alice said All right we will in a minute
But now  Im sure I saw it do get a match Noel theres a dear
What did you see
asked Noel beginning to go for the matches very slowly
Something bright away in the corner under the board against the beam
Perhaps it was a rats eye Noel said or a snakes and we did not put our heads quite so close to the hole till he came back with the matches
Then I struck a match and Alice cried There it is
And there it was and it was a halfsovereign partly dusty and partly bright
We think perhaps a mouse disturbed by the carpets being taken up may have brushed the dust of years from part of the halfsovereign with his tail
We cant imagine how it came there only Dora thinks she remembers once when H O was very little Mother gave him some money to hold and he dropped it and it rolled all over the floor
So we think perhaps this was part of it
We were very glad
H O wanted to go out at once and buy a mask he had seen for fourpence
It had been a shilling mask but now it was going very cheap because Guy Fawkes Day was over and it was a little cracked at the top
but Dora said I dont know that its our money
Lets wait and ask Father
But H O did not care about waiting and I felt for him
Dora is rather like grownups in that way she does not seem to understand that when you want a thing you do want it and that you dont wish to wait even a minute
So we went and asked Albertnextdoors uncle
He was pegging away at one of the rotten novels he has to write to make his living but he said we werent interrupting him at all
My heros folly has involved him in a difficulty he said
It is his own fault
I will leave him to meditate on the incredible fatuity  the hare brained recklessness  which have brought him to this pass
It will be a lesson to him
I meantime will give myself unreservedly to the pleasures of your conversation
Thats one thing I like Alberts uncle for
He always talks like a book and yet you can always understand what he means
I think he is more like us inside of his mind than most grownup people are
He can pretend beautifully
I never met anyone else so good at it except our robber and we began it with him
But it was Alberts uncle who first taught us how to make people talk like books when youre playing things and he made us learn to tell a story straight from the beginning not starting in the middle like most people do
So now Oswald remembered what he had been told as he generally does and began at the beginning but when he came to where Alice said she was the priestess Alberts uncle said  Let the priestess herself set forth the tale in fitting speech
So Alice said O high priest of the great idol the humblest of thy slaves took the school umbrella for a diviningrod and sang the song of inver  whatsitsname
Invocation perhaps
said Alberts uncle
Yes and then I went about and about and the others got tired so the diviningrod fell on a certain spot and I said Dig and we dug  it was where the loose board is for the gas men  and then there really and truly was a halfsovereign lying under the boards and here it is
Alberts uncle took it and looked at it
The great high priest will bite it to see if its good he said and he did
I congratulate you he went on you are indeed among those favoured by the Immortals
First you find halfcrowns in the garden and now this
The high priest advises you to tell your Father and ask if you may keep it
My hero has become penitent but impatient
I must pull him out of this scrape
Ye have my leave to depart
Of course we know from Kipling that that means Youd better bunk and be sharp about it so we came away
I do like Alberts uncle
I shall be like that when Im a man
He gave us our jungle books and he is awfully clever though he does have to write grownup tales
We told Father about it that night
He was very kind
He said we might certainly have the halfsovereign and he hoped we should enjoy ourselves with our treasuretrove
Then he said Your dear Mothers Indian Uncle is coming to dinner here tomorrow night
So will you not drag the furniture about overhead please more than youre absolutely obliged and H O might wear slippers or something
I can always distinguish the note of H
O
s boots
We said we would be very quiet and Father went on  This Indian Uncle is not used to children and he is coming to talk business with me
It is really important that he should be quiet
Do you think Dora that perhaps bed at six for H O and Noel  But H O said Father I really and truly wont make a noise
Ill stand on my head all the evening sooner than disturb the Indian Uncle with my boots
And Alice said Noel never made a row anyhow
So Father laughed and said All right
And he said we might do as we liked with the halfsovereign
Only for goodness sake dont try to go in for business with it he said
Its always a mistake to go into business with an insufficient capital
We talked it over all that evening and we decided that as we were not to go into business with our halfsovereign it was no use not spending it at once and so we might as well have a right royal feast
The next day we went out and bought the things
We got figs and almonds and raisins and a real raw rabbit and Eliza promised to cook it for us if we would wait till tomorrow because of the Indian Uncle coming to dinner
She was very busy cooking nice things for him to eat
We got the rabbit because we are so tired of beef and mutton and Father hasnt a bill at the poultry shop
And we got some flowers to go on the dinnertable for Fathers party
And we got hardbake and raspberry noyau and peppermint rock and oranges and a coconut with other nice things
We put it all in the top long drawer
It is H
O
s play drawer and we made him turn his things out and put them in Fathers old portmanteau
H O is getting old enough now to learn to be unselfish and besides his drawer wanted tidying very badly
Then we all vowed by the honour of the ancient House of Bastable that we would not touch any of the feast till Dora gave the word next day
And we gave H O some of the hardbake to make it easier for him to keep his vow
The next day was the most rememorable day in all our lives but we didnt know that then
But that is another story
I think that is such a useful way to know when you cant think how to end up a chapter
I learnt it from another writer named Kipling
Ive mentioned him before I believe but he deserves it
CHAPTER 15 Lo THE POOR INDIAN
It was all very well for Father to ask us not to make a row because the Indian Uncle was coming to talk business but my young brothers boots are not the only things that make a noise
We took his boots away and made him wear Doras bath slippers which are soft and woolly and hardly any soles to them and of course we wanted to see the Uncle so we looked over the banisters when he came and we were as quiet as mice  but when Eliza had let him in she went straight down to the kitchen and made the most awful row you ever heard it sounded like the Day of judgement or all the saucepans and crockery in the house being kicked about the floor but she told me afterwards it was only the teatray and one or two cups and saucers that she had knocked over in her flurry
We heard the Uncle say God bless my soul
and then he went into Fathers study and the door was shut  we didnt see him properly at all that time
I dont believe the dinner was very nice
Something got burned Im sure  for we smelt it
It was an extra smell besides the mutton
I know that got burned
Eliza wouldnt have any of us in the kitchen except Dora  till dinner was over
Then we got what was left of the dessert and had it on the stairs  just round the corner where they cant see you from the hall unless the first landing gas is lighted
Suddenly the study door opened and the Uncle came out and went and felt in his greatcoat pocket
It was his cigarcase he wanted
We saw that afterwards
We got a much better view of him then
He didnt look like an Indian but just like a kind of brown big Englishman and of course he didnt see us but we heard him mutter to himself  Shocking bad dinner
Eh
 what
When he went back to the study he didnt shut the door properly
That door has always been a little tiresome since the day we took the lock off to get out the pencil sharpener H O had shoved into the keyhole
We didnt listen  really and truly  but the Indian Uncle has a very big voice and Father was not going to be beaten by a poor Indian in talking or anything else  so he spoke up too like a man and I heard him say it was a very good business and only wanted a little capital  and he said it as if it was an imposition he had learned and he hated having to say it
The Uncle said Pooh pooh
to that and then he said he was afraid that what that same business wanted was not capital but management
Then I heard my Father say It is not a pleasant subject I am sorry I introduced it
Suppose we change it sir
Let me fill your glass
Then the poor Indian said something about vintage  and that a poor broken down man like he was couldnt be too careful
And then Father said Well whisky then and afterwards they talked about Native Races and Imperial something or other and it got very dull
So then Oswald remembered that you must not hear what people do not intend you to hear  even if you are not listening and he said We ought not to stay here any longer
Perhaps they would not like us to hear
Alice said Oh do you think it could possibly matter
and went and shut the study door softly but quite tight
So it was no use staying there any longer and we went to the nursery
Then Noel said Now I understand
Of course my Father is making a banquet for the Indian because he is a poor brokendown man
We might have known that from Lo the poor Indian
you know
We all agreed with him and we were glad to have the thing explained because we had not understood before what Father wanted to have people to dinner for  and not let us come in
Poor people are very proud said Alice and I expect Father thought the Indian would be ashamed if all of us children knew how poor he was
Then Dora said Poverty is no disgrace
We should honour honest Poverty
And we all agreed that that was so
I wish his dinner had not been so nasty Dora said while Oswald put lumps of coal on the fire with his fingers so as not to make a noise
He is a very thoughtful boy and he did not wipe his fingers on his trouser leg as perhaps Noel or H O would have done but he just rubbed them on Doras handkerchief while she was talking
I am afraid the dinner was horrid
Dora went on
The table looked very nice with the flowers we got
I set it myself and Eliza made me borrow the silver spoons and forks from Albertnextdoors Mother
I hope the poor Indian is honest said Dicky gloomily when you are a poor brokendown man silver spoons must be a great temptation
Oswald told him not to talk such tommyrot because the Indian was a relation so of course he couldnt do anything dishonourable
And Dora said it was all right any way because she had washed up the spoons and forks herself and counted them and they were all there and she had put them into their washleather bag and taken them back to Albertnextdoors Mother
And the brussels sprouts were all wet and swimmy she went on and the potatoes looked grey  and there were bits of black in the gravy  and the mutton was blueyred and soft in the middle
I saw it when it came out
The applepie looked very nice  but it wasnt quite done in the apply part
The other thing that was burnt  you must have smelt it was the soup
It is a pity said Oswald I dont suppose he gets a good dinner every day
No more do we said H O but we shall tomorrow
I thought of all the things we had bought with our halfsovereign  the rabbit and the sweets and the almonds and raisins and figs and the coconut and I thought of the nasty mutton and things and while I was thinking about it all Alice said  lets ask the poor Indian to come to dinner with us tomorrow
I should have said it myself if she had given me time
We got the little ones to go to bed by promising to put a note on their dressingtable saying what had happened so that they might know the first thing in the morning or in the middle of the night if they happened to wake up and then we elders arranged everything
I waited by the back door and when the Uncle was beginning to go Dicky was to drop a marble down between the banisters for a signal so that I could run round and meet the Uncle as he came out
This seems like deceit but if you are a thoughtful and considerate boy you will understand that we could not go down and say to the Uncle in the hall under Fathers eye Father has given you a beastly nasty dinner but if you will come to dinner with us tomorrow we will show you our idea of good things to eat
You will see if you think it over that this would not have been at all polite to Father
So when the Uncle left Father saw him to the door and let him out and then went back to the study looking very sad Dora says
As the poor Indian came down our steps he saw me there at the gate
I did not mind his being poor and I said Good evening Uncle just as politely as though he had been about to ascend into one of the gilded chariots of the rich and affluent instead of having to walk to the station a quarter of a mile in the mud unless he had the money for a tram fare
Good evening Uncle
I said it again for he stood staring at me
I dont suppose he was used to politeness from boys  some boys are anything but  especially to the Aged Poor
So I said Good evening Uncle yet once again
Then he said  Time you were in bed young man
Eh
 what
Then I saw I must speak plainly with him man to man
So I did
I said  Youve been dining with my Father and we couldnt help hearing you say the dinner was shocking
So we thought as youre an Indian perhaps youre very poor  I didnt like to tell him we had heard the dreadful truth from his own lips so I went on because of Lo the poor Indian  you know  and you cant get a good dinner every day
And we are very sorry if youre poor and wont you come and have dinner with us tomorrow  with us children I mean
Its a very very good dinner  rabbit and hardbake and coconut  and you neednt mind us knowing you re poor because we know honourable poverty is no disgrace and  I could have gone on much longer but he interrupted me to say  Upon my word
And whats your name eh
Oswald Bastable I said and I do hope you people who are reading this story have not guessed before that I was Oswald all the time
Oswald Bastable eh
Bless my soul
said the poor Indian
Yes Ill dine with you Mr Oswald Bastable with all the pleasure in life
Very kind and cordial invitation Im sure
Good night sir
At one oclock I presume
Yes at one I said
Good night sir
Then I went in and told the others and we wrote a paper and put it on the boys dressing table and it said  The poor Indian is coming at one
He seemed very grateful to me for my kindness
We did not tell Father that the Uncle was coming to dinner with us for the polite reason that I have explained before
But we had to tell Eliza so we said a friend was coming to dinner and we wanted everything very nice
I think she thought it was Albertnextdoor but she was in a good temper that day and she agreed to cook the rabbit and to make a pudding with currants in it
And when one oclock came the Indian Uncle came too
I let him in and helped him off with his greatcoat which was all furry inside and took him straight to the nursery
We were to have dinner there as usual for we had decided from the first that he would enjoy himself more if he was not made a stranger of
We agreed to treat him as one of ourselves because if we were too polite he might think it was our pride because he was poor
He shook hands with us all and asked our ages and what schools we went to and shook his head when we said we were having a holiday just now
I felt rather uncomfortable  I always do when they talk about schools  and I couldnt think of anything to say to show him we meant to treat him as one of ourselves
I did ask if he played cricket
He said he had not played lately
And then no one said anything till dinner came in
We had all washed our faces and hands and brushed our hair before he came in and we all looked very nice especially Oswald who had had his hair cut that very morning
When Eliza had brought in the rabbit and gone out again we looked at each other in silent despair like in books
It seemed as if it were going to be just a dull dinner like the one the poor Indian had had the night before only of course the things to eat would be nicer
Dicky kicked Oswald under the table to make him say something  and he had his new boots on too
 but Oswald did not kick back then the Uncle asked  Do you carve sir or shall I
Suddenly Alice said  Would you like grownup dinner Uncle or playdinner
He did not hesitate a moment but said Playdinner by all means
Eh
 what
and then we knew it was all right
So we at once showed the Uncle how to be a dauntless hunter
The rabbit was the deer we had slain in the green forest with our trusty yew bows and we toasted the joints of it when the Uncle had carved it on bits of firewood sharpened to a point
The Uncles piece got a little burnt but he said it was delicious and he said game was always nicer when you had killed it yourself
When Eliza had taken away the rabbit bones and brought in the pudding we waited till she had gone out and shut the door and then we put the dish down on the floor and slew the pudding in the dish in the good oldfashioned way
It was a wild boar at bay and very hard indeed to kill even with forks
The Uncle was very fierce indeed with the pudding and jumped and howled when he speared it but when it came to his turn to be helped he said No thank you think of my liver
Eh
 what
But he had some almonds and raisins  when we had climbed to the top of the chest of drawers to pluck them from the boughs of the great trees and he had a fig from the cargo that the rich merchants brought in their ship  the long drawer was the ship  and the rest of us had the sweets and the coconut
It was a very glorious and beautiful feast and when it was over we said we hoped it was better than the dinner last night
And he said I never enjoyed a dinner more
He was too polite to say what he really thought about Fathers dinner
And we saw that though he might be poor he was a true gentleman
He smoked a cigar while we finished up what there was left to eat and told us about tiger shooting and about elephants
We asked him about wigwams and wampum and mocassins and beavers but he did not seem to know or else he was shy about talking of the wonders of his native land
We liked him very much indeed and when he was going at last Alice nudged me and I said  Theres one and threepence farthing left out of our halfsovereign
Will you take it please because we do like you very much indeed and we dont want it really and we would rather you had it
And I put the money into his hand
Ill take the threepennybit he said turning the money over and looking at it but I couldnt rob you of the rest
By the way where did you get the money for this most royal spread  half a sovereign you said  eh what
We told him all about the different ways we had looked for treasure and when we had been telling some time he sat down to listen better and at last we told him how Alice had played at diviningrod and how it really had found a halfsovereign
Then he said he would like to see her do it again
But we explained that the rod would only show gold and silver and that we were quite sure there was no more gold in the house because we happened to have looked very carefully
Well silver then said he lets hide the platebasket and little Alice shall make the diviningrod find it
Eh
 what
There isnt any silver in the platebasket now Dora said
Eliza asked me to borrow the silver spoons and forks for your dinner last night from Albertnextdoors Mother
Father never notices but she thought it would be nicer for you
Our own silver went to have the dents taken out and I dont think Father could afford to pay the man for doing it for the silver hasnt come back
Bless my soul
said the Uncle again looking at the hole in the big chair that we burnt when we had Guy Fawkes Day indoors
And how much pocketmoney do you get
Eh
 what
We dont have any now said Alice but indeed we dont want the other shilling
Wed much rather you had it wouldnt we
And the rest of us said Yes
The Uncle wouldnt take it but he asked a lot of questions and at last he went away
And when he went he said  Well youngsters Ive enjoyed myself very much
I shant forget your kind hospitality
Perhaps the poor Indian may be in a position to ask you all to dinner some day
Oswald said if he ever could we should like to come very much but he was not to trouble to get such a nice dinner as ours because we could do very well with cold mutton and rice pudding
We do not like these things but Oswald knows how to behave
Then the poor Indian went away
We had not got any treasure by this party but we had had a very good time and I am sure the Uncle enjoyed himself
We were so sorry he was gone that we could none of us eat much tea but we did not mind because we had pleased the poor Indian and enjoyed ourselves too
Besides as Dora said A contented mind is a continual feast so it did not matter about not wanting tea
Only H O did not seem to think a continual feast was a contented mind and Eliza gave him a powder in what was left of the redcurrant jelly Father had for the nasty dinner
But the rest of us were quite well and I think it must have been the coconut with H O
We hoped nothing had disagreed with the Uncle but we never knew
CHAPTER 16 THE END OF THE TREASURESEEKING Now it is coming near the end of our treasureseeking and the end was so wonderful that now nothing is like It used to be
It is like as if our fortunes had been in an earthquake and after those you know everything comes out wrongway up
The day after the Uncle speared the pudding with us opened in gloom and sadness
But you never know
It was destined to be a day when things happened
Yet no sign of this appeared in the early morning
Then all was misery and upsetness
None of us felt quite well I dont know why and Father had one of his awful colds so Dora persuaded him not to go to London but to stay cosy and warm in the study and she made him some gruel
She makes it better than Eliza does Elizas gruel is all little lumps and when you suck them it is dry oatmeal inside
We kept as quiet as we could and I made H O do some lessons like the G B had advised us to
But it was very dull
There are some days when you seem to have got to the end of all the things that could ever possibly happen to you and you feel you will spend all the rest of your life doing dull things just the same way
Days like this are generally wet days
But as I said you never know
Then Dicky said if things went on like this he should run away to sea and Alice said she thought it would be rather nice to go into a convent
H O was a little disagreeable because of the powder Eliza had given him so he tried to read two books at once one with each eye just because Noel wanted one of the books which was very selfish of him so it only made his headache worse
H O is getting old enough to learn by experience that it is wrong to be selfish and when he complained about his head Oswald told him whose fault it was because I am older than he is and it is my duty to show him where he is wrong
But he began to cry and then Oswald had to cheer him up because of Father wanting to be quiet
So Oswald said  Theyll eat H O if you dont look out
And Dora said Oswald was too bad
Of course Oswald was not going to interfere again so he went to look out of the window and see the trams go by and by and by H O came and looked out too and Oswald who knows when to be generous and forgiving gave him a piece of blue pencil and two nibs as good as new to keep
As they were looking out at the rain splashing on the stones in the street they saw a fourwheeled cab come lumbering up from the way the station is
Oswald called out  Here comes the coach of the Fairy Godmother
Itll stop here you see if it doesnt
So they all came to the window to look
Oswald had only said that about stopping and he was stricken with wonder and amaze when the cab really did stop
It had boxes on the top and knobby parcels sticking out of the window and it was something like going away to the seaside and something like the gentleman who takes things about in a carriage with the wooden shutters up to sell to the drapers shops
The cabman got down and some one inside handed out ever so many parcels of different shapes and sizes and the cabman stood holding them in his arms and grinning over them
Dora said It is a pity some one doesnt tell him this isnt the house
And then from inside the cab some one put out a foot feeling for the step like a tortoises foot coming out from under his shell when you are holding him off the ground and then a leg came and more parcels and then Noel cried  Its the poor Indian
And it was
Eliza opened the door and we were all leaning over the banisters
Father heard the noise of parcels and boxes in the hall and he came out without remembering how bad his cold was
If you do that yourself when you have a cold they call you careless and naughty
Then we heard the poor Indian say to Father  I say Dick I dined with your kids yesterday  as I daresay theyve told you
jolliest little cubs I ever saw
Why didnt you let me see them the other night
The eldest is the image of poor Janey  and as to young Oswald hes a man
If hes not a man Im a nigger
Eh
 what
And Dick I say I shouldnt wonder if I could find a friend to put a bit into that business of yours  eh
Then he and Father went into the study and the door was shut  and we went down and looked at the parcels
Some were done up in old dirty newspapers and tied with bits of rag and some were in brown paper and string from the shops and there were boxes
We wondered if the Uncle had come to stay and this was his luggage or whether it was to sell
Some of it smelt of spices like merchandise  and one bundle Alice felt certain was a bale
We heard a hand on the knob of the study door after a bit and Alice said  Fly
and we all got away but H O and the Uncle caught him by the leg as he was trying to get upstairs after us
Peeping at the baggage eh
said the Uncle and the rest of us came down because it would have been dishonourable to leave H O alone in a scrape and we wanted to see what was in the parcels
I didnt touch said H O
Are you coming to stay
I hope you are
No harm done if you did touch said the good kind Indian man to all of us
For all these parcels are for you
I have several times told you about our being dumb with amazement and terror and joy and things like that but I never remember us being dumber than we were when he said this
The Indian Uncle went on I told an old friend of mine what a pleasant dinner I had with you and about the threepennybit and the diviningrod and all that and he sent all these odds and ends as presents for you
Some of the things came from India
Have you come from India Uncle
Noel asked and when he said Yes we were all very much surprised for we never thought of his being that sort of Indian
We thought he was the Red kind and of course his not being accounted for his ignorance of beavers and things
He got Eliza to help and we took all the parcels into the nursery and he undid them and undid them and undid them till the papers lay thick on the floor
Father came too and sat in the Guy Fawkes chair
I cannot begin to tell you all the things that kind friend of Uncles had sent us
He must be a very agreeable person
There were toys for the kids and model engines for Dick and me and a lot of books and Japanese china teasets for the girls red and white and gold  there were sweets by the pound and by the box  and long yards and yards of soft silk from India to make frocks for the girls  and a real Indian sword for Oswald and a book of Japanese pictures for Noel and some ivory chess men for Dicky the castles of the chessmen are elephantandcastles
There is a railway station called that I never knew what it meant before
The brown paper and string parcels had boxes of games in them  and big cases of preserved fruits and things
And the shabby old newspaper parcels and the boxes had the Indian things in
I never saw so many beautiful things before
There were carved fans and silver bangles and strings of amber beads and necklaces of uncut gems  turquoises and garnets the Uncle said they were  and shawls and scarves of silk and cabinets of brown and gold and ivory boxes and silver trays and brass things
The Uncle kept saying This is for you young man or Little Alice will like this fanor Miss Dora would look well in this green silk I think
Eh
 what
And Father looked on as if it was a dream till the Uncle suddenly gave him an ivory paperknife and a box of cigars and said My old friend sent you these Dick hes an old friend of yours too he says
And he winked at my Father for H O and I saw him
And my Father winked back though he has always told us not to
That was a wonderful day
It was a treasure and no mistake
I never saw such heaps and heaps of presents like things out of a fairytale  and even Eliza had a shawl
Perhaps she deserved it for she did cook the rabbit and the pudding and Oswald says it is not her fault if her nose turns up and she does not brush her hair
I do not think Eliza likes brushing things
It is the same with the carpets
But Oswald tries to make allowances even for people who do not wash their ears
The Indian Uncle came to see us often after that and his friend always sent us something
Once he tipped us a sovereign each  the Uncle brought it and once he sent us money to go to the Crystal Palace and the Uncle took us and another time to a circus and when Christmas was near the Uncle said  You remember when I dined with you some time ago you promised to dine with me some day if I could ever afford to give a dinnerparty
Well Im going to have one  a Christmas party
Not on Christmas Day because every one goes home then  but on the day after
Cold mutton and rice pudding
Youll come
Eh
 what
We said we should be delighted if Father had no objection because that is the proper thing to say and the poor Indian I mean the Uncle said No your Father wont object  hes coming too bless your soul
We all got Christmas presents for the Uncle
The girls made him a handkerchief case and a comb bag out of some of the pieces of silk he had given them
I got him a knife with three blades H O got a siren whistle a very strong one and Dicky joined with me in the knife and Noel would give the Indian ivory box that Uncles friend had sent on the wonderful Fairy Cab day
He said it was the very nicest thing he had and he was sure Uncle wouldnt mind his not having bought it with his own money
I think Fathers business must have got better  perhaps Uncles friend put money in it and that did it good like feeding the starving
Anyway we all had new suits and the girls had the green silk from India made into frocks and on Boxing Day we went in two cabs  Father and the girls in one and us boys in the other
We wondered very much where the Indian Uncle lived because we had not been told
And we thought when the cab began to go up the hill towards the Heath that perhaps the Uncle lived in one of the poky little houses up at the top of Greenwich
But the cab went right over the Heath and in at some big gates and through a shrubbery all white with frost like a fairy forest because it was Christmas time
And at last we stopped before one of those jolly big ugly red houses with a lot of windows that are so comfortable inside and on the steps was the Indian Uncle looking very big and grand in a blue cloth coat and yellow sealskin waistcoat with a bunch of seals hanging from it
I wonder whether he has taken a place as butler here
said Dicky
A poor brokendown man  Noel thought it was very likely because he knew that in these big houses there were always thousands of stately butlers
The Uncle came down the steps and opened the cab door himself which I dont think butlers would expect to have to do
And he took us in
It was a lovely hall with bear and tiger skins on the floor and a big clock with the faces of the sun and moon dodging out when it was day or night and Father Time with a scythe coming out at the hours and the name on it was Flint
Ashford
1776 and there was a fox eating a stuffed duck in a glass case and horns of stags and other animals over the doors
Well just come into my study first said the Uncle and wish each other a Merry Christmas
So then we knew he wasnt the butler but it must be his own house for only the master of the house has a study
His study was not much like Fathers
It had hardly any books but swords and guns and newspapers and a great many boots and boxes half unpacked with more Indian things bulging out of them
We gave him our presents and he was awfully pleased
Then he gave us his Christmas presents
You must be tired of hearing about presents but I must remark that all the Uncles presents were watches there was a watch for each of us with our names engraved inside all silver except H
O
s and that was a Waterbury To match his boots the Uncle said
I dont know what he meant
Then the Uncle looked at Father and Father said You tell them sir
So the Uncle coughed and stood up and made a speech
He said  Ladies and gentlemen we are met together to discuss an important subject which has for some weeks engrossed the attention of the honourable member opposite and myself
I said Hear hear and Alice whispered What happened to the guineapig
Of course you know the answer to that
The Uncle went on  I am going to live in this house and as its rather big for me your Father has agreed that he and you shall come and live with me
And so if youre agreeable were all going to live here together and please God itll be a happy home for us all
Eh
 what
He blew his nose and kissed us all round
As it was Christmas I did not mind though I am much too old for it on other dates
Then he said Thank you all very much for your presents but Ive got a present here I value more than anything else I have
I thought it was not quite polite of him to say so till I saw that what he valued so much was a threepennybit on his watchchain and of course I saw it must be the one we had given him
He said You children gave me that when you thought I was the poor Indian and Ill keep it as long as I live
And Ive asked some friends to help us to be jolly for this is our housewarming
Eh
 what
Then he shook Father by the hand and they blew their noses and then Father said Your Uncle has been most kind  most  But Uncle interrupted by saying Now Dick no nonsense
Then H O said Then youre not poor at all
as if he were very disappointed
The Uncle replied I have enough for my simple wants thank you H O and your Fathers business will provide him with enough for yours
Eh
 what
Then we all went down and looked at the fox thoroughly and made the Uncle take the glass off so that we could see it all round and then the Uncle took us all over the house which is the most comfortable one I have ever been in
There is a beautiful portrait of Mother in Fathers sittingroom
The Uncle must be very rich indeed
This ending is like what happens in Dickenss books but I think it was much jollier to happen like a book and it shows what a nice man the Uncle is the way he did it all
Think how flat it would have been if the Uncle had said when we first offered him the one and threepence farthing Oh I dont want your dirty one and threepence
Im very rich indeed
Instead of which he saved up the news of his wealth till Christmas and then told us all in one glorious burst
Besides I cant help it if it is like Dickens because it happens this way
Real life is often something like books
Presently when we had seen the house we were taken into the drawingroom and there was Mrs Leslie who gave us the shillings and wished us good hunting and Lord Tottenham and Albertnextdoors Uncle  and Albertnextdoor and his Mother Im not very fond of her and best of all our own Robber and his two kids and our Robber had a new suit on
The Uncle told us he had asked the people who had been kind to us and Noel said Where is my noble editor that I wrote the poetry to
The Uncle said he had not had the courage to ask a strange editor to dinner but Lord Tottenham was an old friend of Uncles and he had introduced Uncle to Mrs Leslie and that was how he had the pride and pleasure of welcoming her to our housewarming
And he made her a bow like you see on a Christmas card
Then Alice asked What about Mr Rosenbaum
He was kind it would have been a pleasant surprise for him
But everybody laughed and Uncle said  Your father has paid him the sovereign he lent you
I dont think he could have borne another pleasant surprise
And I said there was the butcher and he was really kind but they only laughed and Father said you could not ask all your business friends to a private dinner
Then it was dinnertime and we thought of Uncles talk about cold mutton and rice
But it was a beautiful dinner and I never saw such a dessert
We had ours on plates to take away into another sittingroom which was much jollier than sitting round the table with the grownups
But the Robbers kids stayed with their Father
They were very shy and frightened and said hardly anything but looked all about with very bright eyes
H O thought they were like white mice but afterwards we got to know them very well and in the end they were not so mousy
And there is a good deal of interesting stuff to tell about them but I shall put all that in another book for there is no room for it in this one
We played desert islands all the afternoon and drank Uncles health in ginger wine
It was H O that upset his over Alices green silk dress and she never even rowed him
Brothers ought not to have favourites and Oswald would never be so mean as to have a favourite sister or if he had wild horses should not make him tell who it was
And now we are to go on living in the big house on the Heath and it is very jolly
Mrs Leslie often comes to see us and our own Robber and Albertnextdoors uncle
The Indian Uncle likes him because he has been in India too and is brown but our Uncle does not like Albertnextdoor
He says he is a muff
And I am to go to Rugby and so are Noel and H O and perhaps to Balliol afterwards
Balliol is my Fathers college
It has two separate coats of arms which many other colleges are not allowed
Noel is going to be a poet and Dicky wants to go into Fathers business
The Uncle is a real good old sort and just think we should never have found him if we hadnt made up our minds to be Treasure Seekers
Noel made a poem about it  Lo
the poor Indian from lands afar Comes where the treasure seekers are We looked for treasure but we find The best treasure of all is the Uncle good and kind
I thought it was rather rot but Alice would show it to the Uncle and he liked it very much
He kissed Alice and he smacked Noel on the back and he said I dont think Ive done so badly either if you come to that though I was never a regular professional treasure seeker
Eh
 what
