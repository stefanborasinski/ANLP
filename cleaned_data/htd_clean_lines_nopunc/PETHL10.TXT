James Pethel By MAX BEERBOHM I WAS shocked this morning when I saw in my newspaper a paragraph announcing his sudden death
I do not say that the shock was very disagreeable
One reads a newspaper for the sake of news
Had I never met James Pethel belike I should never have heard of him and my knowledge of his death coincident with my knowledge that he had existed would have meant nothing at all to me
If you learn suddenly that one of your friends is dead you are wholly distressed
If the death is that of a mere acquaintance whom you have recently seen you are disconcerted pricked is your sense of mortality but you do find great solace in telling other people that you met the poor fellow only the other day and that he was so full of life and spirits and that you remember he saidwhatever you may remember of his sayings
If the death is that of a mere acquaintance whom you have not seen for years you are touched so lightly as to find solace enough in even such faded reminiscence as is yours to offer
Seven years have passed since the day when last I saw James Pethel and that day was the morrow of my first meeting with him
I had formed the habit of spending August in Dieppe
The place was then less overrun by trippers than it is now
Some pleasant English people shared it with some pleasant French people
We used rather to resent the raceweekthe third week of the monthas an intrusion on our privacy
We sneered as we read in the Paris edition of The New York Herald the names of the intruders though by some of these we were secretly impressed
We disliked the nightly crush in the baccaratroom of the casino and the croupiers obvious excitement at the high play
I made a point of avoiding that room during that week for the special reason that the sight of serious habitual gamblers has always filled me with a depression bordering on disgust
Most of the men by some subtle stress of their ruling passion have grown so monstrously fat and most of the women so harrowingly thin
The rest of the women seem to be marked out for apoplexy and the rest of the men to be wasting away
One feels that anything thrown at them would be either embedded or shattered and looks vainly among them for one person furnished with a normal amount of flesh
Monsters they are all of them to the eye though I believe that many of them have excellent moral qualities in private life but just as in an American town one goes sooner or latergoes against ones finer judgment but somehow goesinto the dimemuseum so year by year in Dieppes raceweek there would be always one evening when I drifted into the baccaratroom
It was on such an evening that I first saw the man whose memory I here celebrate
My gaze was held by him for the very reason that he would have passed unnoticed elsewhere
He was conspicuous not in virtue of the mere fact that he was taking the bank at the principal table but because there was nothing at all odd about him
He alone among his fellowplayers looked as if he were not to die before the year was out
Of him alone I said to myself that he was destined to die normally at a ripe old age
Next day certainly I would not have made this prediction would not have given him the seven years that were still in store for him nor the comparatively normal death that has been his
But now as I stood opposite to him behind the croupier I was refreshed by my sense of his wholesome durability
Everything about him except the amount of money he had been winning seemed moderate
Just as he was neither fat nor thin so had his face neither that extreme pallor nor that extreme redness which belongs to the faces of seasoned gamblers it was just a clear pink
And his eyes had neither the unnatural brightness nor the unnatural dullness of the eyes about him they were ordinarily clear eyes of an ordinary gray
His very age was moderate a putative thirtysix not more
Not less I would have said in those days
He assumed no air of nonchalance
He did not deal out the cards as though they bored him but he had no look of grim concentration
I noticed that the removal of his cigar from his mouth made never the least difference to his face for he kept his lips pursed out as steadily as ever when he was not smoking
And this constant pursing of his lips seemed to denote just a pensive interest
His bank was nearly done now there were only a few cards left
Opposite to him was a welter of partycolored counters that the croupier had not yet had time to sort out and add to the rouleaux already made there were also a fair accumulation of notes and several little stacks of goldin all not less than fivehundred pounds certainly
Happy banker
How easily had he won in a few minutes more than I with utmost pains could win in many months
I wished I were he
His lucre seemed to insult me personally
I disliked him and yet I hoped he would not take another bank
I hoped he would have the good sense to pocket his winnings and go home
Deliberately to risk the loss of all those riches would intensify the insult to me
Messieurs la banque est aux encheres
There was some brisk bidding while the croupier tore open and shuffled two new packs
But it was as I feared the gentleman whom I resented kept his place
Messieurs la banque est faite
Quinzemille francs a la banque
Messieurs les cartes passent
Messieurs les cartes passent
Turning to go I encountered a friend one of the raceweekers but in a sense a friend
Going to play
I asked
Not while Jimmy Pethels taking the bank he answered with a laugh
Is that the mans name
Yes
Dont you know him
I thought every one knew old Jimmy Pethel
I asked what there was so wonderful about old Jimmy Pethel that every one should be supposed to know him
Oh hes a great character
Has extraordinary luckalways
I do not think my friend was versed in the pretty theory that good luck is the subconscious wisdom of them who in previous incarnations have been consciously wise
He was a member of the stock exchange and I smiled as at a certain quaintness in his remark
I asked in what ways besides luck the great character was manifested
Oh well Pethel had made a huge scoop on the stock exchange when he was only twentythree and very soon had doubled that and doubled it again then retired
He wasnt more than thirtyfive now And then
Oh well he was a regular allround sportsman had gone after big game all over the world and had a good many narrow shaves
Great steeplechaser too
Rather settled down now
Lived in Leicestershire mostly
Had a big place there
Hunted five times a week
Still did an occasional flutter though
Cleared eightythousand in Mexicans last February
Wife had been a barmaid at Cambridge married her when he was nineteen
Thing seemed to have turned out quite well
Altogether a great character
Possibly thought I
But my cursory friend accustomed to quick transactions and to things accepted on the nod had not proved his case to my slower more literary intelligence
It was to him though that I owed some minutes later a chance of testing his opinion
At the cry of Messieurs la banque est aux encheres we looked round and saw that the subject of our talk was preparing to rise from his place
Now one can punt said Grierson this was my friends name and turned to the bureau at which counters are for sale
If old Jimmy Pethel punts he added I shall just follow his luck
But this lodestar was not to be
While my friend was buying his counters and I was wondering whether I too could buy some Pethel himself came up to the bureau
With his lips no longer pursed he had lost his air of gravity and looked younger
Behind him was an attendant bearing a big wooden bowlthat plain but romantic bowl supplied by the establishment to a banker whose gains are too great to be pocketed
He and Grierson greeted each other
He said he had arrived in Dieppe this afternoon was here for a day or two
We were introduced
He spoke to me with empressement saying he was a very great admirer of my work
I no longer disliked him
Grierson armed with counters had now darted away to secure a place that had just been vacated
Pethel with a wave of his hand toward the tables said I suppose you never condescend to this sort of thing
Well I smiled indulgently
Awful waste of time he admitted
I glanced down at the splendid mess of counters and gold and notes that were now becoming under the swift fingers of the little man at the bureau an orderly array
I did not say aloud that it pleased me to be and to be seen talking on terms of equality to a man who had won so much
I did not say how wonderful it seemed to me that he whom I had watched just now with awe and with aversion had all the while been a great admirer of my work
I did but say again indulgently that I supposed baccarat to be as good a way of wasting time as another
Ah but you despise us all the same
He added that he always envied men who had resources within themselves
I laughed lightly to imply that it WAS very pleasant to have such resources but that I didnt want to boast
And indeed I had never felt humbler flimsier than when the little man at the bureau naming a fabulous sum asked its owner whether he would take the main part in notes of mille francs cinqmille dixmillequoi
Had it been mine I should have asked to have it all in fivefranc pieces
Pethel took it in the most compendious form and crumpled it into his pocket
I asked if he were going to play any more tonight
Oh later on he said
I want to get a little sea air into my lungs now
He asked with a sort of breezy diffidence if I would go with him
I was glad to do so
It flashed across my mind that yonder on the terrace he might suddenly blurt out I say look here dont think me awfully impertinent but this moneys no earthly use to me
I do wish youd accept it as a very small return for all the pleasure your work has given me and There PLEASE
Not another word
all with such candor delicacy and genuine zeal that I should be unable to refuse
But I must not raise false hopes in my reader
Nothing of the sort happened
Nothing of that sort ever does happen
We were not long on the terrace
It was not a night on which you could stroll and talk there was a wind against which you had to stagger holding your hat on tightly and shouting such remarks as might occur to you
Against that wind acquaintance could make no headway
Yet I see now that despite that wind or rather because of it I ought already to have known Pethel a little better than I did when we presently sat down together inside the cafe of the casino
There had been a point in our walk or our stagger when we paused to lean over the parapet looking down at the black and driven sea
And Pethel had shouted that it would be great fun to be out in a sailingboat tonight and that at one time he had been very fond of sailing
As we took our seats in the cafe he looked about him with boyish interest and pleasure then squaring his arms on the little table he asked me what I would drink
I protested that I was the host a position which he with the quick courtesy of the very rich yielded to me at once
I feared he would ask for champagne and was gladdened by his demand for water
Apollinaris St Galmier or what
I asked
He preferred plain water
I ventured to warn him that such water was never safe in these places
He said he had often heard that but would risk it
I remonstrated but he was firm
Alors I told the waiter pour Monsieur un verre de leau fraiche et pour moi un demi blonde
Pethel asked me to tell him who every one was
I told him no one was any one in particular and suggested that we should talk about ourselves
You mean he laughed that you want to know who the devil I am
I assured him that I had often heard of him
At this he was unaffectedly pleased
But I added its always more interesting to hear a man talked about by himself
And indeed since he had NOT handed his winnings over to me I did hope he would at any rate give me some glimpses into that great character of his
Full though his life had been he seemed but like a rather clever schoolboy out on a holiday
I wanted to know more
That beer looks good he admitted when the waiter came back
I asked him to change his mind but he shook his head raised to his lips the tumbler of water that had been placed before him and meditatively drank a deep draft
I never he then said touch alcohol of any sort
He looked solemn but all men do look solemn when they speak of their own habits whether positive or negative and no matter how trivial and so though I had really no warrant for not supposing him a reclaimed drunkard I dared ask him for what reason he abstained
When I say I NEVER touch alcohol he said hastily in a tone as of selfdefense I mean that I dont touch it often or at any ratewell I never touch it when Im gambling you know
Itit takes the edge off
His tone did make me suspicious
For a moment I wondered whether he had married the barmaid rather for what she symbolized than for what in herself she was
But no surely not he had been only nineteen years old
Nor in any way had he now this steady brisk cleareyed fellow the aspect of one who had since fallen
The edge off the excitement
I asked
Rather
Of course that sort of excitement seems awfully stupid to YOU butno use denying itI do like a bit of a flutter just occasionally you know
And one has to be in trim for it
Suppose a man sat down deaddrunk to a game of chance what fun would it be for him
None
And its only a question of degree
Soothe yourself ever so little with alcohol and you dont get QUITE the full sensation of gambling
You do lose just a little something of the proper tremors before a coup the proper throes during a coup the proper thrill of joy or anguish after a coup
Youre bound to you know he added purposely making this bathos when he saw me smiling at the heights to which he had risen
And tonight I asked remembering his prosaically pensive demeanor in taking the bank were you feeling these throes and thrills to the utmost
He nodded
And youll feel them again tonight
I hope so
I wonder you can stay away
Oh one gets a bit deadened after an hour or so
One needs to be freshened up
So long as I dont bore you I laughed and held out my cigarettecase
I rather wonder you smoke I murmured after giving him a light
Nicotines a sort of drug
Doesnt it soothe you
Dont you lose just a little something of the tremors and things
He looked at me gravely
By Jove
he ejaculated I never thought of that
Perhaps youre right
Pon my word I must think that over
I wondered whether he were secretly laughing at me
Here was a man to whomso I conceived with an effort of the imaginationthe loss or gain of a few hundred pounds could hardly matter
I told him I had spoken in jest
To give up tobacco might I said intensify the pleasant agonies of a gambler staking his little all
But in your casewell I dont see where the pleasant agonies come in
You mean because Im beastly rich
Rich I amended
All depends on what you call rich
Besides Im not the sort of fellow whos content with three per cent
A couple of months agoI tell you this in confidenceI risked virtually all I had in an Argentine deal
And lost it
No as a matter of fact I made rather a good thing out of it
I did rather well last February too
But theres no knowing the future
A few errors of judgment a war here a revolution there a big strike somewhere else and He blew a jet of smoke from his lips and then looked at me as at one whom he could trust to feel for him in a crash already come
My sympathy lagged and I stuck to the point of my inquiry
Meanwhile I suggested and all the more because you arent merely a rich man but also an active taker of big risks how can these tiny little baccarat risks give you so much emotion
There you rather have me he laughed
Ive often wondered at that myself
I suppose he puzzled it out I do a good lot of makebelieve
While Im playing a game like this game tonight I IMAGINE the stakes are huge
And I IMAGINE I havent another penny in the world
Ah so that with you its always a lifeanddeath affair
He looked away
Oh no I dont say that
Stupid phrase I admitted
Butthere was yet one point I would put to himif you have extraordinary luck always Theres no such thing as luck
No strictly I suppose there isnt
But if in point of fact you always do win thenwell surely perfect luck driveth out fear
Who ever said I always won
he asked sharply
I waved my hands and said Oh you have the reputation you know for extraordinary luck
That isnt the same thing as always winning
Besides I HAVENT extraordinary luck never HAVE had
Good heavens
he exclaimed if I thought I had any more chance of winning than of losing IdId Never again set foot in that baccaratroom tonight I soothingly suggested
Oh baccarat be blowed
I wasnt thinking of baccarat
I was thinking ofoh lots of things baccarat included yes
What things
I ventured to ask
What things
He pushed back his chair
Look here he said with a laugh dont pretend I havent been boring your head off with all this talk about myself
Youve been too patient
Im off
Shall I see you tomorrow
Perhaps youd lunch with us tomorrow
It would be a great pleasure for my wife
Were at the Grand Hotel
I said I should be most happy and called the waiter at sight of whom my friend said he had talked himself thirsty and asked for another glass of water
He mentioned that he had brought his car over with him his little daughter by the news of whose existence I felt idiotically surprised was very keen on motoring and they were all three starting the day after tomorrow on a little tour through France
Afterward they were going on to Switzerland for some climbing
Did I care about motoring
If so we might go for a spin after luncheon to Rouen or somewhere
He drank his glass of water and linking a friendly arm in mine passed out with me into the corridor
He asked what I was writing now and said that he looked to me to do something big one of these days and that he was sure I had it in me
This remark though of course I pretended to be pleased by it irritated me very much
It was destined as you shall see to irritate me very much more in recollection
Yet I was glad he had asked me to luncheonglad because I liked him and glad because I dislike mysteries
Though you may think me very dense for not having thoroughly understood Pethel in the course of my first meeting with him the fact is that I was only aware and that dimly of something more in him than he had cared to revealsome veil behind which perhaps lurked his right to the title so airily bestowed on him by Grierson
I assured myself as I walked home that if veil there was I should tomorrow find an eyelet
But ones intuition when it is off duty seems always a much more powerful engine than it does on active service and next day at sight of Pethel awaiting me outside his hotel I became less confident
His thought I was a face which for all its animation would tell nothingnothing at any rate that mattered
It expressed well enough that he was pleased to see me but for the rest I was reminded that it had a sort of frank inscrutability
Besides it was at all points so very usual a facea face that couldnt so I then thought even if it had leave to betray connection with a great character
It was a strong face certainly but so are yours and mine
And very fresh it looked though as he confessed Pethel had sat up in that beastly baccaratroom till five AM
I asked had he lost
Yes he had lost steadily for four hours proudly he laid stress on this but in the endwell he had won it all back and a bit more
By the way he murmured as we were about to enter the hall dont ever happen to mention to my wife what I told you about that Argentine deal
Shes always rather nervous aboutinvestments
I dont tell her about them
Shes rather a nervous woman altogether Im sorry to say
This did not square with my preconception of her
Slave that I am to traditional imagery I had figured her as flaunting as goldenhaired as haughty to most men but with a provocative smile across the shoulder for some
Nor indeed did her husbands words save me the suspicion that my eyes deceived me when anon I was presented to a very pale small lady whose hair was rather white than gray
And the little daughter
This prodigys hair was as yet down but looked as if it might be up at any moment she was nearly as tall as her father whom she very much resembled in face and figure and heartiness of handshake
Only after a rapid mental calculation could I account for her
I must warn you shes in a great rage this morning said her father
Do try to soothe her
She blushed laughed and bade her father not be so silly
I asked her the cause of her great rage
She said He only means I was disappointed
And he was just as disappointed as I was
WERENT you now Father
I suppose they meant well Peggy he laughed
They were QUITE right said Mrs Pethel evidently not for the first time
They as I presently learned were the authorities of the bathingestablishment
Pethel had promised his daughter he would take her for a swim but on their arrival at the bathingcabins they were ruthlessly told that bathing was defendu a cause du mauvais temps
This embargo was our theme as we sat down to luncheon
Miss Peggy was of opinion that the French were cowards
I pleaded for them that even in English wateringplaces bathing was forbidden when the sea was VERY rough
She did not admit that the sea was very rough today
Besides she appealed to me where was the fun of swimming in absolutely calm water
I dared not say that this was the only sort of water I liked to swim in
They were QUITE right said Mrs Pethel again
Yes but darling Mother you cant swim
Father and I are both splendid swimmers
To gloss over the mothers disability I looked brightly at Pethel as though in ardent recognition of his prowess among waves
With a movement of his head he indicated his daughterindicated that there was no one like her in the whole world
I beamed agreement
Indeed I did think her rather nice
If one liked the father and I liked Pethel all the more in that capacity one couldnt help liking the daughter the two were so absurdly alike
Whenever he was looking at her and it was seldom that he looked away from her the effect if you cared to be fantastic was that of a very vain man before a mirror
It might have occurred to me that if there was any mystery in him I could solve it through her
But in point of fact I had forgotten all about that possible mystery
The amateur detective was lost in the sympathetic observer of a fathers love
That Pethel did love his daughter I have never doubted
One passion is not less true because another predominates
No one who ever saw that father with that daughter could doubt that he loved her intensely
And this intensity gages for me the strength of what else was in him
Mrs Pethels love though less explicit was not less evidently profound
But the maternal instinct is less attractive to an onlooker because he takes it more for granted than the paternal
What endeared poor Mrs Pethel to me waswell the inevitability of the epithet I give her
She seemed poor thing so essentially out of it and by it is meant the glowing mutual affinity of husband and child
Not that she didnt in her little way assert herself during the meal
But she did so I thought with the knowledge that she didnt count and never would count
I wondered how it was that she had in that Cambridge barroom long ago counted for Pethel to the extent of matrimony
But from any such room she seemed so utterly remote that she might well be in all respects now an utterly changed woman
She did preeminently look as if much had by some means been taken out of her with no compensatory process of putting in
Pethel looked so very young for his age whereas she would have had to be really old to look young for hers
I pitied her as one might a governess with two charges who were hopelessly out of hand
But a governess I reflected can always give notice
Love tied poor Mrs Pethel fast to her present situation
As the three of them were to start next day on their tour through France and as the four of us were to make a tour to Rouen this afternoon the talk was much about motoring a theme which Miss Peggys enthusiasm made almost tolerable
I said to Mrs Pethel with more goodwill than truth that I supposed she was very keen on it
She replied that she was
But darling Mother you arent
I believe you hate it
Youre ALWAYS asking father to go slower
And what IS the fun of just crawling along
Oh come Peggy we never crawl
said her father
No indeed said her mother in a tone of which Pethel laughingly said it would put me off coming out with them this afternoon
I said with an expert air to reassure Mrs Pethel that it wasnt fast driving but only bad driving that was a danger
There Mother
cried Peggy
Isnt that what were always telling you
I felt that they were always either telling Mrs Pethel something or as in the matter of that intended bath not telling her something
It seemed to me possible that Peggy advised her father about his investments
I wondered whether they had yet told Mrs Pethel of their intention to go on to Switzerland for some climbing
Of his secretiveness for his wifes sake I had a touching little instance after luncheon
We had adjourned to have coffee in front of the hotel
The car was already in attendance and Peggy had darted off to make her daily inspection of it
Pethel had given me a cigar and his wife presently noticed that he himself was not smoking
He explained to her that he thought he had smoked too much lately and that he was going to knock it off for a while
I would not have smiled if he had met my eye but his avoidance of it made me quite sure that he really had been thinking over what I had said last night about nicotine and its possibly deleterious action on the gambling thrill
Mrs Pethel saw the smile that I could not repress
I explained that I was wishing I could knock off tobacco and envying her husbands strength of character
She smiled too but wanly with her eyes on him
Nobody has so much strength of character as he has she said
Nonsense
he laughed
Im the weakest of men
Yes she said quietly thats true too James
Again he laughed but he flushed
I saw that Mrs Pethel also had faintly flushed and I became horribly aware of following suit
In the sudden glow and silence created by Mrs Pethels paradox I was grateful to the daughter for bouncing back among us and asking how soon we should be ready to start
Pethel looked at his wife who looked at me and rather strangely asked if I was sure I wanted to go with them
I protested that of course I did
Pethel asked her if SHE really wanted to come
You see dear there was the run yesterday from Calais
And tomorrow youll be on the road again and all the days after
Yes said Peggy Im SURE youd much rather stay at home darling Mother and have a good rest
Shall we go and put on our things Peggy
replied Mrs Pethel rising from her chair
She asked her husband whether he was taking the chauffeur with him
He said he thought not
Oh hurrah
cried Peggy
Then I can be on the front seat
No dear said her mother
I am sure Mr Beerbohms would like to be on the front seat
Youd like to be with mother wouldnt you
the girl appealed
I replied with all possible emphasis that I should like to be with Mrs Pethel
But presently when the mother and daughter reappeared in the guise of motorists it became clear that my aspiration had been set aside
I am to be with mother said Peggy
I was inwardly glad that Mrs Pethel could after all assert herself to some purpose
Had I thought she disliked me I should have been hurt but I was sure her desire that I should not sit with her was due merely to a belief that in case of accident a person on the front seat was less safe than a person behind
And of course I did not expect her to prefer my life to her daughters
Poor lady
My heart was with her
As the car glided along the seafront and then under the Norman archway through the town and past the environs I wished that her husband inspired in her as much confidence as he did in me
For me the sight of his clear firm profile he did not wear motorgoggles was an assurance in itself
From time to time for I too was ungoggled I looked round to nod and smile cheerfully at his wife
She always returned the nod but left the smile to be returned by the daughter
Pethel like the good driver he was did not talk just drove
But as we came out on to the Rouen road he did say that in France he always rather missed the British policetraps
Not he added that Ive ever fallen into one
But the chance that a policeman MAY at any moment dart out and land you in a bit of a scrape does rather add to the excitement dont you think
Though I answered in the tone of one to whom the chance of a policetrap is the very salt of life I did not inwardly like the spirit of his remark
However I dismissed it from my mind
The sun was shining and the wind had dropped it was an ideal day for motoring and the Norman landscape had never looked lovelier to me in its width of sober and silvery grace
The other names in this memoir are for good reason pseudonyms
I presently felt that this landscape was not after all doing itself full justice
Was it not rushing rather too quickly past
James
said a shrill faint voice from behind and graduallyOh darling Mother really
protested another voicethe landscape slackened pace
But after a while little by little the landscape lost patience forgot its good manners and flew faster and faster than before
The road rushed furiously beneath us like a river in spate
Avenues of poplars flashed past us every tree of them on each side hissing and swishing angrily in the draft we made
Motors going Rouenward seemed to be past as quickly as motors that bore down on us
Hardly had I espied in the landscape ahead a chateau or other object of interest before I was craning my neck round for a final glimpse of it as it faded on the backward horizon
An endless uphill road was breasted and crested in a twinkling and transformed into a decline near the end of which our car leaped straight across to the opposite ascent andJames
again and again by degrees the laws of nature were reestablished but again by degrees revoked
I did not doubt that speed in itself was no danger but when the road was about to make a sharp curve why shouldnt Pethel just as a matter of form slow down slightly and sound a note or two of the hooter
Suppose another car werewell that was all right the road was clear but at the next turning when our car neither slackened nor hooted and WAS for an instant full on the wrong side of the road I had within me a contraction which at thought of what must have been if lasted though all was well
Loath to betray fear I hadnt turned my face to Pethel
Eyes front
And how about that wagon ahead huge haywagon plodding with its back to us seeming to occupy whole road
Surely Pethel would slacken hoot
No
Imagine a needle threaded with one swift gesture from afar
Even so was it that we shot between wagon and roadsedge through whereon confronting us within a few yardsinches now but we swervedwas a cart that incredibly we grazed not as we rushed on on
Now indeed I had turned my eyes on Pethels profile and my eyes saw there that which stilled with a greater emotion all fear and wonder in me
I think that for the first instant oddly what I felt was merely satisfaction not hatred for I all but asked him whether by not smoking today he had got a keener edge to his thrills
I understood him and for an instant this sufficed me
Those pursedout lips so queerly different from the compressed lips of the normal motorist and seeming as elsewhere last night to denote no more than pensive interest had told me suddenly all that I needed to know about Pethel
Here as thereand oh ever so much better here than therehe could gratify the passion that was in him
No need of any makebelieve here
I remembered the queer look he had given when I asked if his gambling were always a lifeanddeath affair
Here was the real thing the authentic game for the highest stakes
And here was I a little extra stake tossed on to the board
He had vowed I had it in me to do something big
Perhaps though there had been a touch of makebelieve about that
I am afraid it was not before my thought about myself that my moral sense began to operate and my hatred of Pethel set in
Put it to my credit that I did see myself as a mere detail in his villainy
You deprecate the word villainy
Understand all forgive all
No doubt
But between the acts of understanding and forgiving an interval may sometimes be condoned
Condone it in this instance
Even at the time I gave Pethel due credit for risking his own life for having doubtless risked itit and none otheragain and again in the course of his adventurous and abstemious life by field and flood
I was even rather touched by memory of his insistence last night on another glass of that water which just MIGHT give him typhoid rather touched by memory of his unsaying that he never touched alcoholhe who in point of fact had to be ALWAYS gambling on something or other
I gave him due credit too for his devotion to his daughter
But his use of that devotion his cold use of it to secure for himself the utmost thrill of hazard did seem utterly abominable to me
And it was even more for the mother than for the daughter that I was incensed
That daughter did not know him did but innocently share his damnable love of chances but that wife had for years known him at least as well as I knew him now
Here again I gave him credit for wishing though he didnt love her to spare her what he could
That he didnt love her I presumed from his indubitable willingness not to stake her in this afternoons game
That he never had loved herhad taken her in his precocious youth simply as a gigantic chance against him was likely enough
So much the more credit to him for such consideration as he showed her though this was little enough
He could wish to save her from being a lookeron at his game but he couldhe couldnt notgo on playing
Assuredly she was right in deeming him at once the strongest and the weakest of men
Rather a nervous woman
I remembered an engraving that had hung in my room at Oxford and in scores of other rooms there a presentment by Sir Marcus then Mr Stone of a very pretty young person in a Gainsborough hat seated beneath an ancestral elm looking as though she were about to cry and entitled A Gamblers Wife
Mrs Pethel was not like that
Of her there were no engravings for undergraduate hearts to melt at
But there was one man certainly whose compassion was very much at her service
How was he going to help her
I know not how many hairsbreadth escapes we may have had while these thoughts passed through my brain
I had closed my eyes
So preoccupied was I that but for the constant rush of air against my face I might for aught I knew have been sitting ensconced in an armchair at home
After a while I was aware that this rush had abated I opened my eyes to the old familiar streets of Rouen
We were to have tea at the Hotel dAngleterre
What was to be my line of action
Should I take Pethel aside and say Swear to me on your word of honor as a gentleman that you will never again touch the drivinggear or whatever you call it of a motorcar
Otherwise I shall expose you to the world
Meanwhile we shall return to Dieppe by train
He might flush for I knew him capable of flushing as he asked me to explain
And after
He would laugh in my face
He would advise me not to go motoring any more
He might even warn me not to go back to Dieppe in one of those dangerous railwaytrains
He might even urge me to wait until a nice Bath chair had been sent out for me from England
I heard a voice mine alas
saying brightly Well here we are
I helped the ladies to descend
Tea was ordered
Pethel refused that stimulant and had a glass of water
I had a liqueur brandy
It was evident to me that tea meant much to Mrs Pethel
She looked stronger after her second cup and younger after her third
Still it was my duty to help her if I could
While I talked and laughed I did not forget that
But what on earth was I to do
I am no hero
I hate to be ridiculous
I am inveterately averse to any sort of fuss
Besides how was I to be sure that my own personal dread of the return journey hadnt something to do with my intention of tackling Pethel
I rather thought it had
What this woman would dare daily because she was a mother could not I dare once
I reminded myself of this mans reputation for invariable luck
I reminded myself that he was an extraordinarily skilful driver
To that skill and luck I would pin my faith
What I seem to myself do you ask of me
But I answered your question a few lines back
Enough that my faith was rewarded we did arrive safely in Dieppe
I still marvel that we did
That evening in the vestibule of the casino Grierson came up to me
Seen Jimmy Pethel
he asked
He was asking for you
Wants to see you particularly
Hes in the baccaratroom punting winning hand over fist OF course
Said hed seldom met a man he liked more than you
Great character what
One is always glad to be liked and I pleaded guilty to a moments gratification at the announcement that Pethel liked me
But I did not go and seek him in the baccaratroom
A great character assuredly he was but of a kind with which I say it at the risk of seeming priggish I prefer not to associate
Why he had particularly wanted to see me was made clear in a note sent by him to my room early next morning
He wondered if I could be induced to join them in their little tour
He hoped I wouldnt think it great cheek his asking me
He thought it might rather amuse me to come
It would be a very great pleasure to his wife
He hoped I wouldnt say no
Would I send a line by bearer
They would be starting at three oclock
He was mine sincerely
It was not too late to tackle him even now
Should I go round to his hotel
I hesitated andwell I told you at the outset that my last meeting with him was on the morrow of my first
I forget what I wrote to him but am sure that the excuse I made for myself was a good and graceful one and that I sent my kindest regards to Mrs Pethel
She had not I am sure of that too authorized her husband to say she would like me to come with them
Else would not the thought of her the pity of her have haunted me as it did for a very long time
I do not know whether she is still alive
No mention is made of her in the obituary notice which awoke these memories in me
This notice I will however transcribe because it is for all its crudeness of phraseology rather interesting both as an echo and as an amplification
Its title is Death of Wealthy Aviator and its text is Widespread regret will be felt in Leicestershire at the tragic death of Mr James Pethel who had long resided there and was very popular as an allround sportsman
In recent years he had been much interested in aviation and had had a private aerodrome erected on his property
Yesterday afternoon he fell down dead quite suddenly as he was returning to his house apparently in his usual health and spirits after descending from a short flight which despite a strong wind he had made on a new type of aeroplane and on which he was accompanied by his married daughter and her infant son
It is not expected that an inquest will be necessary as his physician Dr Saunders has certified death to be due to heartdisease from which it appears the deceased gentleman had been suffering for many years
Dr Saunders adds that he had repeatedly warned deceased that any strain on the nervous system might prove fatal
Thusfor I presume that his ailment had its origin in his habitsJames Pethel did not despite that merely pensive look of his live his life with impunity
And by reason of that life he died
As for the manner of his death enough that he did die
Let not our hearts be vexed that his great luck was with him to the end
