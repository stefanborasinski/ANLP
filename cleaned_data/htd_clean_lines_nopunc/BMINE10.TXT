BABY MINE BY MARGARET MAYO To my Helper and Husband CHAPTER I Even in college Alfred Hardy was a young man of fixed ideas and high ideals and proud of it
His friend Jimmy Jinks had few ideas and no ideals and was glad of it and before half of their first college term had passed Jimmy had ridded himself of all such worries as making up his own mind or directing his own morals
Alfred did all these things so much better argued Jimmy furthermore Alfred LIKED to do themJimmy owed it to his friend to give him that pleasure
The fact that Jimmy was several years Alfreds senior and twice his size in no way altered his opinion of Alfreds judgment and through their entire college course they agreed as one man in all their discussionsor ratherin all Alfreds discussions
But it was not until the close of their senior year that Alfred favoured Jimmy with his views on matrimony
Sitting alone in a secluded corner of the campus waiting for Alfred to solve a problem in higher mathematics Jimmy now recalled fragments of Alfreds last conversation
No twelve dollar shoes and forty dollar hats for MY wife his young friend had raged and he condemned to Jimmy the wicked extravagance of his own younger sisters
The woman who gets me must be a homemaker
Ill take her to the theatre occasionally and now and then well have a few friends in for the evening but the fireside must be her magnet and Ill be right by her side each night with my books and my days worries
She shall be taken into my confidence completely and Ill take good care to let her know before I marry her just what I expect in return
Alfred certainly has the right idea about marriage mused Jimmy as the toe of his boot shoved the gravel up and down the path
Theres just one impractical feature about it
He was conscious of a slight feeling of heresy when he admitted even ONE flaw in his friends scheme of things
Where is Alfred to find such a wife
Jimmy ran through the list of unattached girls to whom Alfred had thus far presented him
It was no doubt due to his lack of imagination but try as he would he could not see any one of these girls sitting by the fireside listening to Alfreds worries for four or five nights each week
He recalled all the married women whom he had been obliged through no fault of his own to observe
True all of them did not boast twelve dollar shoes or forty dollar hatsfor the very simple reason that the incomes or the tempers of their husbands did not permit of it
In any case Jimmy did not remember having seen them spend many evenings by the fireside
Where then was Alfred to find the exceptional creature who was to help systematise his life
Jimmy was not above hoping that Alfreds search might be a long one
He was content for his friend to go jogging along by his side theorising about marriage and taking no chances with facts
Having come to this conclusion he began to feel uneasy at Alfreds non appearance
Alfred had promised to meet him on this spot at fourthirty and Alfred had decided ideas about punctuality
It was now five thirty
Ought Jimmy to look for him or would he be wiser to remain comfortably seated and to try to digest another of his friends theories
While Jimmy was trying to decide this vexed question his ear caught the sound of a girlish titter
Turning in embarrassment toward a secluded path just behind him whom did he see coming toward him but Alfred with what appeared to be a bunch of daffodils but as Alfred drew nearer Jimmy began to perceive at his elbow a large flowertrimmed hat andhorrors
 beneath it with a great deal of filmy white and yellow floating from it was a small pink and white face
Barely had Jimmy reversed himself and rearranged his round astonished features when Alfred beaming and buoyant brought the bundle of fluff to a full stop before him
Sorry to be late old chap said Alfred
I have brought my excuse with me
I want you to know Miss Merton
Then turning to the small creature whose head peeped just above his elbow Alfred explained to her graciously that Jimmy Jinks was his very best friend present company excepted of course and added that she and Jimmy would no doubt see a great deal of each other in the future
In his embarrassment Jimmys eyes went straight to the young ladys shoes
It was possible that there might be more expensive shoes in this world but Jimmy had certainly never seen daintier
I hope we didnt disturb you a small voice was chirping and innocent and conventional as the remark surely was Jimmy was certain of an undercurrent of mischief in it
He glanced up to protest but two babyblue eyes fixed upon him in apparent wonderment made him certain that anything he could say would seem rude or ridiculous so as usual when in a plight he looked to Alfred for the answer
Slapping Jimmy upon the shoulder in a condescending spirit Alfred suggested that they all sit down and have a chat
Oh how nice chirped the small person
Jimmy felt an irresistible desire to run but the picture of himself in his very stout person streaking across the campus to the giggled delight of Miss Fluff soon brought him submissively to the seat where he sat twiddling his straw hat between his fingers and glancing uncertainly at Alfred who was thoughtful enough to sit next him
Goodness one could almost dance out here couldnt one
said the small person named Zoie as her eyes roved over the bit of level green before them
Would you like to try
asked Alfred apparently agreeable to her every caprice
Id love it
cried Zoie
Come along
She sprang up and held out her hands to him
Im going to be unselfish answered Alfred and let Jimmy have that fun
By this time Jimmy had been seized with an intuitive feeling that his friend was in immediate danger
Was this the young woman who was to sit opposite the fireside five nights a week and systematise Alfreds life
Jimmy stared at the intruder blankly
For answer two small hands were thrust out toward him and an impatient little voice was commanding him to Come dance
He heard Alfreds laughter
He had no intention of accommodating the small person in this or any other matter yet before he realised quite how it had happened he was twostepping up and down the grass to her piping little voice nor did she release him until the perspiration came rolling from his forehead and horror of horrors his onetime friend Alfred seemed to find this amusing and laughed louder and louder when Jimmy sank by his side exhausted
When Jimmy was again able to think consecutively he concluded that considerable conversation must have taken place between Alfred and the small one while he was recovering his breath and readjusting his wilted neckwear
He was now thrown into a fresh panic by an exclamation from the excitable Zoie
You must both meet my friend Aggie Darling she was saying
I am bringing her with me to the hop tonight
She is not at all like me
You will like her dreadfully
She smiled at Jimmy as though she were conferring a great favour upon him
Like her dreadfully commented Jimmy to himself
It was just the kind of expression one might expect from a mind in such disorder as hers
Systematise Alfreds life indeed
There was more nonsensical chatter or so it seemed to Jimmy then Zoie and Alfred rose to go and Jimmy was told by both of them that he was to put in an appearance at the Fraternity hop that night
Ill see you at dinner called Alfred gaily over his shoulder and Jimmy was left to grapple with his first disappointment at his friends lack of discrimination
Its her fault concluded Jimmy as he lifted himself heavily off the bench and started down the campus resolved to console himself with food
CHAPTER II Now Jimmy had no intention of going to the hop
He had tried to tell Alfred so a dozen times during dinner but each time he had been interrupted by one of Alfreds enthusiastic rhapsodies about Zoie
Most marvellous girl I have ever met
exclaimed Alfred over his soup
So sensible so modest
And did you see how simply she dresses
he asked
Jimmy recalled his first vision of billowy fluff but before he could answer Alfred had continued excitedly Ill tell you what first attracted me toward her
He looked at Jimmy as though he expected some especial mark of gratitude for the favour about to be bestowed then he explained with a serious weighing of his words It was her love of children
I had barely been introduced to her when she turned her back upon me and gave her whole attention to Professor Pecks little boy Willie
I said to myself any girl of that age who prefers children to young chaps of my age is the girl for me
 I see assented Jimmy lamely
It was his first remark during dinner
After that I no longer hesitated
You know Jimmy I have decision
Yes I have noticed admitted Jimmy without conviction
In fifteen minutes said Alfred I had learned all about the young ladys antecedents
Having finished his soup and resisted a childish impulse to tip the plate and scrape the bottom of it Jimmy was now looking anxiously toward the door through which the roast ought to come
Ill tell you all about her volunteered Alfred
But Jimmys eyes were upon Alfreds plate his friend had not yet devoured more than two spoonfuls of soup at that rate argued Jimmy the roast would reach them about the time that he was usually trying to make his dessert last as long as possible
She is here with her aunt continued Alfred
They are on a short visit to Professor Peck
Jimmy approved of the short
Thats good he murmured hopeful that a separation from the minx might restore his friends reason
And Jimmy exclaimed Alfred with glistening eyes what do you think
Jimmy thought a great deal but he forebore to say it and Alfred continued very enthusiastically
She lives right in the same town with us
What
ejaculated Jimmy and he felt his appetite going
Within a stones throw of my houseand yours added Alfred triumphantly
Think of our never having met her before
I am thinking said Jimmy
Of course she has been away from home a great deal went on Alfred
Shes been in school in the East but there were the summers
So there were assented Jimmy thinking of his hitherto narrow escapes
Her father is old John Merton continued Alfred
Merton the stationeryou know him Jimmy
Unfortunately he has a great deal of money but that hasnt spoilt her
Oh no
She is just as simple and considerate in her behaviour as if she were some poor little struggling school teacher
She is the one for me Jimmy
There is no doubt about it and Ill tell you a secret
Jimmy looked at him blankly
I am going to propose to her this very night
Good Lord
groaned Jimmy as if his friend had been suddenly struck down in the flower of his youth
Thats why you simply must come with me to the hop continued Alfred
I want you to take care of her friend Aggie and leave me alone with Zoie as much as possible
Zoie
sniffed Jimmy
The name to him was as flippant as its owner
True strong name commented Alfred
So simple so direct so like her
Ill have to leave you now he said rising
I must send her some flowers for the dance
He turned at the door
Suppose I add a few from you for Aggie
What
exploded Jimmy
Just by way of introduction called Alfred gaily
Its a good idea
Before Jimmy could protest further he found himself alone for the second time that day
He ate his roast in gloomy silence
It seemed dry and tasteless
Even his favourite desert of plum pudding failed to rouse him from his dark meditations and he rose from the table dejected and forlorn
A few hours later when Alfred led Jimmy into the ballroom the latter was depressed not only by his friends impending danger but he felt an uneasy foreboding as to his own future
With his college course practically finished and Alfred attaching himself to unforeseen entities Jimmy had come to the ball with a curious feeling of having been left suspended in midair
Before he could voice his misgivings to Alfred the young men were surrounded by a circle of chattering females
And then it was that Jimmy found himself looking into a pair of level brown eyes and felt himself growing hot and cold by turns
When the little knot of youths and maidens disentangled itself into pairs of dancers it became clear to Jimmy that he had been introduced to Aggie and that he was expected to dance with her
As a matter of fact Jimmy had danced with many girls true it was usually when there was no other man left to do duty but still he had done it
Why then should he feel such distressing hesitation about placing his arm around the waist of this browneyed Diana
Try as he would he could not find words to break the silence that had fallen between them
She was so imposing so selfcontrolled
It really seemed to Jimmy that she should be the one to ask him to dance
As a matter of fact that was just what happened and after the dance she suggested that they sit in the garden and in the garden with the moonlight barely peeping through the friendly overhanging boughs of the trees Jimmy found Aggie capable of a courage that filled him with amazement and later that night when he and Alfred exchanged confidences it became apparent to the latter that Aggie had volunteered to undertake the responsibility of outlining Jimmys entire future
He was to follow his fathers wishes and take up a business career in Chicago at once and as soon as all the relatives concerned on both sides had been duly consulted he and Aggie were to embark upon matrimony
Good
cried Alfred when Jimmy had managed to stammer his shamefaced confession
Well make it a double wedding
I can be ready tomorrow so far as Im concerned
And then followed another rhapsody upon the fitness of Zoie as the keeper of his future home and hearth and the mother of his future sons and daughters
In fact it was far into the night when the two friends separatedseparated in more than one sense as they afterward learned
While Alfred and Jimmy were saying good night to each other Zoie and Aggie in one of the pretty chintz bedrooms of Professor Pecks modest home were still exchanging mutual confidences
The thing I like about Alfred said Zoie as she gazed at the tip of her dainty satin slipper and turned her head meditatively to one side is his positive nature
Ive never before met any one like him
Do you know she added with a sly twinkle in her eye it was all I could do to keep from laughing at him
Hes so awfully serious
She giggled to herself at the recollection of him then she leaned forward to Aggie her small hands clasped across her knees and her face dimpling with mischief
He hasnt the remotest idea what Im like
Aggie studied her young friend with unmistakable reproach
I MADE Jimmy know what IM like she said
I told him ALL my ideas about everything
Good Heavens
exclaimed Zoie in shocked surprise
Hes sure to find out sooner or later said Aggie sagely
I think thats the only sensible way to begin
If Id told Alfred all MY ideas about things smiled Zoie thered have BEEN no beginning
What do you mean
asked Aggie with a troubled look
Well take our meeting explained Zoie
Just as we were introduced that horrid little Willie Peck caught his heel in a flounce of my skirt
I turned round to slap him but I saw Alfred looking so I patted his ugly little red curls instead
And what do you think
Alfred told me tonight that it was my devotion to Willie that first made him adore me
And you didnt explain to him
asked Aggie in amazement
And lose him before Id got him
exclaimed Zoie
It might be better than losing him AFTER youve got him concluded the elder girl
Oh Aggie pouted Zoie I think you are horrid
Youre just trying to spoil all the fun of my engagement
I am not cried Aggie and the next moment she was sitting on the arm of Zoies chair
Goose
she said how dare you be cross with me
I am NOT cross declared Zoie and after the customary apologies from Aggie confidence was fully restored on both sides and Zoie continued gaily Dont you worry about Alfred and me she said as she kicked off her tiny slippers and hopped into bed
Just you wait until I get him
Ill manage him all right
I dare say answered Aggie not without misgivings as she turned off the light
CHAPTER III The double wedding of four of Chicagos Younger Set had been adequately noticed in the papers the conventional honeymoon journey had been made and Alfred Hardy and Jimmy Jinks had now settled down to the routine of their respective business interests
Having plunged into his office work with the same vigour with which he had attacked higher mathematics Alfred had quickly gained the confidence of the elders of his firm and they had already begun to give way to him in many important decisions
In fact he was now practically at the head of his particular department with one office doing well in Chicago and a second office promising well in Detroit
As for Jimmy he had naturally started his business career with fewer pyrotechnics but he was none the less contented
He seldom saw his old friend Alfred now but Aggie kept more or less in touch with Zoie and over the luncheon table the affairs of the two husbands were often discussed by their wives
It was after one of these luncheons that Aggie upset Jimmys evening repose by the fireside by telling him that she was a wee bit worried about Zoie and Alfred
Alfred is so unreasonable said Aggie so peevish
Nonsense
exclaimed Jimmy shortly
If hes peevish he has some good reason
You can be sure of that
You neednt get cross with me Jimmy said Aggie in a hurt voice
Why should I be cross with you
snapped Jimmy
It isnt YOUR fault if Alfreds made a fool of himself by marrying the last person on earth whom he should have married
I think he was very lucky to get her argued Aggie in defence of her friend
Oh you do do you
answered Jimmy in a very aggrieved tone
She is one of the prettiest girls in Chicago said Aggie
Youre pretty too answered Jimmy but it doesnt make an idiot of you
Its TIME you said something nice to me purred Aggie and her arm stole fondly around Jimmys large neck
I dont know why it is said Jimmy shaking his head dejectedly but every time Zoie Hardys name is mentioned in this house it seems to stir up some sort of a row between you and me
Thats because youre so prejudiced answered Aggie with a touch of irritation
There you go again said Jimmy
I didnt mean it
interposed Aggie contritely
Oh come now Jimmy she pleaded lets trundle off to bed and forget all about it
And they did
But the next day as Jimmy was heading for the La Salle restaurant to get his luncheon who should call to him airily from a passing taxi but Zoie
It was apparent that she wished him to wait until she could alight and in spite of his disinclination to do so he not only waited but followed the taxi to its stopping place and helped the young woman to the pavement
Oh you darling
exclaimed Zoie all of a flutter and looking exactly like an animated doll
Youve just saved my life
She called to the taxi driver to wait
Are you in trouble
asked the guileless Jimmy
Yes dreadful answered Zoie and she thrust a halfdozen small parcels into Jimmys arms
I have to be at my dressmakers in half an hour and I havent had a bite of lunch
Im miles and miles from home and I cant go into a restaurant and eat just by myself without being stared at
Wasnt it lucky that I saw you when I did
There was really very little left for Jimmy to say so he said it and a few minutes later they were seated teteatete in one of Chicagos most fashionable restaurants and Zoie the unconscious flirt was looking up at Jimmy with apparently adoring eyes and suggesting all the eatables which he particularly abominated
No sooner had the unfortunate man acquiesced in one thing and communicated Zoies wish to the waiter than the flighty young person found something else on the menu that she considered more tempting to her palate
Time and again the waiter had to be recalled and the order had to be given over until Jimmy felt himself laying up a store of nervous indigestion that would doubtless last him for days
When the coveted food at last arrived Zoie had become completely engrossed in the headgear of one of her neighbours and it was only after Jimmy had been induced to make himself ridiculous by craning his neck to see things of no possible interest to him that Zoie at last gave her attention to her plate
In obeyance of Jimmys order the waiter managed to rush the lunch through within three quarters of an hour but when Jimmy and Zoie at length rose to go he was so insanely irritated that he declared they had been in the place for hours demanded that the waiter hurry his bill and then finally departed in high dudgeon without leaving the customary tip behind him
But all this was without its effect upon Zoie who a few moments later rode away in her taxi waving gaily to Jimmy who was now late for business and thoroughly at odds with himself and the world
As a result of the time lost at luncheon Jimmy missed an appointment that had to wait over until after office hours and as a result of this postponement he missed Aggie who went to a friends house for dinner leaving word for him to follow
For the first time in his life Jimmy disobeyed Aggies orders and later on when he trundled off to bed alone he again recalled that it was Zoie Hardy who was always causing hard feeling between him and his spouse
Some hours later when Aggie reached home with misgivings because Jimmy had not joined her she was surprised to find him sleeping as peacefully as a cherub
Poor dear she murmured I hope he wasnt lonesome
And she stole away to her room
The next morning when Aggie did not appear at the breakfast table Jimmy rushed to her room in genuine alarm
It was now Aggies turn to sleep peacefully and he stole dejectedly back to the diningroom and for the first time since their marriage he munched his cold toast and sipped his coffee alone
So thoroughly was his life now disorganised and so low were his spirits that he determined to walk to his office relying upon the crisp morning air to brace him for the days encounters
By degrees he regained his good cheer and as usual when in rising spirits his mind turned toward Aggie
The second anniversary of their wedding was fast approachinghe began to take notice of various window displays
By the time he had reached his office the weightiest decision on his mind lay in choosing between a pearl pendant and a diamond bracelet for his now adorable spouse
But a more difficult problem awaited him
Before he was fairly in his chair the telephone bell rang violently
Never guessing who was at the other end of the wire he picked up his receiver and answered
What
he exclaimed in surprise
Mrs
Hardy
Several times he opened his lips to ask a question but it was apparent that the person at the other end of the line had a great deal to say and very little time to say it and it was only after repeated attempts that he managed to get in a word or so edgewise
Whats happened
he asked
Say nothing to anybody was Zoies noncommittal answer not even to Aggie
Jump in a taxi and come as quickly as you can
But what IS it
persisted Jimmy
The dull sound of the wire told him that the person at the other end had hung up
Jimmy gazed about the room in perplexity
What was he to do
Why on earth should he leave his letters unanswered and his mail topsy turvy to rush forth in the shank of the morning at the bidding of a young woman whom he abhorred
Ridiculous
He would do no such thing
He lit a cigar and began to open a few letters marked private
For the life of him he could not understand one word that he read
A worried look crossed his face
Suppose Zoie were really in need of help Aggie would certainly never forgive him if he failed her
He rose and walked up and down
Why was he not to tell Aggie
Where was Alfred
He stopped abruptly
His over excited imagination had suggested a horrible but no doubt accurate answer
Wedded to an abomination like Zoie Alfred had sought the only escape possible to a man of his honourable idealshe had committed suicide
Seizing his coat and hat Jimmy dashed through the outer office without instructing his astonished staff as to when he might possibly return
Family troubles said the secretary to himself as he appropriated one of Jimmys best cigars
CHAPTER IV LESS than half an hour later Jimmys taxi stopped in front of the fashionable Sherwood Apartments where Zoie had elected to live
Ascending toward the fifth floor he scanned the face of the elevator boy expecting to find it particularly solemn because of the tragedy that had doubtless taken place upstairs
He was on the point of sending out a feeler about the matter when he remembered Zoies solemn injunction to say nothing to anybody
Perhaps it was even worse than suicide
He dared let his imagination go no further
By the time he had put out his hand to touch the electric button at Zoies front door his finger was trembling so that he wondered whether he could hit the mark
The result was a very faint note from the bell but not so faint that it escaped the ear of the anxious young wife who had been pacing up and down the floor of her charming living room for what seemed to her ages
Hurry hurry hurry
Zoie cried through her tears to her neat little maid servant then reaching for her chatelaine she daubed her small nose and flushed cheeks with powder after which she nodded to Mary to open the door
To Jimmy the maids pert goodmorning seemed to be in very bad taste and to properly reprove her he assumed a grave dignified air out of which he was promptly startled by Zoies even more unseemly greeting
Hello Jimmy
she snapped
Her tone was certainly not that of a heartbroken widow
Its TIME you got here she added with an injured air
Jimmy gazed at Zoie in astonishment
She was never what he would have called a sympathetic woman but really
I came the moment you phoned me he stammered what is it
Whats the matter
Its awful sniffled Zoie
And she tore up and down the room regardless of the fact that Jimmy was still unseated
Awful what
questioned Jimmy
Worst Ive ever had sobbed Zoie
Is anything wrong with Alfred
ventured Jimmy
And he braced himself for her answer
Hes gone sobbed Zoie
Gone
echoed Jimmy feeling sure that his worst fears were about to be realised
Gone where
I dont know sniffled Zoie I just phoned his office
He isnt there
Oh is that all
answered Jimmy with a sigh of relief
Just another little family tiff he was unable to conceal a feeling of thankfulness
Whats up
Zoie measured Jimmy with a dangerous gleam in her eyes
She resented the patronising tone that he was adopting
How dare he be cheerful when she was so unhappyand because of him too
She determined that his selfcomplacency should be shortlived
Alfred has found out that I lied about the luncheon she said weighing her words and their effect upon Jimmy
What luncheon
stuttered Jimmy feeling sure that Zoie had suddenly marked him for her victim but puzzled as to what form her persecution was about to take
What luncheon
repeated Zoie trying apparently to conceal her disgust at his dulness
OUR luncheon yesterday
Why did you LIE asked Jimmy his eyes growing rounder and rounder with wonder
I didnt know he KNEW answered Zoie innocently
Knew what
questioned Jimmy more and more befogged
That Id eaten with a man concluded Zoie impatiently
Then she turned her back upon Jimmy and again dashed up and down the room occupied with her own thoughts
It was certainly difficult to get much understanding out of Zoies disjointed observations but Jimmy was doing his best
He followed her restless movements about the room with his eyes and then ventured a timid comment
He couldnt object to your eating with me
Oh couldnt he
cried Zoie and she turned upon him with a look of contempt
If theres anything that he DOESNT object to she continued I havent found it out yet
And with that she threw herself in a large arm chair near the table and left Jimmy to draw his own conclusions
Jimmy looked about the room as though expecting aid from some unseen source then his eyes sought the floor
Eventually they crept to the tip of Zoies tiny slipper as it beat a nervous tattoo on the rug
To save his immortal soul Jimmy could never help being hypnotised by Zoies small feet
He wondered now if they had been the reason of Alfreds first downfall
He recalled with a sigh of relief that Aggies feet were large and reassuring
He also recalled an appropriate quotation The path of virtue is not for women with small feet it ran
Yes Aggies feet are undoubtedly large he concluded
But all this was not solving Zoies immediate problem and an impatient cough from her made him realise that something was expected of him
Why did you lunch with me he asked with a touch of irritation if you thought he wouldnt like it
I was hungry snapped Zoie
Oh grunted Jimmy and in spite of his dislike of the small creature his vanity resented the bald assertion that she had not lunched with him for his companys sake
I wouldnt have made an engagement with you of course she continued with a frankness that vanquished any remaining conceit that Jimmy might have brought with him
I explained to you how it was at the time
It was merely a case of convenience
You know that
Jimmy was beginning to see it more and more in the light of an inconvenience
If you hadnt been in front of that horrid old restaurant just when I was passing she continued all this would never have happened
But you were there and you asked me to come in and have a bite with you and I did and there you are
Yes there I am assented Jimmy dismally
There was no doubt about where he was now but where was he going to end
That was the question
See here he exclaimed with fast growing uneasiness I dont like being mixed up in this sort of thing
Of course youd think of yourself first sneered Zoie
Thats just like a man
Well I dont want to get your husband down on me argued Jimmy evasively
Oh I didnt give YOU away sneered Zoie
YOU neednt worry and she fixed her eyes upon him with a scornful expression that left no doubt as to her opinion that he was a craven coward
But you said hed found out  stammered Jimmy
Hes found out that I ate with a MAN answered Zoie more and more aggrieved at having to employ so much detail in the midst of her distress
He doesnt know it was you
But Zoie protested Jimmy
She lifted a small hand begging him to spare her further questions
It was apparent that she must explain each aspect of their present difficulty with as much patience as though Jimmy were in reality only a child
She sank into her chair and then proceeded with a martyred air
You see it was like this she said
Alfred came into the restaurant just after we had gone out and Henri the waiter who has taken care of him for years told him that I had just been in to luncheon with a gentleman
Jimmy shifted about on the edge of his chair ill at ease
Now if Alfred had only told me that in the first place she continued Id have known what to say but he didnt
Oh no he was as sweet as could be all through breakfast and last night too and then just as he was leaving this morning I said something about luncheon and he said quite casually Where did you have luncheon YESTERDAY my dear
So I answered quite carelessly I had none my love
Well I wish you could have seen him
He called me dreadful things
He says Im the one thing he cant endure
Whats that
questioned Jimmy wondering how Alfred could confine himself to any ONE thing
He says Im a liar
shrieked Zoie tearfully
Well arent you
asked Jimmy
Of course I am declared Zoie but why shouldnt I be
She looked at Jimmy with such an air of selfapproval that for the life of him he could find no reason to offer
You know how jealous Alfred is she continued
He makes such a fuss about the slightest thing that Ive got out of the habit of EVER telling the TRUTH
She walked away from Jimmy as though dismissing the entire matter he shifted his position uneasily she turned to him again with mock sweetness
I suppose YOU told AGGIE all about it
she said
Jimmys round eyes opened wide and his jaw dropped lower
IIdont believe I did he stammered weakly
I didnt think of it again
Thank heaven for that
concluded Zoie with tightly pressed lips
Then she knotted her small white brow in deep thought
Jimmy regarded her with growing uneasiness
What are you up to now
he asked
I dont know yet mused Zoie BUT YOURE NOT GOING TO TELL AGGIEthats ONE SURE thing
And she pinned him down with her eyes
I certainly will tell her asserted Jimmy with a wag of his very round head
Aggie is just the one to get you out of this
Shes just the one to make things worse said Zoie decidedly
Then seeing Jimmys hurt look she continued apologetically Aggie MEANS all right but she has an absolute mania for mixing up in other peoples troubles
And you know how THAT always ends
I never deceived my wife in all my life declared Jimmy with an air of self approval that he was far from feeling
Now Jimmy protested Zoie impatiently you arent going to have moral hydrophobia just when I need your help
Im not going to lie to Aggie if thats what you mean said Jimmy endeavouring not to wriggle under Zoies disapproving gaze
Then dont answered Zoie sweetly
Jimmy never feared Zoie more than when she APPEARED to agree with him
He looked at her now with uneasy distrust
Tell her the truth urged Zoie
I will declared Jimmy with an emphatic nod
And ILL DENY IT concluded Zoie with an impudent toss of her head
What
exclaimed Jimmy and he felt himself getting onto his feet
Ive already denied it to Alfred continued Zoie
I told him Id never been in that restaurant without him in all my life that the waiter had mistaken someone else for me
And again she turned her back upon Jimmy
But dont you see protested Jimmy this would all be so very much simpler if youd just own up to the truth now before its too late
It IS too late declared Zoie
Alfred wouldnt believe me now whatever I told him
He says a woman who lies once lies all the time
Hed think Id been carrying on with you ALL ALONG
Good Lord
groaned Jimmy as the full realisation of his predicament thrust itself upon him
We dont DARE tell him now continued Zoie elated by the demoralised state to which she was fast reducing him
For Heavens sake dont make it any worse she concluded its bad enough as it is
It certainly is agreed Jimmy and he sank dejectedly into his chair
If you DO tell him threatened Zoie from the opposite side of the table Ill say you ENTICED me into the place
What
shrieked Jimmy and again he found himself on his feet
I will insisted Zoie I give you fair warning
He stared at her in absolute horror
I dont believe youve any conscience at all he said
I havent she sniffled
Im too miserable
And throwing herself into the nearest armchair she wept copiously at the thought of her many injuries
Uncertain whether to fly or to remain Jimmy gazed at her gloomily
Well IM not laughing myself to death he said
For answer Zoie turned upon him vehemently
I just wish Id never laid eyes on you Jimmy she cried
Jimmy was wishing the very same thing
If I cared about you she sobbed it wouldnt be so bad but to think of losing my Alfred for words failed her and she trailed off weaklyfor nothing
Thanks grunted Jimmy curtly
In spite of himself he was always miffed by the uncomplimentary way in which she disposed of him
His sarcasm was lost upon Zoie
Having finished all she had to say to him she was now apparently bent upon indulging herself in a first class fit of hysterics
There are critical moments in all of our lives when our future happiness or woe hangs upon our own decision
Jimmy felt intuitively that he was face to face with such a moment but which way to turn
that was the question
Being Jimmy and softhearted in spite of his efforts to conceal it he naturally turned the wrong way in other words towards Zoie
Oh come now he said awkwardly as he crossed to the arm of her chair
This will soon blow over
Zoie only sobbed the louder
This isnt the first time you and Alfred have called it all off he reminded her
Again she sobbed
Jimmy could never remember quite how it happened
But apparently he must have patted Zoie on the shoulder
At any rate something or other loosened the floodgates of her emotion and before Jimmy could possibly escape from her vicinity she had wheeled round in her chair thrown her arms about him and buried her tearstained face against his waistcoat
Good Lord
exclaimed Jimmy for the third time that morning as he glanced nervously toward the door but Zoie was exclaiming in her own way and sobbing louder and louder furthermore she was compelling Jimmy to listen to an exaggerated account of her many disappointments in her unreasonable husband
Seeing no possibility of escape without resorting to physical violence Jimmy stood his ground wondering what to expect next
He did not have long to wonder
CHAPTER V WITHIN an hour from the time Alfred had entered his office that morning he was leaving it in a taxi with his faithful secretary at his side and his important papers in a bag at his feet
Take me to the Sherwood he commanded the driver and be quick
As they neared Alfreds house Johnson could feel waves of increasing anger circling around his perturbed young employer and later when they alighted from the taxi it was with the greatest difficulty that he could keep pace with him
Unfortunately for Jimmy the outer door of the Hardy apartment had been left ajar and thus it was that he was suddenly startled from Zoies unwelcome embraces by a sharp exclamation
So
cried Alfred and he brought his fist down with emphasis on the centre table at Jimmys back
Wheeling about Jimmy beheld his friend face to face with him
Alfreds lips were pressed tightly together his eyes flashing fire
It was apparent that he desired an immediate explanation
Jimmy turned to the place where Zoie had been to ask for help like the traitress that she was he now saw her flying through her bedroom door
Again he glanced at Alfred who was standing like a sentry waiting for the password that should restore his confidence in his friend
Im afraid Ive disturbed you sneered Alfred
Oh no not at all answered Jimmy affecting a careless indifference that he did not feel and unconsciously shaking hands with the waiting secretary
Reminded of the secretarys presence in such a distinctly family scene Alfred turned to him with annoyance
Go into my study he said
Ill be with you presently
Heres your list he added and he thrust a long memorandum into the secretarys hand
Johnson retired as unobtrusively as possible and the two old friends were left alone
There was another embarrassed silence which Jimmy at least seemed powerless to break
Well
questioned Alfred in a threatening tone
Tolerably well answered Jimmy in his most pleasant but slightly nervous manner
Then followed another pause in which Alfred continued to eye his old friend with grave suspicion
The fact is stammered Jimmy I just came over to bring Aggie he corrected himself that is to bring Zoie a little message from Aggie
It seemed to be a SAD one answered Alfred with a sarcastic smile as he recalled the picture of Zoie weeping upon his friends sleeve
Oh nono
answered Jimmy with an elaborate attempt at carelessness
Do you generally play the messenger during business hours
thundered Alfred becoming more and more enraged at Jimmys petty evasions
Just SOMETIMES answered Jimmy persisting in his amiable manner
Jimmy said Alfred and there was a solemn warning in his voice dont YOU lie to me
Jimmy started as though shot
The consciousness of his guilt was strong upon him
I beg your pardon he gasped for the want of anything more intelligent to say
You dont do it well continued Alfred and you and I are old friends
Jimmys round eyes fixed themselves on the carpet
My wife has been telling you her troubles surmised Alfred
Jimmy tried to protest but the lie would not come
Very well continued Alfred Ill tell you something too
Ive done with her
He thrust his hands in his pockets and began to walk up and down
What a turbulent household thought Jimmy and then he set out in pursuit of his friend
Im sorry youve had a misunderstanding he began
Misunderstanding
shouted Alfred turning upon him so sharply that he nearly tripped him up weve never had anything else
There was never anything else for us TO have
Shes lied up hill and down dale from the first time she clinched her baby fingers around my hand he imitated Zoies dainty manner and said pleased to meet you
But Ive caught her with the goods this time he shouted and Ive just about got HIM
Him
echoed Jimmy weakly
The wifestealer exclaimed Alfred and he clinched his fists in anticipation of the justice he would one day mete out to the despicable creature
Now Jimmy had been called many things in his time he realised that he would doubtless be called many more things in the future but never by the wildest stretch of imagination had he ever conceived of himself in the role of wife stealer
Mistaking Jimmys look of amazement for one of incredulity Alfred endeavoured to convince him
Oh YOULL meet a wifestealer sooner or later he assured him
You neednt look so horrified
Jimmy only stared at him and he continued excitedly Shes had the effronterythe bad tastethe idiocy to lunch in a public restaurant with the blackguard
The mere sound of the word made Jimmy shudder but engrossed in his own troubles Alfred continued without heeding him
Henri the headwaiter told me explained Alfred and Jimmy remembered guiltily that he had been very bumptious with the fellow
You know the place continued Alfred the LaSalle a restaurant where I am knownwhere she is knownwhere my best friends dinewhere Henri has looked after me for years
That shows how desperate she is
She must be mad about the fool
Shes lost all sense of decency
And again Alfred paced the floor
Oh I wouldnt go as far as that stammered Jimmy
Oh wouldnt you
cried Alfred again turning so abruptly that Jimmy caught his breath
Each word of Jimmys was apparently goading him on to greater anger
Now dont get hasty Jimmy almost pleaded
The whole thing is no doubt perfectly innocent
Talk to her gently
Win her confidence
Get her to tell you the truth
The truth
shouted Alfred in derision
Zoie
The truth
Jimmy feared that his young friend might actually become violent
Alfred bore down upon him like a maniac
The truth
he repeated wildly
She wouldnt know the truth if she saw it under a microscope
Shes the most unconscionable little liar that ever lured a man to the altar
Jimmy rolled his round eyes with feigned incredulity
I found it out before wed been married a month continued Alfred
She used to sit evenings facing the clock
I sat with my back to it
I used to ask her the time
Invariably she would lie half an hour backward or forward just for practice
THAT was the BEGINNING
Here listen to some of these he added as he drew half a dozen telegrams from his inner pocket and motioned Jimmy to sit at the opposite side of the table
Jimmy would have preferred to stand but it was not a propitious time to consult his own preferences
He allowed himself to be bullied into the chair that Alfred suggested
Throwing himself into the opposite chair Alfred selected various exhibits from his collection of messages
I just brought these up from the office he said
These are some of the telegrams that she sent me each day last week while I was away
This is Mondays
And he proceeded to read with a sneering imitation of Zoies cloy sweetness 
Darling so lonesome without you
Cried all day
When are you coming home to your wee sad wifie
Love and kisses
Zoie
 Tearing the defenceless telegram into bits Alfred threw it from him and waited for his friends verdict
She sent that over the wire
gasped Jimmy
Oh thats nothing answered Alfred
Thats a mild one
And he selected another from the same pocket
Here listen to this
This is what she REALLY did
This is from my secretary the same night
You spied upon her
asked Jimmy feeling more and more convinced that his own deceptions would certainly be run to earth
I HAVE to spy upon her answered Alfred in selfdefence
Its the only way I can keep her from making me utterly ridiculous
And he proceeded to read from the secretarys telegram 
Shopped all morning
Lunched at Martingales with man and woman unknown to meMartingales  he repeated with a sneer  Motored through Park with Mrs Wilmer until five
Mrs Wilmer he exclaimed theres a woman Ive positively forbidden her to speak to
Jimmy only shook his head and Alfred continued to read 
Had tea with Mr and Mrs Thompson and young Ardesley at the Park View
Ardesley is a young cub explained Alfred who spends his time running around with married women while their husbands are away trying to make a living for them
Shocking
was the extent of Jimmys comment and Alfred resumed reading 
Dinner and theatre same party
Supper at Wellingford
Home two A M  He looked at Jimmy expecting to hear Zoie bitterly condemned
Jimmy only stared at him blankly
Thats pretty good commented Alfred for the woman who CRIED all day isnt it
Still Jimmy made no answer and Alfred brought his fist down upon the table impatiently
Isnt it
he repeated
She was a bit busy THAT day admitted Jimmy uneasily
The truth
cried Alfred again as he rose and paced about excitedly
Getting the truth out of Zoie is like going to a fire in the night
You think its near but you never get there
And when she begins by saying that shes going to tell you the REAL truth he threw up his hands in despairwell then its time to leave home
CHAPTER VI There was another pause then Alfred drew in his breath and bore down upon Jimmy with fresh vehemence
The only time I get even a semblance of truth out of Zoie he cried is when I catch her redhanded
Again he pounded the table and again Jimmy winced
And even then he continued she colours it so with her affected innocence and her plea about just wishing to be a good fellow that she almost makes me doubt my own eyes
She is an artist he declared with a touch of enforced admiration
Theres no use talking that woman is an artist
What are you going to do
asked Jimmy for the want of anything better to say
I am going to leave her declared Alfred emphatically
I am going away
A faint hope lit Jimmys round childlike face
With Alfred away there would be no further investigation of the luncheon incident
That might be a good idea he said
Its THE idea said Alfred most of my business is in Detroit anyhow
Im going to make that my headquarters and stay there
Jimmy was almost smiling
As for Zoie continued Alfred she can stay right here and go as far as she likes
Not with me thought Jimmy
But shrieked Alfred with renewed emphasis Im going to find out who the FELLOW is
Ill have THAT satisfaction
Jimmys spirits fell
Henri knows the headwaiter of every restaurant in this town said Alfred that is every one where shed be likely to go and he says hed recognise the man she lunched with if he saw him again
Jimmys features became suddenly distorted
The minute she appears anywhere with anybody explained Alfred Henri will be notified by phone
Hell identify the man and then hell wire me
What good will that do
asked Jimmy weakly
Ill take the first train home declared Alfred
For what
questioned Jimmy
To shoot him
exclaimed Alfred
What
gasped Jimmy almost losing his footing
Alfred mistook Jimmys concern for anxiety on his behalf
Oh Ill be acquitted he declared
Dont you worry
Ill get my tale of woe before the jury
But I say protested Jimmy too uneasy to longer conceal his real emotions why kill this one particular chap when there are so many others
Hes the only one shes ever lunched with ALONE said Alfred
Shes been giddy but at least shes always been chaperoned except with him
Hes the one all right theres no doubt about it
Hes the beginning of the end
His own end yes assented Jimmy half to himself
Now see here old man he argued Id give that poor devil a chance to explain
Explain
shouted Alfred so sharply that Jimmy quickly retreated
I wouldnt believe him now if he were one of the Twelve Apostles
Thats tough murmured Jimmy as he saw the last avenue of honourable escape closed to him
Tough
roared Alfred thinking of himself
Hah
On the Apostles I mean explained Jimmy nervously
Again Alfred paced up and down the room and again Jimmy tried to think of some way to escape from his present difficulty
It was quite apparent that his only hope lay not in his own candor but in Alfreds absence
How long do you expect to be away
he asked
Only until I hear from Henri said Alfred
Henri
repeated Jimmy and again a gleam of hope shone on his dull features
He had heard that waiters were often to be bribed
Nice fellow Henri he ventured cautiously
Gets a large salary no doubt
Does he
exclaimed Alfred with a certain pride of proprietorship
No tips could touch Henri no indeed
Hes not that sort of a person
Again the hope faded from Jimmys round face
I look upon Henri as my friend continued Alfred enthusiastically
He speaks every language known to man
Hes been in every country in the world
HENRI UNDERSTANDS LIFE
LOTS of people UNDERSTAND LIFE commented Jimmy dismally but SOME people dont APPRECIATE it
They value it too lightly to MY way of thinking
Ah but you have something to live for argued Alfred
I have indeed a great deal agreed Jimmy more and more abused at the thought of what he was about to lose
Ah thats different exclaimed Alfred
But what have I
Jimmy was in no frame of mind to consider his young friends assets he was thinking of his own difficulties
Im a laughing stock shouted Alfred
I know it
A good thing who gives his wife everything she asks for while she is running around withwith my best friend for all I know
Oh no no protested Jimmy nervously
I wouldnt say that
Even if she werent running around continued Alfred excitedly without heeding his friends interruption what have we to look forward to
What have we to look backward to
Again Jimmys face was a blank
Alfred answered his own question by lifting his arms tragically toward Heaven
One eternal round of wrangles and rows
A childless home
Do you think she wants babies
he cried wheeling about on Jimmy and daring him to answer in the affirmative
Oh no
he sneered
All she wants is a good time
Well mumbled Jimmy I cant see much in babies myself fat little red worms
Alfreds breath went from him in astonishment Werent YOU ever a fat little red worm
he hissed
Wasnt I ever a little fat red he paused in confusion as his ear became puzzled by the proper sequence of his adjectives a fat red little worm he stammered and see what we are now
He thrust out his chest and strutted about in great pride
Big red worms admitted Jimmy gloomily
But Alfred did not hear him
You and I ought to have SONS on the way to what we are he declared and better
Oh yes better agreed Jimmy thinking of his present plight
Much better
But HAVE we
demanded Alfred
Jimmy glanced about the room as though expecting an answering demonstration from the ceiling
Have YOU
persisted Alfred
Jimmy shook his head solemnly
Have I
asked the irate husband
Out of sheer absent mindedness Jimmy shrugged his shoulders
As usual Alfred answered his own question
Oh no
he raged
YOU have a wife who spends her time and money gadding about with Jimmys face showed a new alarm 
my wife concluded Alfred
Jimmy breathed a sigh of relief
I have a wife said Alfred who spends her time and my money gadding around with God knows whom
But Ill catch him
he cried with new fury
Here he said pulling a roll of bills from his pocket
Ill bet you Ill catch him
How much do you want to bet
Undesirous of offering any added inducements toward his own capture Jimmy backed away both literally and figuratively from Alfreds proposition
Whats the use of getting so excited
he asked
Mistaking Jimmys unwillingness to bet for a disinclination to take advantage of a friends reckless mood Alfred resented the implied insult to his astuteness
You think I cant catch him
he exclaimed
Lets see the colour of your money he demanded
But before Jimmy could comply an unexpected voice broke into the argument and brought them both round with a start
CHAPTER VII Good Heavens exclaimed Aggie who had entered the room while Alfred was talking his loudest
What a racket
Her eyes fell upon Jimmy who was teetering about uneasily just behind Alfred
She stared at him in amazement
Was it possible that Jimmy the methodical had left his office at this hour of the morning and for what
Avoiding the question in Aggies eyes Jimmy pretended to be searching for his pocket handkerchief but always with the vision of Aggie in her new Fall gown and her large picture hat at his elbow
Never before had she appeared so beautiful to him so desirablesuppose he should lose her
Life spread before him as a dreary waste
He tried to look up at her he could not
He feared she would read his guilt in his eyes
What guilt
he asked himself
There was no longer any denying the facta secret had sprung up between them
Annoyed at receiving no greeting Aggie continued in a rather hurt voice Arent you two going to speak to me
Alfred swallowed hard in an effort to regain his composure
Goodmorning he said curtly
Fully convinced of a disagreement between the two old friends Aggie addressed herself in a reproachful tone to Jimmy
My dear she said what are you doing here this time of day
Jimmy felt Alfreds steely eyes upon him
Why
he stammered
Why I just came over tobring your message
My message
repeated Aggie in perplexity
What message
Alfreds eyebrows drew themselves sharply together
Jimmy had told so many lies this morning that another more or less could not matter moreover this was not a time to hesitate
Why the message you sent to Zoie he answered boldly
But I sent no message to Zoie said Aggie
What
thundered Alfred so loud that Aggies fingers involuntarily went to her ears
She was more and more puzzled by the odd behaviour of the two
I mean yesterdays message corrected Jimmy
And he assumed an aggrieved air toward Aggie
You villain exclaimed Aggie
I told you to phone her yesterday morning from the office
Yes I know agreed Jimmy placidly but I forgot it and I just came over to explain
Alfreds fixed stare was relaxing and at last Jimmy could breathe
Oh murmured Aggie with a wise little elevation of her eyebrows then thats why Zoie didnt keep her luncheon appointment with me yesterday
Jimmy felt that if this were to go on much longer he would utter one wild shriek and give himself up for lost but at present he merely swallowed with an effort and awaited developments
It was now Alfreds turn to become excited
Oh IS it
he cried with hysterical laughter
Aggie regarded him with astonishment
Was this her usually selfcontrolled friend
Oh no
sneered Alfred with unmistakable pity for her credulity
Thats not why my wife didnt eat luncheon with you
She may TELL you thats why
She undoubtedly will but its NOT why
Oh no
and running his hands through his hair Alfred tore up and down the room
What do you mean by that
Aggie asked in amazement
Your dear husband Jimmy will doubtless explain answered Alfred with a slur on the dear
Then he turned toward the door of his study
Pray excuse meIM TOO BUSY and with that he strode out of the room and banged the study door behind him
Goodness gracious
gasped Aggie
She looked after Alfred then at Jimmy
She was the picture of consternation
Whats the matter with him
she asked
Just another little family tiff answered Jimmy trying to assume a nonchalant manner
Not about YOU
gasped Aggie
Me
cried Jimmy his equilibrium again upset
Certainly not
he declared
What an idea
Yes wasnt it
answered Aggie
That just shows how silly one can be
I almost thought Alfred was going to say that Zoie had lunched with you
Me
again echoed Jimmy and he wondered if everybody in the world had conspired to make him the target of their attention
He caught Aggies eye and tried to laugh carelessly
That would have been funny wouldnt it
he said
Yes wouldnt it repeated Aggie and he thought he detected a slight uneasiness in her voice
Speaking of lunch added Jimmy quickly I think dearie that Ill come home for lunch in the future
What
exclaimed Aggie in great amazement
Those downtown places upset my digestion explained Jimmy quickly
Isnt this very SUDDEN she asked and again Jimmy fancied that there was a shade of suspicion in her tone
His face assumed a martyred expression
Of course dear he said if you insist upon my eating downtown Ill do it but I thought youd be glad to have me at home
Aggie turned to him with real concern
Why Jimmy she said whats the matter with you
She took a step toward him and anxiously studied his face
I never heard you talk like that before
I dont think youre well
Thats just what Im telling you insisted Jimmy vehemently excited beyond all reason by receiving even this small bit of sympathy
Im ill he declared
No sooner had he made the declaration than he began to believe in it
His doleful countenance increased Aggies alarm
My angelface she purred and she took his chubby cheeks in her hands and looked down at him fondly
You know I ALWAYS want you to come home
She stooped and kissed Jimmys pouting lips
He held up his face for more
She smoothed the hair from his worried brow and endeavoured to cheer him
Ill run right home now she said and tell cook to get something nice and tempting for you
I can see Zoie later
It doesnt matter murmured Jimmy as he followed her toward the door with a doleful shake of his head
I dont suppose I shall ever enjoy my luncheon againas long as I live
Nonsense cried Aggie come along
CHAPTER VIII WHEN Alfred returned to the living room he was followed by his secretary who carried two wellfilled satchels
His temper was not improved by the discovery that he had left certain important papers at his office
Dispatching his man to get them and to meet him at the station with them he collected a few remaining letters from the drawer of the writing table then uneasy at remaining longer under the same roof with Zoie he picked up his hat and started toward the hallway
For the first time his eye was attracted by a thick layer of dust and lint on his coat sleeve
Worse still there was a smudge on his cuff
If there was one thing more than another that Alfred detested it was untidiness
Putting his hat down with a bang he tried to flick the dust from his sleeve with his pocket handkerchief finding this impossible he removed his coat and began to shake it violently
It was at this particular moment that Zoies small face appeared cautiously from behind the frame of the bedroom door
She was quick to perceive Alfreds plight
Disappearing from view for an instant she soon reappeared with Alfreds favourite clothesbrush
She tiptoed into the room
Barely had Alfred drawn his coat on his shoulders when he was startled by a quick little flutter of the brush on his sleeve
He turned in surprise and beheld Zoie who looked up at him as penitent and irresistible as a newlypunished child
Oh snarled Alfred and he glared at her as though he would enjoy strangling her on the spot
Alfred pouted Zoie and he knew she was going to add her customary appeal of Lets make up
But Alfred was in no mood for nonsense
He thrust his hands in his pockets and made straight for the outer doorway
Smiling to herself as she saw him leaving without his hat Zoie slipped it quickly beneath a flounce of her skirt
No sooner had Alfred reached the sill of the door than his hand went involuntarily to his head he turned to the table where he had left his hat
His face wore a puzzled look
He glanced beneath the table in the chair behind the table across the piano and then he began circling the room with pent up rage
He dashed into his study and out again he threw the chairs about with increasing irritation then giving up the search he started hatless toward the hallway
It was then that a soft babyish voice reached his ear
Have you lost something dear
cooed Zoie
Alfred hesitated
It was difficult to lower his dignity by answering her but he needed his headgear
I want my hat he admitted shortly
Your hat
repeated Zoie innocently and she glanced around the room with mild interest
Maybe Mary took it
Mary
cried Alfred and thinking the mystery solved he dashed toward the inner hallway
Let ME get it dear pleaded Zoie and she laid a small detaining hand upon his arm as he passed
Stop it
commanded Alfred hotly and he shook the small hand from his sleeve as though it had been something poisonous
But Allie protested Zoie pretending to be shocked and grieved
Dont you but Allie me cried Alfred turning upon her sharply
All I want is my hat and again he started in search of Mary
Butbutbut Allie stammered Zoie as she followed him
Butbutbut repeated Alfred turning on her in a fury
Youve butted me out of everything that I wanted all my life but youre not going to do it again
You see you said it yourself laughed Zoie
Said WHAT roared Alfred
But tittered Zoie
The remnants of Alfreds selfcontrol were forsaking him
He clinched his fists hard in a final effort toward restraint
Youd just as well stop all these baby tricks he threatened between his teeth theyre not going to work
THIS time my mind is made up
Then why are you afraid to talk to me
asked Zoie sweetly
Who said I was afraid
demanded Alfred hotly
You ACT like it declared Zoie with some truth on her side
You dont want she got no further
All I want interrupted Alfred is to get out of this house once and for all and to stay out of it
And again he started in pursuit of his hat
Why Allie she gazed at him with deep reproach
You liked this place so much when we first came here
Again Alfred picked at the lint on his coat sleeve
Edging her way toward him cautiously she ventured to touch his sleeve with the brush
Ill attend to that myself he said curtly and he sank into the nearest chair to tie a refractory shoe lace
Let me brush you dear pleaded Zoie
I dont wish you to start out in the world looking unbrushed she pouted
Then with a sly emphasis she added teasingly The OTHER women might not admire you that way
Alfred broke his shoe string then and there
While he stooped to tie a knot in it Zoie managed to perch on the arm of his chair
You know Allie she continued coaxingly no one could ever love you as I do
Again Alfred broke his shoe lace
Oh Allie
she exclaimed with a little ripple of childish laughter do you remember how absurdly poor we were when we were first married and how you refused to take any help from your family
And do you remember that silly old pair of black trousers that used to get so thin on the knees and how I used to put shoeblacking underneath so the white wouldnt show through
By this time her arm managed to get around his neck
Stop it
shrieked Alfred as though mortal man could endure no more
Youve used those trousers to settle every crisis in our lives
Zoie gazed at him without daring to breathe even she was aghast at his fury but only temporarily
She recovered herself and continued sweetly If everything is SETTLED she argued wheres the harm in talking
Weve DONE with talking declared Alfred
From this on I act
And determined not to be cheated out of this final decision he again started for the hall door
Oh Allie
cried Zoie in a tone of sharp alarm
In spite of himself Alfred turned to learn the cause of her anxiety
You havent got your overshoes on she said
Speechless with rage Alfred continued on his way but Zoie moved before him swiftly
Ill get them for you dear she volunteered graciously
Stop
thundered Alfred
They were now face to face
I wish you wouldnt roar like that pouted Zoie and the pink tips of her fingers were thrust tight against her ears
Alfred drew in his breath and endeavoured for the last time to repress his indignation
Either you cant or you wont understand that it is extremely unpleasant for me to even talk to you much less to receive your attentions
Very likely answered Zoie unperturbed
But so long as I am your lawful wedded wife she emphasised the lawfulI shant let any harm come to you if I can help it
She lifted her eyes to heaven bidding it to bear witness to her martyrdom and looking for all the world like a stained glass saint
Oh no
shouted Alfred almost hysterical at his apparent failure to make himself understood
You wouldnt let any harm come to me
Oh no
Youve only made me the greatest joke in Chicago he shouted
Youve only made me such a laughing stock that I have to leave it
Thats allthats all
Leave Chicago
exclaimed Zoie incredulously
Then regaining her selfcomposure she edged her way close to him and looked up into his eyes in babylike wonderment
Why Allie where are we going
Her small arm crept up toward his shoulder
Alfred pushed it from him rudely
WE are not going he asserted in a firm measured voice
I am going
Wheres my hat
And again he started in search of his absent headgear
Oh Allie
she exclaimed and this time there was genuine alarm in her voice you wouldnt leave me
Wouldnt I though
sneered Alfred
Before he knew it Zoies arms were about himshe was pleading desperately
Now see here Allie you may call me all the names you like she cried with great selfabasement but you shantyou SHANT go away from Chicago
Oh indeed
answered Alfred as he shook himself free of her
I suppose youd like me to go on with this cat and dog existence
Youd like me to stay right here and pay the bills and take care of you while you flirt with every Tom Dick and Harry in town
Its only your horrid disposition that makes you talk like that whimpered Zoie
You know very well that I never cared for anybody but you
Until you GOT me yes assented Alfred and NOW you care for everybody BUT me
She was about to object but he continued quickly
Where you MEET your gentlemen friends is beyond me
I dont introduce them to you
I should say not agreed Zoie and there was a touch of vindictiveness in her voice
The only male creature that you ever introduced to me was the family dog
I introduce every man whos fit to meet you declared Alfred with an air of great pride
That doesnt speak very well for your acquaintances snipped Zoie
Even HER temper was beginning to assert itself
I wont bicker like this declared Alfred
Thats what you always say when you cant think of an answer retorted Zoie
You mean when Im tired of answering your nonsense
thundered Alfred
CHAPTER IX Realising that she was rapidly losing ground by exercising her advantage over Alfred in the matter of quick retort Zoie with her customary cunning veered round to a more conciliatory tone
Well she cooed suppose I DID eat lunch with a man
Ah
shrieked Alfred as though he had at last run his victim to earth
She retreated with her fingers crossed
I only said suppose she reminded him quickly
Then she continued in a tone meant to draw from him his hearts most secret confidence
Didnt you ever eat lunch with any woman but me
Never
answered Alfred firmly
There was an unmistakable expression of pleasure on Zoies small face but she forced back the smile that was trying to creep round her lips and sidled toward Alfred with eyes properly downcast
Then Im very sorry I did it she said solemnly and Ill never do it again
So
cried Alfred with renewed indignation
You admit it
Just to please you dear explained Zoie sweetly as though she were doing him the greatest possible favour
To please me
gasped Alfred
Do you suppose it pleases me to know that you are carrying on the moment my back is turned making a fool of me to my friends
Your friends
cried Zoie with a sneer
This time it was her turn to be angry
So
Its your FRIENDS that are worrying you
In her excitement she tossed Alfreds now damaged hat into the chair just behind her
He was far too overwrought to see it
I havent done you any harm she continued wildly
Its only what you think your friends think
You havent done me any harm
repeated Alfred in her same tragic key Oh no
Oh no
Youve only cheated me out of everything I expected to get out of life
Thats all
Zoie came to a full stop and waited for him to enumerate the various treasures that he had lost by marrying her
He did so
Before we were married he continued you pretended to adore children
You started your humbugging the first day I met you
I refer to little Willie Peck
A hysterical giggle very nearly betrayed her
Alfred continued I was fool enough to let you know that I admire women who like children
From that day until the hour that I led you to the altar youd fondle the ugliest little brats that we met in the street but the moment you GOT me Alfred
gasped Zoie
This was really going too far
Yes I repeat it
shouted Alfred pounding the table with his fist for emphasis
The moment you GOT me you declared that all children were horrid little insects and that someone ought to sprinkle bugpowder on them
Oh
protested Zoie shocked less by Alfreds interpretation of her sentiments than by the vulgarity with which he expressed them
On another occasion declared Alfred now carried away by the recital of his long pent up wrongs you told me that all babies should be put in cages shipped West and kept in pens until they got to be of an interesting age
Interesting age
 he repeated with a sneer meaning old enough to take YOU out to luncheon I suppose
I never said any such thing objected Zoie
Well that was the idea insisted Alfred
I havent your glib way of expressing myself
You manage to express yourself very well retorted Zoie
When you have anything DISAGREEABLE to say
As for babies she continued tentatively I think they are all very well in their PLACE but they were NEVER meant for an APARTMENT
I offered you a house in the country shouted Alfred
The country
echoed Zoie
How could I live in the country with people being murdered in their beds every night
Read the papers
Always an excuse sighed Alfred resignedly
There always HAS been and there always would be if Id stay to listen
Well for once he declared Im glad that we have no children
If we had I might feel some obligation to keep up this farce of a marriage
As it is he continued YOU are free and I am free
And with a courtly wave of his arm he dismissed Zoie and the entire subject and again he started in pursuit of Mary and his hat
If its your freedom you wish pouted Zoie with an abused air you might have said so in the first place
Alfred stopped in sheer amazement at the cleverness with which the little minx turned his every statement against him
Its not very manly of you she continued to abuse me just because youve found someone whom you like better
Thats not true protested Alfred hotly and you know its not true
Little did he suspect the trap into which she was leading him
Then you DONT love anybody more than you do me
she cried eagerly and she gazed up at him with adoring eyes
I didnt say any such thing hedged Alfred
Then you DO she accused him
I DONT he declared in self defence
With a cry of joy she sprang into his arms clasped her fingers tightly behind his neck and rained impulsive kisses upon his unsuspecting face
For an instant Alfred looked down at Zoie undecided whether to strangle her or to return her embraces
As usual his selfrespect won the day for him and with a determined effort he lifted her high in the air so that she lost her tenacious hold of him and sat her down with a thud in the very same chair in which she had lately dropped his hat
Having acted with this admirable resolution he strode majestically toward the inner hall but before he could reach it Zoie was again on her feet in a last vain effort to conciliate him
Turning Alfred caught sight of his poor battered hat
This was the final spur to action
Snatching it up with one hand and throwing his latchkey on the table with the other he made determinedly for the outer door
Screaming hysterically Zoie caught him just as he reached the threshold and threw the whole weight of her body upon him
Alfred she pleaded if you REALLY love me you CANT leave me like this
Her emotion was now genuine
He looked down at her gravely then into the future
There are other things more important than what YOU call love  he said very solemnly
There is such a thing as a soul if you only knew it
And you have hurt mine through and through
But how Alfred how
asked the small person and there was a frown of genuine perplexity on her tiny puckered brow
What have I REALLY DONE She stroked his hand fondly her baby eyes searched his face
It isnt so much what people DO to us that counts answered Alfred in a proud hurt voice
Its how much they DISAPPOINT us in what they do
I expected better of YOU he said sadly
Ill DO better coaxed Zoie if youll only give me a chance
He was half inclined to believe her
Now Allie she pleaded perceiving that his resentment was dying and resolved to at last adopt a straight course if youll only listen Ill tell you the REAL TRUTH
Unprepared for the electrical effect of her remark Zoie found herself staggering to keep her feet
She gazed at Alfred in amazement
His arms were lifted to Heaven his breath was coming fast 
The REAL TRUTH
 he gasped then bringing his crushed hat down on his forehead with a resounding whack he rushed from her sight
The clang of the closing elevator door brought Zoie to a realisation of what had actually happened
Determined that Alfred should not escape her she rushed to the hall door and called to him wildly
There was no answer
Running back to the room she threw open the window and threw herself half out of it
She was just in time to see Alfred climb into a passing taxi
Alfred
she cried
Then automatically she flew to the phone
Give me 4302 Main she called and she tried to force back her tears
Is this Hardy  Company
she asked
Well this is Mrs Hardy she explained
I wish youd ring me up the moment my husband comes in
There was a slight pause then she clutched the receiver harder
Not COMING back
she gasped
Goneto Detroit
A short moan escaped her lips
She let the receiver fall back on the hook and her head went forward on her outstretched arms
CHAPTER X When Jimmy came home to luncheon that day Aggie succeeded in getting a general idea of the state of affairs in the Hardy household
Of course Jimmy didnt tell the whole truth
Oh nofar from it
In fact he appeared to be aggravatingly ignorant as to the exact cause of the Hardy upheaval
Of ONE thing however he was certain
Alfred was going to quit Chicago and leave Zoie to her own devices
Jimmy
cried Aggie
How awful
and before Jimmy was fairly out of the front gate she had seized her hat and gloves and rushed to the rescue of her friend
Not surprised at finding Zoie in a state of collapse Aggie opened her arms sympathetically to receive the weeping confidences that she was sure would soon come
Zoie dear she said as the fragile mite rocked to and fro
What is it
She pressed the soft ringlets from the girls throbbing forehead
Its Alfred sobbed Zoie
Hes gone
Yes I know answered Aggie tenderly
Isnt it awful
Jimmy just told me
Jimmy told you WHAT
questioned Zoie and she lifted her head and regarded Aggie with sudden uneasiness
Her friends answer raised Jimmy considerably in Zoies esteem
Apparently he had not breathed a word about the luncheon
Why Jimmy told me continued Aggie that you and Alfred had had another tiff and that Alfred had gone for good
For GOOD
echoed Zoie and her eyes were wide with terror
Did Alfred tell Jimmy that
Aggie nodded
Then he MEANS it
cried Zoie at last fully convinced of the strength of Alfreds resolve
But he shant she declared emphatically
I wont let him
Ill go after him
He has no right By this time she was running aimlessly about the room
What did you do to him
asked Aggie feeling sure that Zoie was as usual at fault
Nothing answered Zoie with wide innocent eyes
Nothing
echoed Aggie with little confidence in her friends ability to judge impartially about so personal a matter
Absolutely nothing affirmed Zoie
And there was no doubting that she at least believed it
What does he SAY questioned Aggie diplomatically
He SAYS I hurt his soul
Whatever THAT is answered Zoie and her face wore an injured expression
Isnt that a nice excuse she continued for leaving your lawful wedded wife
It was apparent that she expected Aggie to rally strongly to her defence
But at present Aggie was bent upon getting facts
HOW did you hurt him
she persisted
I ate lunch said Zoie with the face of a cherub
With whom
questioned Aggie slyly
She was beginning to scent the probable origin of the misunderstanding
Its of no consequence answered Zoie carelessly I wouldnt have wiped my feet on the man
By this time she had entirely forgotten Aggies proprietorship in the source of her trouble
But who WAS the man
urged Aggie and in her mind she had already condemned him as a low unprincipled creature
What does that matter
asked Zoie impatiently
Its ANY man with Alfredyou know thatANY man 
Aggie sank in a chair and looked at her friend in despair
Why DO you do these things she said wearily when you know how Alfred feels about them
You talk as though I did nothing else answered Zoie with an aggrieved tone
Its the first time since Ive been married that Ive ever eaten lunch with any man but Alfred
I thought youd have a little sympathy with me she whimpered instead of putting me on the gridiron like everyone else does
Everyone else
questioned Aggie with recurring suspicion
I mean Alfred explained Zoie
HES everyone else to me
And then with a sudden abandonment of grief she threw herself prostrate at her friends knees
Oh Aggie what can I do
she cried
But Aggie was not satisfied with Zoies fragmentary account of her latest escapade
Is that the only thing that Alfred has against you
she asked
Thats the LATEST sniffled Zoie in a heap at Aggies feet
And then she continued in a much aggrieved tone You know hes ALWAYS rowing because we havent as many babies as the cook has cats
Well why dont you get him a baby
asked the practical farseeing Aggie
Its too late NOW moaned Zoie
Not at all reassured Aggie
Its the very thing that would bring him back
How COULD I get one
questioned Zoie and she looked up at Aggie with round astonished eyes
Adopt it answered Aggie decisively
Zoie regarded her friend with mingled disgust and disappointment
No she said with a sigh and a shake of her head that wouldnt do any good
Alfreds so fussy
He always wants his OWN things around
He neednt know declared Aggie boldly
What do you mean
whispered Zoie
Drawing herself up with an air of great importance and regarding the wondering young person at her knee with smiling condescension Aggie prepared to make a most interesting disclosure
There was a long article in the paper only this morning she told Zoie saying that three thousand husbands in this VERY CITY are fondling babies not their own
Zoie turned her small head to one side the better to study Aggies face
It was apparent to the latter that she must be much more explicit
Babies adopted in their absence explained Aggie while they were on trips around the country
A dangerous light began to glitter in Zoies eyes
Aggie
she cried bringing her small hands together excitedly do you think I COULD
Why not
asked Aggie with a very superior air
Zoies enthusiasm was increasing her friends admiration of her own scheme
This same paper tells of a woman who adopted three sons while her husband was in Europe and he thinks each one of them is his
Where can we get some
cried Zoie now thoroughly enamoured of the idea
You can always get TONS of them at the Childrens Home answered Aggie confidently
I cant endure babies declared Zoie but Id do ANYTHING to get Alfred back
Can we get one TODAY
she asked
Aggie looked at her small friend with positive pity
You dont WANT one TODAY she explained
Zoie rolled her large eyes inquiringly
If you were to get one today continued Aggie Alfred would know it wasnt yours wouldnt he
A light of understanding began to show on Zoies small features
There was none when he left this morning added Aggie
Thats true acquiesced Zoie
You must wait awhile counselled Aggie and then get a perfectly new one
But Zoie had never been taught to wait
Now Aggie she began
Aggie continued without heeding her
After a few months she explained when Alfreds temper has had time to cool well get Jimmy to send him a wire that he has an heir
A few months
exclaimed Zoie as though Aggie had suggested an eternity
Ive never been away from Alfred that long in all my life
Aggie was visibly annoyed
Well of course she said coldly as she rose to go if you can get Alfred back WITHOUT that But I cant
cried Zoie and she clung to her friend as to her last remaining hope
Then answered Aggie somewhat mollified by Zoies complete submission
THIS is the only way
The President of the Childrens Home is a great friend of Jimmys she said proudly
It was at this point that Zoie made her first practical suggestion
Then well LET JIMMY GET IT she declared
Of course agreed Aggie enthusiastically as though they would be according the poor soul a rare privilege
Jimmy gives a hundred dollars to the Home every Christmasadditional proof why he should be selected for this very important office
Good Heavens
exclaimed Zoie with shocked surprise
If Alfred were to give a hundred dollars to a Babys Home I should suspect him
Dont be silly
snapped Aggie curtly
In spite of her firm faith in Jimmys innocence she was undoubtedly annoyed by Zoies unpleasant suggestion
There was an instants pause then putting disagreeable thoughts from her mind Aggie turned to Zoie with renewed enthusiasm
We must get down to business she said well begin on the babys outfit at once
Its what
queried Zoie
Its clothes explained Aggie
Oh what fun
exclaimed Zoie and she clapped her hands merrily like a very small child
A moment later she stopped with sudden misgiving
But Aggie she said fearfully suppose Alfred shouldnt come back after Ive got the baby
Id be a widow with a child
Oh hes sure to come back
answered Aggie with a confident air
Hell take the first train home
I believe he will assented Zoie joyfully
All her clouds were again dispelled
Aggie she cried impulsively you are a darling
You have just saved my life
And she clasped her arms so tightly around Aggies neck that her friend was in danger of being suffocated
Releasing herself Aggie continued with a ruffled collar and raised vanity You can write him an insinuating letter now and then just to lead up to the good news gradually
Zoie tipped her small head to one side and studied her friend thoughtfully
Do you know Aggie she said with frank admiration I believe you are a better liar than I am
Im NOT a liar objected Aggie vehemently at least not often she corrected
Ive never lied to Jimmy in all my life
She drew herself up with conscious pride
And Jimmy has NEVER LIED TO ME
Isnt that nice sniffed Zoie and she pretended to be searching for her pockethandkerchief
But Aggie did not see her
She was glancing at the clock
I must go now she said
And she started toward the door
But Aggie protested Zoie unwilling to be left alone
Ill run in again at tea time promised Aggie
I dont mind the DAYS whined Zoie but when NIGHT comes I just MUST have somebodys arms around me
Zoie
gasped Aggie both shocked and alarmed
I cant help it confessed Zoie the moment it gets dark Im just scared stiff
Thats no way for a MOTHER to talk reproved Aggie
A mother
exclaimed Zoie horrified at the sudden realisation that this awful appellation would undoubtedly pursue her for the rest of her life
Oh dont call me that she pleaded
You make me feel a thousand years old
Nonsense laughed Aggie and before Zoie could again detain her she was out of the room
When the outside door had closed behind her friend Zoie gazed about the room disconsolately but her depression was shortlived
Remembering Aggies permission about the letter she ran quickly to the writing table curled her small self up on one foot placed a brand new pen in the holder then drew a sheet of paper toward her and with shoulders hunched high and her face close to the paper after the manner of a child she began to pen the first of a series of veiled communications that were ultimately to fill her young husband with amazement
CHAPTER XI When Jimmy reached his office after his unforeseen call upon Zoie his subsequent encounter with Alfred and his enforced luncheon at home with Aggie he found his mail his phone calls and his neglected appointments in a state of hopeless congestion and try as he would he could not concentrate upon their disentanglement
Growing more and more furious with the long legged secretary who stood at the corner of his desk looking down upon him expectantly and waiting for his tardy instructions Jimmy rose and looked out of the window
He could feel Andrews reproachful eyes following him
Shall Miss Perkins take your letters now
asked Andrew and he wondered how late the office staff would be kept tonight to make up for the time that was now being wasted
Coming after repeated wounds from his nearest and dearest Andrews implied reproach was too much for Jimmys overwrought nerves
Get out
he answered unceremoniously
And when Andrew could assure himself that he had heard aright he stalked out of the door with his head high in the air
Jimmy looked after his departing secretary with positive hatred
It was apparent to him that the whole world was against him
He had been too easy he decided
His family friends and business associates had undoubtedly lost all respect for him
From this day forth he was determined to show himself to be a man of strong mettle
Having made this important decision and having convinced himself that he was about to start on a new life Jimmy strode to the door of the office and without disturbing the injured Andrew he called sharply to Miss Perkins to come at once and take his letters
Poor Jimmy
Again he tried in vain to concentrate upon the details of the cutglass industry
Invariably his mind would wander back to the unexpected incidents of the morning
Stopping suddenly in the middle of a letter to a competing firm he began pacing hurriedly up and down the room
Had she not feared that her chief might misconstrue any suggestion from her as an act of impertinence Miss Perkins having learned all the companys cutglass quotations by rote could easily have supplied the remainder of the letter
As it was she waited impatiently tapping the corner of the desk with her idle pencil
Jimmy turned at the sound and glanced at the pencil with unmistakable disapproval
Miss Perkins waited in silence
After one or two more uneasy laps about the room Jimmy went to his phone and called his house number
Its undoubtedly domestic trouble decided Miss Perkins and she wondered whether it would be delicate of her under the circumstances to remain in the room
From her employers conversation at the phone it was clear to Miss Perkins that Mrs Jinks was spending the afternoon with Mrs Hardy but why this should have so annoyed MR Jinks was a question that Miss Perkins found it difficult to answer
Was it possible that Mr Jinkss present state of unrest could be traced to the door of the beautiful young wife of his friend
Oh dear thought Miss Perkins how scandalous
That will do commanded Jimmy interrupting Miss Perkinss interesting speculations and he nodded toward the door
But stammered Miss Perkins as she glanced at the unfinished letters
Ill call you when I need you answered Jimmy gruffly
Miss Perkins left the room in high dudgeon
ILL show them said Jimmy to himself determined to carry out his recent resolve to be firm
Then his mind wend back to his domestic troubles
Suppose that Zoie after imposing secrecy upon him should change that thing called her mind and confide in Aggie about the luncheon
Jimmy was positively pale
He decided to telephone to Zoies house and find out how affairs were progressing
At the phone he hesitated
If Aggie HAS found out about the luncheon he argued my phoning to Zoies will increase her suspicions
If Zoie has told her nothing shell wonder why Im phoning to Zoies house
Theres only one thing to do he decided
I must wait and say nothing
I can tell from Aggies face when I meet her at dinner whether Zoie has betrayed me
Having arrived at this conclusion Jimmy resolved to get home as early as possible and again Miss Perkins was called to his aid
The flurry with which Jimmy despatched the days remaining business confirmed both Miss Perkins and Andrew in their previous opinion that the boss had suddenly gone off his head
And when he at last left the office and banged the door behind him there was a general sigh of relief from his usually tranquil staff
Instead of walking as was his custom Jimmy took a taxi to his home but alas to his surprise he found no wife
Did Mrs Jinks leave any word
he inquired from the butler
None at all answered that unperturbed creature and Jimmy felt sure that the attitude of his office antagonists had communicated itself to his household servants
When Jimmys anxious ear at last caught the rustle of a womans dress in the hallway his dinner had been waiting half an hour and he had worked himself into a state of fierce antagonism toward everything and everybody
At the sound of Aggies voice however his heart began to pound with fear
Had she found him out for the weak miserable deceiver that he was
Would she tell him that they were going to separate forever
Aggies first words were reassuring
Awfully sorry to be so late dear she said
Jimmy felt her kiss upon his chubby cheek and her dear arms about his neck
He decided forthwith to tell her everything and never never again to run the risk of deceiving her but before he could open his lips she continued gaily Ive brought Zoie home with me dear
Theres no sense in her eating all alone and shes going to have ALL her dinners with us
Jimmy groaned
After dinner continued Aggie you and I can take her to the theatre and all those places and keep her cheered until Alfred comes home
Home
repeated Jimmy in alarm
Was it possible that Alfred had already relented
Oh he doesnt know it yet explained Aggie but hes coming
Well tell you all about it at dinner
And they did
While waiting for Aggie Jimmy had thought himself hungry but once the two women had laid before him their nefarious babysnatching schemefood lost its savour for him and one course after another was taken away from him untouched
Each time that Jimmy ventured a mild objection to his part in the plan as scheduled by them he met the threatening eye of Zoie and by the time that the three left the table he was so harassed and confused by the chatter of the two excited women that he was not only reconciled but eager to enter into any scheme that might bring Alfred back and free him of the enforced companionship of Alfreds nerveracking wife
True he reflected it was possible that Alfred on his return might discover him to be the culprit who lunched with Zoie and might carry out his murderous threat but even such a fate was certainly preferable to interminable evenings spent under the same roof with Zoie
All YOU need do Jimmy explained Aggie sweetly when the three of them were comfortably settled in the library is to see your friend the Superintendent of the Babies Home and tell him just what kind of a baby we shall need and when we shall need it
Cant we see it ourselves
chimed in Zoie
Oh yes indeed said Aggie confidently and she turned to Jimmy with a matteroffact tone
Youd better tell the Superintendent to have several for us to look at when the time arrives
Yes thats better agreed Zoie
As for Jimmy he had long ceased to make any audible comment but internally he was saying to himself man of strong mettle indeed
Well attend to all the clothes for the child said Aggie generously to Jimmy
I want everything to be handmade exclaimed Zoie enthusiastically
We can make a great many of the things ourselves evenings said Aggie while we sit here and talk to Jimmy
I thought we were going OUT evenings
objected Zoie
Jimmy rolled his eyes toward her like a dumb beast of burden
MOST evenings assented Aggie
And then toward the last you know Zoie she hesitated to explain further for Jimmy was already becoming visibly embarrassed
Oh yes thats true blushed Zoie
There was an awkward pause then Aggie turned again toward Jimmy who was pretending to rebuild the fire
Oh yes one more thing she said
When everything is quite ready for Alfreds return well allow you Jimmy dear to wire him the good news
Thanks so much said Jimmy
I wish it were time to wire now said Zoie pensively and in his mind Jimmy fervently agreed with that sentiment
The next few months will slip by before you know it declared Aggie cheerfully
And by the way Zoie she added why should you go back to your lonesome flat tonight
Zoie began to feel for her pocket handkerchief Jimmy sat up to receive the next blow
Stay here with us suggested Aggie
Well be so glad to have you
She included Jimmy in her glance
Wont we dear
she asked
When the two girls went upstairs arm in arm that night Jimmy remained in his chair by the fire too exhausted to even prepare for bed
A man of mettle
he said again to himself
This had certainly been the longest day of his life
CHAPTER XII WHEN Aggie predicted that the few months of waiting would pass quickly for Zoie she was quite correct
They passed quickly for Aggie as well but how about Jimmy
When he afterward recalled this interval in his life it was always associated with long strands of lace winding around the legs of the library chairs white things lying about in all the places where he had once enjoyed sitting or lying late dinners lonely breakfasts and a sense of isolation from Aggie
One evening when he had waited until he was out of all patience with Aggie he was told by his late and apologetical spouse that she had been helping Zoie to redecorate her bedroom to fit the coming occasion
It is all done in pink and white explained Aggie and then followed detailed accounts of the exquisite bed linens the soft lovely hangings and even the entire relighting of the room
Why pink
asked Jimmy objecting to any scheme of Zoies on general principles
Its Alfreds favourite colour explained Aggie
Besides its so becoming she added
Jimmy could not help feeling that this lure to Alfreds senses was absolutely indecent and he said so
Upon my word answered Aggie quite affronted you are getting as unreasonable as Alfred himself
Then as Jimmy prepared to sulk she added coaxingly I was GOING to tell you about Zoies lovely new negligee and about the dear little crib that just matches it
Everything is going to be in harmony
With Zoie in the house
asked Jimmy sceptically
I cant think why youve taken such a dislike to that helpless child said Aggie
A few days later while in the midst of his mornings mail Jimmy was informed that it was now time for him to conduct Aggie and Zoie to the Babies Home to select the last but most important detail for their coming campaign
According to instructions Jimmy had been in communication with the amused Superintendent of the Home and he now led the two women forth with the proud consciousness that he at least had attended properly to his part of the business
By the time they reached the Childrens Home several babies were on view for their critical inspection
Zoie stared into the various cribs containing the wee red mites with puckered faces
Oh dear
she exclaimed havent you any white ones
These are supposed to be white said the Superintendent with an indulgent smile the black ones are on the other side of the room
Black ones
cried Zoie in horror and she faced about quickly as though expecting an attack from their direction
Which particular one of these would you recommend
asked the practical Aggie of the Superintendent as she surveyed the first lot
Well its largely a matter of taste maam he answered
This seems a healthy little chap he added and seizing the long white clothes of the nearest infant he drew him across his arm and held him out for Aggies inspection
Lets see cried Zoie and she stood on tiptoe to peep over the Superintendents elbow
As for Jimmy he stood gloomily apart
This was an ordeal for which he had long been preparing himself and he was resolved to accept it philosophically
I dont think much of that one snipped Zoie
And in spite of himself
Jimmy felt his temper rising
Aggie turned to him with a smile
Which one do YOU prefer Jimmy
Its not MY affair answered Jimmy curtly
Since when
asked Zoie
Aggie perceived trouble brewing and she turned to pacify Jimmy
Which one do you think your FRIEND ALFRED would like
she persisted
If I were in his place began Jimmy hotly
Oh but you ARENT interrupted Zoie then she turned to the Superintendent
What makes some of them so much larger than others
she asked glancing at the babies he had CALLED white
Well you see theyre of different ages explained the Superintendent indulgently
We told Mr Jinks they must all be of the same age said Zoie with a reproachful look at Jimmy
What age is that
asked the Superintendent
I should say a week old said Aggie
Then this is the one for you decided the Superintendent designating his first choice
I think wed better take the Superintendents advice said Aggie complacently
Zoie looked around the room with a dissatisfied air
Was it possible that all babies were as homely as these
You know Zoie explained Aggie divining her thought they get better looking as they grow older
They couldnt look worse
was Zoies disgusted comment
Fetch it home Jimmy said Aggie
What
exclaimed Jimmy who had considered his mission completed
You dont expect US to carry it do you
asked Aggie in a hurt voice
The Superintendent settled the difficulty temporarily by informing them that the baby could not possibly leave the home until the mother had signed the necessary papers for its release
I thought all those details had been attended to said Aggie and again the two women surveyed Jimmy with grieved disappointment
Ill get the mothers signature the first thing in the morning volunteered the Superintendent
Very well said Zoie and in the meantime Ill send some new clothes for it and with a lofty farewell to the Superintendent she and Aggie followed Jimmy down stairs to the taxi
Now said Zoie when they were properly seated lets stop at a telegraph office and let Jimmy send a wire to Alfred
Wait until we get the baby cautioned Aggie
Well have it the first thing in the morning argued Zoie
Jimmy can send him a nightletter compromised Aggie that way Alfred wont get the news until morning
A few minutes later the taxi stopped in front of Jimmys office and with a sigh of thanksgiving he hurried upstairs to his unanswered mail
CHAPTER XIII When Alfred Hardy found himself on the train bound for Detroit he tried to assure himself that he had done the right thing in breaking away from an association that had kept him for months in a constant state of ferment
His business must come first he decided
Having settled this point to his temporary satisfaction he opened his afternoon paper and leaned back in his seat meaning to divert his mind from personal matters by learning what was going on in the world at large
No sooner had his eye scanned the first headline than he was startled by a boisterous greeting from a fellow traveller who was just passing down the aisle
Hello Hardy
cried his well meaning acquaintance
Where are you bound for
Detroit answered Alfred annoyed by the sudden interruption
Wheres the missus
asked the intruder
Chicago was Alfreds short reply
THATS a funny thing declared the convivial spirit not guessing how funny it really was
You know he continued so loud that everyone in the vicinity could not fail to hear him the last time I met you two you were on your honeymoonon THIS VERY TRAIN and with that the fellow sat himself down uninvited by Alfreds side and started on a long list of compliments about the fine little girl who had in his opinion done Alfred a great favour when she consented to tie herself to a dull moneygrubbing chap like him
So thought Alfred this is the way the world sees us
And he began to frame inaudible but desperate defences of himself
Again he told himself that he was right but his friends thoughtless words had planted an uncomfortable doubt in his mind and when he left the train to drive to his hotel he was thinking very little about the new business relations upon which he was entering in Detroit and very much about the domestic relations which he had just severed in Chicago
Had he been merely a dull moneygrubber
Had he left his wife too much alone
Was she not a mere child when he married her
Could he not with more consideration have made of her a more understanding companion
These were questions that were still unanswered in his mind when he arrived at one of Detroits most enterprising hotels
But later having telephoned to his office and found that several matters of importance were awaiting his decision he forced himself to enter immediately upon his business obligations
As might have been expected Alfred soon won the respect and serious consideration of most of his new business associates and this in a measure so mollified his hurt pride that upon rare occasions he was affable enough to accept the hospitality of their homes
But each excursion that he made into the social life of these new friends only served to remind him of the unsettled state of his domestic affairs
How your wife must miss you
his hostess would remark before they were fairly seated at table
They tell me she is so pretty his visavis would exclaim
When is she going to join you
the lady on his left would ask
Then his host would laugh and tell the dear ladies that in HIS opinion Alfred was afraid to bring his wife to Detroit lest he might lose her to a handsomer man
Alfred could never quite understand why remarks such as this annoyed him almost to the point of declaring the whole truth
His LEAVING Zoie and his losing her as these wouldbe comedians expressed it were two separate and distinct things in his mind and he felt an almost irresistible desire to make this plain to all concerned
But no sooner did he open his lips to do so than a picture of Zoie in all her childlike pleading loveliness arose to dissuade him
He could imagine his dinner companions all pretending to sympathise with him while they flayed poor Zoie alive
She would never have another chance to be known as a respectable woman and compared to most women of his acquaintance she WAS a respectable woman
True according to old fashioned standards she had been indiscreet but apparently the present day woman had a standard of her own
Alfred found his eye wandering round the table surveying the wives of his friends
Was there one of them he wondered who had never fibbed to her husband or eaten a simple luncheon unchaperoned by him
Of one thing he was certain there was not one of them so attractive as Zoie
Might she not be forgiven to some extent if her physical charms had made her a source of dangerous temptation to unprincipled scoundrels like the one with whom she had no doubt lunched
Then too had she not offered at the moment of his departure to tell him the real truth
Might this not have been the one occasion upon which she would have done so
She seemed so sincere he ruminated so truly penitent
Then again how generous it was of her to persist in writing to him with never an answer from him to encourage her
If she cared for him so little as he had once imagined why should she wish to keep up even a presence of fondness
Her letters indicated an undying devotion
These were some of the thoughts that were going through Alfreds mind just three months after his departure from Chicago and all the while his hostess was mentally dubbing him a dull person
What an abstracted man he is
she said before he was down the front steps
Is he really so clever in business
a woman friend inquired
Its hard to believe isnt it
commented a third and his host apologised for the absent Alfred by saying that he was no doubt worried about a particular business decision that had to be made the next morning
But it was not the responsibility of this business decision that was knotting Alfreds brow as he walked hurriedly toward the hotel where he had told his office boy to leave the last mail
This had been the longest interval that Zoie had ever let slip without writing
He recalled that her last letters had hinted at a slight indisposition
In fact she had even mentioned seeing the doctorGood Heavens
he thought Suppose she were really ill
Who would look after her
When Alfred reached his rooms the boy had not yet arrived
He crossed to the library table and took from the drawer all the letters thus far received from Zoie
He read them consecutively
How could he have been so stupid as not to have realised sooner that her illnesswhatever it washad been gradually creeping upon her from the very first day of his departure
The boy arrived with the mail
It contained no letter from Zoie and Alfred went to bed with an uneasy mind
The next morning he was down at his office early still no letter from Zoie
Refusing his partners invitation to lunch Alfred sat alone in his office glad to be rid of intrusive eyes
He would write to Jimmy Jinks he decided and find out whether Zoie were in any immediate danger
Not willing to await the return of his stenographer or to acquaint her with his personal affairs Alfred drew pen and paper toward him and sat helplessly before it
How could he inquire about Zoie without appearing to invite a reconciliation with her
While he was trying to answer this vexed question a sharp knock came at the door
He turned to see a uniformed messenger holding a telegram toward him
Intuitively he felt that it contained some word about Zoie
His hand trembled so that he could scarcely sign for the message before opening it
A moment later the messenger boy was startled out of his lethargy by a succession of contradictory exclamations
No
cried Alfred incredulously as he gazed in ecstasy at the telegram
Yes
he shouted excitedly as he rose from his chair
Wheres a time table
he asked the astonished boy and he began rummaging rapidly through the drawers of his desk
Any answer
inquired the messenger
Take this said Alfred
And he thrust a bill into the small boys hand
Yes sir answered the boy and disappeared quickly lest this madman might reconsider his generosity
Alfred threw down the time table in despair
No train for Chicago until night he cried but his mind was working fast
The next moment he was at the telephone asking for the Division Superintendent of the railway line
When Alfreds partner returned from luncheon he found a curt note informing him that Alfred had left on a special for Chicago and would write
Ill bet its his wife
said the partner
CHAPTER XIV During the evening of the same day that Alfred was enjoying such pleasurable emotions Zoie and Aggie were closeted in the pretty pink and white bedroom that the latter had tried to describe to Jimmy
On a rosecoloured couch in front of the fire sat Aggie threading ribbons through various bits of soft white linen and in front of her at the foot of a rosedraped bed knelt Zoie
She was trying the effect of a large pink bow against the lace flounce of an empty but inviting bassinette
Hows that
she called to Aggie as she turned her head to one side and surveyed the result of her experiment with a critical eye
Aggie shot a grudging glance at the bassinette
I wish you wouldnt bother me every moment she said
Ill never get all these things finished
Apparently Zoie decided that the bow was properly placed for she applied herself to sewing it fast to the lining
In her excitement she gave the thread a vicious pull
Oh dear oh dear my thread is always breaking
she sighed in vexation
Youre excited said Aggie
Wouldnt YOU be excited questioned Zoie if you were expecting a baby and a husband in the morning
I suppose I should admitted Aggie
For a time the two friends sewed in silence then Zoie looked up with sudden anxiety
Youre SURE Jimmy sent the wire
she asked
I saw him write it answered Aggie while I was in the office today
When will Alfred get it
demanded Zoie eagerly
Oh he wont GET it until tomorrow morning said Aggie
I told you that today
Its a night message
I wonder what hell be doing when he gets it
mused Zoie
There was a suspicion of a smile around her lips
What will he do AFTER he gets it
questioned Aggie
Looking up at her friend in alarm Zoie suddenly ceased sewing
You dont mean he wont come
she gasped
Of course I dont answered Aggie
Hes only HUMAN if he is a husband
There was a sceptical expression around Zoies mouth but she did not pursue the subject
How do you suppose that red baby will ever look in this pink basket
she asked
And then with a regretful little sigh she declared that she wished shed used blue
I didnt think the baby that we chose was so horribly red said Aggie
Red
cried Zoie its magenta
And again her thread broke
Oh darn
she exclaimed in annoyance and once more rethreaded her needle
I couldnt look at it she continued with a disgusted little pucker of her face
I wish they had let us take it this afternoon so I could have got used to it before Alfred gets here
Now dont be silly scolded Aggie
You know very well that the Superintendent cant let it leave the home until its mother signs the papers
It will be here the first thing in the morning
Youll have all day to get used to it before Alfred gets here
ALL DAY echoed Zoie and the corners of her mouth began to droop
Wont Alfred be here before TOMORROW NIGHT
Aggie was becoming exasperated by Zoies endless questions
I told you she explained wearily that the wire wont be delivered until tomorrow morning it will take Alfred eight hours to get here and there may not be a train just that minute
Eight long hours sighed Zoie dismally
And Aggie looked at her reproachfully forgetting that it is always the last hour that is hardest to bear
Zoie resumed her sewing resignedly
Aggie was meditating whether she should read her young friend a lecture on the value of patience when the telephone began to ring violently
Zoie looked up from her sewing with a frown
You answer it will you Aggie
she said
I cant let go this thread
Hello called Aggie sweetly over the phone then she added in surprise Is this you Jimmy dear
Apparently it was and as Zoie watched Aggies face with its increasing distress she surmised that Jimmys message was anything but dear
Good heavens
cried Aggie over the telephone thats awful
Isnt Alfred coming
was the first question that burst from Zoies lips
Aggie motioned to Zoie to be quiet
TO NIGHT
she exclaimed
Tonight
echoed Zoie joyfully and without waiting for more details and with no thought beyond the moment she flew to her dressing table and began arranging her hair powdering her face perfuming her lips and making herself particularly alluring for the prodigal husbands return
Now the farsighted Aggie was experiencing less pleasant sensations at the phone
A special
she was saying to Jimmy
When did Alfred GET the message
There was a slight pause
Then she asked irritably Well didnt you mark it NIGHT message
From the expression on Aggies face it was evident that he had not done so
But Jimmy protested Aggie this is dreadful
We havent any baby
Then calling to him to wait a minute and leaving the receiver dangling she crossed the room to Zoie who was now thoroughly engrossed in the making of a fresh toilet
Zoie
she exclaimed excitedly Jimmy made a mistake
Of course hed do THAT answered Zoie carelessly
But you dont understand persisted Aggie
They sent the NIGHT message TODAY
Alfreds coming on a special
Hell be here tonight
Thank goodness for that
cried Zoie and the next instant she was waltzing gaily about the room
Thats all very well answered Aggie as she followed Zoie with anxious eyes but WHERES YOUR BABY
Good heavens
cried Zoie and for the first time she became conscious of their predicament
She gazed at Aggie in consternation
I forgot all about it she said and then asked with growing anxiety What can we DO
Do
echoed Aggie scarcely knowing herself what answer to make weve got to GET it TONIGHT
Thats all
But protested Zoie how CAN we get it when the mother hasnt signed the papers yet
Jimmy will have to arrange that with the Superintendent of the Home answered Aggie with decision and she turned toward the phone to instruct Jimmy accordingly
Yes thats right assented Zoie glad to be rid of all further responsibility well let Jimmy fix it
Say Jimmy called Aggie excitedly youll have to go straight to the Childrens Home and get that baby just as quickly as you can
Theres some red tape about the mother signing papers but dont mind about that
Make them give it to you tonight
Hurry Jimmy
Dont waste a minute
There was evidently a protest from the other end of the wire for Aggie added impatiently Go on Jimmy do
You can EAT any time
And with that she hung up the receiver
Its clothes called Zoie frantically
Tell him about the clothes
I sent them this evening
Never mind about the clothes answered Aggie
Were lucky if we get the baby
But I have to mind persisted Zoie
I gave all its other things to the laundress
I wanted them to be nice and fresh
And now the horrid old creature hasnt brought them back yet
You get into your OWN things commanded Aggie
Wheres my dressing gown
asked Zoie her elation revived by the thought of her fine raiment and with that she flew to the foot of the bed and snatched up two of the prettiest negligees ever imported from Paris
Which do you like better
she asked as she held them both aloft the pink or the blue
It doesnt matter answered Aggie wearily
Get into SOMETHING thats all
Then unhook me commanded Zoie gaily as she turned her back to Aggie and continued to admire the two creations on her arm
So pleased was she with the picture of herself in either of the garments that she began humming a gay waltz and swaying to the rhythm
Stand still commanded Aggie but her warning was unnecessary for at that moment Zoie was transfixed by a horrible fear
Suppose she said in alarm that Jimmy cant GET the baby
Hes GOT to get it answered Aggie emphatically and she undid the last stubborn hook of Zoies gown and put the girl from her
There now youre all unfastened she said hurry and get dressed
You mean undressed laughed Zoie as she let her pretty evening gown fall lightly from her shoulders and drew on her pink negligee
Oh Aggie
she exclaimed as she caught sight of her reflection in the mirror isnt it a love
And you know she added
Alfred just adores pink
Silly
answered Aggie but in spite of herself she was quite thrilled by the picture of the exquisite young creature before her
Zoie had certainly never looked more irresistible
Cant you get some of that colour out of your cheeks asked Aggie in despair
You look like a washerwoman
Ill put on some cold cream and powder answered Zoie
She flew to her dressing table and in a moment there was a white cloud in her immediate vicinity
She turned to Aggie to inquire the result
Again the phone rang
Whos that
she exclaimed in alarm
Ill see answered Aggie
It couldnt be Alfred could it
asked Zoie with mingled hope and dread
Of course not answered Aggie as she removed the receiver from the hook
Alfred wouldnt phone he would come right up
CHAPTER XV Discovering that it was merely Jimmy on the wire Zoies uneasiness abated but Aggies anxiety was visibly increasing
Where ARE you
she asked of her spouse
The Childrens Home
she repeated then followed further explanations from Jimmy which were apparently not satisfactory
Oh Jimmy
cried his disturbed wife it cant be
Thats horrible
What is it
shrieked Zoie trying to get her small ear close enough to the receiver to catch a bit of the obviously terrifying message
Wait a minute called Aggie into the phone
Then she turned to Zoie with a look of despair
The mothers changed her mind she explained she wont give up the baby
Good Lord
cried Zoie and she sank into the nearest chair
For an instant the two women looked at each other with blank faces
What can we DO asked Zoie
Aggie did not answer immediately
This was indeed a serious predicament but presently Zoie saw her friends mouth becoming very resolute and she surmised that Aggie had solved the problem
Well have to get ANOTHER baby thats all decided Aggie
There must be OTHER babies
Where
asked Zoie
There in the Childrens Home answered Aggie with great confidence and she returned to the phone
Zoie crossed to the bed and knelt at its foot in search of her little pink slippers
Oh Aggie she sighed the others were all so red
But Aggie did not heed her protest
Listen Jimmy she called in the phone cant you get another baby
There was a pause then Aggie commanded hotly Well GET in the business
Another pause and then Aggie continued very firmly Tell the Superintendent that we JUST MUST have one
Zoie stopped in the act of putting on her second slipper and called a reminder to Aggie
Tell him to get a HE one she said Alfred wants a boy
Take what you can get
answered Aggie impatiently and again she gave her attention to the phone
What
she cried with growing despair and Zoie waited to hear what had gone wrong now
Nothing under three months explained Aggie
Wont that do
asked Zoie innocently
Do
echoed Aggie in disgust
A three months old baby is as big as a whale
Well cant we say it GREW UP
asked Zoie priding herself on her power of ready resource
Overnight like a mushroom
sneered Aggie
Almost vanquished by her friends new air of cold superiority Zoie was now on the verge of tears
Somebody must have a new baby she faltered
Somebody ALWAYS has a new baby
For their own personal USE yes admitted Aggie but who has a new baby for US
How do I know
asked Zoie helplessly
Youre the one who ought to know
You got me into this and youve GOT to get me out of it
Can you imagine she asked growing more and more unhappy what would happen to me if Alfred were to come home now and not find a baby
He wouldnt forgive a LITTLE lie what would he do with a WHOPPER like this
Then with sudden decision she rushed toward the phone
Let me talk to Jimmy she said and the next moment she was chattering so rapidly and incoherently over the phone that Aggie despaired of hearing one word that she said and retired to the next room to think out a new plan of action
Say Jimmy stammered Zoie into the phone youve GOT to get me a baby
If you dont Ill kill myself
I will Jimmy I will
You got me into this Jimmy she reminded him
Youve GOT to get me out of it
And then followed pleadings and coaxings and cajolings and at length a pause during which Jimmy was apparently able to get in a word or so
His answer was not satisfactory to Zoie
What
she shrieked tiptoeing to get her lips closer to the receiver then she added with conviction the mother has no business to change her mind
Apparently Jimmy maintained that the mother had changed it none the less
Well take it away from her commanded Zoie
Get it quick while she isnt looking
Then casting a furtive glance over her shoulder to make sure that Aggie was still out of the room she indulged in a few dark threats to Jimmy also some vehement reminders of how he had DRAGGED her into that horrid old restaurant and been the immediate cause of all the misfortunes that had ever befallen her
Could Jimmy have been sure that Aggie was out of earshot of Zoies conversation the argument would doubtless have kept up indefinitely as it wasthe result was a quick acquiescence on his part and by the time that Aggie returned to the room Zoie was wreathed in smiles
Its all right she said sweetly
Jimmys going to get it
Aggie looked at her sceptically
Goodness knows I hope so she said then added in despair Look at your cheeks
Theyre flaming
Once more the powder puff was called into requisition and Zoie turned a temporarily blanched face to Aggie
Is that better
she asked
Very much answered Aggie but how about your hair
Whats the matter with it
asked Zoie
Her reflection betrayed a coiffure that might have turned Marie Antoinette green with envy
Would anybody think youd been in bed for days
asked Aggie
Alfred likes it that way was Zoies defence
Turn around said Aggie without deigning to argue the matter further
And she began to remove handfuls of hairpins from the yellow knotted curls
What are you doing
exclaimed Zoie as she sprayed her white neck and arms with her favourite perfume
Aggie did not answer
Zoie leaned forward toward the mirror to smooth out her eyebrows with the tips of her perfumed fingers
Good gracious she cried in horror as she caught sight of her reflection
Youre not going to put my hair in a pigtail
Thats the way invalids always have their hair was Aggies laconic reply and she continued to plait the obstinate curls
I wont have it like that
declared Zoie and she shook herself free from Aggies unwelcome attentions and proceeded to unplait the hateful pigtail
Alfred would leave me
Aggie shrugged her shoulders
If youre going to make a perfect fright of me pouted Zoie I just wont see him
He isnt coming to see YOU reminded Aggie
Hes coming to see the baby
If Jimmy doesnt come soon Ill not HAVE any baby answered Zoie
Get into bed said Aggie and she proceeded to turn down the soft lace coverlets
Where did I put my cap
asked Zoie
Her eyes caught the small knot of lace and ribbons for which she was looking and she pinned it on top of her saucy little curls
In you go said Aggie motioning to the bed
Wait said Zoie impressively wait till I get my rose lights on the pillow
She pulled the slender gold chain of her night lamp instantly the large white pillows were bathed in a warm pink glowshe studied the effect very carefully then added a lingerie pillow to the two more formal ones kicked off her slippers and hopped into bed
One more glance at the pillows then she arranged the ribbons of her negligee to fall carelessly outside the coverlet threw one arm gracefully above her head halfclosed her eyes and sank languidly back against her pillows
Hows that
she breathed faintly
Controlling her impulse to smile Aggie crossed to the dressingtable with a businesslike air and applied to Zoies pink cheeks a third coating of powder
Zoie sat bolt upright and began to sneeze
Aggie she said I just hate you when you act like that
But suddenly she was seized with a new idea
I wonder she mused as she looked across the room at the soft pink sofa bathed in firelight I wonder if I shouldnt look better on that couch under those roses
Aggie was very emphatic in her opinion to the contrary
Certainly not
she said
Then decided Zoie with a mischievous smile Ill get Alfred to carry me to the couch
That way I can get my arms around his neck
And once you get your arms around a mans neck you can MANAGE him
Aggie looked down at the small person with distinct disapproval
Now dont you make too much fuss over Alfred she continued
YOURE the one whos to do the forgiving
Dont forget that
Whats more she reminded Zoie youre very very weak
But before she had time to instruct Zoie further there was a sharp quick ring at the outer door
The two women glanced at each other inquiringly
The next instant a mans step was heard in the hallway
How is she Mary
demanded someone in a voice tense with anxiety
Its Alfred
exclaimed Zoie
And we havent any baby
gasped Aggie
What shall I do
cried Zoie
Lie down commanded Aggie and Zoie had barely time to fall back limply on the pillows when the excited young husband burst into the room
CHAPTER XVI When Alfred entered Zoies bedroom he glanced about him in bewilderment
It appeared that he was in an enchanted chamber
Through the dim rose light he could barely perceive his young wife
She was lying white and apparently lifeless on her pillows
He moved cautiously toward the bed but Aggie raised a warning finger
Afraid to speak he grasped Aggies hand and searched her face for reassurance she nodded toward Zoie whose eyes were closed
He tiptoed to the bedside sank on his knees and reverently kissed the small hand that hung limply across the side of the bed
To Alfreds intense surprise his lips had barely touched Zoies fingertips when he felt his head seized in a frantic embrace
Alfred Alfred
cried Zoie in delight then she smothered his face with kisses
As she lifted her head to survey her astonished husband she caught the reproving eye of Aggie
With a weak little sigh she relaxed her tenacious hold of Alfred breathed his name very faintly and sank back apparently exhausted upon her pillows
Its been too much for her said the terrified young husband and he glanced toward Aggie in anxiety
Aggie nodded assent
How pale she looks added Alfred as he surveyed the white face on the pillows
Shes so weak poor dear sympathised Aggie almost in a whisper
Alfred nodded his understanding to Aggie
It was then that his attention was for the first time attracted toward the crib
My boy
he exclaimed
And again Zoie forgot Aggies warning and sat straight up in bed
But Alfred did not see her
He was making determinedly for the crib his heart beating high with the pride of possession
Throwing back the coverlets of the bassinette Alfred stared at the empty bed in silence then he quickly turned to the two anxious women
Where is he
he asked his eyes wide with terror
Zoies lips opened to answer but no words came
Alfreds eyes turned to Aggie
The look on her face increased his worst fears
Dont tell me hes he could not bring himself to utter the word
He continued to look helplessly from one woman to the other
In vain Zoie again tried to answer
Aggie also made an unsuccessful attempt to speak
Then driven to desperation by the strain of the situation Zoie declared boldly Hes out
Out
echoed Alfred in consternation
With Jimmy explained Aggie coming to Zoies rescue as well as she knew how
Jimmy
repeated Alfred in great astonishment
Just for a breath of air explained Zoie sweetly She had now entirely regained her self possession
Isnt he very young to be out at night
asked Alfred with a puzzled frown
We told Jimmy that answered Aggie amazed at the promptness with which each succeeding lie presented itself
But you see she continued Jimmy is so crazy about the child that we cant do anything with him
Jimmy crazy about my baby
exclaimed Alfred incredulously
He always said babies were little red worms
 Not this one answered Zoie sweetly
No indeed chimed in Aggie
He acts as though he owned it
Oh DOES he
exclaimed Alfred hotly
Ill soon put a stop to that he declared
Where did he take him
Again the two women looked at each other inquiringly then Aggie stammered evasively
Oh jjust downstairssomewhere
Ill LOOK jjust downstairs somewhere decided Alfred and he snatched up his hat and started toward the door
Alfred
cried Zoie in alarm
Coming back to her bedside to reassure her Alfred was caught in a frantic embrace
Ill be back in a minute dear he said but Zoie clung to him and pleaded desperately
You arent going to leave me the very first thing
Alfred hesitated
He had no wish to be cruel to Zoie but the thought of Jimmy out in the street with his baby at this hour of the night was not to be borne
Zoie renewed her efforts at persuasion
Now dearie she said I wish youd go get shaved and wash up a bit
I dont wish baby to see you looking so horrid
Yes do Alfred insisted Aggie
Hes sure to be here in a minute
My boy wont care HOW his father looks declared Alfred proudly and Zoie told Aggie afterward that his chest had momentarily expanded three inches
But I care persisted Zoie
First impressions are so important
Now Zoie cautioned Aggie as she crossed toward the bed with affected solicitude
You mustnt excite yourself
Zoie was quick to understand the suggested change in her tactics and again she sank back on her pillows apparently ill and faint
Utterly vanquished by the dire result of his apparently inhuman thoughtlessness Alfred glanced at Aggie uncertain as to how to repair the injury
Aggie beckoned to him to come away from the bed
Let her have her own way she whispered with a significant glance toward Zoie
Alfred nodded understandingly and put a finger to his lips to signify that he would henceforth speak in hushed tones then he tiptoed back to the bed and gently stroked the curls from Zoies troubled forehead
There now dear he whispered lie still and rest and Ill go shave and wash up a bit
Zoie sighed her acquiescence
Mind he whispered to Aggie you are to call me the moment my boy comes and then he slipped quietly into the bedroom
No sooner had Alfred crossed the threshold than Zoie sat up in bed and called in a sharp whisper to Aggie Whats keeping them
she asked
I cant imagine answered Aggie also in whisper
If I had Jimmy here declared Zoie vindictively Id wring his little fat neck and slipping her little pink toes from beneath the covers she was about to get out of bed when Aggie who was facing Alfreds bedroom door gave her a warning signal
Zoie had barely time to get back beneath the covers when Alfred reentered the room in search of his satchel
Aggie found it for him quickly
Alfred glanced solicitously at Zoies closed eyes
Im so sorry he apologised to Aggie and again he slipped softly out of the room
Aggie and Zoie drew together for consultation
Suppose Jimmy cant get the baby whispered Zoie
In that case hed have phoned argued Aggie
Lets phone to the Home suggested Zoie and find She was interrupted by Alfreds voice
Say Aggie called Alfred from the next room
Yes
answered Aggie sweetly and she crossed to the door and waited
Hasnt he come yet
called Alfred impatiently
Not yet Alfred said Aggie and she closed the door very softly lest Alfred should hear her
I never knew Alfred could be so silly
snapped Zoie
Sh
sh
warned Aggie and she glanced anxiously toward Alfreds door
He doesnt care a bit about me
complained Zoie
Its all that horrid old baby that hes never seen If Jimmy doesnt come soon he never WILL see it declared Aggie and she started toward the window to look out
Just then there was a short quick ring of the bell
The two women glanced at each other with mingled hope and fear
Then their eyes sought the door expectantly
CHAPTER XVII With the collar of his long ulster pushed high and the brim of his derby hat pulled low Jimmy Jinks crept cautiously into the room
When he at length ceased to glance over his shoulder and came to a full stop Aggie perceived a bit of white flannel hanging beneath the hem of his tightly buttoned coat
Youve GOT it
she cried
Where is it 
asked Zoie
Give it to me demanded Aggie
Jimmy stared at them as though stupefied then glanced uneasily over his shoulder to make sure that no one was pursuing him
Aggie unbuttoned his ulster seized a wee mite wrapped in a large shawl and clasped it to her bosom with a sigh of relief
Thank heaven
she exclaimed then crossed quickly to the bassinette and deposited her charge
In the meantime having thrown discretion to the wind Zoie had hopped out of bed
As usual her greeting to Jimmy was in the nature of a reproach
What kept you
she demanded crossly
Yes chimed in Aggie who was now bending over the crib
What made you so long
See here
answered Jimmy hotly if you two think you can do any better youre welcome to the job and with that he threw off his overcoat and sank sullenly on the couch
Sh
sh
exclaimed Zoie and Aggie simultaneously and they glanced nervously toward Alfreds bedroom door
Jimmy looked at them without comprehending why he should sh
They did not bother to explain
Instead Zoie turned her back upon him
Lets see it she said peeping into the bassinette
And then with a little cry of disgust she again looked at Jimmy reproachfully
Isnt it ugly
she said
Jimmys contempt for womans ingratitude was too deep for words and he only stared at her in injured silence
But his reflections were quickly upset when Alfred called from the next room to inquire again about Baby
Alfreds here
whispered Jimmy beginning to realise the meaning of the womens mysterious behaviour
Sh
sh
said Aggie again to Jimmy and Zoie flew toward the bed almost vaulting over the footboard in her hurry to get beneath the covers
For the present Alfred did not disturb them further
Apparently he was still occupied with his shaving but just as Jimmy was about to ask for particulars the phone rang
The three culprits glanced guiltily at each other
Whos that
whispered Zoie in a frightened voice
Aggie crossed to the phone
Hello she called softly
The Childrens Home
she exclaimed
Jimmy paused in the act of sitting and turned his round eyes toward the phone
Aggies facial expression was not reassuring
But we cant she was saying thats impossible
What is it
called Zoie across the foot of the bed unable longer to endure the suspense
Aggie did not answer
She was growing more and more excited
A thief
she cried wildly over the phone
How dare you call my husband a thief
Jimmy was following the conversation with growing interest
Wait a minute said Aggie then she left the receiver hanging by the cord and turned to the expectant pair behind her
Its the Childrens Home she explained
That awful woman says Jimmy STOLE her baby
What
exclaimed Zoie as though such depravity on Jimmys part were unthinkable
Then she looked at him accusingly and asked in low measured tones DID you STEAL HER BABY JIMMY
Didnt you tell me to
asked Jimmy hotly
Not literally corrected Aggie
How else COULD I steal a baby
demanded Jimmy
Zoie looked at the unfortunate creature as if she could strangle him and Aggie addressed him with a threat in her voice
Well the Superintendent says youve got to bring it straight back
Id like to see myself
said Jimmy
He shant bring it back declared Zoie
Ill not let him
What shall I tell the Superintendent
asked Aggie hes holding the wire
Tell him he cant have it answered Zoie as though that were the end of the whole matter
Well concluded Aggie he says if Jimmy DOESNT bring it back the mothers coming after it
Good Lord
exclaimed Zoie
As for Jimmy he bolted for the door
Aggie caught him by the sleeve as he passed
Wait Jimmy she said peremptorily
There was a moment of awful indecision then something approaching an idea came to Zoie
Tell the Superintendent that it isnt here she whispered to Aggie across the footboard
Tell him that Jimmy hasnt got here yet
Yes agreed Jimmy tell him I havent got here yet
Aggie nodded wisely and returned to the phone
Hello she called pleasantly then proceeded to explain
Mr Jinks hasnt got here yet
There was a pause then she added in her most conciliatory tone Ill tell him what you say when he comes in
Another pause and she hung up the receiver with a most gracious good bye and turned to the others with increasing misgivings
He says he wont be responsible for that mother much longershes halfcrazy
What right has she to be crazy
demanded Zoie in an abused voice
Shes a widow
She doesnt need a baby
Well decided Aggie after careful deliberation youd better take it back Jimmy before Alfred sees it
What
exclaimed Zoie in protest
And again Jimmy bolted but again he failed to reach the door
CHAPTER XVIII His face covered with lather and a shaving brush in one hand Alfred entered the room just as his friend was about to escape
Jimmy
exclaimed the excited young father youre back
Oh yesyes admitted Jimmy nervously Im back
My boy
cried Alfred and he glanced toward the crib
Hes here
Yesyes agreed Aggie uneasily as she tried to place herself between Alfred and the bassinette
Hes here but you maynt have him Alfred
What
exclaimed Alfred trying to put her out of the way
Not yet protested Aggie not just yet
Give him to me demanded Alfred and thrusting Aggie aside he took possession of the small mite in the cradle
Butbut Alfred pleaded Aggie your face
Youll get him all wet
Alfred did not heed her
He was bending over the cradle in an ecstasy
My boy
he cried my boy
Lifting the baby in his arms he circled the room cooing to him delightedly
Was he away from home when his fadder came
Oh me oh my
Coochy
Coochy
Coochy
Suddenly he remembered to whom he owed this wondrous treasure and forgetful of the lather on his unshaven face he rushed toward Zoie with an overflowing heart
My precious
he exclaimed and he covered her cheek with kisses
Go away
cried Zoie in disgust and she pushed Alfred from her and brushed the hateful lather from her little pink check
But Alfred was not to be robbed of his exaltation and again he circled the room making strange gurgling sounds to Baby
Did a horrid old Jimmy take him away from fadder
he said sympathetically in the small persons ear and he glanced at Jimmy with frowning disapproval
Id just like to see him get you away from me again
he added to Baby as he tickled the mites ear with the end of his shaving brush
Oh me
oh my
he exclaimed in trepidation as he perceived a bit of lather on the infants cheek
Then lifting the boy high in his arms and throwing out his chest with great pride he looked at Jimmy with an air of superiority
I guess Im bad aye
he said
Jimmy positively blushed
As for Zoie she was growing more and more impatient for a little attention to herself
Rockabye Baby sang Alfred in strident tones and he swung the child high in his arms
Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Alfred as though hypnotised
They kept time to his lullaby out of sheer nervousness
Suddenly Alfred stopped held the child from him and gazed at it in horror
Good heavens
he exclaimed
The others waited breathlessly
Look at that babys face commanded Alfred
Zoie and Aggie exchanged alarmed glances then Zoie asked in trepidation Whats the matter with his face
Hes got a fever declared Alfred
And he started toward the bed to show the child to its mother
Go away
shrieked Zoie waving Alfred off in wild alarm
What
asked Alfred backing from her in surprise
Aggie crossed quickly to Alfreds side and looked over his shoulder at the boy
I dont see anything wrong with its face she said
Its scarlet
persisted Alfred
Oh said Jimmy with a superior air theyre always like that
Nothing of the sort snorted Alfred and he glared at Jimmy threateningly
Youve frozen the child parading him around the streets
Let me have him Alfred begged Aggie sweetly Ill put him in his crib and keep him warm
Reluctantly Alfred released the boy
His eyes followed him to the crib with anxiety
Wheres his nurse
he asked as he glanced first from one to the other
Zoie and Jimmy stared about the room as though expecting the desired person to drop from the ceiling
Then Zoie turned upon her unwary accomplice
Jimmy she called in a threatening tone where IS his nurse
Does Jimmy take the nurse out too
demanded Alfred more and more annoyed by the privileges Jimmy had apparently been usurping in his absence
Never mind about the nurse interposed Aggie
Baby likes me better anyway
Ill tuck him in and she bent fondly over the crib but Alfred was not to be so easily pacified
Do you mean to tell me he exclaimed excitedly that my boy hasnt any nurse
We HAD a nurse corrected Zoie butbut I had to discharge her
Alfred glanced from one to the other for an explanation
Discharge her
he repeated for what
She was crazy stammered Zoie
Alfreds eyes sought Aggies for confirmation
She nodded
He directed his steady gaze toward Jimmy
The latter jerked his head up and down in nervous assent
Well said Alfred amazed at their apparent lack of resource why didnt you get ANOTHER nurse
Aggie is going to stay and take care of baby tonight declared Zoie and then she beamed upon Aggie as only she knew how
Arent you dear
she asked sweetly
Yes indeed answered Aggie studiously avoiding Jimmys eye
Baby is going to sleep in the spare room with Aggie and Jimmy said Zoie
What
exclaimed Jimmy too desperate to care what Alfred might infer
Ignoring Jimmys implied protest Zoie continued sweetly to Alfred Now dont worry dear go back to your room and finish your shaving
Finish shaving
repeated Alfred in a puzzled way
Then his hand went mechanically to his cheek and he stared at Zoie in astonishment
By Jove
he exclaimed I had forgotten all about it
That shows you how excited I am
And with a reluctant glance toward the cradle he went quickly from the room singing a high pitched lullaby
Just as the three conspirators were drawing together for consultation Alfred returned to the room
It was apparent that there was something important on his mind
By the way he said glancing from one to another I forgot to askwhats his name
The conspirators looked at each other without answering
To Alfred their delay was annoying
Of course his son had been given his fathers name but he wished to HEAR someone say so
Babys I mean he explained impatiently
Jimmy felt instinctively that Zoies eyes were upon him
He avoided her gaze
Jimmy
called Zoie meaning only to appeal to him for a name
Jimmy
thundered the infuriated Alfred
Youve called my boy Jimmy
Why Jimmy
For once Zoie was without an answer
After waiting in vain for any response Alfred advanced upon the uncomfortable Jimmy
You seem to be very popular around here he sneered
Jimmy shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and studied the pattern of the rug upon which he was standing
After what seemed an age to Jimmy Alfred turned his back upon his old friend and started toward his bedroom
Jimmy peeped out uneasily from his long eyelashes
When Alfred reached the threshold he faced about quickly and stared again at Jimmy for an explanation
It seemed to Jimmy that Alfreds nostrils were dilating
He would not have been surprised to see Alfred snort fire
He let his eyes fall before the awful spectacle of his friends wrath
Alfreds upper lip began to curl
He cast a last withering look in Jimmys direction retired quickly from the scene and banged the door
When Jimmy again had the courage to lift his eyes he was confronted by the contemptuous gaze of Zoie who was sitting up in bed and regarding him with undisguised disapproval
Why didnt you tell him what the babys name is
she demanded
How do I know what the babys name is
retorted Jimmy savagely
Sh
sh
cautioned Aggie as she glanced nervously toward the door through which Alfred had just passed
What does it matter WHAT the babys name is so long as we have to send it back
Ill NOT send it back declared Zoie emphatically at least not until morning
That will give Jimmy a whole night to get another one
Another
shrieked Jimmy
See here you two cant be changing babies every five minutes without Alfred knowing it
Even HE has SOME sense
Nonsense
answered Aggie shortly
You know perfectly well that all young babies look just alike
Their own mothers couldnt tell them apart if it werent for their clothes
But where can we GET another
asked Zoie
Before Aggie could answer Alfred was again heard calling from the next room
Apparently all his anger had subsided for he inquired in the most amiable tone as to what baby might be doing and how he might be feeling
Aggie crossed quickly to the door and sweetly reassured the anxious father then she closed the door softly and turned to Zoie and Jimmy with a new inspiration lighting her face
I have it she exclaimed ecstatically
Jimmy regarded his spouse with grave suspicion
Now see here he objected every time YOU HAVE IT I DO IT
The NEXT time you HAVE IT YOU DO IT
The emphasis with which Jimmy made his declaration deserved consideration but to his amazement it was entirely ignored by both women
Hopping quickly out of bed without even glancing in his direction Zoie gave her entire attention to Aggie
What is it
she asked eagerly
There must be OTHER babies Homes said Aggie and she glanced at Jimmy from her superior height
They arent open all night like corner drug stores growled Jimmy
Well they ought to be decided Zoie
And surely argued Aggie in an extraordinary caselike This was an extraordinary case  declared Jimmy and you saw what happened this time and the Superintendent is a friend of mineat least he WAS a friend of mine
And with that Jimmy sat himself down on the far corner of the couch and proceeded to ruminate on the havoc that these two women had wrought in his once tranquil life
Zoie gazed at Jimmy in deep disgust her friend Aggie had made an excellent suggestion and instead of acting upon it with alacrity here sat Jimmy sulking like a stubborn child
I suppose said Zoie as her eyebrows assumed a bored angle there are SOME babies in the world outside of Childrens Homes
Of course was Aggies enthusiastic rejoinder theres one born every minute
But I was born BETWEEN minutes protested Jimmy
Whos talking about you
snapped Zoie
Again Aggie exclaimed that she had it
Shes got it twice as bad groaned Jimmy and he wondered what new form her persecution of him was about to take
Where is the morning paper
asked Aggie excitedly
We cant advertise NOW protested Zoie
Its too late for that
Sh
Sh
answered Aggie as she snatched the paper quickly from the table and began running her eyes up and down its third page
Married married she murmured and then with delight she found the half column for which she was searching
Born she exclaimed triumphantly
Here we are
Get a pencil Zoie and well take down all the new ones
Of course agreed Zoie clapping her hands in glee and Jimmy can get a taxi and look them right up
Oh CAN he
shouted Jimmy as he rose with clenched fists
Now you two see here Before Jimmy could complete his threat there was a sharp ring of the door bell
He looked at the two women inquiringly
Its the mother cried Zoie in a hoarse whisper
The mother
repeated Jimmy in terror and he glanced uncertainly from one door to the other
Cover up the baby
called Zoie and drawing Jimmys overcoat quickly from his arm Aggie threw it hurriedly over the cradle
For an instant Jimmy remained motionless in the centre of the room hatless coatless and shorn of ideas
A loud knock on the door decided him and he sank with trembling knees behind the nearest armchair just as Zoie made a flying leap into the bed and prepared to draw the cover over her head
The knock was repeated and Aggie signalled to Zoie to answer it
Come in
called Zoie very faintly
CHAPTER XIX From his hidingplace Jimmy peeped around the edge of the armchair and saw what seemed to be a large clothes basket entering the room
Closer inspection revealed the small figure of Maggie the washerwomans daughter propelling the basket which was piled high with freshly laundered clothing
Jimmy drew a long sigh of relief and unknotted his cramped limbs
Shall I lay the things on the sofa mum
asked Maggie as she placed her basket on the floor and waited for Zoies instructions
Yes please answered Zoie too exhausted for further comment
Taking the laundry piece by piece from the basket Maggie made excuses for its delay while she placed it on the couch
Deaf to Maggies chatter Zoie lay back languidly on her pillows but she soon heard something that lifted her straight up in bed
Me mother is sorry she had to kape you waitin this week said Maggie over her shoulder but weve got twins at OUR house
Twins
echoed Zoie and Aggie simultaneously
Then together they stared at Maggie as though she had been dropped from another world
Finding attention temporarily diverted from himself Jimmy had begun to rearrange both his mind and his cravat when he felt rather than saw that his two persecutors were regarding him with a steady determined gaze
In spite of himself Jimmy raised his eyes to theirs
Twins
was their laconic answer
Now Jimmy had heard Maggies announcement about the bountiful supply of offspring lately arrived at her house but not until he caught the fanatical gleam in the eyes of his companions did he understand the part they meant him to play in their next adventure
He waited for no explanationhe bolted toward the door
Wait Jimmy commanded Aggie
But it was not until she had laid firm hold of him that he waited
Surprised by such strange behaviour on the part of those whom she considered her superiors Maggie looked first at Aggie then at Jimmy then at Zoie uncertain whether to go or to stay
Anythin to go back mum
she stammered
Zoie stared at Maggie solemnly from across the foot of the bed
Maggie she asked in a deep sepulchral tone where do you live
Just around the corner on High Street mum gasped Maggie
Then keeping her eyes fixed uneasily on Zoie she picked up her basket and backed cautiously toward the door
Wait
commanded Zoie and Maggie paused one foot in midair
Wait in the hall said Zoie
Yesum assented Maggie almost in a whisper
Then she nodded her head jerkily cast another furtive glance at the three persons who were regarding her so strangely and slipped quickly through the door
Having crossed the room and stealthily closed the door Aggie returned to Jimmy who was watching her with the furtive expression of a trapped animal
Its Providence she declared with a grave countenance
Jimmy looked up at Aggie with affected innocence then rolled his round eyes away from her
He was confronted by Zoie who had approached from the opposite side of the room
Its Fate declared Zoie in awestruck tones
Jimmy was beginning to wriggle but he kept up a last desperate presence of not understanding them
You neednt tell me Im going to take the wash to the old lady he said for Im not going to do it
It isnt the WASH said Aggie and her tone warned him that she expected no nonsense from him
You know what we are thinking about just as well as we do said Zoie
Ill write that washerwoman a note and tell her we must have one of those babies right now
And with that she turned toward her desk and began rummaging amongst her papers for a pencil and pad
The luck of these poor she murmured
The luck of US corrected Aggie whose spirits were now soaring
Then she turned to Jimmy with growing enthusiasm
Just think of it dear she said Fate has sent us a baby to our very door
Well declared Jimmy again beginning to show signs of fight if Fate has sent a baby to the door you dont need me and with that he snatched his coat from the crib
Wait Jimmy again commanded Aggie and she took his coat gently but firmly from him
Now see here argued Jimmy trying to get free from his strongminded spouse you know perfectly well that that washerwoman isnt going to let us have that baby
Nonsense called Zoie over her shoulder while she scribbled a hurried note to the washerwoman
If she wont let us have it for keeps Ill just rent it
 Good Lord
exclaimed Jimmy in genuine horror
Warm fresh palpitating babies rented as you would rent a gas stove
Thats all a pose declared Aggie in a matteroffact tone
You think babies little red worms youve said so
Jimmy could not deny it
Shell be only too glad to rent it declared Zoie as she glanced hurriedly through the note just written and slipped it together with a bill into an envelope
Ill pay her anything
Its only until I can get another one
Another
shouted Jimmy and his eyes turned heavenward for help
An endless chain with me to put the links together
Dont be so theatrical said Aggie irritably as she took up Jimmys coat and prepared to get him into it
Why DO you make such a fuss about NOTHING sighed Zoie
Nothing
echoed Jimmy and he looked at her with wondering eyes
I crawl about like a thief in the night snatching babies from their mothers breasts and you call THAT nothing
You dont have to CRAWL  reminded Zoie you can take a taxi
Heres your coat dear said Aggie graciously as she endeavoured to slip Jimmys limp arms into the sleeves of the garment
You can take Maggie with you said Zoie with the air of conferring a distinct favour upon him
And the wash on my lap added Jimmy sarcastically
No said Zoie unruffled by Jimmys ungracious behaviour
Well send the wash later
Thats very kind of you sneered Jimmy as he unconsciously allowed his arms to slip into the sleeves of the coat Aggie was urging upon him
All you need to do said Aggie complacently is to get us the baby
Yes said Jimmy and what do you suppose my friends would say if they were to see me riding around town with the washladys daughter and a baby on my lap
What would YOU say
he asked Aggie if you didnt know the facts
Nobodys going to see you answered Aggie impatiently its only around the corner
Go on Jimmy be a good boy
You mean a good thing retorted Jimmy without budging from the spot
How ridiculous
exclaimed Zoie its as easy as can be
Yes the FIRST one SOUNDED easy too said Jimmy
All you have to do explained Zoie trying to restrain her rising intolerance of his stupidity is to give this note to Maggies mother
Shell give you her baby you bring it back here well give you THIS one and you can take it right back to the Home
And meet the other mother concluded Jimmy with a shake of his head
There was a distinct threat in Zoies voice when she again addressed the stubborn Jimmy and the glitter of triumph was in her eyes
Youd better meet here THERE than HERE she warned him you know what the Superintendent said
Thats true agreed Aggie with an anxious face
Come now she pleaded it will only take a minute you can do the whole thing before you have had time to think
Before I have had time to think repeated Jimmy excitedly
Thats how you get me to do everything
Well this time Ive HAD time to think and I dont think I will
and with that he threw himself upon the couch unmindful of the damage to the freshly laundered clothes
Get up cried Zoie
You havent time to sit down said Aggie
Ill TAKE time declared Jimmy
His eyes blinked ominously and he remained glued to the couch
There was a short silence the two women gazed at Jimmy in despair
Remembering a fresh grievance Jimmy turned upon them
By the way he said do you two know that I havent had anything to eat yet
And do you know said Zoie that Alfred may be back at any minute
He cant stay away forever
Not unless he has cut his throat rejoined Jimmy and thats what Id do if I had a razor
Zoie regarded Jimmy as though he were beyond redemption
Cant you ever think of anybody but yourself
she asked with a martyred air
Had Jimmy been half his age Aggie would have felt sure that she saw him make a face at her friend for answer
As it was she resolved to make one last effort to awaken her unobliging spouse to a belated sense of duty
You see dear she said you might better get the washerwomans baby than to go from house to house for one and she glanced again toward the paper
Yes urged Zoie and thats just what youll HAVE to do if you dont get this one
Jimmys head hung dejectedly
It was apparent that his courage was slipping from him
Aggie was quick to realise her opportunity and before Jimmy could protect himself from her treacherous wiles she had slipped one arm coyly about his neck
Now Jimmy she pleaded as she pressed her soft cheek to his throbbing temple and toyed with the bay curl on his perspiring forehead wont you do this little teenyweepy thing just for me
Jimmys lips puckered in a pout he began to blink nervously
Aggie slipped her other arm about his neck
You know she continued with a baby whine I got Zoie into this and Ive just got to get her out of it
Youre not going to desert me are you Jimmy
You WILL help me wont you dear
Her breath was on Jimmys cheek he could feel her lips stealing closer to his
He had not been treated to much affection of late
His head drooped lowerhe began to twiddle the fob on his watch chain
Wont you
persisted Aggie
Jimmy studied the toes of his boots
Wont you
she repeated and her soft eyelashes just brushed the tip of his retrousee nose
Jimmys head was now wagging from side to side
Wont you
she entreated a fourth time and she kissed him full on the lips
With a resigned sigh Jimmy rose mechanically from the heap of crushed laundry and held out his fat chubby hand
Give me the letter he groaned
Here you are said Zoie taking Jimmys acquiescence as a matter of course and she thrust the letter into the pocket of Jimmys ulster
Now when you get back with the baby she continued dont come in all of a sudden just wait outside and whistle
You CAN WHISTLE cant you
she asked with a doubtful air
For answer Jimmy placed two fingers between his lips and produced a shrill whistle that made both Zoie and Aggie glance nervously toward Alfreds bedroom door
Yes you can WHISTLE admitted Zoie then she continued her directions
If Alfred is not in the room Ill raise the shade and you can come right up
And if he is in the room
asked Jimmy with a fine shade of sarcasm
If he IS in the room explained Zoie you must wait outside until I can get rid of him
Jimmy turned his eyes toward Aggie to ask if it were possible that she still approved of Zoies inhuman plan
For answer Aggie stroked his coat collar fondly
Well give you the signal the moment the coast is clear she said then she hurriedly buttoned Jimmys large ulster and wound a muffler about his neck
There now dear do go youre all buttoned up and with that she urged him toward the door
Just a minute protested Jimmy as he paused on the threshold
Let me get this right if the shade is up I stay down
Not at all corrected Aggie and Zoie in a breath
If the shade is up you come up
Jimmy cast another martyred look in Zoies direction
You wont hurry will you
he said you know it is only twentythree below zero and I havent had anything to eat yetand Yes we know interrupted the two women in chorus and then Aggie added wearily go on Jimmy dont be funny
Funny
snorted Jimmy
With a baby on my lap and the wash ladys daughter I wont be funny oh no
It is doubtful whether Jimmy would not have worked himself into another state of open rebellion had not Aggie put an end to his protests by thrusting him firmly out of the room and closing the door behind him
After this act of heroic decision on her part the two women listened intently fearing that he might return but presently they heard the bang of the outer door and at last they drew a long breath of relief
For the first time since Alfreds arrival Aggie was preparing to sink into a chair when she was startled by a sharp exclamation from Zoie
Good heavens cried Zoie I forgot to ask Maggie
Ask her what
questioned Aggie
Boys or girls said Zoie with a solemn look toward the door through which Jimmy had just disappeared
Well decided Aggie after a moments reflection its too late now
Anyway she concluded philosophically we couldnt CHANGE it
CHAPTER XX With more or less damage to himself consequent on his excitement Alfred completed his shaving and hastened to return to his wife and the babe
Finding the supposedly ill Zoie careering about the centre of the room expostulating with Aggie the young man stopped dumbfounded on the threshold
Zoie he cried in astonishment
What are you doing out of bed
For an instant the startled Zoie gazed at him stupefied
Why II Her eyes sought Aggies for a suggestion there was no answer there
It was not until her gaze fell upon the cradle that she was seized by the desired inspiration
I just got up to see baby she faltered then putting one hand giddily to her head she pretended to sway
In an instant Alfreds arms were about her
He bore her quickly to the bed
You stay here my darling he said tenderly
Ill bring baby to you and after a solicitous caress he turned toward babys crib and bent fondly over the little one
Ah theres fathers man he said
Was he lonesome baby
Oh goodis gacious then followed an incoherent muttering of baby talk as he bore the youngster toward Zoies bed
Come my precious he called to Zoie as he sank down on the edge of the bed
See mothers boy
Mother
shrieked Zoie in horror
It had suddenly dawned upon her that this was the name by which Alfred would no doubt call her for the rest of her life
She almost detested him
But Alfred did not see the look of disgust on Zoies face
He was wholly absorbed by baby
What a funny face he cooed as he pinched the youngsters cheek
Great Scott what a grip he cried as the infants fingers closed around his own
Will you look at the size of those hands he exclaimed
Zoie and Aggie exchanged worried glances the baby had no doubt inherited his large hands from his mother
Say Aggie called Alfred what are all of these little specks on babys forehead
He pointed toward the infants brow
One two three he counted
Zoie was becoming more and more uncomfortable at the close proximity of the little stranger
Oh said Aggie with affected carelessness as she leaned over Alfreds shoulder and glanced at babys forehead
That is just a little rash
A rash
exclaimed Alfred excitedly thats dangerous isnt it
Wed better call up the doctor
And he rose and started hurriedly toward the telephone baby in arms
Dont be silly called Zoie filled with vague alarm at the thought of the family physicians appearance and the explanations that this might entail
Stepping between Alfred and the phone Aggie protested frantically
You see Alfred she said it is better to have the rash OUT it wont do any harm unless it turns IN
Hes perfectly well declared Zoie if youll only put him in his crib and leave him alone
Alfred looked down at his charge
Is that right son
he asked and he tickled the little fellow playfully in the ribs
Ill tell you what he called over his shoulder to Zoie hes a fine looking boy
And then with a mysterious air he nodded to Aggie to approach
Whom does he look like
he asked
Again Zoie sat up in anxiety
Aggie glanced at her uncertain what answer to make
II hadnt thought she stammered weakly
Go on go on exclaimed the proud young father you cant tell me that you can look at that boy and not see the resemblance
To whom
asked Aggie half fearfully
Why said Alfred hes the image of Zoie
Zoie gazed at the puckered red face in Alfreds arms
What
she shrieked in disgust then fall back on her pillows and drew the lace coverlet over her face
Mistaking Zoies feeling for one of embarrassment at being overpraised Alfred bore the infant to her bedside
See dear he persisted see for yourself look at his forehead
Id rather look at you pouted Zoie peeping from beneath the coverlet if you would only put that thing down for a minute
Thing
exclaimed Alfred as though doubting his own ears
But before he could remonstrate further Zoies arms were about his neck and she was pleading jealously for his attention
Please Alfred she begged I have scarcely had a look at you yet
Alfred shook his head and turned to baby with an indulgent smile
It was pleasant to have two such delightful creatures bidding for his entire attention
Dear me he said to baby
Dear me tink of mudder wanting to look at a big ugy ting like fadder when she could look at a itty witty ting like dis and he rose and crossed to the crib where he deposited the small creature with yet more gurgling and endearing
Zoies dreams of rapture at Alfreds home coming had not included such divided attention as he was now showing her and she was growing more and more desperate at the turn affairs had taken
She resolved to put a stop to his nonsense and to make him realise that she and no one else was the lode star of his existence
She beckoned to Aggie to get out of the room and to leave her a clear field and as soon as her friend had gone quietly into the next room she called impatiently to Alfred who was still cooing rapturously over the young stranger
Finding Alfred deaf to her first entreaty Zoie shut her lips hard rearranged her pretty headdress drew one fascinating little curl down over her shoulder reknotted the pink ribbon of her negligee and then issued a final and imperious order for her husband to attend her
Yes yes dear answered Alfred with a shade of impatience
Im coming Im coming
And bidding a reluctant farewell to the small person in the crib he crossed to her side
Zoie caught Alfreds hand and drew him down to her he smiled complacently
Well he said in the patronising tone that Zoie always resented
How is hubbys little girl
Its about time pouted Zoie that you made a little fuss over me for a change
My own
murmured Alfred
He stooped to kiss the eager lips but just as his young wife prepared to lend herself to his long delayed embrace his mind was distracted by an uneasy thought
Do you think that Baby is He was not permitted to finish the sentence
Zoie drew him back to her with a sharp exclamation
Think of ME for a while she commanded
My darling expostulated Alfred with a shade of surprise at her vehemence
How could I think of anyone else
Again he stooped to embrace her and again his mind was directed otherwise
I wonder if Baby is warm enough he said and attempted to rise
Wonder about ME for a while snapped Zoie clinging to him determinedly
Again Alfred looked at her in amazement
Was it possible there was anything besides Baby worth wondering about
Whether there was or not Zoie was no longer to be resisted and with a last regretful look at the crib he resigned himself to giving his entire attention to his spoiled young wife
Gratified by her hardwon conquest Zoie now settled herself in Alfreds arms
You havent told me what you did all the time that you were away she reminded him
Oh there was plenty to do answered Alfred
Did you think of me every minute
she asked jealously
That would be telling laughed Alfred as he pinched her small pink ear
I wish to be told  declared Zoie I dont suppose you realise it but if I were to live a THOUSAND YEARS Id never be quite sure what you did during those FEW MONTHS
It was nothing that you wouldnt have been proud of answered Alfred with an unconscious expansion of his chest
Do you love me as much as ever
asked Zoie
Behave yourself answered Alfred trying not to appear flattered by the discovery that his absence had undoubtedly caused her great uneasiness
Well SAY it
demanded Zoie
You know I do answered Alfred with the diffidence of a school boy
Then kiss me concluded Zoie with an air of finality that left Alfred no alternative
As a matter of fact Alfred was no longer seeking an alternative
He was again under the spell of his wifes adorable charms and he kissed her not once but many times
Foolish child he murmured then he laid her tenderly against the large white pillows remonstrating with her for being so spoiled and cautioning her to be a good little girl while he went again to see about Baby
Zoie clung to his hand and feigned approaching tears
You arent thinking of me at all
she pouted
And kisses are no good unless you put your whole mind on them
Give me a real kiss
she pleaded
Again Alfred stooped to humour the small importunate person who was so jealous of his every thought but just as his lips touched her forehead his ear was arrested by a sound as yet new both to him and to Zoie
He lifted his head and listened
What was that
he asked
I dont know answered Zoie wondering if the cat could have got into the room
A redoubled effort on the part of the young stranger directed their attention in the right direction
My God
exclaimed Alfred tragically its Baby
Hes crying
And with that he rushed to the crib and clasped the small mite close to his breast leaving Zoie to pummel the pillows in an agony of vexation
After vain cajoling of the angry youngster Alfred bore him excitedly to Zoies bedside
Youd better take him dear he said
To the young husbands astonishment Zoie waved him from her in terror and called loudly for Aggie
But no sooner had Aggie appeared on the scene than a sharp whistle was heard from the pavement below
Pull down the shade
cried Zoie frantically
Aggie hastened toward the window
Attributing Zoies uneasiness to a caprice of modesty Alfred turned from the cradle to reassure her
No one can see in way up here he said
To Zoies distress the lowering of the shade was answered by a yet shriller whistle from the street below
Was it up or down
cried Zoie to Aggie in an agony of doubt as she tried to recall her instructions to Jimmy
I dont know answered Aggie
Ive forgotten
Another impatient whistle did not improve their memory
Alarmed by Zoies increasing excitement and thinking she was troubled merely by a sick womans fancy that someone might see through the window Alfred placed the babe quickly in its cradle and crossed to the young wifes bed
It was up dear he said
You had Aggie put it down
Then I want it up declared the seemingly perverse Zoie
But it was up argued Alfred
A succession of emotional whistles set Zoie to pounding the pillows
Put it down
she commanded
But Zoie protested Alfred
Did I say up or did I say down
moaned the halfdemented Zoie while long whistles and short whistles appealing whistles and impatient whistles followed each other in quick succession
You said down dear persisted Alfred now almost as distracted as his wife
Zoie waved him from the room
I wish youd get out of here she cried you make me so nervous that I cant think at all
Of course dear murmured Alfred if you wish it
And with a hurt and perplexed expression on his face he backed quickly from the room
CHAPTER XXI When Zoies letter asking for the OFlarety twin had reached that young ladys astonished mother Mrs OFlarety felt herself suddenly lifted to a position of importance
Think of the purty Mrs Hardy a wantin my little Bridget she exclaimed and she began to dwell upon the romantic possibilities of her offsprings future under the care of such a foine stylish lady and concluded by declaring it a lucky day entoirely
 Jimmy had his misgivings about it being Bridgets LUCKY day but it was not for him to delay matters by dwelling upon the eccentricities of Zoies character and when Mrs OFlarety had deposited Bridget in Jimmys short arms and slipped a well filled nursing bottle into his overcoat pocket he took his leave hastily lest the excited woman add Bridgets twin to her willing offering
Once out of sight of the elated mother Jimmy thrust the defenceless Bridget within the folds of his already snug ulster buttoned the garment in such places as it would meet and made for the taxi which owing to the upset condition of the street he had been obliged to abandon at the corner
Whether the driver had obtained a more promising fare or been run in by the police Jimmy never knew
At any rate it was in vain that he looked for his vehicle
So intense was the cold that it was impossible to wait for a chance taxi furthermore the meanness of the district made it extremely unlikely that one would appear and glancing guiltily behind him to make sure that no one was taking cognisance of his strange exploit Jimmy began picking his way along dark lanes and avoiding the lighted thoroughfare on which the Sherwood was situated until he was within a block of his destination
Panting with haste and excitement he eventually gained courage to dash through a side street that brought him within a few doors of the Sherwood
Again glancing behind him he turned the well lighted corner and arrived beneath Zoies window to find one shade up and one down
In his perplexity he emitted a faint whistle
Immediately he saw the other shade lowered
Uncertain as to what arrangement he had actually made with Zoie he ventured a second whistle
The result was a hysterical running up and down of the shade which left him utterly bewildered as to what disposition he was supposed to make of the wobbly bit of humanity pressed against his shirt front
Reaching over his artificially curved figure to grasp a bit of white that trailed below his coat he looked up to see a passing policeman eyeing him suspiciously
Taking the air
asked the policeman
Yeyes mumbled Jimmy with affected nonchalence and he knocked the heels of his boots together in order to keep his teeth from chattering
Its a fifine ninight for air he stuttered
Is it
said the policeman and to Jimmys horror he saw the fellows eyes fix themselves on the bit of white
Gogoodnight stammered Jimmy hurriedly and trying to assume an easy stride in spite of the uncomfortable addition to his already rotund figure he slipped into the hotel where avoiding the lighted elevator he laboured quickly up the stairs
At the very moment when Zoie was driving Alfred in consternation from the room Jimmy entered it uninvited
Get out was the inhospitable greeting received simultaneously from Zoie and Aggie and without waiting for further instructions he got
Fortunately for all concerned Alfred who was at the same moment departing by way of the bedroom door did not look behind him but it was some minutes before Aggie who had followed Jimmy into the hall could persuade him to return
After repeated and insistent signals both from Aggie and Zoie Jimmys round red face appeared cautiously around the frame of the door
It bore unmistakable indications of apoplexy
But the eyes of the women were not upon Jimmys face they too had caught sight of the bit of white that hung below his coat and dragging him quickly into the room and closing the door Aggie proceeded without inquiry or thanks to unbutton his coat and to take from beneath it the small object for which she and Zoie had been eagerly waiting
Thank Heaven
sighed Zoie as she saw Aggie bearing the latest acquisition to Alfreds rapidly increasing family safely toward the crib
Suddenly remembering something in his right hand coat pocket Jimmy called to Aggie who turned to him and waited expectantly
After characteristic fumbling he produced a well filled nursing bottle
Whats that
asked Zoie
For HER grunted Jimmy and he nodded toward the bundle in Aggies arms
HER
cried Zoie and Aggie in chorus
Zoie shut her lips hard and gazed at him with contempt
I might have known youd get the wrong kind she said
What Jimmy thought about the ingratitude of woman was not to be expressed in language
He controlled himself as well as he could and merely LOOKED the things that he would like to have said
Well it cant be helped now decided the philosophic Aggie here Jimmy she said you hold HER a minute and Ill get you the other one
Placing the small creature in Jimmys protesting arms Aggie turned toward the cradle to make the proposed exchange when she was startled by the unexpected return of Alfred
Thanks to the ample folds of Jimmys ulster he was able to effectually conceal his charge and he started quickly toward the hall but in making the necessary detour around the couch he failed to reach the door before Alfred who had chosen a more direct way
Hold on Jimmy exclaimed Alfred good naturedly and he laid a detaining hand on his friends shoulder
Where are you going
Ill be back stammered Jimmy weakly edging his way toward the door and contriving to keep his back toward Alfred
Wait a minute said Alfred jovially as he let his hand slip onto Jimmys arm you havent told me the news yet
Ill tell you later mumbled Jimmy still trying to escape
But Alfreds eye had fallen upon a bit of white flannel dangling below the bottom of Jimmys ulster it travelled upward to Jimmys unusually rotund figure
What have you got there
he demanded to know as he pointed toward the centre button of Jimmys overcoat
Here
echoed Jimmy vapidly glancing at the button in question why thats just a little There was a faint wail from the depths of the ulster
Jimmy began to caper about with elephantine tread
Oochie coochie oochie he called excitedly
Whats the matter with you
asked Alfred
The wail became a shriek
Good Heavens
cried the anxious father its my boy
And with that he pounced upon Jimmy threw wide his ulster and snatched from his arms Jimmys latest contribution to Zoies scheme of things
As Aggie had previously remarked all young babies look very much alike and to the inexperienced eye of this new and overwrought father there was no difference between the infant that he now pressed to his breast and the one that unsuspected by him lay peacefully dozing in the crib not ten feet from him
He gazed at the face of the newcomer with the same ecstasy that he had felt in the possession of her predecessor
But Zoie and Aggie were looking at each other with something quite different from ecstasy
My boy exclaimed Alfred with deep emotion as he clasped the tiny creature to his breast
Then he turned to Jimmy
What were you doing with my baby
he demanded hotly
II was just taking him out for a little walk
stammered Jimmy
You just try threatened Alfred and he towered over the intimidated Jimmy
Are you crazy
Jimmy was of the opinion that he must be crazy or he would never have found himself in such a predicament as this but the anxious faces of Zoie and Aggie denied him the luxury of declaring himself so
He sank mutely on the end of the couch and proceeded to sulk in silence
As for Aggie and Zoie they continued to gaze openmouthed at Alfred who was waltzing about the room transported into a new heaven of delight at having snatched his heir from the danger of another night ramble with Jimmy
Did a horrid old Jimmy spoil his itty nap
he gurgled to Baby
Then with a sudden exclamation of alarm he turned toward the anxious women
Aggie
he cried as he stared intently into Babys face
Lookhis rash
Its turned IN
Aggie pretended to glance over Alfreds shoulder
Why so it has she agreed nervously
What shall we do
cried the distraught Alfred
Its all right now counselled Aggie so long as it didnt turn in too suddenly
Wed better keep him warm hadnt we
suggested Alfred remembering Aggies previous instructions on a similar occasion
Ill put him in his crib he decided and thereupon he made a quick move toward the bassinette
Staggering back from the cradle with the unsteadiness of a drunken man Alfred called upon the Diety
What is THAT
he demanded as he pointed toward the unexpected object before him
Neither Zoie Aggie nor Jimmy could command words to assist Alfreds rapidly waning powers of comprehension and it was not until he had swept each face for the third time with a look of inquiry that Zoie found breath to stammer nervously Whywhywhy thats the OTHER one
The other one
echoed Alfred in a dazed manner then he turned to Aggie for further explanation
Yes affirmed Aggie with an emphatic nod the other one
An undescribable joy was dawning on Alfreds face
You dont mean He stared from the infant in his arms to the one in the cradle then back again at Aggie and Zoie
The women solemnly nodded their heads
Even Jimmy unblushingly acquiesced
Alfred turned toward Zoie for the final confirmation of his hopes
Yes dear assented Zoie sweetly thats Alfred
What Jimmy and the women saw next appeared to be the dance of a whirling dervish as a matter of fact it was merely a man mad with delight clasping two infants in long clothes and circling the room with them
When Alfred could again enunciate distinctly he rushed to Zoies side with the babes in his arms
My darling he exclaimed why didnt you tell me
I was ashamed whispered Zoie hiding her head to shut out the sight of the red faces pressed close to hers
My angel
cried Alfred struggling to control his complicated emotions then gazing at the precious pair in his arms he cast his eyes devoutly toward heaven Was ever a man so blessed
Zoie peeped from the covers with affected shyness
You love me just as much
she queried
I love you TWICE as much declared Alfred and with that he sank exhausted on the foot of the bed vainly trying to teeter one son on each knee
CHAPTER XXII When Jimmy gained courage to turn his eyes in the direction of the family group he had helped to assemble he was not reassured by the reproachful glances that he met from Aggie and Zoie
It was apparent that in their minds he was again to blame for something
Realising that they dared not openly reproach him before Alfred he decided to make his escape while his friend was still in the room
He reached for his hat and tiptoed gingerly toward the door but just as he was congratulating himself upon his decision Alfred called to him with a mysterious air
Jimmy he said just a minute and he nodded for Jimmy to approach
It must have been Jimmys guilty conscience that made him powerless to disobey Alfreds every command
Anyway he slunk back to the fond parents side where he ultimately allowed himself to be inveigled into swinging his new watch before the unattentive eyes of the redfaced babes on Alfreds knees
Lower Jimmy lower called Alfred as Jimmy absentmindedly allowed the watch to swing out of the prescribed orbit
Look at the darlings Jimmy look at them he exclaimed as he gazed at the small creatures admiringly
Yes look at them Jimmy repeated Zoie and she glared at Jimmy behind Alfreds back
Dont you wish you had one of them Jimmy
 asked Alfred
Well I wish he had commented Zoie and she wondered how she was ever again to detach either of them from Alfreds breast
Before she could form any plan the telephone rang loud and persistently
Jimmy glanced anxiously toward the women for instructions
Ill answer it said Aggie with suspicious alacrity and she crossed quickly toward the phone
The scattered bits of conversation that Zoie was able to gather from Aggies end of the wire did not tend to soothe her overexcited nerves
As for Alfred he was fortunately so engrossed with the babies that he took little notice of what Aggie was saying
What woman
asked Aggie into the phone
Wheres she from
The answer was evidently not reassuring
Certainly not exclaimed Aggie dont let her come up send her away
Mrs Hardy cant see anyone at all
Then followed a bit of pantomime between Zoie and Aggie from which it appeared that their troubles were multiplying then Aggie again gave her attention to the phone
I dont know anything about her she fibbed that woman must have the wrong address
And with that she hung up the receiver and came towards Alfred anxious to get possession of his two small charges and to get them from the room lest the mother who was apparently downstairs should thrust herself into their midst
Whats the trouble Aggie
asked Alfred and he nodded toward the telephone
Oh just some woman with the wrong address answered Aggie with affected carelessness
Youd better let me take the babies now Alfred
Take them where
asked Alfred with surprise
To bed answered Aggie sweetly they are going to sleep in the next room with Jimmy and me
She laid a detaining hand on Jimmys arm
Whats the hurry
asked Alfred a bit disgruntled
Its very late argued Aggie
Of course it is insisted Zoie
Please Alfred she pleaded do let Aggie take them
Alfred rose reluctantly
Mother knows best he sighed but ignoring Aggies outstretched arms he refused to relinquish the joy of himself carrying the small mites to their room and he disappeared with the two of them singing his now favourite lullaby
When Alfred had left the room Jimmy who was now seated comfortably in the rocker was rudely startled by a sharp voice at either side of him
Well
shrieked Zoie with all the disapproval that could be got into the one small word
Youre very clever arent you
sneered Aggie at Jimmys other elbow
Jimmy stared from one to the other
A nice fix youve got me into NOW reproved Zoie
Why didnt you get out when you had the chance
demanded Aggie
You would take your own sweet time wouldnt you said Zoie
What did I tell you
asked Aggie
What does he care
exclaimed Zoie and she walked up and down the room excitedly oblivious of the disarrangement of her flying negligee
Hes perfectly comfortable
Oh yes assented Jimmy as he sank back into the rocker and began propelling himself to and fro
I never felt better but a disinterested observer would have seen in him the picture of discomfort
Youre going to feel a great deal WORSE he was warned by Aggie
Do you know who that was on the telephone
she asked
Jimmy looked at her mutely
The mother
said Aggie emphatically What
exclaimed Jimmy
Shes down stairs explained Aggie
Jimmy had stopped rockinghis face now wore an uneasy expression
Its time you showed a little human intelligence taunted Zoie then she turned her back upon him and continued to Aggie what did she say
She says answered Aggie with a threatening glance toward Jimmy that she wont leave this place until Jimmy gives her baby back
Let her have her old baby said Jimmy
I dont want it
You dont want it
snapped Zoie indignantly what have YOU got to do with it
Oh nothing nothing acquiesced Jimmy meekly Im a mere detail
A lot you care what becomes of me exclaimed Zoie reproachfully then she turned to Aggie with a decided nod
Well I want it she asserted
But Zoie protested Aggie in astonishment you cant mean to keep BOTH of them
I certainly DO said Zoie
What
cried Aggie and Jimmy in concert
Jimmy has presented Alfred with twins continued Zoie testily and now he has to HAVE twins
Jimmys eyes were growing rounder and rounder
Do you know continued Zoie with a growing sense of indignation what would happen to me if I told Alfred NOW that he WASNT the father of twins
Hed fly straight out of that door and Id never see him again
Aggie admitted that Zoie was no doubt speaking the truth
Jimmy has awakened Alfreds paternal instinct for twins declared Zoie with another emphatic nod of her head and now Jimmy must take the consequences
Jimmy tried to frame a few faint objections but Zoie waved him aside with a positive air
Its no use arguing
If it were only ONE it wouldnt be so bad but to tell Alfred that hes lost twins he couldnt live through it
But Zoie argued Aggie we cant have that mother hanging around down stairs until that baby is an old man
Shell have us arrested the next thing
Why arrest US
asked Zoie with wide baby eyes
WE didnt take it
Old slowpoke took it
And she nodded toward the now utterly vanquished Jimmy
Thats right murmured Jimmy with a weak attempt at sarcasm dont leave me out of anything good
It doesnt matter WHICH one she arrests decided the practical Aggie
Well it matters to me objected Zoie
And to me too if its all the same to you protested Jimmy
Whoever it is continued Aggie the truth is bound to come out
Alfred will have to know sooner or later so we might as well make a clean breast of it first as last
Thats the first sensible thing youve said in three months declared Jimmy with reviving hope
Oh is that so
sneered Zoie and she levelled her most malicious look at Jimmy
What do you think Alfred would do to YOU Mr Jimmy if he knew the truth
YOURE the one who sent him the telegram you are the one who told him that he was a FATHER
Thats true admitted Aggie with a wrinkled forehead
Zoie was quick to see her advantage
She followed it up
And Alfred hasnt any sense of humour you know
How could he have
groaned Jimmy hes married
And with that he sank into his habitual state of dumps
Your sarcasm will do a great deal of good flashed Zoie
Then she dismissed him with a nod and crossed to her dressing table
But Zoie persisted Aggie as she followed her young friend in trepidation dont you realise that if you persist in keeping this baby that mother will dog Jimmys footsteps for the rest of his life
That will be nice murmured Jimmy
Zoie busied herself with her toilet and turned a deaf ear to Aggie
There was a touch of genuine emotion in Aggies voice when she continued
Just think of it Zoie Jimmy will never be able to come and go like a free man again
What do I care how he comes and goes
exclaimed Zoie impatiently
If Jimmy had gone when we told him to go that woman would have had her old baby by now but he didnt oh no
All he ever does is to sit around and talk about his dinner
Yes cried Jimmy hotly and thats about as far as I ever GET with it
Youll never get anywhere with anything was Zoies exasperating answer
Youre too slow
Well theres nothing slow about you retorted Jimmy stung to a frenzy by her insolence
Oh please please interposed Aggie desperately determined to keep these two irascible persons to the main issue
What are we going to tell that mother
You can tell her whatever you like answered Zoie with an impudent toss of her head but Ill NOT give up that baby until I get ANOTHER one
Another
almost shrieked Jimmy
It was apparent that he must needs increase the number of his brain cells if he were to follow this extraordinary young womans line of thought much further
You dont expect to go on multiplying them forever do you
he asked
YOU are the one who has been multiplying them was Zoies disconcerting reply
It was evident to Jimmy that he could not think fast enough nor clearly enough to save himself from a mental disaster if he continued to argue with the shameless young woman so he contented himself by rocking to and fro and murmuring dismally that he had known from the first that it was to be an endless chain
While Zoie and Jimmy had been wrangling Aggie had been weighing the pros and cons of the case
She now turned to Jimmy with a tone of firm but motherly decision
Zoie is quite right she said
Jimmy rolled his large eyes up at his spouse with a you too Brutus expression
Aggie continued mercilessly Its the only way Jimmy
No sooner had Aggie arrived at her decision than Zoie upset her tranquillity by a triumphant expression of I have it
Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Zoies radiant face in consternation
They were accustomed to see only reproach there
Her sudden enthusiasm increased Jimmys uneasiness
YOU have it he grunted without attempting to conceal his disgust
SHES the one who generally has it
And he nodded toward Aggie
Inflamed by her young friends enthusiasm Aggie rushed to her eagerly
What is it Zoie
she asked
The washerwoman
exclaimed Zoie as though the revelation had come straight from heaven
SHE HAD TWINS and with that two pairs of eyes turned expectantly toward the only man in the room
Tracing the pattern of the rug with his toe Jimmy remained stubbornly oblivious of their attentions
He rearranged the pillows on the couch and finally for want of a better occupation he wound his watch
All to no avail
He could feel Zoies catlike gaze upon him
Jimmy can get the other one she said
The hell I can exclaimed Jimmy starting to his feet and no longer considering time or place
The two women gazed at him reproachfully
Jimmy
cried Aggie in a shocked hurt voice
Thats the first time Ive ever heard you swear
Well it wont be the LAST time declared Jimmy hotly if THIS keeps up
His eyes were blazing
He paced to and fro like an infuriated lion
Dearest said Aggie you look almost imposing
Nonsense interrupted Zoie
who found Jimmy unusually ridiculous
If Id known that Jimmy was going to put such an idea into Alfreds head Id have got the two in the first place
Will she let us HAVE the other
asked Aggie with some misgiving
Of course she will answered Zoie leaving Jimmy entirely out of the conversation
Shes as poor as a church mouse
Ill pay her well
Shell never miss it
What could she do with one twin anyway
A snort of rage from Jimmy did not disturb Zoies enthusiasm
She proceeded to elaborate her plan
Ill adopt them she declared Ill leave them all Alfreds money
Think of Alfred having real live twins for keeps
It would be nice wouldnt it
commented Jimmy sarcastically
Zoie turned to Jimmy as though they were on the best of terms
How much money have you
she asked
Before Jimmy could declare himself penniless Aggie answered for him with the greatest enthusiasm He has a whole lot he drew some today
Good
exclaimed Zoie to the abashed Jimmy and then she continued in a matterof fact tone Now Jimmy she said you go give the washwoman what money you have on account then tell her to come around here in the morning when Alfred has gone out and Ill settle all the details with her
Go on now Jimmy she continued you dont need another letter
No chimed in Aggie sweetly you know her now dear
Oh yes corroborated Jimmy with a sarcastic smile and without budging from the spot on which he stood we are great pals now
Whats the matter
asked Zoie astonished that Jimmy was not starting on his mission with alacrity
What are you waiting for
Jimmy merely continued to smile enigmatically
You know what happened the last time you hesitated warned Aggie
I know what happened when I DIDNT hesitate ruminated Jimmy still holding his ground
Zoies eyes were wide with surprise
You dont mean to say she exclaimed incredulously that you arent GOINGafter we have thought all this out just to SAVE you
Say answered Jimmy with a confidential air do me a favour will you
Stop thinking out things to save me
 But Jimmy protested both women simultaneously but before they could get further Alfreds distressed voice reached them from the next room
Aggie
he called frantically
CHAPTER XVIII What seemed to be a streak of pink through the room was in reality Zoie bolting for the bed
While Zoie hastened to snuggle comfortably under the covers Aggie tried without avail to get Jimmy started on his errand
Getting no response from Aggie Alfred bearing one infant in his arms came in search of her
Apparently he was having difficulty with the unfastening of babys collar
Aggie he called sharply how on earth do you get this fool pin out
Take him back Alfred answered Aggie impatiently Ill be there in a minute
But Alfred had apparently made up his mind that he was not a success as a nurse
Youd better take him now Aggie he decided as he offered the small person to the reluctant Aggie
Ill stay here and talk to Jimmy
Oh but Jimmy was just going out answered Aggie then she turned to her obdurate spouse with mock sweetness Werent you dear
she asked
Yes affirmed Zoie with a threatening glance toward Jimmy
He was going just now
Still Jimmy remained rooted to the spot
Out
questioned Alfred
What for
Just for a little air explained Aggie blandly
Yes growled Jimmy another little heir
Air
repeated Alfred in surprise
He had air a while ago with my son
He is going to stay here and tell me the news
Sit down Jimmy he commanded and to the intense annoyance of Aggie and Zoie Jimmy sank resignedly on the couch
Alfred was about to seat himself beside his friend when the phone rang violently
Being nearest to the instrument Alfred reached it first and Zoie and Aggie awaited the consequences in dread
What they heard did not reassure them nor Jimmy
Still down there
exclaimed Alfred into the phone
Jimmy began to wriggle with a vague uneasiness
Well continued Alfred at the phone that woman has the wrong number
Then with a peremptory Wait a minute he turned to Zoie The hall boy says that woman who called a while ago is still down stairs and she wont go away until she has seen you Zoie
She has some kind of an idiotic idea that you know where her baby is
How absurd sneered Zoie
How silly added Aggie
How foolish grunted Jimmy
Well decided Alfred Id better go down stairs and see whats the matter with her and he turned toward the door to carry out his intention
Alfred
called Zoie sharply
She was half out of bed in her anxiety
Youll do no such thing
Phone down to the boy to send her away
Shes crazy
Oh said Alfred then shes been here before
Who is she
Who is she
answered Zoie trying to gain time for a new inspiration
Why shes shes her face lit up with satisfactionthe idea had arrived
Shes the nurse she concluded emphatically
The nurse
repeated Alfred a bit confused
Yes answered Zoie pretending to be annoyed with his dull memory
Shes the one I told you about the one I had to discharge
Oh said Alfred with the relief of sudden comprehension the crazy one
Aggie and Zoie nodded their heads and smiled at him tolerantly then Zoie continued to elaborate
You see she said the poor creature was so insane about little Jimmy that I couldnt go near the child
What
exclaimed Alfred in a mighty rage
Ill soon tell the boy what to do with her he declared and he rushed to the phone
Barely had Alfred taken the receiver from the hook when the outer door was heard to bang
Before he could speak a distracted young woman whose excitable manner bespoke her foreign origin swept through the door without seeing him and hurled herself at the unsuspecting Zoie
The womans black hair was dishevelled and her large shawl had fallen from her shoulders
To Jimmy who was crouching behind an armchair she seemed a giantess
My baby
cried the frenzied mother with what was unmistakably an Italian accent
Where is he
There was no answer her eyes sought the cradle
Ah
she shrieked then upon finding the cradle empty she redoubled her lamentations and again she bore down upon the terrified Zoie
You she cried you know where my baby is
For answer Zoie sank back amongst her pillows and drew the bed covers completely over her head
Alfred approached the bed to protect his young wife the Italian woman wheeled about and perceived a small child in his arms
She threw herself upon him
I knew it she cried I knew it
Managing to disengage himself from what he considered a mad woman and elevating one elbow between her and the child Alfred prevented the mother from snatching the small creature from his arms
Calm yourself madam he commanded with a superior air
We are very sorry for you of course but we cant have you coming here and going on like this
Hes OUR baby and Hes NOT your baby
cried the infuriated mother hes MY baby
Give him to me
Give him to me and with that she sprang upon the uncomfortable Alfred like a tigress
Throwing her whole weight on his uplifted elbow she managed to pull down his arm until she could look into the face of the washerwomans promising young offspring
The air was rent by a scream that made each individual hair of Jimmys head stand up in its own defence
He could feel a sickly sensation at the top of his short thick neck
Hes NOT my baby wailed the now demented mother little dreaming that the infant for which she was searching was now reposing comfortably on a soft pillow in the adjoining room
As for Alfred all of this was merely confirmation of Zoies statement that this poor soul was crazy and he was tempted to dismiss her with worthy forbearance
I am glad madam he said that you are coming to your senses
Now all would have gone well and the bewildered mother would no doubt have left the room convinced of her mistake had not Jimmys nerves got the better of his judgment
Having slipped cautiously from his position behind the armchair he was tiptoeing toward the door and was flattering himself on his escape when suddenly as his forward foot cautiously touched the threshold he heard the cry of the captor in his wake and before he could possibly command the action of his other foot he felt himself being forcibly drawn backward by what appeared to be his too tenacious coattails
If only they would tear thought Jimmy but thanks to the excellence of the tailor that Aggie had selected for him they did NOT tear
Not until she had anchored Jimmy safely to the centre of the rug did the irate mother pour out the full venom of her resentment toward him
From the mixture of English and Italian that followed it was apparent that she was accusing Jimmy of having stolen her baby
Take me to him she demanded tragically my babytake me to him
Jimmy appealed to Aggie and Zoie
Their faces were as blank as his own
He glanced at Alfred
Humour her whispered Alfred much elated by the evidence of his own selfcontrol as compared to Jimmys utter demoralisation under the apparently same circumstances
Still Jimmy did not budge
Alfred was becoming vexed he pointed first to his own forehead then to that of Jimmys hysterical captor
He even illustrated his meaning by making a rotary motion with his forefinger intended to remind Jimmy that the woman was a lunatic
Still Jimmy only stared at him and all the while the woman was becoming more and more emphatic in her declaration that Jimmy knew where her baby was
Sure Jimmy said Alfred out of all patience with Jimmys stupidity and tiring of the strain of the womans presence
You know where her baby is
Ah
cried the mother and she towered over Jimmy with a wild light in her eyes
Take me to him she demanded take me to him
Jimmy rolled his large eyes first toward Aggie then toward Zoie and at last toward Alfred
There was no mercy to be found anywhere
Take her to him Jimmy commanded a concert of voices and pursued by a bundle of waving colours and a medley of discordant sounds Jimmy shot from the room
CHAPTER XXIV The departure of Jimmy and the crazed mother was the occasion for a general relaxing among the remaining occupants of the room
Exhausted by what had passed Zoie had ceased to interest herself in the future
It was enough for the present that she could sink back upon her pillows and draw a long breath without an evil face bending over her and without the air being rent by screams
As for Aggie she fell back upon the window seat and closed her eyes
The horrors into which Jimmy might be rushing had not yet presented themselves to her imagination
Of the three Alfred was the only one who had apparently received exhilaration from the encounter
He was strutting about the room with the babe in his arms undoubtedly enjoying the sensations of a hero
When he could sufficiently control his feeling of elation he looked down at the small person with an air of condescension and again lent himself to the garbled sort of language with which defenceless infants are inevitably persecuted
Tink of dat horrid old woman wanting to steal our own little oppsie woppsie toppsie babykins he said
Then he turned to Zoie with an air of great decision
That woman ought to be locked up he declared shes dangerous and with that he crossed to Aggie and hurriedly placed the infant in her unsuspecting arms
Here Aggie he said you take Alfred and get him into bed
Glad of an excuse to escape to the next room and recover her self control Aggie quickly disappeared with the child
For some moments Alfred continued to pace up and down the room then he came to a full stop before Zoie
Ill have to have something done to that woman he declared emphatically
Jimmy will do enough to her sighed Zoie weakly
Shes no business to be at large continued Alfred then with a businesslike air he started toward the telephone
Where are you going
asked Zoie
Alfred did not answer
He was now calling into the phone Give me information
What on earth are you doing
demanded Zoie more and more disturbed by his mysterious manner
One cant be too careful retorted Alfred in his most paternal fashion theres an awful lot of kidnapping going on these days
Well you dont suspect information do you
asked Zoie
Again Alfred ignored her he was intent upon things of more importance
Hello he called into the phone is this information
Apparently it was for he continued with a satisfied air Well give me the Fullerton Street Police Station
The Police
cried Zoie sitting up in bed and looking about the room with a new sense of alarm
Alfred did not answer
Aggie
shrieked the overwrought young wife
Alfred attempted to reassure her
Now now dear dont get nervous he said I am only taking the necessary precautions
And again he turned to the phone
Alarmed by Zoies summons Aggie entered the room hastily
She was not reassured upon hearing Alfreds further conversation at the phone
Is this the Fullerton Street Police Station
asked Alfred
The Police
echoed Aggie and her eyes sought Zoies inquiringly
Sh
Sh
called Alfred over his shoulder to the excited Aggie then he continued into the phone
Is Donneghey there
There was a pause
Alfred laughed jovialiy
It is
Well hello Donneghey this is your old friend Hardy Alfred Hardy at the Sherwood
Ive just got back then he broke the happy news to the no doubt appreciative Donneghey
What do you think
he said Im a happy father
Zoie puckered her small face in disgust
Alfred continued to elucidate joyfully at the phone
Doubles he said yessureon the level
I dont know why you have to tell the whole neighbourhood snapped Zoie
Her colour was visibly rising
But Alfred was now in the full glow of his genial account to his friend
Set em up
he repeated in answer to an evident suggestion from the other end of the line I should say I would
The drinks are on me
Tell the boys Ill be right over
And say Donneghey he added in a more confidential tone I want to bring one of the men home with me
I want him to keep an eye on the house tonight then after a pause he concluded confidentially Ill tell you all about it when I get there
It looks like a kidnapping scheme to me and with that he hung up the receiver unmistakably pleased with himself and turned his beaming face toward Zoie
Its all right dear he said rubbing his hands together with evident satisfaction Donneghey is going to let us have a Special Officer to watch the house tonight
I wont HAVE a special officer declared Zoie vehemently then becoming aware of Alfreds great surprise she explained halftearfully Im not going to have the police hanging around our very door
I would feel as though I were in prison
You ARE in prison my dear returned the now irrepressible Alfred
A prison of love you and our precious boys
He stooped and implanted a gracious kiss on her forehead then turned toward the table for his hat
Now he said Ill just run around the corner set up the drinks for the boys and bring the officer home with me and drawing himself up proudly he cried gaily in parting Ill bet theres not another man in Chicago who has what I have to night
I hope not groaned Zoie
as the door closed behind him
Then thrusting her two small feet from beneath the coverlet and perching on the side of the bed she declared to Aggie that Alfred was getting more idiotic every minute
Hes worse than idiotic corrected Aggie
Hes getting dangerous
If he gets the police around here before we give that baby back theyll get the mother
Shell tell all she knows and that will be the end of Jimmy
End of Jimmy
exclaimed Zoie itll be the end of ALL of us
I can see our pictures in the papers right now groaned Aggie
Jimmy will be the villain
Jimmy IS a villain declared Zoie
Where is he
Why doesnt he come back
How am I ever going to get that other twin
There is only one thing to do decided Aggie I must go for it myself
And she snatched up her cape from the couch and started toward the door
You
cried Zoie in alarm and leave me alone
Its our only chance argued Aggie
Ill have to do it now before Alfred gets back
But Aggie protested Zoie clinging to her departing friend suppose that crazy mother should come back
Nonsense replied Aggie and before Zoie could actually realise what was happening the bang of the outside door told her that she was alone
CHAPTER XXV Wondering what new terrors awaited her Zoie glanced uncertainly from door to door
So strong had become her habit of taking refuge in the bed that unconsciously she backed toward it now
Barely had she reached the centre of the room when a terrific crash of breaking glass from the adjoining room sent her shrieking in terror over the footboard and head first under the covers
Here she would doubtless have remained until suffocated had not Jimmy in his backward flight from one of the inner rooms overturned a large rocker
This additional shock to Zoies overstrung nerves forced a wild scream from her lips and an answering exclamation from the nerveracked Jimmy made her sit bolt upright
She gazed at him in astonishment
His tie was awry one end of his collar had taken leave of its anchorage beneath his stout chin and was now just tickling the edge of his red perspiring brow
His hair was on end and his feelings were undeniably ruffled
As usual Zoies greeting did not tend to conciliate him
How did YOU get here
she asked with an air of reproach
The fireescape panted Jimmy and he nodded mysteriously toward the inner rooms of the apartment
Fireescape
echoed Zoie
There was only one and that led through the bathroom window
Jimmy explained no further
He was now peeping cautiously out of the window toward the pavement below
Wheres the mother
demanded Zoie
Jimmy jerked his thumb in the direction of the street
Zoie gazed at him with grave apprehension
Jimmy
she exclaimed
You havent killed her
Jimmy shook his head and continued to peer cautiously out of the window
What did you do with her
called the now exasperated Zoie
What did I do with her
repeated Jimmy a flash of his old resentment returning
What did SHE do with ME
For the first time Zoie became fully conscious of Jimmys ludicrous appearance
Her overstrained nerves gave way and she began to laugh hysterically
Say shouted Jimmy towering over the bed and devoutly wishing that she were his wife so that he might strike her with impunity
Dont you sic any more lunatics onto me
It is doubtful whether Zoies continued laughter might not have provoked Jimmy to desperate measures had not the phone at that moment directed their thoughts toward worse possibilities
After the instrument had continued to ring persistently for what seemed to Zoie an age she motioned to Jimmy to answer it
He responded by retreating to the other side of the room
It may be Aggie suggested Zoie
For the first time Jimmy became aware that Aggie was nowhere in the apartment
Good Lord
he exclaimed as he realised that he was again teteatete with the terror of his dreams
Where IS Aggie
Gone to do what YOU should have done was Zoies characteristic answer
Well answered Jimmy hotly its about time that somebody besides me did something around this place
YOU mocked Zoie all YOUVE ever done was to hoodoo me from the very beginning
If youd taken my advice answered Jimmy and told your husband the truth about the luncheon thered never have been any beginning
 If if if cried Zoie in an agony of impatience if youd tipped that horrid old waiter enough hed never have told anyway
Im not buying waiters to cover up your crimes announced Jimmy with his most self righteous air
Youll be buying more than that to cover up your OWN crimes before youve finished retorted Zoie
Before Ive finished with YOU yes agreed Jimmy
He wheeled upon her with increasing resentment
Do you know where I expect to end up
he asked
I know where you OUGHT to end up snapped Zoie
Ill finish in the electric chair said Jimmy
I can feel blue lightning chasing up and down my spine right now
Well I wish you HAD finished in the electric chair declared Zoie before you ever dragged me into that awful old restaurant
Oh you do do you
answered Jimmy shaking his fist at her across the foot of the bed
For the want of adequate words to express his further feelings Jimmy was beginning to jibber when the outer door was heard to close and he turned to behold Aggie entering hurriedly with something partly concealed by her long cape
Its all right explained Aggie triumphantly to Zoie
Ive got it
She threw her cape aside and disclosed the fruits of her conquest
So snorted Jimmy in disgust slightly miffed by the apparent ease with which Aggie had accomplished a task about which he had made so much ado youve gone into the business too have you
Aggie deigned no reply to him
She continued in a businesslike tone to Zoie
Wheres Alfred
she asked
Still out answered Zoie
Thank Heaven sighed Aggie then she turned to Jimmy and addressed him in rapid decided tones
Now dear she said Ill just put the new baby to bed then Ill give you the other one and you can take it right down to the mother
Jimmy made a vain start in the direction of the fireescape
Four detaining hands were laid upon him
Dont try anything like that warned Aggie you cant get out of this house without that baby
The mother is down stairs now
Shes guarding the door
I saw her
And Aggie sailed triumphantly out of the room to make the proposed exchange of babies
Before Jimmy was able to suggest to himself an escape from Aggies last plan of action the telephone again began to cry for attention
Neither Jimmy nor Zoie could summon courage to approach the impatient instrument and as usual Zoie cried frantically for Aggie
Aggie was not long in returning to the room and this time she bore in her arms the infant so strenuously demanded by its mad mother
Here you are Jimmy she said heres the other one
Now take him down stairs quickly before Alfred gets back
She attempted to place the unresisting babe in Jimmys chubby arms but Jimmys freedom was not to be so easily disposed of
What
he exclaimed backing away from the small creature in fear and abhorrence take that bundle of rags down to the hotel office and have that woman hystericing all over me
No thanks
Oh well answered Aggie distracted by the persistent ringing of the phone then hold him a minute until I answer the phone
This at least was a compromise and reluctantly Jimmy allowed the now wailing infant to be placed in his arms
Jig it Jimmy jig it cried Zoie
Jimmy looked down helplessly at the babys angry red face but before he had made much headway with the jigging Aggie returned to them much excited by the message which she had just received over the telephone
That mother is making a scene down stairs in the office she said
You hear chided Zoie in a fury at Jimmy what did Aggie tell you
If she wants this thing maintained Jimmy looking down at the bundle in his arms she can come after it
We cant have her up here objected Aggie
Alfred may be back at any minute
Hed catch her
You know what happened the last time we tried to change them
You can send it down the chimney for all I care concluded Jimmy
I have it
exclaimed Aggie her face suddenly illumined
Oh Lord groaned Jimmy who had come to regard any elation on Zoies or Aggies part as a sure forewarner of ultimate discomfort for him
Again Aggie had recourse to the phone
Hello she called to the office boy tell that woman to go around to the back door and well send something down to her
There was a slight pause then Aggie added sweetly Yes tell her to wait at the foot of the fireescape
Zoie had already caught the drift of Aggies intention and she now fixed her glittering eyes upon Jimmy who was already shifting about uneasily and glancing at Aggie who approached him with a businesslike air
Now dear said Aggie come with me
Ill hand Baby out through the bathroom window and you can run right down the fireescape with him
If I do run down the fireescape exclaimed Jimmy wagging his large head from side to side Ill keep right on RUNNING
Thats the last youll ever see of me
But Jimmy protested Aggie slightly hurt by his threat once that woman gets her baby youll have no more trouble
With you two still alive
asked Jimmy looking from one to the other
Shell be up here if you dont hurry urged Aggie impatiently and with that she pulled Jimmy toward the bedroom door
Let her come said Jimmy planting his feet so as to resist Aggies repeated tugs Im going to South America
Why will you act like this cried Aggie in utter desperation when we have so little time
Say said Jimmy irrelevantly do you know that I havent had any  Yes interrupted Aggie and Zoie in chorus we know
How long continued Zoie impatiently is it going to take you to slip down that fireescape
That depends on how fast I slip  answered Jimmy doggedly
Youll slip all right sneered Zoie
Further exchange of pleasantries between these two antagonists was cut short by the banging of the outside door
Good Heavens
exclaimed Aggie glancing nervously over her shoulder theres Alfred now
Hurry Jimmy hurry she cried and with that she fairly forced Jimmy out through the bedroom door and followed in his wake to see him safely down the fireescape
CHAPTER XXVI Zoie had barely time to arrange herself after the manner of an interesting invalid when Alfred entered the room in the gayest of spirits
Hello dearie he cried as he crossed quickly to her side
Already
asked Zoie faintly and she glanced uneasily toward the door through which Jimmy and Aggie had just disappeared
I told you I shouldnt be long said Alfred jovially and he implanted a condescending kiss on her forehead
How is the little mother eh
he asked rubbing his hands together in satisfaction
Youre all cold pouted Zoie edging away and youve been drinking
I had to have one or two with the boys said Alfred throwing out his chest and strutting about the room but never again
From now on I cut out all drinks and cigars
This is where I begin to live my life for our sons
How about your life for me
asked Zoie as she began to see long years of boredom stretching before her
You and our boys are one and the same dear answered Alfred coming back to her side
You mean you couldnt go on loving ME if it werent for the BOYS
asked Zoie with anxiety
She was beginning to realise how completely her hold upon him depended upon her hideous deception
Of course I could Zoie answered Alfred flattered by what he considered her desire for his complete devotion but But not so MUCH pouted Zoie
Well of course dear admitted Alfred evasively as he sank down upon the edge of the bed by her side You neednt say another word interrupted Zoie and then with a shade of genuine repentance she declared shamefacedly that she hadnt been much of a wife to Alfred
Nonsense
contradicted the proud young father youve given me the ONE thing that I wanted most in the world
But you see dear said Zoie as she wound her little white arms about his neck and looked up into his face adoringly YOUVE been the ONE thing that I wanted MOST and I never realised until tonight howhow crazy you are about things
What things
asked Alfred a bit puzzled
Well said Zoie letting her eyes fall before his and picking at a bit of imaginary lint on the coverlet babies and things
Oh said Alfred and he was about to proceed when she again interrupted him
But now that I DO realise it continued Zoie earnestly her fingers on his lips lest he again interrupt if youll only have a little patience with me IllIll again her eyes fell bashfully to the coverlet as she considered the possibility of being ultimately obliged to replace the bogus twins with real ones
All the patience in the world answered Alfred little dreaming of the problem that confronted the contrite Zoie
Thats all I ask declared Zoie her assurance completely restored and in case anything SHOULD happen to THESE she glanced anxiously toward the door through which Aggie had borne the twins
But nothing is going to happen to these dear interrupted Alfred rising and again assuming an air of fatherly protection
Ill attend to that
There there he added patting her small shoulder and nodding his head wisely
That crazy woman has got on your nerves but you neednt worry Ive got everything fixed
Donneghey sent a special officer over with me
Hes outside watching the house now
Now
shrieked Zoie fixing her eyes on the bedroom door through which Jimmy had lately disappeared and wondering whether he had yet slipped down the fireescape
Yes continued Alfred walking up and down the floor with a masterly stride
If that woman is caught hanging around here again shell get a little surprise
My boys are safe now God bless them
Then reminded of the fact that he had not seen them since his return he started quickly toward the bedroom door
Ill just have a look at the little rascals he decided
No dear cried Zoie
She caught Alfreds arm as he passed the side of her bed and clung to him in desperation
Wait a minute
Alfred looked down at her in surprise
She turned her face toward the door and called lustily Aggie
Aggie
What is it dear
questioned Alfred thinking Zoie suddenly ill can I get you something
Before Zoie was obliged to reply Aggie answered her summons
Did you call
she asked glancing inquiringly into Zoies distressed face
Alfreds here said Zoie with a sickly smile as she stroked his hand and glanced meaningly at Aggie
Hes GOT the OFFICER
The OFFICER
cried Aggie and involuntarily she took a step backward as though to guard the bedroom door
Yes said Alfred mistaking Aggies surprise for a compliment to his resource and now Aggie if youll just stay with Zoie for a minute Ill have a look at my boys
No no
exclaimed Aggie nervously and she placed herself again in front of the bedroom door
Alfred was plainly annoyed by her proprietory air
Theyre asleep explained Aggie
Ill not WAKE them persisted Alfred I just wish to have a LOOK at them and with that he again made a move toward the door
But Alfred protested Zoie still clinging to his hand youre not going to leave me again so soon
Alfred was becoming more and more restive under the seeming absurdity of their persistent opposition but before he could think of a polite way of overruling them Aggie continued persuasively
You stay with Zoie she said
Ill bring the boys in here and you can both have a look at them
But Aggie argued Alfred puzzled by her illogical behaviour would it be wise to wake them
Just this once said Aggie
Now you stay here and Ill get them
Before Alfred could protest further she was out of the room and the door had closed behind her so he resigned himself to her decision banished his temporary annoyance at her obstinacy and glanced about the room with a new air of proprietorship
This is certainly a great night Zoie he said
It certainly is acquiesced Zoie with an over emphasis that made Alfred turn to her with new concern
Im afraid that mad woman made you very nervous dear he said
She certainly did said Zoie
Zoies nerves were destined to bear still further strain for at that moment there came a sharp ring at the door
Beside herself with anxiety Zoie threw her arms about Alfred who had advanced to soothe her drew him down by her side and buried her head on his breast
You ARE jumpy said Alfred and at that instant a wrangle of loud voices and a general commotion was heard in the outer hall
Whats that
asked Alfred endeavouring to disentangle himself from Zoies frantic embrace
Zoie clung to him so tightly that he was unable to rise but his alert ear caught the sound of a familiar voice rising above the din of dispute in the hallway
That sounds like the officer he exclaimed
The officer
cried Zoie and she wound her arms more tightly about him
CHAPTER XXVII Propelled by a large red fist attached to the back of his badly wilted collar the writhing form of Jimmy was now thrust through the outer door
Let go of me shouted the hapless Jimmy
The answer was a spasmodic shaking administered by the fist then a large burly officer carrying a small babe in his arms shoved the reluctant Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him
I got him for you sir announced the officer proudly to the astonished Alfred who had just managed to untwine Zoies arms and to struggle to his feet
Alfreds eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy then they travelled to the bundle of long clothes in the officers arms
My boy
he cried
My boy
He snatched the infant from the officer and pressed him jealously to his breast
I dont understand he said gazing at the officer in stupefaction
Where was he
You mean this one
asked the officer nodding toward the unfortunate Jimmy
I caught him slipping down your fireescape
I KNEW it exclaimed Zoie in a rage and she cast a vindictive look at Jimmy for his awkwardness
Knew WHAT dear
asked Alfred now thoroughly puzzled
Zoie did not answer
Her powers of resource were fast waning
Alfred turned again to the officer then to Jimmy who was still flashing defiance into the officers threatening eyes
My God
he exclaimed this is awful
Whats the matter with you Jimmy
This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out into the night
Then youve had trouble with him before
remarked the officer
He studied Jimmy with new interest proud in the belief that he had brought a confirmed babysnatcher to justice
Ive had a little trouble myself declared Jimmy hotly now resolved to make a clean breast of it
Im not asking about your troubles interrupted the officer savagely and Jimmy felt the huge creatures obnoxious fingers tightening again on his collar
Go ahead sir said the officer to Alfred
Well began Alfred nodding toward the now livid Jimmy he was out with my boy when I arrived
I stopped him from going out with him a second time and now you officer catch him slipping down the fireescape
I dont know what to say he finished weakly
I do exclaimed Jimmy feeling more and more like a high explosive and Ill say it
Cut it shouted the officer
And before Jimmy could get further Alfred resumed with fresh vehemence
Hes supposed to be a friend of mine he explained to the officer as he nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy
He was all right when I left him a few months ago
Youll think Im all right again shouted Jimmy trying to get free from the officer before Ive finished telling all I That wont help any interrupted the officer firmly and with another twist of Jimmys badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most civil manner What shall I do with him sir
I dont know said Alfred convinced that his friend was a fit subject for a straight jacket
This is horrible
Its absurd cried Zoie on the verge of hysterics and in utter despair of ever disentangling the present complication without ultimately losing Alfred youre all absurd she cried wildly
Absurd
exclaimed Alfred turning upon her in amazement what do you mean
Its a joke said Zoie without the slightest idea of where the joke lay
If you had any sense you could see it
I DONT see it said Alfred with hurt dignity
Neither do I said Jimmy with boiling resentment
Can you call it a joke asked Alfred incredulously to have our boy He stopped suddenly remembering that there was a companion piece to this youngster
The other one
he exclaimed our other boy He rushed to the crib found it empty and turned a terrified face to Zoie
Where is he
he demanded
Now Alfred pleaded Zoie dont get excited hes all right
How do you know
asked the distracted father
Zoie did not know but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy and as usual he was the source of an inspiration for her
Jimmy never cared for the other one she said did you Jimmy
Alfred turned to the officer with a tone of command
Wait he said then he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other boy was quite safe
The picture that confronted him brought the hair straight up on his head
True to her promise and ignorant of Jimmys return with the first baby Aggie had chosen this illfated moment to appear on the threshold with one babe on each arm
Here they are she said graciously then stopped in amazement at sight of the horrified Alfred clasping a third infant to his breast
Good God
exclaimed Alfred stroking his forehead with his unoccupied hand and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition THOSE arent MINE he pointed to the two red mites in Aggies arms
Whwhy not Alfred
stammered Aggie for the want of something better to say
What
shrieked Alfred
Then he turned in appeal to his young wife whose face had now become utterly expressionless
Zoie
he entreated
There was an instants pause then the blood returned to Zoies face and she proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her
OURS dear she murmured softly with a bashful droop of her lids
But THIS one
persisted Alfred pointing to the baby in his arms and feeling sure that his mind was about to give way
Whywhywhy stuttered Zoie THATS the JOKE
The joke
echoed Alfred looking as though he found it anything but such
Yes added Aggie sharing Zoies desperation to get out of their temporary difficulty no matter at what cost in the future
Didnt Jimmy tell you
Tell me WHAT
stammered Alfred what IS there to tell
Why you see said Aggie growing more enthusiastic with each elaboration of Zoies lie we didnt dare to break it to you too suddenly
Break it to me
gasped Alfred a new light was beginning to dawn on his face
So concluded Zoie now thoroughly at home in the new situation we asked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT
Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoies direction
Was it possible that she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty
You ASKED Jimmy
repeated Alfred
Yes confirmed Aggie with easy confidence we wanted you to get used to the idea gradually
The idea echoed Alfred
He was afraid to allow his mind to accept too suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure lest his joy over power him
Youyoudodont mean he stuttered
Yes dear sighed Zoie with the face of an angel and then with a languid sigh she sank back contentedly on her pillows
My boys
My boys
cried Alfred now delirious with delight
Give them to me he called to Aggie and he snatched the surprised infants savagely from her arms
Give me ALL of them ALL of them
He clasped the three babes to his breast then dashed to the bedside of the unsuspecting Zoie and covered her small face with rapturous kisses
Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to hers Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence but unconscious of her unmotherly action Alfred continued his mad career about the room his heart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind in general
Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee he treated that bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss
A proceeding which Jimmy did not at all approve
Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled Jimmy was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a loud resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young friend
Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault and Alfred veered off in the direction of the officer who stepped aside just in time to avoid similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young father
Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies Alfred suddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other
Well said the officer regarding Alfred with an injured air and feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his shortlived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal if this is all a joke Ill let the woman go
The woman repeated Alfred what woman
I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fireescape explained the officer
Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly
I thought she might be an accomplice
What does she look like officer
asked Alfred
His manner was becoming more paternal not to say condescending with the arrival of each new infant
Dont be silly Alfred snapped Zoie really ashamed that Alfred was making such an idiot of himself
Its only the nurse
Oh thats it said Alfred with a wise nod of comprehension the nurse then shes in the joke too
He glanced from one to the other
They all nodded
Youre all in it he exclaimed flattered to think that they had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many of them to deceive him
Yes assented Jimmy sadly we are all in it
 Well shes a great actress decided Alfred with the air of a connoisseur
She sure is admitted Donneghey more and more disgruntled as he felt his reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him
She put up a phoney story about the kid being hers he added
But I could tell she wasnt on the level
Goodnight sir he called to Alfred and ignoring Jimmy he passed quickly from the room
Oh officer Alfred called after him
Hang around downstairs
Ill be down later and fix things up with you
Again Alfred gave his whole attention to his newfound family
He leaned over the cradle and gazed ecstatically into the three small faces below his
This is too much he murmured
Much too much agreed Jimmy who was now sitting hunched up on the couch in his customary attitude of gloom
You were right not to break it to me too suddenly said Alfred and with his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch by Jimmys side
Youre a cute one he continued to Jimmy who was edging away from the three mites with aversion
In the absence of any answer from Jimmy Alfred appealed to Zoie Isnt he a cute one dear
he asked
Oh yes VERY answered Zoie sarcastically
Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at self restraint Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door
If you women are done with me he said Ill clear out
Clear out
exclaimed Alfred rising quickly and placing himself between his old friend and the door
What a chance and he laughed boisterously
Youre not going to get out of my sight this night he declared
Im just beginning to appreciate all youve done for me
So am I assented Jimmy and unconsciously his hand sought the spot where his dinner should have been but Alfred was not to be resisted
A man needs someone around he declared when hes going through a thing like this
I need all of you all of you and with his eyes he embraced the weary circle of faces about him
I feel as though I could go out of my head he explained and with that he began tucking the three small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one
Zoie regarded him with a bored expression You act as though you WERE out of your head she commented but Alfred did not heed her
He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing three babies to sleep with one lullaby
The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show some resemblance to their natural selves when their features were again simultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door
CHAPTER XXVIII Annoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby to three Alfred looked up to see Maggie hatless and out of breath bursting into the room and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene
But Maggie paid no heed to Alfreds look of inquiry
She made directly for the side of Zoies bed
If you plaze mum she panted looking down at Zoie and wringing her hands
What is it
asked Aggie who had now reached the side of the bed 
Scuse me for comin right inMaggie was breathing hardbut me mother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin home from work and hes fightin mad about the babies mum
Sh
Sh
cautioned Aggie and Zoie as they glanced nervously toward Alfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing interest in Maggies conversation
Babies
he repeated your father is mad about babies
Its all right dear interrupted Zoie nervously you see she went on to explain pointing toward the trembling Maggie this is our washerwomans little girl
Our washerwoman has had twins too and it made the wash late and her husband is angry about it
Oh said Alfred with a comprehensive nod but Maggie was not to be so easily disposed of
If you please mum she objected it aint about the wash
Its about our baby girls
Girls
exclaimed Zoie involuntarily
Girls
repeated Alfred drawing himself up in the fond conviction that all his heirs were boys No wonder your pas angry
Id be angry too
Come now he said to Maggie patting the child on the shoulder and regarding her indulgently you go straight home and tell your father that what HE needs is BOYS
Well of course sir answered the bewildered Maggie thinking that Alfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her parents if you aint afther likin girls me mother sint the money back and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel petticoat
The money
repeated Alfred in a puzzled way what money
It was again Zoies time to think quickly
The money for the wash dear she explained
Nonsense
retorted Alfred positively beaming generosity who talks of money at such a time as this
And taking a ten dollar bill from his pocket he thrust it in Maggies outstretched hand while she was trying to return to him the original purchase money
Here he said to the astonished girl you take this to your father
Tell him I sent it to him for his babies
Tell him to start a bank account with it
This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal or at least so Maggie decided
She had a hazy idea that Alfred was adding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters but she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such a grand hoigh gentleman even though her failure to do so would no doubt result in a beating when she reached home
She stared at Alfred undecided what to do the money still lay in her outstretched hand
Im afraid Pall niver loike it sir she said
Like it
exclaimed Alfred in high feather and he himself closed her red little fingers over the bill hes GOT to like it
Hell GROW to like it
Now you run along he concluded to Maggie as he urged her toward the door and tell him what I say
Yes sir murmured Maggie far from sharing Alfreds enthusiasm
Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie particularly under Alfreds watchful eye Jimmy had sought his old refuge the high backed chair
As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoies being able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned Jimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their way with him
His mind wandered toward other things and finally into space
His head dropped lower and lower on his chest his breathing became laboured so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of Maggie who was about to pass him on her way to the door
Sure an its Mr
Jinks
exclaimed Maggie
Then coming close to the side of the unsuspecting sleeper she hissed a startling message in his ear
Me mother said to tell you that me fadders hoppin mad at you sir
Jimmy sat up and rubbed his eyes
He studied the young person at his elbow then he glanced at Alfred utterly befuddled as to what had happened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes
Apparently Maggie was waiting for an answer to something but to what
Jimmy thought he detected an ominous look in Alfreds eyes
Letting his hand fall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it Jimmy began to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart she stared at him the harder
Go away whispered Jimmy but Maggie did not move
Shoo shoo
he said and waved her off with his hand
Puzzled by Jimmys sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child Alfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow
Your fathers mad at Jimmy
he repeated
What about
For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the prompt answer that came from her direction
The wash dear said Zoie to Alfred Jimmy had to go after the wash and then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to stop longer Zoie called to her haughtily You neednt wait Maggie we understand
Sure an its more an I do answered Maggie and shaking her head sadly she slipped from the room
But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of Maggies inhuman parent
Just fancy he said turning his head to one side meditatively fancy any man not liking to be the father of twins and with that he again bent over the cradle and surveyed its contents
Think Jimmy he said when he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms just think of the way THAT father feels and then think of the way I feel
And then think of the way I feel grumbled Jimmy
You
exclaimed Alfred what have you to feel about
Before Jimmy could answer the air was rent by a piercing scream and a crash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms
Whats that
whispered Aggie with an anxious glance toward Zoie
Sounded like breaking glass said Alfred
Burglars
exclaimed Zoie for want of anything better to suggest
Burglars
repeated Alfred with a superior air nonsense
Nonsense
Here he said turning to Jimmy you hold the boys and Ill go see and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust upon him he felt three red spineless morsels wriggling about in his arms
He made what lap he could for the armful and sat up in a stiff strained attitude on the edge of the couch
In the meantime Alfred had strode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror
Aggie looked at Zoie with dreadful foreboding
You dont suppose it could be
she paused
My baby
shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining room
Where IS he
Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges Jimmy began to circle the room
So agitated was his mind that he could scarcely hear Aggie who was reporting proceedings from her place at the bedroom door
Shes come up the fireescape cried Aggie shes beating Alfred to death
What
shrieked Zoie making a flying leap from her coverlets
Shes locking him in the bathroom declared Aggie and with that she disappeared from the room bent on rescue
My Alfred
cried Zoie tragically and she started in pursuit of Aggie
Wait a minute called Jimmy who had not yet been able to find a satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and humanity
What shall I do with these things
Eat em was Zoies helpful retort as the trailing end of her negligee disappeared from the room
CHAPTER XXIX Now had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this commotion he might have heard the bell of the outside door which had been ringing violently for some minutes
As it was he was wholly unprepared for the flying advent of Maggie
Oh plaze sir she cried pointing with trembling fingers toward the babes in Jimmys arms me fadders coming right behind me
Hes alookin for you sir
For me murmured Jimmy wondering vaguely why everybody on earth seemed to be looking for HIM
Put em down sir cried Maggie still pointing to the three babies put em down
Hes liable to wallop you
Put em where
asked Jimmy now utterly confused as to which way to turn
There said Maggie and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very eyes
Of course said Jimmy vapidly and he sank on his knees and strove to let the wobbly creatures down easily
Bang went the outside door
Thats Pa now cried Maggie
Oh hide sir hide
And with that disconcerting warning she too deserted him
Hide where
gasped Jimmy
There was a moments awful silence
Jimmy rose very cautiously from the cradle his eyes sought the armchair
It had always betrayed him
He glanced toward the window
It was twelve stories to the pavement
He looked towards the opposite door beyond that was the mad Italian woman
His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway he made a determined dash in that direction but no sooner had he put his head through the door than he drew it back quickly
The conversation between OFlarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring
Jimmy decided to take a chance with the Italian mother and as fast as he could he streaked it toward the opposite door
The shrieks and denunciations that he met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of the Irish father
For an instant he stood in the centre of the room wavering as to which side to surrender himself
The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer he threw himself on the floor and attempted to roll under the bed the space between the railing and the floor was far too narrow
Why had he disregarded Aggies advice as to diet
The knob of the door handle was turninghe vaulted into the bed and drew the covers over his head just as OFlarety trembling with excitement and pursued by Maggie burst into the room
Lave go of me cried OFlarety to Maggie who clung to his arm in a vain effort to soothe him and flinging her off he made straight for the bed
Ah he cried gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object beneath the covers there you are mum and he shook his fist above what he believed to be the cowardly Mrs Hardy 
Tis well ye may cover up your head said he for shame on yez
Me wife may take in washing but when I comes home at night I wants me kids and Ill be after havin em too
Where ar they
he demanded
Then getting no response from the agitated covers he glanced wildly about the room
Glory be to God
he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib but he stopped short in astonishment when upon peering into it he found not one or two but three barren
Theyre child stalers thats what they are he declared to Maggie as he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast
Me little Biddy he crooned over his much coveted possession
Me little Norah he added fondly looking down at his second
The thought of his narrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled his wrath
Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now semiquiet comforter
The black heart of ye mum he roared then ordering Maggie to give back every penny of that shameless creeturs money he turned toward the door
So intense had been OFlaretys excitement and so engrossed was he in his denunciation that he had failed to see the wildeyed Italian woman rushing toward him from the opposite door
You you
cried the frenzied woman and to OFlaretys astonishment she laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced her
Where are you going with my baby
she asked then peering into the face of the infant nearest to her she uttered a disappointed moan 
Tis not my baby
she cried
She scanned the face of the second infantagain she moaned
Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother of the third infant OFlarety jerked his head in the direction of the cradle
I guess youll find what youre lookin for in there he said
Then bidding Maggie to git along out o this and shrugging his shoulders to convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet he swept quickly from the room
Clasping her longsought darling to her heart and weeping with delight the Italian mother was about to follow OFlarety through the door when Zoie staggered into the room weak and exhausted
You you
called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother
How dare you lock my husband in the bathroom
She pointed to the key which the woman still unconsciously clasped in her hand
Give me that key she demanded give it to me this instant
Take your horrid old key said the mother and she threw it on the floor
If you ever try to get my baby again Ill lock your husband in JAIL and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue she took her welcome departure
Zoie stooped for the key one hand to her giddy head but Aggie who had just returned to the room reached the key first and volunteered to go to the aid of the captive Alfred who was pounding desperately on the bathroom door and demanding his instant release
Ill let him out said Aggie
You get into bed and she slipped quickly from the room
Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet and slipped beneath it
Her first sensation was of touching something rough and scratchy then came the awful conviction that the thing against which she lay was alive
Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited bedfellow or even daring to look behind her Zoie fled from the room emitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that direction seem mere baby cries
So completely had Jimmy been enveloped in the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague feeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows and had lost all knowledge of their goings and comings
But when his unexpected companion was thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream and swathed in a large pink comforter he rolled ignominiously from the upper side of the bed where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed awaiting further developments
Of one thing he was certain a great deal had transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and he had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter
By the time he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge a babel of voices was again drawing near and he hastily drew back in his shell and waited
Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright Zoie pushed Aggie before her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed
Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that the pink comforter along with other covers had slipped down behind it Aggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend
You imagined it Zoie she declared look for yourself
Zoies small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway
Well perhaps I did she admitted then she slipped gingerly into the room my nerves are jumping like fizzy water
They were soon to jump more for at this instant Alfred burning with anger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom entered the room demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother who had dared to make him a captive in his own house
Where is she
he called to Zoie and Aggie and his eye roved wildly about the room
Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly acquired offspring
My boys
he cried and he rushed toward the crib
Theyre gone
he declared tragically
Gone
echoed Aggie
Not ALL of them said Zoie
All insisted Alfred and his hands went distractedly toward his head
Shes taken them all
Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way
They had a hazy recollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman but what had become of the other two
Where did they go
asked Aggie
I dont know said Zoie with the first truth she had spoken that night I left them with Jimmy
Jimmy
shrieked Alfred and a diabolical light lit his features
Jimmy
he snorted with sudden comprehension then hes at it again
Hes crazy as she is
This is inhuman
This joke has got to stop
And with that decision he started toward the outer door
But Allie
protested Zoie really alarmed by the look that she saw on his face
Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement and patted her shoulder condescendingly
Control yourself my dear he said
Control yourself Ill get your babies for youtrust me Ill get them
And then he added with parting emphasis from the doorway Ill SETTLE WITH JIMMY
By uncovering one eye Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie were engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room
By uncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action for him immediately upon his reappearance
He determined not to wait for the details
Fixing himself cautiously on all fours and making sure that he was well covered by the pink comforter he began to crawl slowly toward the bedroom door
Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation Zoie suddenly beheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws wriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room
Look
she screamed and pointing in horror toward the dreadful creature now dragging itself across the threshold she sank fainting into Aggies outstretched arms
CHAPTER XXX Having dragged the limp form of her friend to the nearby couch Aggie was bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives when Alfred returned in triumph
He was followed by the officer in whose arms were three infants and behind whom was the irate OFlarety the hysterical Italian woman and last of all Maggie
Bring them all in here officer called Alfred over his shoulder
Ill soon prove to you whose babies those are
Then turning to Aggie who stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly Ive got them Aggie Ive got them
He glanced toward the empty bed
Wheres Zoie
he asked
Shes fainted said Aggie and stepping from in front of the young wife she pointed toward the couch
Oh my darling
cried Alfred with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie and began frantically patting her hands
My poor frightened darling
Then he turned to the officer his sense of injury welling high within him You see what these people have done to my wife
Shes fainted
Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of OFlarety he again bent over Zoie
Rouse yourself my dear he begged of her
Look at me he pleaded
Your babies are safe
HER babies
snorted OFlarety unable longer to control his pent up indignation
Ill let you know when I want to hear from you snarled the officer to OFlarety
But theyre NOT her babies protested the Italian woman desperately
Cut it shouted the officer and with low mutterings the outraged parents were obliged to bide their time
Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she regained her senses
Your babies are all right he assured her
Ive brought them all back to you
All
gasped Zoie weakly and she wondered what curious fate had been intervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking
Yes dear said Alfred every one and he pointed toward the three infants in the officers arms
See dear see
Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces
Oh
she moaned and again she swooned
I told you shed be afraid to face us shouted the now triumphant OFlarety
You brute
retorted the still credulous Alfred how dare you persecute this poor demented mother
Alfreds persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful Italian woman
She didnt persecute me oh no
she exclaimed sarcastically
Keep still you
commanded the officer
Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and begged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers
Lets hear her SAY it demanded OFlarety
You SHALL hear her answered Alfred with confidence
Then he beckoned to the officer to approach explaining that Zoie was very weak
Sure said the officer then planting himself directly in front of Zoies half closed eyes he thrust the babies upon her attention
Look Zoie
pleaded Alfred
Look
Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite her own
Take them away
she cried with a frantic wave of her arm take them away
What
exclaimed Alfred in astonishment
What did I tell you
shouted OFlarety
This hateful reminder brought Alfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife
The excitement has unnerved her he said to the officer
Aint you about done with my kids
asked OFlarety marvelling how any man with so little penetration as the officer managed to hold down a good payin job
What do you want for your proof anyway
asked the mother
But Alfreds faith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily shaken
My wife is in no condition to be questioned he declared
Shes out of her head and if you dont He stepped suddenly for without warning the door was thrown open and a second officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant Jimmy
I guess Ive got somethin here that you folks need in your business he called nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy
Jimmy
exclaimed Aggie having at last got her breath
The Joker
cried Alfred bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a ferocious expression
I caught him slipping down the fireescape explained the officer
Again
exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach
Jimmy said Alfred coming close to his friend and fixing his eyes upon him in a determined effort to control the poor creatures fast failing faculties you know the truth of this thing
You are the one who sent me that telegram you are the one who told me that I was a father
Well arent you a father
asked Aggie trying to protect her dejected spouse
Of course I am replied Alfred with every confidence but I have to prove it to the officer
Jimmy knows he concluded
Then turning to the uncomfortable man at his side he demanded imperatively Tell the officer the truth you idiot
No more of your jokes
Am I a father or am I not
If youre depending on ME for your future offspring answered Jimmy wagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences you are NOT a father
Depending on YOU
gasped Alfred and he stared at his friend in bewilderment
What do you mean by that
Ask them answered Jimmy and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie
Alfred appealed to Aggie
Ask Zoie said Aggie
Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie
My darling he entreated rouse yourself
Slowly she opened her eyes
Now said Alfred with enforced selfcontrol you must look the officer squarely in the eye and tell him whose babies those are and he nodded toward the officer who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the subject
How should I know
cried Zoie too exhausted for further lying
What
exclaimed Alfred his hand on his forehead
I only borrowed them said Zoie to get you home and with that she sank back on the couch and closed her eyes
What did I tell you
cried the triumphant OFlarety
I guess theyre yourn all right admitted the officer doggedly and he grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents
I guess theyd better be shouted OFlarety then he and the Italian woman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts
Wait a minute cried Alfred
I want an understanding
OFlarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist
If you dont leave my kids alone youll GIT an understanding
 Me too added the mother
On your way commanded the officer to the pair of them and together with Maggie and the officer they disappeared forever from the Hardy household
Alfred gazed about the room
My God
he exclaimed then he turned to Jimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer If Im not a father what am I
Id hate to tell you was Jimmys unsympathetic reply and in utter dejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his hands
What shall I do with this one sir
asked the officer undecided as to Jimmys exact standing in the household
Shoot him for all I care groaned Alfred and he rocked to and fro
How ungrateful
exclaimed Aggie then she signalled to the officer to go
No more of your funny business said the officer with a parting nod at Jimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises that Jimmy had left on his shins
Oh Jimmy
said Aggie sympathetically and she pressed her hot face against his round apoplectic cheek
You poor dear
And after all you have done for us
Yes sneered Zoie having regained sufficient strength to stagger to her feet hes done a lot hasnt he
And then forgetting that her original adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous results was still unknown to Aggie and Alfred she concluded bitterly All this would never have happened if it hadnt been for Jimmy and his horrid old luncheon
Jimmy was startled
This was too much and just as he had seemed to be well out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life
He turned to bolt for the door but Aggies eyes were upon him
Luncheon
exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown
Zoies hand was already over her lips but too late
Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss Alfred too was now beginning to sit up and take notice
What luncheon
he demanded
Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie then at Jimmy then resolving to make a clean breast of the matter she sidled toward Alfred with her most ingratiating manner
Now Alfred she purred as she endeavoured to act one arm about his unsuspecting neck if youll only listen Ill tell you the REAL TRUTH
A wild despairing cry from Alfred a dash toward the door by Jimmy and a determined effort on Aggies part to detain her spouse temporarily interrupted Zoies narrative
But in spite of these discouragements Zoie did eventually tell Alfred the real truth and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another day she had added to her confession promises whose happy fulfillment was evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices up and down the stairway of Alfreds new suburban home and the flutter of golden curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his ample well kept grounds
