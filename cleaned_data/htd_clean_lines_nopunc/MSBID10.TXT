BERTRAM TAKES THE REINS Miss Billys Decision CHAPTER I CALDERWELL DOES SOME TALKING Calderwell had met Mr M J Arkwright in London through a common friend since then they had tramped half over Europe together in a comradeship that was as delightful as it was unusual
As Calderwell put it in a letter to his sister Belle We smoke the same cigar and drink the same tea hes just as much of an old woman on that subject as I am
 and we agree beautifully on all necessary points of living from tipping to late sleeping in the morning while as for politics and religionwe disagree in those just enough to lend spice to an otherwise tame existence
Farther along in this same letter Calderwell touched upon his new friend again
I admit however I would like to know his name
To find out what that mysterious M
J
stands for has got to be pretty nearly an obsession with me
I am about ready to pick his pocket or rifle his trunk in search of some lurking Martin or John that will set me at peace
As it is I confess that I have ogled his incoming mail and his outgoing baggage shamelessly only to be slapped in the face always and everlastingly by that bland M
J
Ive got my revenge now though
To myself I call him Mary Jane and his broadshouldered brownbearded six feet of muscular manhood would so like to be called Mary Jane
By the way Belle if you ever hear of murder and sudden death in my direction better set the sleuths on the trail of Arkwright
Six to one youll find I called him Mary Jane to his face
Calderwell was thinking of that letter now as he sat at a small table in a Paris cafe
Opposite him was the six feet of muscular manhood broad shoulders pointed brown beard and alland he had just addressed it inadvertently as Mary Jane
During the brief sickening moment of silence after the name had left his lips Calderwell was conscious of a whimsical realization of the lights music and laughter all about him
Well I chose as safe a place as I could
he was thinking
Then Arkwright spoke
How long since youve been in correspondence with members of my family
Eh
Arkwright laughed grimly
Perhaps you thought of it yourself then Ill admit youre capable of it he nodded reaching for a cigar
But it so happens you hit upon my familys favorite name for me
Mary Jane You mean they actually call you that
Yes bowed the big fellow calmly as he struck a light
Appropriatedont you think
Calderwell did not answer
He thought he could not
Well silence gives consent they say laughed the other
Anyhow you must have had some reason for calling me that
Arkwright what does M
J
stand for
demanded Calderwell
Oh is that it
smiled the man opposite
Well Ill own those initials have been something of a puzzle to people
One man declares theyre Merely Jokes but another not so friendly says they stand for Mostly Jealousy of more fortunate chaps who have real names for a handle
My small brothers and sisters discovering with the usual perspicacity of ones family on such matters that I never signed or called myself anything but M J dubbed me Mary Jane
And there you have it
Mary Jane
You
Arkwright smiled oddly
Oh well whats the difference
Would you deprive them of their innocent amusement
And they do so love that Mary Jane
Besides whats in a name anyway
he went on eyeing the glowing tip of the cigar between his fingers
 A rose by any other nameyouve heard that probably
Names dont always signify my dear fellow
For instance I know a Billybut hes a girl
Calderwell gave a sudden start
You dont mean BillyNeilson
The other turned sharply
Do you know Billy Neilson
Calderwell gave his friend a glance from scornful eyes
Do I know Billy Neilson
he cried
Does a fellow usually know the girl hes proposed to regularly once in three months
Oh I know Im telling tales out of school of course he went on in response to the look that had come into the brown eyes opposite
But whats the use
Everybody knows itthat knows us
Billy herself got so she took it as a matter of courseand refused as a matter of course too just as she would refuse a serving of apple pie at dinner if she hadnt wanted it
Apple pie
scouted Arkwright
Calderwell shrugged his shoulders
My dear fellow you dont seem to realize it but for the last six months you have been assisting at the obsequies of a dead romance
Indeed
And is itburied yet
Oh no sighed Calderwell cheerfully
I shall go back one of these days Ill warrant and begin the same old game again though I will acknowledge that the last refusal was so very decided that its been a year almost since I received it
I think I was really convinced for a while thatthat she didnt want that apple pie he finished with a whimsical lightness that did not quite coincide with the stern lines that had come to his mouth
For a moment there was silence then Calderwell spoke again
Where did you knowMiss Billy
Oh I dont know her at all
I know of her through Aunt Hannah
Calderwell sat suddenly erect
Aunt Hannah
Is she your aunt too
Jove
This is a little old world after all isnt it
She isnt my aunt
Shes my mothers third cousin
None of us have seen her for years but she writes to mother occasionally and of course for some time now her letters have been running over full of Billy
She lives with her I believe doesnt she
She does rejoined Calderwell with an unexpected chuckle
I wonder if you know how she happened to live with her at first
Why no I reckon not
What do you mean
Calderwell chuckled again
Well Ill tell you
You being a Mary Jane ought to appreciate it
You see Billy was named for one William Henshaw her fathers chum who promptly forgot all about her
At eighteen Billy being left quite alone in the world wrote to Uncle William and asked to come and live with him
Well
But it wasnt well
William was a fortyyear old widower who lived with two younger brothers an old butler and a Chinese cook in one of those funny old Beacon Street houses in Boston
The Strata Bertram called it
Bright boyBertram
The Strata
Yes
I wish you could see that house Arkwright
Its a regular layer cake
Cyrilhes the second brother must be thirtyfour or five nowlives on the top floor in a rugless curtainless musicmad existencejust a plain crank
Below him comes William
William collects things everything from tenpenny nails to teapots I should say and theyre all there in his rooms
Farther down somewhere comes Bertram
Hes the Bertram Henshaw you understand the artist
Not the FaceofaGirl Henshaw
The same only of course four years ago he wasnt quite so well known as he is now
Well to resume and go on
It was into this house this masculine paradise ruled over by Pete and Dong Ling in the kitchen that Billys naive request for a home came
Great Scott
breathed Arkwright appreciatively
Yes
Well the letter was signed Billy
They took her for a boy naturally and after something of a struggle they agreed to let him come
For his particular delectation they fixed up a room next to Bertram with guns and fishing rods and such ladylike specialties and William went to the station to meet the boy
With never a suspicion
With never a suspicion
Gorry
Well he came and she conquered
I guess things were lively for a while though
Oh there was a kitten too I believe Spunk who added to the gayety of nations
But what did the Henshaws do
Well I wasnt there of course but Bertram says they spun around like tops gone mad for a time but finally quieted down enough to summon a married sister for immediate propriety and to establish Aunt Hannah for permanency the next day
So thats how it happened
Well by George
cried Arkwright
Yes nodded the other
So you see there are untold possibilities just in a name
Remember that
Just suppose you as Mary Jane should beg a home in a feminine householdsay in Miss Billys for instance
Id like to retorted Arkwright with sudden warmth
Calderwell stared a little
The other laughed shamefacedly
Oh its only that I happen to have a devouring curiosity to meet that special young lady
I sing her songs you know shes written some dandies
 Ive heard a lot about her and Ive seen her picture
He did not add that he had also purloined that same picture from his mothers bureauthe picture being a gift from Aunt Hannah
So you see I would indeed like to occupy a corner in the fair Miss Billys household
I could write to Aunt Hannah and beg a home with her you know eh
Of course
Why dont youMary Jane
laughed Calderwell
Billyd take you all right
Shes had a little Miss Hawthorn a music teacher there for months
Shes always doing stunts of that sort
Belle writes me that shes had a dozen forlornites there all this last summer two or three at a timetired widows lonesome old maids and crippled kidsjust to give them a royal good time
So you see shed take you without a doubt
Jove
what a pair youd make Miss Billy and Mr Mary Jane
Youd drive the suffragettes into conniption fitsjust by the sound of you
Arkwright laughed quietly then he frowned
But how about it
he asked
I thought she was keeping house with Aunt Hannah
Didnt she stay at all with the Henshaws
Oh yes a few months
I never knew just why she did leave but I fancied from something Billy herself said once that she discovered she was creating rather too much of an upheaval in the Strata
So she took herself off
She went to school and travelled considerably
She was over here when I met her first
After that she was with us all one summer on the yacht
A couple of years ago or so she went back to Boston bought a house and settled down with Aunt Hannah
And shes not marriedor even engaged
Wasnt the last I heard
I havent seen her since December and Ive heard from her only indirectly
She corresponds with my sister and so do Iintermittently
I heard a month ago from Belle and she had a letter from Billy in August
But I heard nothing of any engagement
How about the Henshaws
I should think there might be a chance there for a romance a charming girl and three unattached men
Calderwell gave a slow shake of the head
I dont think so
William islet me see nearly fortyfive I guess by this time and he isnt a marrying man
He buried his heart with his wife and baby years ago
Cyril according to Bertram hates women and all other confusion so that ought to let him out
As for Bertram himselfBertram is only Bertram
Hes always been that
Bertram loves girlsto paint but I cant imagine him making serious love to any one
It would always be the tilt of a chin or the turn of a cheek that he was admiringto paint
No theres no chance for a romance there Ill warrant
But theresyourself
Calderwells eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch
Oh of course
I presume January or February will find me back there he admitted with a sigh and a shrug
Then a little bitterly he added No Arkwright
I shall keep away if I can
I know theres no chance for menow
Then youll leave me a clear field
bantered the other
Of courseMary Jane  retorted Calderwell with equal lightness
Thank you
Oh you neednt laughed Calderwell
My giving you the right of way doesnt insure you a thoroughfare for yourselfthere are others you know
Billy Neilson has had sighing swains about I her I imagine since she could walk and talk
She is a wonderfully fascinating little bit of femininity and she has a heart of pure gold
All is I envy the man who wins itfor the man who wins that wins her
There was no answer
Arkwright sat with his eyes on the moving throng outside the window near them
Perhaps he had not heard
At all events when he spoke some time later it was of a matter far removed from Miss Billy Neilson or the way to her heart
Nor was the young lady mentioned between them again that day
Long hours later just before parting for the night Arkwright said Calderwell Im sorry but I believe after all I cant take that trip to the lakes with you
I Im going home next week
Home
Hang it Arkwright
Id counted on you
Isnt this rather sudden
Yes and no
Ill own Ive been drifting about with you contentedly enough for the last six months to make you think mountainclimbing and boatpaddling were the end and aim of my existence
But they arent you know really
Nonsense
At heart youre as much of a vagabond as I am and you know it
Perhaps
But unfortunately I dont happen to carry your pocketbook
You may if you like
Ill hand it over any time grinned Calderwell
Thanks
You know well enough what I mean shrugged the other
There was a moments silence then Calderwell queried Arkwright how old are you
Twentyfour
Good
Then youre merely travelling to supplement your education see
Oh yes I see
But something besides my education has got to be supplemented now I reckon
What are you going to do
There was an almost imperceptible hesitation then a little shortly came the answer Hit the trail for Grand Opera and bring up probablyin vaudeville
Calderwell smiled appreciatively
You can sing like the devil he admitted
Thanks returned his friend with uplifted eyebrows
Do you mind calling it an angel just for this occasion
Oh the matineegirls will do that fast enough
But I say Arkwright what are you going to do with those initials then
Let em alone
Oh no you wont
And you wont be Mary Jane either
Imagine a Mary Jane in Grand Opera
I know what youll be
Youll be Senor Martini Johnini Arkwrightino
By the way you didnt say what that M
J
really did stand for hinted Calderwell shamelessly  Merely Jokesin your estimation evidently shrugged the other
But my going isnt a joke Calderwell
Im really going
And Im going to work
Buthow shall you manage
Time will tell
Calderwell frowned and stirred restlessly in his chair
But honestly now toto follow that trail of yours will take money
Ander a faint red stole to his foreheaddont they have erpatrons for these young and budding geniuses
Why cant I have a hand in this trail too or maybe youd call it a foot eh
Id be no end glad to Arkwright
Thanks old man
The red was duplicated this time above the brown silky beard
That was mighty kind of you and I appreciate it but it wont be necessary
A generous but perhaps misguided bachelor uncle left me a few thousands a year or so ago and Im going to put them all down my throator rather into itbefore I give up
Where you going to study
New York
Again there was an almost imperceptible hesitation before the answer came
Im not quite prepared to say
Why not try it here
Arkwright shook his head
I did plan to when I came over but Ive changed my mind
I believe Id rather work while longer in America
Hmm murmured Calderwell
There was a brief silence followed by other questions and other answers after which the friends said good night
In his own room as he was dropping off to sleep Calderwell muttered drowsily By George
I havent found out yet what that blamed M
J
stands for
CHAPTER II AUNT HANNAH GETS A LETTER In the cozy livingroom at Hillside Billy Neilsons pretty home on Corey Hill Billy herself sat writing at the desk
Her pen had just traced the date October twentyfifth when Mrs Stetson entered with a letter in her hand
Writing my dear
Then dont let me disturb you
She turned as if to go
Billy dropped her pen sprang to her feet flew to the little womans side and whirled her half across the room
There
she exclaimed as she plumped the breathless and scandalized Aunt Hannah into the biggest easy chair
I feel better
I just had to let off steam some way
Its so lovely you came in just when you did
Indeed
IIm not so sure of that stammered the lady dropping the letter into her lap and patting with agitated fingers her cap her curls the two shawls about her shoulders and the lace at her throat
My grief and conscience Billy
Worst you ever grow up
Hope not purred Billy cheerfully dropping herself on to a low hassock at Aunt Hannahs feet
But my dear youyoure engaged
Billy bubbled into a chuckling laugh
As if I didnt know that when Ive just written a dozen notes to announce it
And oh Aunt Hannah such a time as Ive had telling what a dear Bertram is and how I love love love him and what beautiful eyes he has and such a nose and Billy
Aunt Hannah was sitting erect in pale horror
Eh
Billys eyes were roguish
You didnt write that in those notes
Write it
Oh no
Thats only what I wanted to write chuckled Billy
What I really did write was as staid and proper ashere let me show you she broke off springing to her feet and running over to her desk
There
this is about what I wrote to them all she finished whipping a note out of one of the unsealed envelopes on the desk and spreading it open before Aunt Hannahs suspicious eyes
Hmm that is very goodfor you admitted the lady
Well I like thatafter all my stern self control and selfsacrifice to keep out all those things I wanted to write bridled Billy
Besides theyd have been ever so much more interesting reading than these will be she pouted as she took the note from her companions hand
I dont doubt it observed Aunt Hannah dryly
Billy laughed and tossed the note back on the desk
Im writing to Belle Calderwell now she announced musingly dropping herself again on the hassock
I suppose shell tell Hugh
Poor boy
Hell be disappointed
Billy sighed but she uptilted her chin a little
He ought not to be
I told him long long ago the very first time thatthat I couldnt
I know dear butthey dont always understand
Aunt Hannah sighed in sympathy with the faraway Hugh Calderwell as she looked down at the bright young face near her
There was a moments silence then Billy gave a little laugh
He will be surprised she said
He told me once that Bertram wouldnt ever care for any girl except to paint
To paint indeed
As if Bertram didnt love mejust meif he never saw another tube of paint
I think he does my dear
Again there was silence then from Billys lips there came softly Just think weve been engaged almost four weeksand tomorrow itll be announced
Im so glad I didnt ever announce the other two
The other two cried Aunt Hannah
Billy laughed
Oh I forgot
You didnt know about Cyril
Cyril
Oh there didnt anybody know it either not even Cyril himself dimpled Billy mischievously
I just engaged myself to him in imagination you know to see how Id like it
I didnt like it
But it didnt last anyhow very long just three weeks I believe
Then I broke it off she finished with unsmiling mouth but dancing eyes
Billy
protested Aunt Hannah feebly
But I am glad only the family knew about my engagement to Uncle Williamoh Aunt Hannah you dont know how good it does seem to call him Uncle again
It was always slipping out anyhow all the time we were engaged and of course it was awful then
That only goes to prove my dear how entirely unsuitable it was from the start
A bright color flooded Billys face
I know but if a girl will think a man is asking for a wife when all he wants is a daughter and if she blandly says Yes thank you Ill marry you I dont know what you can expect
You can expect just what you gotmisery and almost a tragedy retorted Aunt Hannah severely
A tender light came into Billys eyes
Dear Uncle William
What a jewel he was all the way through
And hed have marched straight to the altar too with never a flicker of an eyelid I knowselfsacrificing martyr that he was
Martyr
bristled Aunt Hannah with extraordinary violence for her
Im thinking that term belonged somewhere else
A month ago Billy Neilson you did not look as if youd live out half your days
But I suppose youd have gone to the altar too with never a flicker of an eyelid
But I thought I had to protested Billy
I couldnt grieve Uncle William so after Mrs Hartwell had said how hehe wanted me
Aunt Hannahs lips grew stern at the corners
There are times whenwhen I think it would be wiser if Mrs Kate Hartwell would attend to her own affairs
Aunt Hannahs voice fairly shook with wrath
WhyAunt Hannah
reproved Billy in mischievous horror
Im shocked at you
Aunt Hannah flushed miserably
There there child forget I said it
I ought not to have said it of course she murmured agitatedly
Billy laughed
You should have heard what Uncle William said
But never mind
We all found out the mistake before it was too late and everything is lovely now even to Cyril and Marie
Did you ever see anything so beatifically happy as that couple are
Bertram says he hasnt heard a dirge from Cyrils rooms for three weeks and that if anybody else played the kind of music hes been playing it would be just common garden ragtime
Music
Oh my grief and conscience
That makes me think Billy
If Im not actually forgetting what I came in here for cried Aunt Hannah fumbling in the folds of her dress for the letter that had slipped from her lap
Ive had word from a young niece
Shes going to study music in Boston
A niece
Well not really you know
She calls me Aunt just as you and the Henshaw boys do
But I really am related to her for her mother and I are third cousins while it was my husband who was distantly related to the Henshaw family
Whats her name
 Mary Jane Arkwright
Where is that letter
Here it is on the floor reported Billy
Were you going to read it to me
she asked as she picked it up
Yesif you dont mind
Id love to hear it
Then Ill read it
Itit rather annoys me in some ways
I thought the whole family understood that I wasnt living by myself any longer that I was living with you
Im sure I thought I wrote them that long ago
But this sounds almost as if they didnt understand itat least as if this girl didnt
How old is she
I dont know but she must be some old to be coming here to Boston to study music alone singing I think she said
You dont remember her then
Aunt Hannah frowned and paused the letter half withdrawn from its envelope
Nobut that isnt strange
They live West
I havent seen any of them for years
I know there are several childrenand I suppose Ive been told their names
I know theres a boythe eldest I thinkwho is quite a singer and theres a girl who paints I believe but I dont seem to remember a Mary Jane
 Never mind
Suppose we let Mary Jane speak for herself suggested Billy dropping her chin into the small pink cup of her hand and settling herself to listen
Very well sighed Aunt Hannah and she opened the letter and began to read
DEAR AUNT HANNAHThis is to tell you that Im coming to Boston to study singing in the school for Grand Opera and Im planning to look you up
Do you object
I said to a friend the other day that Id half a mind to write to Aunt Hannah and beg a home with her and my friend retorted Why dont you Mary Jane
But that of course I should not think of doing
But I know I shall be lonesome Aunt Hannah and I hope youll let me see you once in a while anyway
I plan now to come next week Ive already got as far as New York as you see by the addressand I shall hope to see you soon
All the family would send love I know
M J
ARKWRIGHT
Grand Opera
Oh how perfectly lovely cried Billy
Yes but Billy do you think she is expecting me to invite her to make her home with me
I shall have to write and explain that I cant if she does of course
Billy frowned and hesitated
Why it soundeda littlethat way but Suddenly her face cleared
Aunt Hannah Ive thought of the very thing
We will take her
Oh Billy I couldnt think of letting you do that demurred Aunt Hannah
Youre very kindbut oh no not that
Why not
I think it would be lovely and we can just as well as not
After Marie is married in December she can have that room
Until then she can have the little blue room next to me
Butbutwe dont know anything about her
We know shes your niece and shes lonesome and we know shes musical
I shall love her for every one of those things
Of course well take her
ButI dont know anything about her age
All the more reason why she should be looked out for then retorted Billy promptly
Why Aunt Hannah just as if you didnt want to give this lonesome unprotected young girl a home
Oh I do of course but Then its all settled interposed Billy springing to her feet
But what if wewe shouldnt like her
Nonsense
What if she shouldnt like us
laughed Billy
However if youd feel better just ask her to come and stay with us a month
We shall keep her all right afterwards
See if we dont
Slowly Aunt Hannah got to her feet
Very well dear
Ill write of course as you tell me to and its lovely of you to do it
Now Ill leave you to your letters
Ive hindered you far too long as it is
Youve rested me declared Billy flinging wide her arms
Aunt Hannah fearing a second dizzying whirl impelled by those same young arms drew her shawls about her shoulders and backed hastily toward the hall door
Billy laughed
Oh I wont againtoday she promised merrily
Then as the lady reached the arched doorway Tell Mary Jane to let us know the day and train and well meet her
Oh and Aunt Hannah tell her to wear a pinka white pink and tell her we will too she finished gayly
CHAPTER III BILLY AND BERTRAM Bertram called that evening
Before the open fire in the livingroom he found a pensive Billy awaiting hima Billy who let herself be kissed it is true and who even kissed back shyly adorably but a Billy who looked at him with wide almost frightened eyes
Why darling whats the matter
he demanded his own eyes growing wide and frightened
Bertram itsdone
Whats done
What do you mean
Our engagement
Itsannounced
I wrote stacks of notes today and even now there are some left for tomorrow
And then theresthe newspapers
Bertram right away now everybody will know it
Her voice was tragic
Bertram relaxed visibly
A tender light came to his eyes
Well didnt you expect everybody would know it my dear
Yyes but At her hesitation the tender light changed to a quick fear
Billy you arentsorry
The pink glory that suffused her face answered him before her words did
Sorry
Oh never Bertram
Its only that it wont be ours any longerthat is it wont belong to just our two selves
Everybody will know it
And theyll bow and smile and say How lovely
to our faces and Did you ever
to our backs
Oh no Im not sorry Bertram but I amafraid
AfraidBilly
Yes
Billy sighed and gazed with pensive eyes into the fire
Across Bertrams face swept surprise consternation and dismay
Bertram had thought he knew Billy in all her moods and fancies but he did not know her in this one
Why Billy
he breathed
Billy drew another sigh
It seemed to come from the very bottoms of her small satinslippered feet
Well I am
Youre the Bertram Henshaw
You know lots and lots of people that I never even saw
And theyll come and stand around and stare and lift their lorgnettes and say Is that the one
Dear me
 Bertram gave a relieved laugh
Nonsense sweetheart
I should think you were a picture Id painted and hung on a wall
I shall feel as if I werewith all those friends of yours
Bertram what if they dont like it
Her voice had grown tragic again
Like it
Yes
The pictureme I mean
They cant help liking it he retorted with the prompt certainty of an adoring lover
Billy shook her head
Her eyes had gone back to the fire
Oh yes they can
I can hear them
What sheBertram Henshaws wifea frivolous inconsequential Billy like that
Bertram
Billy turned fiercely despairing eyes on her loverBertram sometimes I wish my name were Clarissa Cordelia or Arabella Maud or Hannah Janeanything thats feminine and proper
Bertrams ringing laugh brought a faint smile to Billys lips
But the words that followed the laugh and the caressing touch of the mans hands sent a flood of shy color to her face
 Hannah Jane indeed
As if Id exchange my Billy for her or any Clarissa or Arabella that ever grew
I adore Billyflame nature and And naughtiness
put in Billy herself
Yesif there be any laughed Bertram fondly
But see he added taking a tiny box from his pocket see what Ive brought for this same Billy to wear
Shed have had it long ago if she hadnt insisted on waiting for this announcement business
Oh Bertram what a beauty
dimpled Billy as the flawless diamond in Bertrams fingers caught the light and sent it back in a flash of flame and crimson
Now you are minereally mine sweetheart
The mans voice and hand shook as he slipped the ring on Billys outstretched finger
Billy caught her breath with almost a sob
And Im so glad to beyours dear she murmured brokenly
Andand Ill make you proud that I am yours even if I am just Billy  she choked
Oh I know Ill write such beautiful beautiful songs now
The man drew her into a close embrace
As if I cared for that he scoffed lovingly
Billy looked up in quick horror
Why Bertram you dont mean you dont care
He laughed lightly and took the dismayed little face between his two hands
Care darling
of course I care
You know how I love your music
I care about everything that concerns you
I meant that Im proud of you nowjust you
I love you you know
There was a moments pause
Billys eyes as they looked at him carried a curious intentness in their dark depths
You mean you likethe turn of my head and the tilt of my chin
she asked a little breathlessly
I adore them
came the prompt answer
To Bertrams utter amazement Billy drew back with a sharp cry
No nonot that
Why Billy Billy laughed unexpectedly then she sighed
Oh its all right of course she assured him hastily
Its only Billy stopped and blushed
Billy was thinking of what Hugh Calderwell had once said to her that Bertram Henshaw would never love any girl seriously that it would always be the turn of her head or the tilt of her chin that he lovedto paint
Well only what
demanded Bertram
Billy blushed the more deeply but she gave a light laugh
Nothing only something Hugh Calderwell said to me once
You see Bertram I dont think Hugh ever thought you wouldmarry
Oh didnt he
bridled Bertram
Well that only goes to show how much he knows about it
Erdid you announce itto him
Bertrams voice was almost savage now
Billy smiled
No but I did to his sister and shell tell him
Oh Bertram such a time as I had over those notes went on Billy with a chuckle
Her eyes were dancing and she was seeming more like her usual self Bertram thought
You see there were such a lot of things I wanted to say about what a dear you were and how much II liked you and that you had such lovely eyes and a nose Billy
This time it was Bertram who was sitting erect in pale horror
Billy threw him a roguish glance
Goosey
You are as bad as Aunt Hannah
I said that was what I wanted to say
What I really said wasquite another matter she finished with a saucy uptilting of her chin
Bertram relaxed with a laugh
You witch
His admiring eyes still lingered on her face
Billy Im going to paint you sometime in just that pose
Youre adorable
Pooh
Just another face of a girl teased the adorable one
Bertram gave a sudden exclamation
There
And I havent told you yet
Guess what my next commission is
To paint a portrait
Yes
Cant
Who is it
J G Winthrops daughter
Not the J G
Winthrop
The same
Oh Bertram how splendid
Isnt it
And then the girl herself
Have you seen her
But you havent I know unless you met her abroad
She hasnt been in Boston for years until now
No I havent seen her
Is she so very beautiful
Billy spoke a little soberly
Yesand no
The artist lifted his head alertly
What Billy called his painting look came to his face
It isnt that her features are so regularthough her mouth and chin are perfect
But her face has so much character and theres an elusive something about her eyes Jove
If I can only catch it itll be the best thing yet that Ive ever done Billy
Will it
Im so gladand youll get it I know you will claimed Billy clearing her throat a little nervously
I wish I felt so sure sighed Bertram
But itll be a great thing if I do get itJ G Winthrops daughter you know besides the merit of the likeness itself
Yes yes indeed
Billy cleared her throat again
Youve seen her of course lately
Oh yes
I was there half the morning discussing the detailssittings and costume and deciding on the pose
Did you find oneto suit
Find one
The artist made a despairing gesture
I found a dozen that I wanted
The trouble was to tell which I wanted the most
Billy gave a nervous little laugh
Isnt thatunusual
she asked
Bertram lifted his eyebrows with a quizzical smile
Well they arent all Marguerite Winthrops he reminded her
Marguerite
cried Billy
Oh is her name Marguerite
I do think Marguerite is the dearest name
Billys eyes and voice were wistful
I dontnot the dearest
Oh its all well enough of course but it cant be compared for a moment towell say Billy
Billy smiled but she shook her head
Im afraid youre not a good judge of names she objected
Yes I am though for that matter I should love your name no matter what it was
Even if twas Mary Jane eh
bantered Billy
Well youll have a chance to find out how you like that name pretty quick sir
Were going to have one here
Youre going to have a Mary Jane here
Do you mean that Rosas going away
Mercy
I hope not shuddered Billy
You dont find a Rosa in every kitchenand never in employment agencies
My Mary Jane is a niece of Aunt Hannahsor rather a cousin
Shes coming to Boston to study music and Ive invited her here
Weve asked her for a month though I presume we shall keep her right along
Bertram frowned
Well of course thats very nice forMary Jane he sighed with meaning emphasis
Billy laughed
Dont worry dear
She wont bother us any
Oh yes she will sighed Bertram
Shell be roundlots you see if she isnt
Billy I think sometimes youre almost too kindto other folks
Never
laughed Billy
Besides what would you have me do when a lonesome young girl was coming to Boston
Anyhow youre not the one to talk young man
Ive known you to take in a lonesome girl and give her a home she flashed merrily
Bertram chuckled
Jove
What a time that was
he exclaimed regarding his companion with fond eyes
And Spunk too
Is she going to bring a Spunk
Not that Ive heard smiled Billy but she is going to wear a pink
Not really Billy
Of course she is
I told her to
How do you suppose we could know her when we saw her if she didnt
demanded the girl indignantly
And what is more sir there will be two pinks worn this time
I shant do as Uncle William did and leave off my pink
Only think what long minutes that seemed hours of miseryI spent waiting there in that trainshed just because I didnt know which man was my Uncle William
Bertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders
Well your Mary Jane wont probably turn out to be quite such a bombshell as our Billy didunless she should prove to be a boy he added whimsically
Oh but Billy she cant turn out to be such a dear treasure finished the man
And at the adoring look in his eyes Billy blushed deeplyand promptly forgot all about Mary Jane and her pink
CHAPTER IV FOR MARY JANE I have a letter here from Mary Jane my dear announced Aunt Hannah at the luncheon table one day
Have you
Billy raised interested eyes from her own letters
What does she say
She will be here Thursday
Her train is due at the South Station at fourthirty
She seems to be very grateful to you for your offer to let her come right here for a month but she says shes afraid you dont realize perhaps just what you are doingto take her in like that with her singing and all
Nonsense
She doesnt refuse does she
Oh no she doesnt refusebut she doesnt accept either exactly as I can see
Ive read the letter over twice too
Ill let you judge for yourself by and by when you have time to read it
Billy laughed
Never mind
I dont want to read it
Shes just a little shy about coming thats all
Shell stay all right when we come to meet her
What time did you say it was Thursday
Half past four South Station
Thursday at half past four
Let me see thats the day of the Carletons At Home isnt it
Oh my grief and conscience yes
But I had forgotten it
What shall we do
Oh that will be easy
Well just go to the Carletons early and have John wait then take us from there to the South Station
Meanwhile well make sure that the little blue room is all ready for her
I put in my white enamel workbasket yesterday and that pretty little blue case for hairpins and curling tongs that I bought at the fair
I want the room to look homey to her you know
As if it could look any other way if you had anything to do with it sighed Aunt Hannah admiringly
Billy laughed
If we get stranded we might ask the Henshaw boys to help us out Aunt Hannah
Theyd probably suggest guns and swords
Thats the way they fixed up my room
Aunt Hannah raised shocked hands of protest
As if we would
Mercy what a time that was
Billy laughed again
I never shall forget never my first glimpse of that room when Mrs Hartwell switched on the lights
Oh Aunt Hannah I wish you could have seen it before they took out those guns and spiders
As if I didnt see quite enough when I saw Williams face that morning he came for me
retorted Aunt Hannah spiritedly
Dear Uncle William
What an old saint he has been all the way through mused Billy aloud
And Cyrilwho would ever have believed that the day would come when Cyril would say to me as he did last night that he felt as if Marie had been gone a month
Its been just seven days you know
I know
She comes tomorrow doesnt she
Yes and Im glad
I shall tell Marie she neednt leave Cyril on my hands again
Bertram says that at home Cyril hasnt played a dirge since his engagement but I notice that up here where Marie might be but isnthis tunes would never be mistaken for ragtime
By the way she added as she rose from the table thats another surprise in store for Hugh Calderwell
He always declared that Cyril wasnt a marrying man either any more than Bertram
You know he said Bertram only cared for girls to paint but She stopped and looked inquiringly at Rosa who had appeared at that moment in the hall doorway
Its the telephone Miss Neilson
Mr Bertram Henshaw wants you
A few minutes later Aunt Hannah heard Billy at the piano
For fifteen twenty thirty minutes the brilliant scales and arpeggios rippled through the rooms and up the stairs to Aunt Hannah who knew by the very sound of them that some unusual nervousness was being worked off at the finger tips that played them
At the end of forty five minutes Aunt Hannah went downstairs
Billy my dear excuse me but have you forgotten what time it is
Werent you going out with Bertram
Billy stopped playing at once but she did not turn her head
Her fingers busied themselves with some music on the piano
We arent going Aunt Hannah she said
Bertram cant
Cant Well he didnt want toso of course I said not to
Hes been painting this morning on a new portrait and she said he might stay to luncheon and keep right on for a while this afternoon if he liked
Andhe did like so he stayed
Why howhow Aunt Hannah stopped helplessly
Oh no not at all interposed Billy lightly
He told me all about it the other night
Its going to be a very wonderful portrait and of course I wouldnt want to interfere withhis work
And again a brilliant scale rippled from Billys fingers after a crashing chord in the bass
Slowly Aunt Hannah turned and went upstairs
Her eyes were troubled
Not since Billys engagement had she heard Billy play like that
Bertram did not find a pensive Billy awaiting him that evening
He found a brighteyed flushedcheeked Billy who let herself be kissed oncebut who did not kiss back a blithe elusive Billy who played tripping little melodies and sang jolly little songs instead of sitting before the fire and talking a Billy who at last turned and asked tranquilly Well how did the picture go
Bertram rose then crossed the room and took Billy very gently into his arms
Sweetheart you were a dear this noon to let me off like that he began in a voice shaken with emotion
You dont know perhaps exactly what you did
You see I was nearly wild between wanting to be with you and wanting to go on with my work
And I was just at that point where one little word from you one hint that you wanted me to come anywayand I should have come
But you didnt say it nor hint it
Like the brave little bit of inspiration that you are you bade me stay and go on with my work
The inspirations head drooped a little lower but this only brought a wealth of soft bronze hair to just where Bertram could lay his cheek against itand Bertram promptly took advantage of his opportunity
And so I stayed Billy and I did good work I know I did good work
Why BillyBertram stepped back now and held Billy by the shoulders at arms lengthBilly thats going to be the best work Ive ever done
I can see it coming even now under my fingers
Billy lifted her head and looked into her lovers face
His eyes were glowing
His cheeks were flushed
His whole countenance was aflame with the soul of the artist who sees his vision taking shape before him
And Billy looking at him felt suddenlyashamed
Oh Bertram Im proud proud proud of you
she breathed
Come lets go over to the fireand talk
CHAPTER V MARIE SPEAKS HER MIND Billy with John and Peggy met Marie Hawthorn at the station
Peggy was short for Pegasus and was what Billy always called her luxurious sevenseated touring car
I simply wont call it automobile  she had declared when she bought it
In the first place it takes too long to say it and in the second place I dont want to add one more to the nineteen different ways to pronounce it that I hear all around me every day now
As for calling it my car or my motor carI should expect to see a Pullman or one of those huge black trucks before my door if I ordered it by either of those names
Neither will I insult the beautiful thing by calling it a machine
Its name is Pegasus
I shall call it Peggy
 And Peggy she called it
John sniffed his disdain and Billys friends made no secret of their amused tolerance but in an astonishingly short time half the automobile owners of her acquaintance were calling their own cars Peggy and even the dignified John himself was heard to order some gasoline for Peggy quite as a matter of course
When Marie Hawthorn stepped from the train at the North Station she greeted Billy with affectionate warmth though at once her blue eyes swept the space beyond expectantly and eagerly
Billys lips curved in a mischievous smile
No he didnt come she said
He didnt want toa little bit
Marie grew actually pale
Didnt want to
she stammered
Billy gave her a spasmodic hug
Goosey
No he didnta little bit but he did a great big bit
As if you didnt know he was dying to come Marie
But he simply couldntsomething about his concert Monday night
He told me over the telephone but between his joy that you were coming and his rage that he couldnt see you the first minute you did come I couldnt quite make out what was the trouble
But hes coming to dinner tonight so hell doubtless tell you all about it
Marie sighed her relief
Oh thats all right then
I was afraid he was sickwhen I didnt see him
Billy laughed softly
No he isnt sick Marie but you neednt go away again before the weddingnot to leave him on my hands
I wouldnt have believed Cyril Henshaw confirmed old bachelor and avowed womanhater could have acted the part of a lovesick boy as he has the last week or two
The roseflush on Maries cheek spread to the roots of her fine yellow hair
Billy dear hehe didnt
Marie dearhehe did
Marie laughed
She did not say anything but the roseflush deepened as she occupied herself very busily in getting her trunkcheck from the little hand bag she carried
Cyril was not mentioned again until the two girls veils tied and coats buttoned were snugly ensconced in the tonneau and Peggys nose was turned toward home
Then Billy asked Have you settled on where youre going to live
Not quite
Were going to talk of that tonight but we do know that we arent going to live at the Strata
Marie
Marie stirred uneasily at the obvious disappointment and reproach in her friends voice
But dear it wouldnt be wise Im sure she argued hastily
There will be you and Bertram We shant be there for a year nearly cut in Billy with swift promptness
Besides I think it would be lovelyall together
Marie smiled but she shook her head
Lovelybut not practical dear
Billy laughed ruefully
I know youre worrying about those puddings of yours
Youre afraid somebody is going to interfere with your making quite so many as you want to and Cyril is worrying for fear therell be somebody else in the circle of his shaded lamp besides his little Marie with the light on her hair and the mending basket by her side
Billy what are you talking about
Billy threw a roguish glance into her friends amazed blue eyes
Oh just a little picture Cyril drew once for me of what home meant for him a room with a table and a shaded lamp and a little woman beside it with the light on her hair and a great basket of sewing by her side
Maries eyes softened
Did he saythat
Yes
Oh he declared he shouldnt want her to sit under that lamp all the time of course but he hoped shed like that sort of thing
Marie threw a quick glance at the stolid back of John beyond the two empty seats in front of them
Although she knew he could not hear her words instinctively she lowered her voice
Did you knowthenaboutme
she asked with heightened color
No only that there was a girl somewhere who he hoped would sit under the lamp some day
And when I asked him if the girl did like that sort of thing he said yes he thought so for she had told him once that the things she liked best of all to do were to mend stockings and make puddings
Then I knew of course twas you for Id heard you say the same thing
So I sent him right along out to you in the summer house
The pink flush on Maries face grew to a red one
Her blue eyes turned again to Johns broad back then drifted to the long imposing line of windowed walls and doorways on the right
The automobile was passing smoothly along Beacon Street now with the Public Garden just behind them on the left
After a moment Marie turned to Billy again
Im so glad he wantsjust puddings and stockings she began a little breathlessly
You see for so long I supposed he wouldnt want anything but a very brilliant talented wife who could play and sing beautifully a wife hed be proud oflike you
Me
Nonsense
laughed Billy
Cyril never wanted me and I never wanted himonly once for a few minutes so to speak when I thought I did
In spite of our music we arent a mite congenial
I like people around he doesnt
I like to go to plays he doesnt
He likes rainy days and I abhor them
Mercy
Life with me for him would be one long jangling discord my love while with you itll be one long sweet song
Marie drew a deep breath
Her eyes were fixed on a point far ahead up the curveless street
I hope it will indeed
she breathed
Not until they were almost home did Billy say suddenly Oh did Cyril write you
A young relative of Aunt Hannahs is coming tomorrow to stay a while at the house
Eryes Cyril told me admitted Marie
Billy smiled
Didnt like it I suppose eh
she queried shrewdly
Nno Im afraid he didntvery well 
He said shed beone more to be around
There what did I tell you
dimpled Billy
You can see what youre coming to when you do get that shaded lamp and the mending basket
A moment later coming in sight of the house Billy saw a tall smoothshaven man standing on the porch
The man lifted his hat and waved it gayly baring a slightly bald head to the sun
Its Uncle Williambless his heart
cried Billy
Theyre all coming to dinner then he and Aunt Hannah and Bertram and I are going down to the Hollis Street Theatre and let you and Cyril have a taste of what that shaded lamp is going to be
I hope you wont be lonesome she finished mischievously as the car drew up before the door
CHAPTER VI AT THE SIGN OF THE PINK After a week of beautiful autumn weather Thursday dawned raw and cold
By noon an east wind had made the temperature still more uncomfortable
At two oclock Aunt Hannah tapped at Billys chamber door
She showed a troubled face to the girl who answered her knock
Billy would you mind very much if I asked you to go alone to the Carletons and to meet Mary Jane
she inquired anxiously
Why nothat is of course I should mind dear because I always like to have you go to places with me
But it isnt necessary
You arent sick are you
Nno not exactly but I have been sneezing all the morning and taking camphor and sugar to break it upif it is a cold
But it is so raw and Novemberish out that Why of course you shant go you poor dear
Mercy
dont get one of those dreadful colds on to you before the wedding
Have you felt a draft
Wheres another shawl
Billy turned and cast searching eyes about the roomBilly always kept shawls everywhere for Aunt Hannahs shoulders and feet
Bertram had been known to say indeed that a room according to Aunt Hannah was not fully furnished unless it contained from one to four shawls assorted as to size and warmth
Shawls certainly did seem to be a necessity with Aunt Hannah as she usually wore from one to three at the same timewhich again caused Bertram to declare that he always counted Aunt Hannahs shawls when he wished to know what the thermometer was
No Im not cold and I havent felt a draft said Aunt Hannah now
I put on my thickest gray shawl this morning with the little pink one for downstairs and the blue one for breakfast so you see Ive been very careful
But I have sneezed six times so I think twould be safer not to go out in this east wind
You were going to stop for Mrs Granger anyway werent you
So youll have her with you for the tea
Yes dear dont worry
Ill take your cards and explain to Mrs Carleton and her daughters
And of course as far as Mary Jane is concerned I dont know her any more than you do so I couldnt be any help there sighed Aunt Hannah
Not a bit smiled Billy cheerily
Dont give it another thought my dear
I shant have a bit of trouble
All Ill have to do is to look for a girl alone with a pink
Of course Ill have mine on too and shell be watching for me
So just run along and take your nap dear and be all rested and ready to welcome her when she comes finished Billy stooping to give the soft faintly pink cheek a warm kiss
Well thank you my dear perhaps I will sighed Aunt Hannah drawing the gray shawl about her as she turned away contentedly
Mrs Carletons tea that afternoon was for Billy not an occasion of unalloyed joy
It was the first time she had appeared at a gathering of any size since the announcement of her engagement and as she dolefully told Bertram afterwards she had very much the feeling of the picture hung on the wall
And they did put up their lorgnettes and say Is that the one
 she declared and I know some of them finished with Did you ever
too she sighed
But Billy did not stay long in Mrs Carletons softlylighted flowerperfumed rooms
At ten minutes past four she was saying goodby to a group of friends who were vainly urging her to remain longer
I cantI really cant she declared
Im due at the South Station at half past four to meet a Miss Arkwright a young cousin of Aunt Hannahs whom Ive never seen before
Were to meet at the sign of the pink she explained smilingly just touching the single flower she wore
Her hostess gave a sudden laugh
Let me see my dear if I remember rightly youve had experience before meeting at this sign of the pink
At least I have a very vivid recollection of Mr William Henshaws going once to meet a boy with a pink who turned out to be a girl
Now to even things up your girl should turn out to be a boy
Billy smiled and reddened
Perhapsbut I dont think today will strike the balance she retorted backing toward the door
This young ladys name is Mary Jane and Ill leave it to you to find anything very masculine in that
It was a short drive from Mrs Carletons Commonwealth Avenue home to the South Station and Peggy made as quick work of it as the narrow congested cross streets would allow
In ample time Billy found herself in the great waitingroom with John saying respectfully in her ear The man says the train comes in on Track Fourteen Miss an its on time
At twentynine minutes past four Billy left her seat and walked down the trainshed platform to Track Number Fourteen
She had pinned the pink now to the outside of her long coat and it made an attractive dash of white against the darkblue velvet
Billy was looking particularly lovely today
Framing her face was the big darkblue velvet picture hat with its becoming white plumes
During the brief minutes wait before the clanging locomotive puffed into view far down the long track Billys thoughts involuntarily went back to that other watcher beside a train gate not quite five years before
Dear Uncle William
she murmured tenderly
Then suddenly she laughedso nearly aloud that a man behind her gave her a covert glance from curious eyes
My
but what a jolt I must have been to Uncle William
Billy was thinking
The next minute she drew nearer the gate and regarded with absorbed attention the long line of passengers already sweeping up the narrow aisle between the cars
Hurrying men came first with long strides and eyes that looked straight ahead
These Billy let pass with a mere glance
The next group showed a sprinkling of womenwomen whose trig hats and linen collars spelled promptness as well as certainty of aim and accomplishment
To these also Billy paid scant attention
Couples came nextthe men anxiouseyed and usually walking two steps ahead of their companions the women plainly flustered and hurried and invariably buttoning gloves or gathering up trailing ends of scarfs or boas
The crowd was thickening fast now and Billys eyes were alert
Children were appearing and young women walking alone
One of these wore a bunch of violets
Billy gave her a second glance
Then she saw a pinkbut it was on the coat lapel of a tall young fellow with a brown beard so with a slight frown she looked beyond down the line
Old men came now and old women fleshy women and women with small children and babies
Couples came toodawdling couples plainly newly married the men were not two steps ahead and the womens gloves were buttoned and their furs in place
Gradually the line thinned and soon there were left only an old man with a cane and a young woman with three children
Yet nowhere had Billy seen a girl wearing a white carnation and walking alone
With a deeper frown on her face Billy turned and looked about her
She thought that somewhere in the crowd she had missed Mary Jane and that she would find her now standing near
But there was no one standing near except the goodlooking young fellow with the little pointed brown beard who as Billy noticed a second time was wearing a white carnation
As she glanced toward him their eyes met
Then to Billys unbounded amazement the man advanced with uplifted hat
I beg your pardon but is not thisMiss Neilson
Billy drew back with just a touch of hauteur
Yyes she murmured
I thought soyet I was expecting to see you with Aunt Hannah
I am M J Arkwright Miss Neilson
For a brief instant Billy stared dazedly
You dont meanMary Jane
she gasped
Im afraid I do
His lips twitched
But I thoughtwe were expecting She stopped helplessly
For one more brief instant she stared then suddenly a swift change came to her face
Her eyes danced
Ohoh
she chuckled
How perfectly funny
You have evened things up after all
To think that Mary Jane should be a She paused and flashed almost angrily suspicious eyes into his face
But mine was Billy  she cried
Your name isnt reallyMary Jane
I am often called that
His brown eyes twinkled but they did not swerve from their direct gaze into her own
But Billy hesitated and turned her eyes away
She saw then that many curious glances were already being flung in her direction
The color in her cheeks deepened
With an odd little gesture she seemed to toss something aside
Never mind she laughed a little hysterically
If youll pick up your bag please Mr Mary Jane and come with me
John and Peggy are waiting
OrI forgotyou have a trunk of course
The man raised a protesting hand
Thank you but Miss Neilson reallyI couldnt think of trespassing on your hospitality now you know
But wewe invited you stammered Billy
He shook his head
You invited Miss Mary Jane
Billy bubbled into low laughter
I beg your pardon but it is funny she sighed
You see I came once just the same way and now to have the tables turned like this
What will Aunt Hannah saywhat will everybody say
Come I want them to beginto say it she chuckled irrepressibly
Thank you but I shall go to a hotel of course
Later if youll be so good as to let me call and explain
But Im afraid Aunt Hannah will think Billy stopped abruptly
Some distance away she saw John coming toward them
She turned hurriedly to the man at her side
Her eyes still danced but her voice was mockingly serious
Really Mr Mary Jane Im afraid youll have to come to dinner then you can settle the rest with Aunt Hannah
John is almost upon us and I dont want to make explanations
Do you
John she said airily to the somewhat dazed chauffeur who had been told he was to meet a young woman take Mr Arkwrights bag please and show him where Peggy is waiting
It will be five minutes perhaps before I can come if youll kindly excuse me she added to Arkwright with a flashing glance from merry eyes
I have sometelephoning to do
All the way to the telephone booth Billy was trying to bring order out of the chaos of her mind but all the way too she was chuckling
To think that this thing should have happened to me she said almost aloud
And here I am telephoning just like Uncle WilliamBertram said Uncle William did telephone about me In due course Billy had Aunt Hannah at the other end of the wire
Aunt Hannah listen
Id never have believed it but its happened
Mary Jane isa man
Billy heard a dismayed gasp and a muttered Oh my grief and conscience
then a shaking Whaat
I say Mary Jane is a man
Billy was enjoying herself hugely
A maan Yes a great big man with a brown beard
Hes waiting now with John and I must go
But Billy I dont understand chattered an agitated voice over the line
Hehe called himself Mary Jane
He hasnt any business to be a big man with a brown beard
What shall we do
We dont want a big man with a brown beardhere
Billy laughed roguishly
I dont know
You asked him
How he will like that little blue roomAunt Hannah
Billys voice turned suddenly tragic
For pitys sake take out those curling tongs and hairpins and the workbasket
Id never hear the last of it if he saw those I know
Hes just that kind
A half stifled groan came over the wire
Billy he cant stay here
Billy laughed again
No no dear he wont I know
He says hes going to a hotel
But I had to bring him home to dinner there was no other way under the circumstances
He wont stay
Dont you worry
But goodby
I must go
Remember those curling tongs And the receiver clicked sharply against the hook
In the automobile some minutes later Billy and Mr M J Arkwright were speeding toward Corey Hill
It was during a slight pause in the conversation that Billy turned to her companion with a demure I telephoned Aunt Hannah Mr Arkwright
I thought she ought to bewarned
You are very kind
What did she sayif I may ask
There was a brief moment of hesitation before Billy answered
She said you called yourself Mary Jane and that you hadnt any business to be a big man with a brown beard
Arkwright laughed
Im afraid I owe Aunt Hannah an apology he said
He hesitated glanced admiringly at the glowing halfaverted face near him then went on decisively
He wore the air of a man who has set the match to his bridges
I signed both letters M J Arkwright but in the first one I quoted a remark of a friend and in that remark I was addressed as Mary Jane
I did not know but Aunt Hannah knew of the nickname
Arkwright was speaking a little slowly now as if weighing his words
But when she answered I saw that she did not for from something she said I realized that she thought I was a real Mary Jane
For the joke of the thing I let it pass
Butif she noticed my letter carefully she saw that I did not accept your kind invitation to give Mary Jane a home
Yes we noticed that nodded Billy merrily
But we didnt think you meant it
You see we pictured you as a shy young thing
But really she went on with a low laugh you see your coming as a masculine Mary Jane was particularly funnyfor me for though perhaps you didnt know it I came once to this very same city wearing a pink and was expected to be Billy a boy
And only today a lady warned me that your coming might even things up
But I didnt believe it woulda Mary Jane
Arkwright laughed
Again he hesitated and seemed to be weighing his words
Yes I heard about that coming of yours
I might almost saythats why Ilet the mistake pass in Aunt Hannahs letter he said
Billy turned with reproachful eyes
Oh how couldyou
But thenit was a temptation
She laughed suddenly
What sinful joy you must have had watching me hunt for Mary Jane
 I didnt acknowledged the other with unexpected candor
I feltashamed
And when I saw you were there alone without Aunt Hannah I came very near not speaking at alluntil I realized that that would be even worse under the circumstances
Of course it would smiled Billy brightly so I dont see but I shall have to forgive you after all
And here we are at home Mr Mary Jane
By the way what did you say that M
J
did stand for
she asked as the car came to a stop
The man did not seem to hear at least he did not answer
He was helping his hostess to alight
A moment later a plainly agitated Aunt Hannah her gray shawl topped with a huge black one opened the door of the house
CHAPTER VII OLD FRIENDS AND NEW At ten minutes before six on the afternoon of Arkwrights arrival Billy came into the living room to welcome the three Henshaw brothers who as was frequently the case were dining at Hillside
Bertram thought Billy had never looked prettier than she did this afternoon with the bronze sheen of her pretty house gown bringing out the bronze lights in her dark eyes and in the soft waves of her beautiful hair
Her countenance too carried a peculiar something that the artists eye was quick to detect and that the artists fingers tingled to put on canvas
Jove
Billy he said low in her ear as he greeted her I wish I had a brush in my hand this minute
Id have a Face of a Girl that would be worth while
Billy laughed and dimpled her appreciation but down in her heart she was conscious of a vague unrest
Billy wished sometimes that she did not so often seem to Bertrama picture
She turned to Cyril with outstretched hand
Oh yes Maries coming she smiled in answer to the quick shifting of Cyrils eyes to the hall doorway
And Aunt Hannah too
Theyre upstairs
And Mary Jane
demanded William a little anxiously Wills getting nervous volunteered Bertram airily
He wants to see Mary Jane
You see weve told him that we shall expect him to see that she doesnt bother us four too much you know
Hes expected always to remove her quietly but effectually whenever he sees that she is likely to interrupt a teteatete
Naturally then Will wants to see Mary Jane
Billy began to laugh hysterically
She dropped into a chair and raised both her hands palms outward
Dont dontplease dont
she choked or I shall die
Ive had all I can stand already
All you can stand
What do you mean
Is she soimpossible
This last was from Bertram spoken softly and with a hurried glance toward the hall
Billy dropped her hands and lifted her head
By heroic effort she pulled her face into sobriety all but her eyesand announced Mary Jane isa man
Whaat
A man Billy
Three masculine forms sat suddenly erect
Yes
Oh Uncle William I know now just how you feltI know I know gurgled Billy incoherently
There he stood with his pink just as I didonly he had a brown beard and he didnt have Spunkand I had to telephone to prepare folks just as you did
And the room the room
I fixed the room too she babbled breathlessly only I had curling tongs and hair pins in it instead of guns and spiders
Child child
what are you talking about
Williams face was red
A manMary Jane Cyril was merely cross
Billy what does this mean
Bertram had grown a little white
Billy began to laugh again yet she was plainly trying to control herself
Ill tell you
I must tell you
Aunt Hannah is keeping him upstairs so I can tell you she panted
But it was so funny when I expected a girl you know to see him with his brown beard and he was so tall and big
And of course it made me think how I came and was a girl when you expected a boy and Mrs Carleton had just said today that maybe this girl would even things up
Oh it was so funny
Billy mymy dear remonstrated Uncle William mildly
But what is his name
demanded Cyril
Did the creature sign himself Mary Jane
exploded Bertram
I dont know his name except that its M
J
and thats how he signed the letters
But he is called Mary Jane sometimes and in the letter he quoted somebodys speechIve forgotten just howbut in it he was called Mary Jane and of course Aunt Hannah took him for a girl explained Billy grown a little more coherent now
Didnt he write again
asked William
Yes
Well why didnt he correct the mistake then
demanded Bertram
Billy chuckled
He didnt want to I guess
He thought it was too good a joke
Joke
scoffed Cyril
But see here Billy he isnt going to live here now
Bertrams voice was almost savage
Oh no he isnt going to live herenow interposed smooth tones from the doorway
MrArkwright
breathed Billy confusedly
Three crimsonfaced men sprang to their feet
The situation for a moment threatened embarrassed misery for all concerned but Arkwright with a cheery smile advanced straight toward Bertram and held out a friendly hand
The proverbial fate of listeners he said easily but I dont blame you at all
No he isnt going to live here he went on grasping each brothers hand in turn as Billy murmured faint introductions and what is more he hereby asks everybodys pardon for the annoyance his little joke has caused
He might add that hes heartilyashamed of himself as well but if any of you Arkwright turned to the three tall men still standing by their chairs if any of you had suffered what he has at the hands of a swarm of youngsters for that names sake you wouldnt blame him for being tempted to get what fun he could out of Mary Janeif there ever came a chance
Naturally after this there could be nothing stiff or embarrassing
Billy laughed in relief and motioned Mr Arkwright to a seat near her
William said Of course of course
and shook hands again
Bertram and Cyril laughed shamefacedly and sat down
Somebody said But what does the M
J
stand for anyhow
Nobody answered this however perhaps because Aunt Hannah and Marie appeared just then in the doorway
Dinner proved to be a lively meal
In the newcomer Bertram met his match for wit and satire and Mr Mary Jane as he was promptly called by every one but Aunt Hannah was found to be a most entertaining guest
After dinner somebody suggested music
Cyril frowned and got up abruptly
Still frowning he turned to a bookcase near him and began to take down and examine some of the books
Bertram twinkled and glanced at Billy
Which is it Cyril
he called with cheerful impertinence stool piano or audience that is the matter tonight
Only a shrug from Cyril answered
You see explained Bertram jauntily to Arkwright whose eyes were slightly puzzled Cyril never plays unless the piano and the pedals and the weather and your ears and my watch and his fingers are just right
Nonsense
scorned Cyril dropping his book and walking back to his chair
I dont feel like playing tonight thats all
You see nodded Bertram again
I see bowed Arkwright with quiet amusement
I believeMr Mary Janesings observed Billy at this point demurely
Why yes of course  chimed in Aunt Hannah with some nervousness
Thats what sheI mean hewas coming to Boston forto study music
Everybody laughed
Wont you sing please
asked Billy
Can youwithout your notes
I have lots of songs if you want them
For a momentbut only a momentArkwright hesitated then he rose and went to the piano
With the easy sureness of the trained musician his fingers dropped to the keys and slid into preliminary chords and arpeggios to test the touch of the piano then with a sweetness and purity that made every listener turn in amazed delight a welltrained tenor began the Thro the leaves the night winds moving of Schuberts Serenade
Cyrils chin had lifted at the first tone
He was listening now with very obvious pleasure
Bertram too was showing by his attitude the keenest appreciation
William and Aunt Hannah resting back in their chairs were contentedly nodding their approval to each other
Marie in her corner was motionless with rapture
As to BillyBilly was plainly oblivious of everything but the song and the singer
She seemed scarcely to move or to breathe till the songs completion then there came a low Oh how beautiful
through her parted lips
Bertram looking at her was conscious of a vague irritation
Arkwright youre a lucky dog he declared almost crossly
I wish I could sing like that
I wish I could paint a Face of a Girl  smiled the tenor as he turned from the piano
Oh but Mr Arkwright dont stop objected Billy springing to her feet and going to her music cabinet by the piano
Theres a little song of Nevins I want you to sing
There here it is
Just let me play it for you
And she slipped into the place the singer had just left
It was the beginning of the end
After Nevin came De Koven and after De Koven Gounod
Then came Nevin again Billy still playing the accompaniment
Next followed a duet
Billy did not consider herself much of a singer but her voice was sweet and true and not without training
It blended very prettily with the clear pure tenor
William and Aunt Hannah still smiled contentedly in their chairs though Aunt Hannah had reached for the pink shawl near herthe music had sent little shivers down her spine
Cyril with Marie had slipped into the little reception room across the hall ostensibly to look at some plans for a house althoughas everybody knewthey were not intending to build for a year
Bertram still sitting stiffly erect in his chair was not conscious of a vague irritation now
He was conscious of a very real and a very decided onean irritation that was directed against himself against Billy and against this man Arkwright but chiefly against music per se
He hated music
He wished he could sing
He wondered how long it took to teach a man to sing anyhow and he wondered if a man could sing who never had sung
At this point the duet came to an end and Billy and her guest left the piano
Almost at once after this Arkwright made his very graceful adieus and went off with his suitcase to the hotel where as he had informed Aunt Hannah his room was already engaged
William went home then and Aunt Hannah went upstairs
Cyril and Marie withdrew into a still more secluded corner to look at their plans and Bertram found himself at last alone with Billy
He forgot then in the blissful hour he spent with her before the open fire how he hated music though he did say just before he went home that night Billy how long does it taketo learn to sing
Why I dont know Im sure replied Billy abstractedly then with sudden fervor Oh Bertram hasnt Mr Mary Jane a beautiful voice
Bertram wished then he had not asked the question but all he said was  Mr Mary Jane indeed
What an absurd name
But doesnt he sing beautifully
Eh
Oh yes he sings all right said Bertrams tongue
Bertrams manner said Oh yes anybody can sing
CHAPTER VIII M J
OPENS THE GAME On the morning after Cyrils first concert of the season Billy sat sewing with Aunt Hannah in the little sittingroom at the end of the hall upstairs
Aunt Hannah wore only one shawl this morningwhich meant that she was feeling unusually well
Marie ought to be here to mend these stockings remarked Billy as she critically examined a tiny break in the black silk mesh stretched across the darningegg in her hand only shed want a bigger hole
She does so love to make a beautiful black latticework bridge across a yawning white china seaand youd think the safety of an army depended on the way each plank was laid too she concluded
Aunt Hannah smiled tranquilly but she did not speak
I suppose you dont happen to know if Cyril does wear big holes in his socks resumed Billy after a moments silence
If youll believe it that thought popped into my head last night when Cyril was playing that concerto so superbly
It did actuallyright in the middle of the adagio movement too
And in spite of my joy and pride in the music I had all I could do to keep from nudging Marie right there and then and asking her whether or not the dear man was hard on his hose
Billy
gasped the shocked Aunt Hannah but the gasp broke at once into whatin Aunt Hannahpassed for a chuckle
If I remember rightly when I was there at the house with you at first my dear William told me that Cyril wouldnt wear any sock after it came to mending
Horrors
Billy waved her stocking in mock despair
That will never do in the world
It would break Maries heart
You know how she dotes on darning
Yes I know smiled Aunt Hannah
By the way where is she this morning
Billy raised her eyebrows quizzically
Gone to look at an apartment in Cambridge I believe
Really Aunt Hannah between her home hunting in the morning and her furnitureand rug hunting in the afternoon and her poring over houseplans in the evening I cant get her to attend to her clothes at all
Never did I see a bride so utterly indifferent to her trousseau as Marie Hawthornand her wedding less than a month away
But shes been shopping with you once or twice since she came back hasnt she
And she said it was for her trousseau
Billy laughed
Her trousseau
Oh yes it was
Ill tell you what she got for her trousseau that first day
We started out to buy two hats some lace for her wedding gown some crepe de Chine and net for a little dinner frock and some silk for a couple of waists to go with her tailored suit and what did we get
We purchased a newstyle eggbeater and a set of cake tins
Marie got into the kitchen department and I simply couldnt get her out of it
But the next day I was not to be inveigled below stairs by any plaintive prayer for a nutmeg grater or a soda spoon
She shopped that day and to some purpose
We accomplished lots
Aunt Hannah looked a little concerned
But she must have some things started
Oh she hasmost everything now
Ive seen to that
Of course her outfit is very simple anyway
Marie hasnt much money you know and she simply wont let me do half what I want to
Still she had saved up some money and Ive finally convinced her that a trousseau doesnt consist of eggbeaters and cake tins and that Cyril would want her to look pretty
That name will fetch her every time and Ive learned to use it beautifully
I think if I told her Cyril approved of short hair and nearsightedness shed I cut off her golden locks and don spectacles on the spot
Aunt Hannah laughed softly
What a child you are Billy
Besides just as if Marie were the only one in the house who is ruled by a magic name
The color deepened in Billys cheeks
Well of course any girlcares something for the man she loves
Just as if I wouldnt do anything in the world I could for Bertram
Oh that makes me think who was that young woman Bertram was talking with last evening just after he left us I mean
Miss WinthropMiss Marguerite Winthrop
Bertram isis painting her portrait you know
Oh is that the one
murmured Aunt Hannah
Hmm well she has a beautiful face
Yes she has
Billy spoke very cheerfully
She even hummed a little tune as she carefully selected a needle from the cushion in her basket
Theres a peculiar something in her face mused Aunt Hannah aloud
The little tune stopped abruptly ending in a nervous laugh
Dear me
I wonder how it feels to have a peculiar something in your face
Bertram too says she has it
Hes trying to catch it he says
I wonder nowif he does catch it does she lose it
Flippant as were the words the voice that uttered them shook a little
Aunt Hannah smiled indulgentlyAunt Hannah had heard only the flippancy not the shake
I dont know my dear
You might ask him this afternoon
Billy made a sudden movement
The china egg in her lap rolled to the floor
Oh but I dont see him this afternoon she said lightly as she stooped to pick up the egg
Why Im sure he told me Aunt Hannahs sentence ended in a questioning pause
Yes I know nodded Billy brightly but hes told me something since
He isnt going
He telephoned me this morning
Miss Winthrop wanted the sitting changed from tomorrow to this afternoon
He said he knew Id understand
Why yes but Aunt Hannah did not finish her sentence
The whir of an electric bell had sounded through the house
A few moments later Rosa appeared in the open doorway
Its Mr Arkwright Miss
He said as how he had brought the music she announced
Tell him Ill be down at once directed the mistress of Hillside
As the maid disappeared Billy put aside her work and sprang lightly to her feet
Now wasnt that nice of him
We were talking last night about some duets he had and he said hed bring them over
I didnt know hed come so soon though
Billy had almost reached the bottom of the stairway when a low familiar strain of music drifted out from the livingroom
Billy caught her breath and held her foot suspended
The next moment the familiar strain of music had become a lullaby one of Billys ownand sung now by a melting tenor voice that lingered caressingly and understandingly on every tender cadence
Motionless and almost breathless Billy waited until the last low lullaby vibrated into silence then with shining eyes and outstretched hands she entered the livingroom
Oh that wasbeautiful she breathed
Arkwright was on his feet instantly
His eyes too were alight
I could not resist singing it just once here he said a little unsteadily as their hands met
But to hear my little song sung like that
I couldnt believe it was mine choked Billy still plainly very much moved
You sang it as Ive never heard it sung before
Arkwright shook his head slowly
The inspiration of the roomthat is all he said
It is a beautiful song
All of your songs are beautiful
Billy blushed rosily
Thank you
You knowmore of them then
I think I know them allunless you have some new ones out
Have you some new ones lately
Billy shook her head
No I havent written anything since last spring
But youre going to
She drew a long sigh
Yes oh yes
I know that now With a swift biting of her lower lip Billy caught herself up in time
As if she could tell this man this stranger what she had told Bertram that night by the firethat she knew that now now she would write beautiful songs with his love and his pride in her as incentives
Oh yes I think I shall write more one of these days she finished lightly
But come this isnt singing duets
I want to see the music you brought
They sang then one after another of the duets
To Billy the music was new and interesting
To Billy too it was new and interesting to hear her own voice blending with anothers so perfectly to feel herself a part of such exquisite harmony
Oh oh
she breathed ecstatically after the last note of a particularly beautiful phrase
I never knew before how lovely it was to sing duets
Nor I replied Arkwright in a voice that was not quite steady
Arkwrights eyes were on the enraptured face of the girl so near him
It was well perhaps that Billy did not happen to turn and catch their expression
Still it might have been better if she had turned after all
But Billys eyes were on the music before her
Her fingers were busy with the fluttering pages searching for another duet
Didnt you
she murmured abstractedly
I supposed youd sung them before but you see I never diduntil the other night
There lets try this one
This one was followed by another and another
Then Billy drew a long breath
There
that must positively be the last she declared reluctantly
Im so hoarse now I can scarcely croak
You see I dont pretend to sing really
Dont you
You sing far better than some who do anyhowretorted the man warmly
Thank you smiled Billy that was nice of you to say sofor my sakeand the others arent here to care
But tell me of yourself
I havent had a chance to ask you yet andI think you said Mary Jane was going to study for Grand Opera
Arkwright laughed and shrugged his shoulders
She is but as I told Calderwell shes quite likely to bring up in vaudeville
Calderwell
Do you meanHugh Calderwell
Billys cheeks showed a deeper color
The man gave an embarrassed little laugh
He had not meant to let that name slip out just yet
Yes
He hesitated then plunged on recklessly
We tramped half over Europe together last summer
Did you
Billy left her seat at the piano for one nearer the fire
But this isnt telling me about your own plans she hurried on a little precipitately
Youve studied before of course
Your voice shows that
Oh yes Ive studied singing several years and Ive had a year or two of church work besides a little concert practice of a mild sort
Have you begun here yet
Yyes Ive had my voice tried
Billy sat erect with eager interest
They liked it of course
Arkwright laughed
Im not saying that
No but I am declared Billy with conviction
They couldnt help liking it
Arkwright laughed again
Just how well they had liked it he did not intend to say
Their remarks had been quite too flattering to repeat even to this very plainly interested young woman delightful and heartwarming as was this same show of interest to himself
Thank you was all he said
Billy gave an excited little bounce in her chair
And youll begin to learn roles right away
I already have someafter a fashionbefore I came here
Really
How splendid
Why then youll be acting them next right on the Boston Opera House stage and well all go to hear you
How perfectly lovely
I can hardly wait
Arkwright laughedbut his eyes glowed with pleasure
Arent you hurrying things a little
he ventured
But they do let the students appear argued Billy
I knew a girl last year who went on in Aida and she was a pupil at the School
She sang first in a Sunday concert then they put her in the bill for a Saturday night
She did splendidlyso well that they gave her a chance later at a subscription performance
Oh youll be thereand soon too
Thank you
I only wish the powers that could put me there had your flattering enthusiasm on the matter he smiled
I dont worry any nodded Billy only please dont arrive too soonnot before the wedding you know she added jokingly
We shall be too busy to give you proper attention until after that
A peculiar look crossed Arkwrights face
Thewedding he asked a little faintly
Yes
Didnt you know
My friend Miss Hawthorn is to marry Mr Cyril Henshaw next month
The man opposite relaxed visibly
Oh Miss Hawthorn No I didnt know he murmured then with sudden astonishment he added And to Mr Cyril the musician did you say
Yes
You seem surprised
I am
Arkwright paused then went on almost defiantly
You see Calderwell was telling me only last September how very unmarriageable all the Henshaw brothers were
So I am surprisednaturally finished Arkwright as he rose to take his leave
A swift crimson stained Billys face
But surely you must know thatthat That he has a right to change his mind of course supplemented Arkwright smilingly coming to her rescue in the evident confusion that would not let her finish her sentence
But Calderwell made it so emphatic you see about all the brothers
He said that William had lost his heart long ago that Cyril hadnt any to lose and that Bertram But Mr Arkwright Bertram isis Billy had moistened her lips and plunged hurriedly in to prevent Arkwrights next words
But again was she unable to finish her sentence and again was she forced to listen to a very different completion from the smiling lips of the man at her side
Is an artist of course said Arkwright
Thats what Calderwell declaredthat it would always be the tilt of a chin or the curve of a cheek that the artist lovedto paint
Billy drew back suddenly
Her face paled
As if now she could tell this man that Bertram Henshaw was engaged to her
He would find it out soon of course for himself and perhaps he like Hugh Calderwell would think it was the curve of her cheek or the tilt of her chin Billy lifted her chin very defiantly now as she held out her hand in goodby
CHAPTER IX A RUG A PICTURE AND A GIRL AFRAID Thanksgiving came
Once again the Henshaw brothers invited Billy and Aunt Hannah to spend the day with them
This time however there was to be an additional guest present in the person of Marie Hawthorn
And what a day it was for everything and everybody concerned
First the Strata itself from Dong Lings kitchen in the basement to Cyrils domain on the top floor the house was as spick andspan as Petes eager old hands could make it
In the drawingroom and in Bertrams den and studio great clusters of pink roses perfumed the air and brightened the sombre richness of the oldtime furnishings
Before the open fire in the den a sleek gray catadorned with a huge ribbon bow the exact shade of the roses Bertram had seen to that
winked and blinked sleepy yellow eyes
In Bertrams studio the latest Face of a Girl had made way for a group of canvases and plaques every one of which showed Billy Neilson in one pose or another
Upstairs where Williams chaos of treasures filled shelves and cabinets the place of honor was given to a small black velvet square on which rested a pair of quaint Battersea enamel mirror knobs
In Cyrils roomsusually so austerely barea handsome Oriental rug and several curtaindraped chairs hinted at purchases made at the instigation of a taste other than his own
When the doorbell rang Pete admitted the ladies with a promptness that was suggestive of surreptitious watching at some window
On Petes face the dignity of his high office and the delight of the moment were fighting for mastery
The dignity held firmly through Mrs Stetsons friendly greeting but it fled in defeat when Billy Neilson stepped over the threshold with a cheery Good morning Pete
Laws
But its good to be seein you here again stammered the mandelight now in sole possession
Shell be coming to stay one of these days Pete smiled the eldest Henshaw hurrying forward
I wish she had now whispered Bertram who in spite of Williams quick stride had reached Billys side first
From the stairway came the patter of a mans slippered feet
The rug has come and the curtains too called a householder sort of voice that few would have recognized as belonging to Cyril Henshaw
You must all come upstairs and see them after dinner
The voice apparently spoke to everybody but the eyes of the owner of the voice plainly saw only the fairhaired young woman who stood a little in the shadow behind Billy and who was looking about her now as at something a little fearsome but very dear
You knowIve never beenwhere you livebefore explained Marie Hawthorn in a low vibrant tone when Cyril bent over her to take the furs from her shoulders
In Bertrams den a little later as hosts and guests advanced toward the fire the sleek gray cat rose stretched lazily and turned her head with majestic condescension
Well Spunkie come here commanded Billy snapping her fingers at the slowmoving creature on the hearthrug
Spunkie when I am your mistress youll have to change either your name or your nature
As if I were going to have such a bunch of independent moderation as you masquerading as an understudy to my frisky little Spunk
Everybody laughed
William regarded his namesake with fond eyes as he said Spunkie doesnt seem to be worrying
The cat had jumped into Billys lap with a matter ofcourse air that was unmistakableand to Bertram adorable
Bertrams eyes as they rested on Billy were even fonder than were his brothers
I dont think any one isworrying he said with quiet emphasis
Billy smiled
I should think they might be she answered
Only think how dreadfully upsetting I was in the first place
Williams beaming face grew a little stern
Nobody knew it but Kateand she didnt know it she only imagined it he said tersely
Billy shook her head
Im not so sure she demurred
As I look back at it now I think I can discern a few evidences myselfthat I was upsetting
I was a bother to Bertram in his painting I am sure
You were an inspiration corrected Bertram
Think of the posing you did for me
A swift something like a shadow crossed Billys face but before her lover could question its meaning it was gone
And I know I was a torment to Cyril
Billy had turned to the musician now
Well I admit you were a littleupsetting at times retorted that individual with something of his old imperturbable rudeness
Nonsense
cut in William sharply
You were never anything but a comfort in the house Billy my dearand you never will be
Thank you murmured Billy demurely
Ill remember thatwhen Pete and I disagree about the table decorations and Dong Ling doesnt like the way I want my soup seasoned
An anxious frown showed on Bertrams face
Billy he said in a low voice as the others laughed at her sally you neednt have Pete nor Dong Ling here if you dont want them
Dont want them
echoed Billy indignantly
Of course I want them
ButPete is old and Yes and wheres he grown old
For whom has he worked the last fifty years while hes been growing old
I wonder if you think Id let Pete leave this house as long as he wants to stay
As for Dong Ling A sudden movement of Bertrams hand arrested her words
She looked up to find Pete in the doorway
Dinner is served sir announced the old butler his eyes on his masters face
William rose with alacrity and gave his arm to Aunt Hannah
Well Im sure were ready for dinner he declared
It was a good dinner and it was well served
It could scarcely have been otherwise with Dong Ling in the kitchen and Pete in the diningroom doing their utmost to please
But even had the turkey been tough instead of tender and even had the pies been filled with sawdust instead of with delicious mincemeat it is doubtful if four at the table would have known the difference Cyril and Marie at one end were discussing where to put their new sideboard in their diningroom and Bertram and Billy at the other were talking of the next Thanksgiving when according to Bertram the Strata would have the dearest little mistress that ever was born
As if under these circumstances the tenderness of the turkey or the toothsomeness of the mince pie mattered
To Aunt Hannah and William in the centre of the table however it did matter so it was well of course that the dinner was a good one
And now said Cyril when dinner was over suppose you come up and see the rug
In compliance with this suggestion the six trailed up the long flights of stairs then Billy carrying an extra shawl for Aunt Hannah Cyrils rooms were always cool
Oh yes I knew we should need it she nodded to Bertram as she picked up the shawl from the hall stand where she had left it when she came in
Thats why I brought it
Oh my grief and conscience Cyril how can you stand itto climb stairs like this panted Aunt Hannah as she reached the top of the last flight and dropped breathlessly into the nearest chairfrom which Marie had rescued a curtain just in time
Well Im not sure I couldif I were always to eat a Thanksgiving dinner just before laughed Cyril
Maybe I ought to have waited and let you rest an hour or two
But twould have been too dark then to see the rug objected Marie
Its a genuine Persian a Kirman you know and Im so proud of it she added turning to the others
I wanted you to see the colors by daylight
Cyril likes it better anyhow in the daytime
Fancy Cyril liking any sort of a rug at any time chuckled Bertram his eyes on the rich softly blended colors of the rug before him
Honestly Miss Marie he added turning to the little bride elect how did you ever manage to get him to buy any rug
He wont have so much as a ravelling on the floor up here to walk on
A startled dismay came into Maries blue eyes
Why I thought he wanted rugs she faltered
Im sure he said Of course I want rugs interrupted Cyril irritably
I want them everywhere except in my own especial den
You dont suppose I want to hear other people clattering over bare floors all day do you
Of course not
Bertrams face was preternaturally grave as he turned to the little music teacher
I hope Miss Marie that you wear rubber heels on your shoes he observed solicitously
Even Cyril laughed at this though all he said was Come come I got you up here to look at the rug
Bertram however was not to be silenced
And another thing Miss Marie he resumed with the air of a true and tried adviser
Just let me give you a pointer
Ive lived with your future husband a good many years and I know what Im talking about
Bertram be still growled Cyril
Bertram refused to be still
Whenever you want to know anything about Cyril listen to his playing
For instance if after dinner you hear a dreamy waltz or a sleepy nocturne you may know that all is well
But if on your ears there falls anything like a dirge or the wail of a lost spirit gone mad better look to your soup and see if it hasnt been scorched or taste of your pudding and see if you didnt put in salt instead of sugar
Bertram will you be still
cut in Cyril testily again
After all judging from what Billy tells me resumed Bertram cheerfully what Ive said wont be so important to you for you arent the kind that scorches soups or uses salt for sugar
So maybe Id better put it to you this way if you want a new sealskin coat or an extra diamond tiara tackle him when he plays like this
And with a swift turn Bertram dropped himself to the piano stool and dashed into a rollicking melody that half the newsboys of Boston were whistling
What happened next was a surprise to every one
Bertram very much as if he were a naughty little boy was jerked by a wrathful brothers hand off the piano stool
The next moment the wrathful brother himself sat at the piano and there burst on five pairs of astonished ears a crashing dissonance which was but the prelude to music such as few of the party often heard
Spellbound they listened while rippling runs and sonorous harmonies filled the room to overflowing as if under the fingers of the player there werenot the keyboard of a pianobut the violins flutes cornets trombones bass viols and kettledrums of a full orchestra
Billy perhaps of them all best understood
She knew that in those tripping melodies and crashing chords were Cyrils joy at the presence of Marie his wrath at the flippancy of Bertram his ecstasy at that for which the rug and curtains stoodthe little woman sewing in the radiant circle of a shaded lamp
Billy knew that all this and more were finding voice at Cyrils finger tips
The others too understood in a way but they unlike Billy were not in the habit of finding on a few score bits of wood and ivory a vent for their moods and fancies
The music was softer now
The resounding chords and purling runs had become a belllike melody that wound itself in and out of a maze of exquisite harmonies now hiding now coming out clear and unafraid like a mountain stream emerging into a sunlit meadow from the leafy shadows of its forest home
In a breathless hush the melody quivered into silence
It was Bertram who broke the pause with a longdrawn By George
Then a little unsteadily If its I that set you going like that old chap Ill come up and play ragtime every day
Cyril shrugged his shoulders and got to his feet
If youve seen all you want of the rug well go downstairs he said nonchalantly
But we havent
chorussed several indignant voices
And for the next few minutes not even the owner of the beautiful Kirman could find any fault with the quantity or the quality of the attention bestowed on his new possession
But Billy under cover of the chatter said reproachfully in his ear Oh Cyril to think you can play like that and wonton demand
I canton demand shrugged Cyril again
On the way downstairs they stopped at Williams rooms
I want you to see a couple of Batterseas I got last week cried the collector eagerly as he led the way to the black velvet square
Theyre fineand I think she looks like you he finished turning to Billy and holding out one of the knobs on which was a beautifully executed miniature of a young girl with dark dreamy eyes
Oh how pretty
exclaimed Marie over Billys shoulder
But what are they
The collector turned his face alight
Mirror knobs
Ive got lots of them
Would you like to see themreally
Theyre right here
The next minute Marie found herself looking into a cabinet where lay a score or more of round and oval discs of glass porcelain and metal framed in silver gilt and brass and mounted on long spikes
Oh how pretty cried Marie again but howhow queer
Tell me about them please
William drew a long breath
His eyes glistened
William loved to talkwhen he had a curio and a listener
I will
Our greatgrandmothers used them you know to support their mirrors or to fasten back their curtains he explained ardently
Now heres another Battersea enamel but it isnt so good as my new onesthat face is almost a caricature
But what a beautiful shipon that round one
exclaimed Marie
And whats this one
glass
Yes but thats not so rare as the others
Still its pretty enough
Did you notice this one with the bright red and blue and green on the white backgroundregular Chinese mode of decoration that is
Erany time William began Bertram mischievously but William did not seem to hear
Now in this corner he went on warming to his subject are the enamelled porcelains
They were probably made at the Worcester works England you know and I think many of them are quite as pretty as the Batterseas
You see it was at Worcester that they invented that variation of the transfer printing process that they called bat printing where they used oil instead of ink and gelatine instead of paper
Now engravings for that kind of printing were usually in stipple workdots you knowso the prints on these knobs can easily be distinguished from those of the transfer printing
See
Now this one is Er of course William any time interposed Bertram again his eyes twinkling
William stopped with a laugh
Yes I know
Tis time I talked of something else Bertram he conceded
But twas lovely and I was interested really claimed Marie
Besides there are such a lot of things here that Id like to see she finished turning slowly about
These are what he was collecting last year murmured Billy hovering over a small cabinet where were some beautiful specimens of antique jewelry brooches necklaces armlets Rajah rings and anklets gorgeous in color and exquisite in workmanship
Well here is something you will enjoy declared Bertram with an airy flourish
Do you see those teapots
Well we can have tea every day in the year and not use one of them but five times
Ive counted
There are exactly seventythree he concluded as he laughingly led the way from the room
How about leap year
quizzed Billy
Ho
Trust Will to find another Old Blue or a perfect treasure of a black basalt by that time shrugged Bertram
Below Williams rooms was the floor once Bertrams but afterwards given over to the use of Billy and Aunt Hannah
The rooms were open today and were bright with sunshine and roses but they were very plainly unoccupied
And you dont use them yet
remonstrated Billy as she paused at an open door
No
These are Mrs Bertram Henshaws rooms said the youngest Henshaw brother in a voice that made Billy hurry away with a dimpling blush
They were Billysand they can never seem any ones but Billys now declared William to Marie as they went down the stairs
And now for the den and some good stories before the fire proposed Bertram as the six reached the first floor again
But we havent seen your pictures yet objected Billy
Bertram made a deprecatory gesture
Theres nothing much he began but he stopped at once with an odd laugh
Well I shant say that he finished flinging open the door of his studio and pressing a button that flooded the room with light
The next moment as they stood before those plaques and panels and canvaseson each of which was a pictured Billythey understood the change in his sentence and they laughed appreciatively
 Much indeed
exclaimed William
Oh how lovely
breathed Marie
My grief and conscience Bertram
All these and of Billy
I knew you had a good many but Aunt Hannah paused impotently her eyes going from Bertrams face to the pictures again
But howwhen did you do them
queried Marie
Some of them from memory
More of them from life
A lot of them were just sketches that I did when she was here in the house four or five years ago answered Bertram like this for instance
And he pulled into a better light a picture of a laughing darkeyed girl holding against her cheek a small gray kitten with alert bright eyes
The original and only Spunk he announced
What a dear little cat
cried Marie
You should have seen itin the flesh remarked Cyril dryly
No paint nor painter could imprison that untamed bit of Satanic mischief on any canvas that ever grew
Everybody laughedeverybody but Billy
Billy indeed of them all had been strangely silent ever since they entered the studio
She stood now a little apart
Her eyes were wide and a bit frightened
Her fingers were twisting the corners of her handkerchief nervously
She was looking to the right and to the left and everywhere she sawherself
Sometimes it was her full face sometimes her profile sometimes there were only her eyes peeping from above a fan or peering from out brown shadows of nothingness
Once it was merely the back of her head showing the mass of waving hair with its high lights of burnished bronze
Again it was still the back of her head with below it the bare slender neck and the scarf draped shoulders
In this picture the curve of a halfturned cheek showed plainly and in the background was visible a hand holding four playing cards at which the pictured girl was evidently looking
Sometimes it was a merry Billy with dancing eyes sometimes a demure Billy with long lashes caressing a flushed cheek
Sometimes it was a wistful Billy with eyes that looked straight into yours with peculiar appeal
But always it wasBilly
There I think the tilt of this chin is perfect
It was Bertram speaking
Billy gave a sudden cry
Her face whitened
She stumbled forward
No no Bertram youyou didnt mean thethe tilt of the chin she faltered wildly
The man turned in amazement
WhyBilly
he stammered
Billy what is it
The girl fell back at once
She tried to laugh lightly
She had seen the dismayed questioning in her lovers eyes and in the eyes of William and the others
Nnothing she gesticulated hurriedly
It was nothing at all truly
But Billy it was something
Bertrams eyes were still troubled
Was it the picture
I thought you liked this picture
Billy laughed againthis time more naturally
Bertram Im ashamed of youexpecting me to say I like any of this she scolded with a wave of her hands toward the omnipresent Billy
Why I feel as if I were in a room with a thousand mirrors and that Id been discovered putting rouge on my cheeks and lampblack on my eyebrows
William laughed fondly
Aunt Hannah and Marie gave an indulgent smile
Cyril actually chuckled
Bertram only still wore a puzzled expression as he laid aside the canvas in his hands
Billy examined intently a sketch she had found with its back to the wall
It was not a pretty sketch it was not even a finished one and Billy did not in the least care what it was
But her lips cried interestedly Oh Bertram what is this
There was no answer
Bertram was still engaged apparently in putting away some sketches
Over by the doorway leading to the den Marie and Aunt Hannah followed by William and Cyril were just disappearing behind a huge easel
In another minute the merry chatter of their voices came from the room beyond
Bertram hurried then straight across the studio to the girl still bending over the sketch in the corner
Bertram
gasped Billy as a kiss brushed her cheek
Pooh
Theyre gone
Besides what if they did see
Billy what was the matter with the tilt of that chin
Billy gave an hysterical little laughat least Bertram tried to assure himself that it was a laugh though it had sounded almost like a sob
Bertram if you say another word about about the tilt of that chin I shall scream she panted
Why Billy
With a nervous little movement Billy turned and began to reverse the canvases nearest her
Come sir she commanded gayly
Billy has been on exhibition quite long enough
It is high time she was turned face to the wall to meditate and grow more modest
Bertram did not answer
Neither did he make a move to assist her
His ardent gray eyes were following her slim graceful figure admiringly
Billy it doesnt seem true yet that youre really mine he said at last in a low voice shaken with emotion
Billy turned abruptly
A peculiar radiance shone in her eyes and glorified her face
As she stood she was close to a picture on an easel and full in the soft glow of the shaded lights above it
Then you do want me she began just menot to she stopped short
The man opposite had taken an eager step toward her
On his face was the look she knew so well the look she had come almost to dreadthe painting look
Billy stand just as you are he was saying
Dont move
Jove
But that effect is perfect with those dark shadows beyond and just your hair and face and throat showing
I declare Ive half a mind to sketch But Billy with a little cry was gone
CHAPTER X A JOB FOR PETEAND FOR BERTRAM The early days in December were busy ones certainly in the little house on Corey Hill
Marie was to be married the twelfth
It was to be a home wedding and a very simple oneaccording to Billy and according to what Marie had said it was to be
Billy still serenely spoke of it as a simple affair but Marie was beginning to be fearful
As the days passed bringing with them more and more frequent evidences either tangible or intangible of orders to stationers caterers and florists her fears found voice in a protest
But Billy it was to be a simple wedding she cried
And so it is
But what is this I hear about a breakfast
Billys chin assumed its most stubborn squareness
I dont know Im sure what you did hear she retorted calmly
Billy
Billy laughed
The chin was just as stubborn but the smiling lips above it graced it with an air of charming concession
There there dear coaxed the mistress of Hillside dont fret
Besides Im sure I should think you of all people would want your guests fed But this is so elaborate from what I hear
Nonsense
Not a bit of it
Rosa says therell be salads and cakes and icesand I dont know what all
Billy looked concerned
Well of course Marie if youd rather have oatmeal and doughnuts she began with kind solicitude but she got no farther
Billy
besought the bride elect
Wont you be serious
And theres the cake in wedding boxes too
I know but boxes are so much easier and cleaner thanjust fingers apologized an anxiously serious voice
Marie answered with an indignant grieved glance and hurried on
And the flowersroses dozens of them in December
Billy I cant let you do all this for me
Nonsense dear
laughed Billy
Why I love to do it
Besides when youre gone just think how lonesome Ill be
I shall have to adopt somebody else thennow that Mary Jane has proved to be nothing but a disappointing man instead of a nice little girl like you she finished whimsically
Marie did not smile
The frown still lay between her delicate brows
And for my trousseauthere were so many things that you simply would buy
I didnt get one of the eggbeaters Billy reminded her anxiously
Marie smiled now but she shook her head too
Billy I cannot have you do all this for me
Why not
At the unexpectedly direct question Marie fell back a little
Why because II cant she stammered
I cant get them for myself andand Dont you love me
A pink flush stole to Maries face
Indeed I do dearly
Dont I love you
The flush deepened
II hope so
Then why wont you let me do what I want to and be happy in it
Money just money isnt any good unless you can exchange it for something you want
And just now I want pink roses and ice cream and lace flounces for you
Marie Billys voice trembled a littleI never had a sister till I had you and I have had such a good time buying things that I thought you wanted
But of course if you dont want them The words ended in a choking sob and down went Billys head into her folded arms on the desk before her
Marie sprang to her feet and cuddled the bowed head in a loving embrace
But I do want them dear I want them all every single one she urged
Now promise me promise me that youll do them all just as youd planned
You will wont you
There was the briefest of hesitations then came the muffled reply Yesif you really want them
I do dearindeed I do
I love pretty weddings and II always hoped that I could have oneif I ever married
So you must know dear how I really do want all those things declared Marie fervently
And now I must go
I promised to meet Cyril at Park Street at three oclock
And she hurried from the roomand not until she was halfway to her destination did it suddenly occur to her that she had been urging actually urging Miss Billy Neilson to buy for her pink roses ice cream and lace flounces
Her cheeks burned with shame then
But almost at once she smiled
Now wasnt that just like Billy
she was saying to herself with a tender glow in her eyes
It was early in December that Pete came one day with a package for Marie from Cyril
Marie was not at home and Billy herself went downstairs to take the package from the old mans hands
Mr Cyril said to give it to Miss Hawthorn stammered the old servant his face lighting up as Billy entered the room but Im sure he wouldnt mind your taking it
Im afraid Ill have to take it Pete unless you want to carry it back with you she smiled
Ill see that Miss Hawthorn has it the very first moment she comes in
Thank you Miss
It does my old eyes good to see your bright face
He hesitated then turned slowly
Good day Miss Billy
Billy laid the package on the table
Her eyes were thoughtful as she looked after the old man who was now almost to the door
Something in his bowed form appealed to her strangely
She took a quick step toward him
Youll miss Mr Cyril Pete she said pleasantly
The old man stopped at once and turned
He lifted his head a little proudly
Yes Miss
II was there when he was born
Mr Cyrils a fine man
Indeed he is
Perhaps its your good care thats helped someto make him so smiled the girl vaguely wishing that she could say something that would drive the wistful look from the dim old eyes before her
For a moment Billy thought she had succeeded
The old servant drew himself stiffly erect
In his eyes shone the loyal pride of more than fifty years honest service
Almost at once however the pride died away and the wistfulness returned
Thank ye Miss but I dont lay no claim to that of course he said
Mr Cyrils a fine man and we shall miss him butI callate changes must cometo all of us
Billys brown eyes grew a little misty
I suppose they must she admitted
The old man hesitated then as if impelled by some hidden force he plunged on Yes and theyll be comin to you one of these days Miss and thats what I was wantin to speak to ye about
I understand of course that when you get there youll be wantin younger blood to serve ye
My feet aint so spry as they once was and my old hands blunder sometimes in spite of what my head bids em do
So I wanted to tell yethat of course I shouldnt expect to stay
Id go
As he said the words Pete stood with head and shoulders erect his eyes looking straight forward but not at Billy
Dont you want to stay
The girlish voice was a little reproachful
Petes head drooped
Not ifIm not wanted came the husky reply
With an impulsive movement Billy came straight to the old mans side and held out her hand
Pete
Amazement incredulity and a look that was almost terror crossed the old mans face then a flood of dull red blotted them all out and left only worshipful rapture
With a choking cry he took the slim little hand in both his rough and twisted ones much as if he were possessing himself of a treasured bit of eggshell china
Miss Billy
Pete there arent a pair of feet in Boston nor a pair of hands either that Id rather have serve me than yours no matter if they stumble and blunder all day
I shall love stumbles and blundersif you make them
Now run home and dont ever let me hear another syllable about your leaving
They were not the words Billy had intended to say
She had meant to speak of his long faithful service and of how much they appreciated it but to her surprise Billy found her own eyes wet and her own voice trembling and the words that she would have said she found fast shut in her throat
So there was nothing to do but to stammer out somethinganything that would help to keep her from yielding to that absurd and awful desire to fall on the old servants neck and cry
Not another syllable
she repeated sternly
Miss Billy
choked Pete again
Then he turned and fled with anything but his usual dignity
Bertram called that evening
When Billy came to him in the livingroom her slender self was almost hidden behind the swirls of damask linen in her arms
Bertrams eyes grew mutinous
Do you expect me to hug all that
he demanded
Billy flashed him a mischievous glance
Of course not
You dont have to hug anything you know
For answer he impetuously swept the offending linen into the nearest chair and drew the girl into his arms
Oh
And see how youve crushed poor Maries tablecloth
she cried with reproachful eyes
Bertram sniffed imperturbably
Im not sure but Id like to crush Marie he alleged
Bertram
I cant help it
See here Billy
He loosened his clasp and held the girl off at arms length regarding her with stormy eyes
Its Marie Marie Mariealways
If I telephone in the morning youve gone shopping with Marie
If I want you in the afternoon for something youre at the dressmakers with Marie
If I call in the evening Im here interrupted Billy with decision
Oh yes youre here admitted Bertram aggrievedly and so are dozens of napkins miles of tablecloths and yards upon yards of lace and flummydiddles you call doilies
They all belong to Marie and they fill your arms and your thoughts full until there isnt an inch of room for me
Billy when is this thing going to end
Billy laughed softly
Her eyes danced
The twelfththat is therell be apause then
Well Im thankful ifeh
broke off the man with a sudden change of manner
What do you mean by a pause
Billy cast down her eyes demurely
Well of course this ends the twelfth with Maries wedding but Ive sort of regarded it as anunderstudy for one thats coming next October you see
Billy you darling
breathed a supremely happy voice in a shelllike earBilly was not at arms length now
Billy smiled but she drew away with gentle firmness
And now I must go back to my sewing she said
Bertrams arms did not loosen
His eyes had grown mutinous again
That is she amended I must be practising my part ofthe understudy you know
You darling
breathed Bertram again this time however he let her go
But honestly is it all necessary
he sighed despairingly as she seated herself and gathered the tablecloth into her lap
Do you have to do so much of it all
I do smiled Billy unless you want your brother to run the risk of leading his bride to the altar and finding her robed in a kitchen apron with an eggbeater in her hand for a bouquet
Bertram laughed
Is it so bad as that
No of course notquite
But never have I seen a bride so utterly oblivious to clothes as Marie was till one day in despair I told her that Cyril never could bear a dowdy woman
As if Cyril in the old days ever could bear any sort of woman
scoffed Bertram merrily
I know but I didnt mention that part smiled Billy
I just singled out the dowdy one
Did it work
Billy made a gesture of despair
Did it work
It worked too well
Marie gave me one horrified look then at once and immediately she became possessed with the idea that she was a dowdy woman
And from that day to this she has pursued every lurking wrinkle and every fold awry until her dressmakers life isnt worth the living and Im beginning to think mine isnt either for I have to assure her at least four times every day now that she is not a dowdy woman
You poor dear laughed Bertram
No wonder you dont have time to give to me
A peculiar expression crossed Billys face
Oh but Im not the only one who at times is otherwise engaged sir she reminded him
What do you mean
There was yesterday and last Monday and last week Wednesday and Oh but you let me off then argued Bertram anxiously
And you said That I didnt wish to interfere with your workwhich was quite true interrupted Billy in her turn smoothly
By the wayBilly was examining her stitches very closely now how is Miss Winthrops portrait coming on
Splendidlythat is it was until she began to put off the sittings for her pink teas and folderols
Shes going to Washington next week too to be gone nearly a fortnight finished Bertram gloomily
Arent you putting more work than usual into this oneand more sittings
Well yes laughed Bertram a little shortly
You see shes changed the pose twice already
Changed it
Yes
Wasnt satisfied
Fancied she wanted it different
But cant youdont you have something to say about it
Oh yes of course and she claims shell yield to my judgment anyhow
But whats the use
Shes been a spoiled darling all her life and in the habit of having her own way about everything
Naturally under those circumstances I cant expect to get a satisfactory portrait if shes out of tune with the pose
Besides I will own so far her suggestions have made for improvementprobably because shes been happy in making them so her expression has been good
Billy wet her lips
I saw her the other night she said lightly
If the lightness was a little artificial Bertram did not seem to notice it
She is certainlyvery beautiful
Yes
Bertram got to his feet and began to walk up and down the little room
His eyes were alight
On his face the painting look was king
Its going to mean a lot to methis picture Billy
In the first place Im just at the point in my career where a big success would mean a lot and where a big failure would mean more
And this portrait is bound to be one or the other from the very nature of the thing
Iis it
Billys voice was a little faint
Yes
First because of who the sitter is and secondly because of what she is
She is of course the most famous subject Ive had and half the artistic world knows by this time that Marguerite Winthrop is being done by Henshaw
You can see what itll beif I fail
But you wont fail Bertram
The artist lifted his chin and threw back his shoulders
No of course not but He hesitated frowned and dropped himself into a chair
His eyes studied the fire moodily
You see he resumed after a moment theres a peculiar elusive something about her expression Billy stirred restlessly and gave her thread so savage a jerk that it brokea something that isnt easily caught by the brush
Anderson and Fullambig fellows both of themdidnt catch it
At least Ive understood that neither her family nor her friends are satisfied with their portraits
And to succeed where Anderson and Fullam failedJove
Billy a chance like that doesnt come to a fellow twice in a lifetime
Bertram was out of his chair again tramping up and down the little room
Billy tossed her work aside and sprang to her feet
Her eyes too were alight now
But you arent going to fail dear she cried holding out both her hands
Youre going to succeed
Bertram caught the hands and kissed first one then the other of their soft little palms
Of course I am he agreed passionately leading her to the sofa and seating himself at her side
Yes but you must really feel it she urged feel the sure in yourself
You have toto doing things
Thats what I told Mary Jane yesterday when he was running on about what he wanted to doin his singing you know
Bertram stiffened a little
A quick frown came to his face
Mary Jane indeed
Of all the absurd names to give a fullgrown sixfoot man
Billy do for pitys sake call him by his nameif hes got one
Billy broke into a rippling laugh
I wish I could dear she sighed ingenuously
Honestly it bothers me because I cant think of him as anything but Mary Jane
It seems so silly
It certainly doeswhen one remembers his beard
Oh hes shaved that off now
He looks rather better too
Bertram turned a little sharply
Do you see the fellowoften
Billy laughed merrily
No
Hes about as disgruntled as you are over the way the wedding monopolizes everything
Hes been up once or twice to see Aunt Hannah and to get acquainted as he expresses it and once he brought up some music and we sang but he declares the wedding hasnt given him half a show
Indeed
Well thats a pity Im sure rejoined Bertram icily
Billy turned in slight surprise
Why Bertram dont you like Mary Jane
Billy for heavens sake
Hasnt he got any name but that
Billy clapped her hands together suddenly
There that makes me think
He told Aunt Hannah and me to guess what his name was and we never hit it once
What do you think it is
The initials are M
J
I couldnt say Im sure
What is it
Oh he didnt tell us
You see he left us to guess it
Did he
Yes mused Billy abstractedly her eyes on the dancing fire
The next minute she stirred and settled herself more comfortably in the curve of her lovers arm
But there
who cares what his name is
Im sure I dont
Nor I echoed Bertram in a voice that he tried to make not too fervent
He had not forgotten Billys surprised Why Bertram dont you like Mary Jane
and he did not like to call forth a repetition of it
Abruptly therefore he changed the subject
By the way what did you do to Pete today
he asked laughingly
He came home in a seventh heaven of happiness babbling of what an angel straight from the sky Miss Billy was
Naturally I agreed with him on that point
But what did you do to him
Billy smiled
Nothingonly engaged him for our butler for life
Oh I see
That was dear of you Billy
As if Id do anything else
And now for Dong Ling I suppose some day
Bertram chuckled
Well maybe I can help you there he hinted
You see his Celestial Majesty came to me himself the other day and said after sundry and various preliminaries that he should be velly much glad when the Little Missee came to live with me for then he could go back to China with a heart at rest as he had money velly much plenty and didnt wish to be Melican man any longer
Dear me smiled Billy what a happy state of affairsfor him
But for youdo you realize young man what that means for you
A new wife and a new cook all at once
And you know Im not Marie
Ho
Im not worrying retorted Bertram with a contented smile besides as perhaps you noticed it wasnt Marie that I askedto marry me
CHAPTER XI A CLOCK AND AUNT HANNAH Mrs Kate Hartwell the Henshaw brothers sister from the West was expected on the tenth
Her husband could not come she had written but she would bring with her little Kate the youngest child
The boys Paul and Egbert would stay with their father
Billy received the news of little Kates coming with outspoken delight
The very thing
she cried
Well have her for a flower girl
She was a dear little creature as I remember her
Aunt Hannah gave a sudden low laugh
Yes I remember she observed
Kate told me after you spent the first day with her that you graciously informed her that little Kate was almost as nice as Spunk
Kate did not fully appreciate the compliment I fear
Billy made a wry face
Did I say that
Dear me
I was a terror in those days wasnt I
But then and she laughed softly really Aunt Hannah that was the prettiest thing I knew how to say for I considered Spunk the topnotch of desirability
I think I should have liked to know Spunk smiled Marie from the other side of the sewing table
He was a dear declared Billy
I had another most as good when I first came to Hillside but he got lost
For a time it seemed as if I never wanted another but Ive about come to the conclusion now that I do and Ive told Bertram to find one for me if he can
You see I shall be lonesome after youre gone Marie and Ill have to have something she finished mischievously
Oh I dont mind the inferenceas long as I know your admiration of cats laughed Marie
Let me see Kate writes she is coming the tenth murmured Aunt Hannah going back to the letter in her hand
Good
nodded Billy
That will give time to put little Kate through her paces as flower girl
Yes and it will give Big Kate time to try to make your breakfast a supper and your roses pinksor sunflowers cut in a new voice dryly
Cyril
chorussed the three ladies in horror adoration and amusementaccording to whether the voice belonged to Aunt Hannah Marie or Billy
Cyril shrugged his shoulders and smiled
I beg your pardon he apologized but Rosa said you were in here sewing and I told her not to bother
Id announce myself
Just as I got to the door I chanced to hear Billys speech and I couldnt resist making the amendment
Maybe youve forgotten Kates love of managingbut I havent he finished as he sauntered over to the chair nearest Marie
No I haventforgotten observed Billy meaningly
Nor Inor anybody else declared a severe voiceboth the words and the severity being most extraordinary as coming from the usually gentle Aunt Hannah
Oh well never mind spoke up Billy quickly
Everythings all right now so lets forget it
She always meant it for kindness Im sure
Even when she told you in the first place what aertorment you were to us
quizzed Cyril
Yes flashed Billy
She was being kind to you then
Humph
vouchsafed Cyril
For a moment no one spoke
Cyrils eyes were on Marie who was nervously trying to smooth back a few fluffy wisps of hair that had escaped from restraining combs and pins
Whats the matter with the hair little girl
asked Cyril in a voice that was caressingly irritable
Youve been fussing with that long suffering curl for the last five minutes
Maries delicate face flushed painfully
Its got loosemy hair she stammered and it looks so dowdy that way
Billy dropped her thread suddenly
She sprang for it at once before Cyril could make a move to get it
She had to dive far under a chair to capture itwhich may explain why her face was so very red when she finally reached her seat again
On the morning of the tenth Billy Marie and Aunt Hannah were once more sewing together this time in the little sittingroom at the end of the hall upstairs
Billys fingers in particular were flying very fast
I told John to have Peggy at the door at eleven she said after a time but I think I can finish running in this ribbon before then
I havent much to do to get ready to go
I hope Kates train wont be late worried Aunt Hannah
I hope not replied Billy but I told Rosa to delay luncheon anyway till we get here
I She stopped abruptly and turned a listening ear toward the door of Aunt Hannahs room which was open
A clock was striking
Mercy
that cant be eleven now she cried
But it must beit was ten before I came upstairs
She got to her feet hurriedly
Aunt Hannah put out a restraining hand
No no dear thats halfpast ten
But it struck eleven
Yes I know
It doesat halfpast ten
Why the little wretch laughed Billy dropping back into her chair and picking up her work again
The idea of its telling fibs like that and frightening people half out of their lives
Ill have it fixed right away
Maybe John can do it hes always so handy about such things
But I dont want it fixed demurred Aunt Hannah
Billy stared a little
You dont want it fixed
Maybe you like to have it strike eleven when its halfpast ten
Billys voice was merrily sarcastic
Yyes I do stammered the lady apologetically
You see II worked very hard to fix it so it would strike that way
Aunt Hannah Well I did retorted the lady with unexpected spirit
I wanted to know what time it was in the nightIm awake such a lot
But I dont see
Billys eyes were perplexed
Why must you make it tell fibs in order toto find out the truth
she laughed
Aunt Hannah elevated her chin a little
Because that clock was always striking one
One
Yeshalfpast you know and I never knew which halfpast it was
But it must strike halfpast now just the same
It does
There was the triumphant ring of the conqueror in Aunt Hannahs voice
But now it strikes halfpast on the hour and the clock in the hall tells me then what time it is so I dont care
For one more brief minute Billy stared before a sudden light of understanding illumined her face
Then her laugh rang out gleefully
Oh Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah she gurgled
If Bertram wouldnt call you the limit making a clock strike eleven so youll know its halfpast ten
Aunt Hannah colored a little but she stood her ground
Well theres only half an hour anyway now that I dont know what time it is she maintained for one or the other of those clocks strikes the hour every thirty minutes
Even during those neverending three ones that strike one after the other in the middle of the night I can tell now for the hall clock has a different sound for the halfhours you know so I can tell whether its one or a halfpast
Of course chuckled Billy
Im sure I think its a splendid idea chimed in Marie valiantly and Im going to write it to mothers Cousin Jane right away
Shes an invalid and shes always lying awake nights wondering what time it is
The doctor says actually he believes shed get well if he could find some way of letting her know the time at night so shed get some sleep for she simply cant go to sleep till she knows
She cant bear a light in the room and it wakes her all up to turn an electric switch or anything of that kind
Why doesnt she have one of those phosphorous things
questioned Billy
Marie laughed quietly
She did
I sent her oneand she stood it just one night
Stood it
Yes
She declared it gave her the creeps and that she wouldnt have the spooky thing staring at her all night like that
So its got to be something she can hear and Im going to tell her Mrs Stetsons plan right away
Well Im sure I wish you would cried that lady with prompt interest and shell like it Im sure
And tell her if she can hear a town clock strike its just the same and even better for there arent any halfhours at all to think of there
I willand I think its lovely declared Marie
Of course its lovely smiled Billy rising but I fancy Id better go and get ready to meet Mrs Hartwell or the lovely thing will be telling me that its halfpast eleven
And she tripped laughingly from the room
Promptly at the appointed time John with Peggy drew up before the door and Billy muffled in furs stepped into the car which with its protecting top and sides and glass windshield was in its winter dress
Yesm tis a little chilly Miss said John in answer to her greeting as he tucked the heavy robes about her
Oh well I shall be very comfortable Im sure smiled Billy
Just dont drive too rapidly specially coming home
I shall have to get a limousine I think when my ship comes in John
Johns grizzled old face twitched
So evident were the words that were not spoken that Billy asked laughingly Well John what is it
John reddened furiously
Nothing Miss
I was only thinkin that if you didnt tend ter haulin in so many other folkss ships yours might get in sooner
Why John
Nonsense
II love to haul in other folkss ships laughed the girl embarrassedly
Yes Miss I know you do grunted John
Billy colored
No nothat is I meanI dont do it very much she stammered
John did not answer apparently but Billy was sure she caught a lowmuttered indignant much
as he snapped the door shut and took his place at the wheel
To herself she laughed softly
She thought she possessed the secret now of some of Johns disapproving glances toward her humble guests of the summer before
CHAPTER XII SISTER KATE At the station Mrs Hartwells train was found to be gratifyingly on time and in due course Billy was extending a cordial welcome to a tall handsome woman who carried herself with an unmistakable air of assured competence
Accompanying her was a little girl with big blue eyes and yellow curls
I am very glad to see you both smiled Billy holding out a friendly hand to Mrs Hartwell and stooping to kiss the round cheek of the little girl
Thank you you are very kind murmured the lady butare you alone Billy
Where are the boys
Uncle William is out of town and Cyril is rushed to death and sent his excuses
Bertram did mean to come but he telephoned this morning that he couldnt after all
Im sorry but Im afraid youll have to make the best of just me condoled Billy
Theyll be out to the house this evening of courseall but Uncle William
He doesnt return until tomorrow
Oh doesnt he
murmured the lady reaching for her daughters hand
Billy looked down with a smile
And this is little Kate I suppose she said whom I havent seen for such a long long time
Let me see you are how old now
Im eight
Ive been eight six weeks
Billys eyes twinkled
And you dont remember me I suppose
The little girl shook her head
No but I know who you are she added with shy eagerness
Youre going to be my Aunt Billy and youre going to marry my Uncle WilliamI mean my Uncle Bertram
Billys face changed color
Mrs Hartwell gave a despairing gesture
Kate my dear I told you to be sure and remember that it was your Uncle Bertram now
You see she added in a discouraged aside to Billy she cant seem to forget the first one
But then what can you expect
laughed Mrs Hartwell a little disagreeably
Such abrupt changes from one brother to another are somewhat disconcerting you know
Billy bit her lip
For a moment she said nothing then a little constrainedly she rejoined Perhaps
Stilllet us hope we have the right one now
Mrs Hartwell raised her eyebrows
Well my dear Im not so confident of that
My choice has been and always will beWilliam
Billy bit her lip again
This time her brown eyes flashed a little
Is that so
But you see after all you arent making thethe choice
Billy spoke lightly gayly and she ended with a bright little laugh as if to hide any intended impertinence
It was Mrs Hartwells turn to bite her lip and she did it
So it seems she rejoined frigidly after the briefest of pauses
It was not until they were on their way to Corey Hill some time later that Mrs Hartwell turned with the question Cyril is to be married in church I suppose
No
They both preferred a home wedding
Oh what a pity
Church weddings are so attractive
To those who like them amended Billy in spite of herself
To every one I think corrected Mrs Hartwell positively
Billy laughed
She was beginning to discern that it did not do much harmnor much good to disagree with her guest
Its in the evening then of course
pursued Mrs Hartwell
No at noon
Oh how could you let them
But they preferred it Mrs
Hartwell
What if they did
retorted the lady sharply
Cant you do as you please in your own home
Evening weddings are so much prettier
We cant change now of course with the guests all invited
That is I suppose you do have guests
Mrs Hartwells voice was aggrievedly despairing
Oh yes smiled Billy demurely
We have guests invitedand Im afraid we cant change the time
No of course not but its too bad
I conclude there are announcements only as I got no cards
Announcements only bowed Billy
I wish Cyril had consulted me a little about this affair
Billy did not answer
She could not trust herself to speak just then
Cyrils words of two days before were in her ears Yes and it will give Big Kate time to try to make your breakfast supper and your roses pinksor sunflowers
In a moment Mrs Hartwell spoke again
Of course a noon wedding is quite pretty if you darken the rooms and have lightsyoure going to do that I suppose
Billy shook her head slowly
Im afraid not Mrs Hartwell
That isnt the plan now
Not darken the rooms
exclaimed Mrs Hartwell
Why it wont She stopped suddenly and fell back in her seat
The look of annoyed disappointment gave way to one of confident relief
But then that can be changed she finished serenely
Billy opened her lips but she shut them without speaking
After a minute she opened them again
You might consultCyrilabout that she said in a quiet voice
Yes I will nodded Mrs Hartwell brightly
She was looking pleased and happy again
I love weddings
Dont you
You can do so much with them
Can you
laughed Billy irrepressibly
Yes
Cyril is happy of course
Still I cant imagine him in love with any woman
I think Marie can
I suppose so
I dont seem to remember her much still I think I saw her once or twice when I was on last June
Music teacher wasnt she
Yes
She is a very sweet girl
Hmm I suppose so
Still I think twould have been better if Cyril could have selected some one that wasnt musicalsay a more domestic wife
Hes so terribly unpractical himself about household matters
Billy gave a ringing laugh and stood up
The car had come to a stop before her own door
Do you
Just you wait till you see Maries trousseau ofeggbeaters and cake tins she chuckled
Mrs Hartwell looked blank
Whatever in the world do you mean Billy
she demanded fretfully as she followed her hostess from the car
I declare
arent you ever going to grow beyond making those absurd remarks of yours
Maybesometime laughed Billy as she took little Kates hand and led the way up the steps
Luncheon in the cozy diningroom at Hillside that day was not entirely a success
At least there were not present exactly the harmony and tranquillity that are conceded to be the best sauce for ones food
The wedding of course was the allabsorbing topic of conversation and Billy between Aunt Hannahs attempts to be polite Maries to be sweettempered Mrs Hartwells to be dictatorial and her own to be pacifying as well as firm had a hard time of it
If it had not been for two or three diversions created by little Kate the meal would have been indeed a dismal failure
But little Katemost of the time the personification of proper littlegirlhoodhad a disconcerting faculty of occasionally dropping a word here or a question there with startling effect
As for instance when she asked Billy Whos going to boss your wedding
and again when she calmly informed her mother that when she was married she was not going to have any wedding at all to bother with anyhow
She was going to elope and she should choose somebodys chauffeur because hed know how to go the farthest and fastest so her mother couldnt catch up with her and tell her how she ought to have done it
After luncheon Aunt Hannah went upstairs for rest and recuperation
Marie took little Kate and went for a brisk walkfor the same purpose
This left Billy alone with her guest
Perhaps you would like a nap too Mrs Hartwell suggested Billy as they passed into the livingroom
There was a curious note of almost hopefulness in her voice
Mrs Hartwell scorned naps and she said so very emphatically
She said something else too
Billy why do you always call me Mrs Hartwell in that stiff formal fashion
You used to call me Aunt Kate
 But I was very young then
Billys voice was troubled
Billy had been trying so hard for the last two hours to be the graciously cordial hostess to this womanBertrams sister
Very true
Then why not Kate now
Billy hesitated
She was wondering why it seemed so hard to call Mrs Hartwell Kate
Of course resumed the lady when youre Bertrams wife and my sister Why of course cried Billy in a sudden flood of understanding
Curiously enough she had never before thought of Mrs Hartwell as her sister
I shall be glad to call you Kateif you like
Thank you
I shall like it very much Billy nodded the other cordially
Indeed my dear Im very fond of you and I was delighted to hear you were to be my sister
If onlyit could have stayed William instead of Bertram
But it couldnt smiled Billy
It wasnt Williamthat I loved
But Bertramits so absurd
Absurd
The smile was gone now
Yes
Forgive me Billy but I was about as much surprised to hear of Bertrams engagement as I was of Cyrils
Billy grew a little white
But Bertram was never an avowedwoman hater like Cyril was he
 Womanhaterdear me no
He was a womanlover always
As if his eternal Face of a Girl didnt prove that
Bertram has always loved womento paint
But as for his ever taking them seriouslywhy Billy whats the matter
Billy had risen suddenly
If youll excuse me please just a few minutes Billy said very quietly
I want to speak to Rosa in the kitchen
Ill be backsoon
In the kitchen Billy spoke to Rosashe wondered afterwards what she said
Certainly she did not stay in the kitchen long enough to say much
In her own room a minute later with the door fast closed she took from her table the photograph of Bertram and held it in her two hands talking to it softly but a little wildly
I didnt listen
I didnt stay
Do you hear
I came to you
She shall not say anything that will make trouble between you and me
Ive suffered enough through her already
And she doesnt knowshe didnt know before and she doesnt now
Shes only imagining
I will not notnot believe that you love mejust to paint
No matter what they sayall of them
I will not Billy put the photograph back on the table then and went downstairs to her guest
She smiled brightly though her face was a little pale
I wondered if perhaps you wouldnt like some music she said pleasantly going straight to the piano
Indeed I would
agreed Mrs Hartwell
Billy sat down then and playedplayed as Mrs Hartwell had never heard her play before
Why Billy you amaze me she cried when the pianist stopped and whirled about
I had no idea you could play like that
Billy smiled enigmatically
Billy was thinking that Mrs Hartwell would indeed have been surprised if she had known that in that playing were herself the ride home the luncheon Bertram and the girlwhom Bertram did not love only to paint CHAPTER XIII CYRIL AND A WEDDING The twelfth was a beautiful day
Clear frosty air set the blood to tingling and the eyes to sparkling even if it were not your wedding day while if it were It was Marie Hawthorns wedding day and certainly her eyes sparkled and her blood tingled as she threw open the window of her room and breathed long and deep of the fresh morning air before going down to breakfast
They say Happy is the bride that the sun shines on  she whispered softly to an English sparrow that cocked his eye at her from a neighboring tree branch
As if a bride wouldnt be happy sun or no sun she scoffed tenderly as she turned to go downstairs
As it happens however tingling blood and sparkling eyes are a matter of more than weather or even weddings as was proved a little later when the telephone bell rang
Kate answered the ring
Hullo is that you Kate
called a despairing voice
Yes
Good morning Bertram
Isnt this a fine day for the wedding
Fine
Oh yes I suppose so though I must confess I havent noticed itand you wouldnt if you had a lunatic on your hands
A lunatic
Yes
Maybe you have though
Is Marie rampaging around the house like a wild creature and asking ten questions and making twenty threats to the minute
Certainly not
Dont be absurd Bertram
What do you mean
See here Kate that show comes off at twelve sharp doesnt it
Show indeed
retorted Kate indignantly
The wedding is at noon sharpas the best man should know very well
All right then tell Billy please to see that it is sharp or I wont answer for the consequences
What do you mean
What is the matter
Cyril
Hes broken loose at last
Ive been expecting it all along
Ive simply marvelled at the meekness with which he has submitted himself to be tied up with white ribbons and topped with roses
Nonsense Bertram
Well it amounts to that
Anyhow he thinks it does and hes wild
I wish you could have heard the thunderous performance on his piano with which he woke me up this morning
Billy says he plays everythinghis past present and future
All is if he was playing his future this morning I pity the girl whos got to live it with him
Bertram
Bertram chuckled remorselessly
Well I do
But Ill warrant he wasnt playing his future this morning
He was playing his presentthe wedding
You see hes just waked up to the fact that itll be a perfect orgy of women and other confusion and he doesnt like it
All the sameesic Ive had to assure him just fourteen times this morning that the ring the license the carriage the ministers fee and my sanity are all O K When he isnt asking questions hes making threats to snake the parson up there an hour ahead of time and be off with Marie before a soul comes
What an absurd idea
Cyril doesnt think so
Indeed Kate Ive had a hard struggle to convince him that the guests wouldnt think it the most delightful experience of their lives if they should come and find the ceremony over with and the bride gone
Well you remind Cyril please that there are other people besides himself concerned in this wedding observed Kate icily
I have purred Bertram and he says all right let them have it then
Hes gone now to look up proxy marriages I believe
Proxy marriages indeed
Come come Bertram Ive got something to do this morning besides to stand here listening to your nonsense
See that you and Cyril get here on timethats all
And she hung up the receiver with an impatient jerk
She turned to confront the startled eyes of the bride elect
What is it
Is anything wrongwith Cyril
faltered Marie
Kate laughed and raised her eyebrows slightly
Nothing but a little stage fright my dear
Stage fright
Yes
Bertram says hes trying to find some one to play his role I believe in the ceremony
Mrs
Hartwell At the look of dismayed terror that came into Maries face Mrs Hartwell laughed reassuringly
There there dear child dont look so horror stricken
There probably never was a man yet who wouldnt have fled from the wedding part of his marriage if he could and you know how Cyril hates fuss and feathers
The wonder to me is that hes stood it as long as he has
I thought I saw it coming last night at the rehearsaland now I know I did
Marie still looked distressed
But he never saidI thought She stopped helplessly
Of course he didnt child
He never said anything but that he loved you and he never thought anything but that you were going to be his
Men never dotill the wedding day
Then they never think of anything but a place to run she finished laughingly as she began to arrange on a stand the quantity of little white boxes waiting for her
But if hed told mein time I wouldnt have had a thingbut the minister faltered Marie
And when you think so much of a pretty wedding too
Nonsense
It isnt good for a man to give up to his whims like that
Maries cheeks grew a deeper pink
Her nostrils dilated a little
It wouldnt be a whim Mrs Hartwell and I should be glad to give up she said with decision
Mrs Hartwell laughed again her amused eyes on Maries face
Dear me child
dont you know that if men had their way theydwell if men married men thered never be such a thing in the world as a shower bouquet or a piece of wedding cake
There was no reply
A little precipitately Marie turned and hurried away
A moment later she was laying a restraining hand on Billy who was filling tall vases with superb longstemmed roses in the kitchen
Billy please she panted couldnt we do without those
Couldnt we send them to somesome hospitaland the wedding cake too and The wedding caketo some hospital No of course notto the hospital
It would make them sick to eat it wouldnt it
That there was no shadow of a smile on Maries face showed how desperate indeed was her state of mind
I only meant that I didnt want them myself nor the shower bouquet nor the rooms darkened nor little Kate as the flower girland would you mind very much if I asked you not to be my maid of honor
Marie Marie covered her face with her hands then and began to sob brokenly so there was nothing for Billy to do but to take her into her arms with soothing little murmurs and pettings
By degrees then the whole story came out
Billy almost laughedbut she almost cried too
Then she said Dearie I dont believe Cyril feels or acts half so bad as Bertram and Kate make out and anyhow if he did its too late now toto send the wedding cake to the hospital or make any other of the little changes you suggest
Billys lips puckered into a halfsmile but her eyes were grave
Besides there are your music pupils trimming the livingroom this minute with evergreen theres little Kate making her flowergirl wreath and Mrs Hartwell stacking cake boxes in the hall to say nothing of Rosa gloating over the best china in the diningroom and Aunt Hannah putting purple bows into the new lace cap shes counting on wearing
Only think how disappointed theyd all be if I should say Never mindstop that
Maries just going to have a minister
No fuss no feathers
Why dearie even the roses are hanging their heads for grief she went on mistily lifting with gentle fingers one of the fullpetalled pink beauties near her
Besides theres yourguests
Oh of course I knew I couldntreally sighed Marie as she turned to go upstairs all the light and joy gone from her face
Billy once assured that Marie was out of hearing ran to the telephone
Bertram answered
Bertram tell Cyril I want to speak to him please
All right dear but go easy
Better strike up your tuning fork to find his pitch today
Youll discover its a high one all right
A moment later Cyrils tersely nervous Good morning Billy came across the line
Billy drew in her breath and cast a hurriedly apprehensive glance over her shoulder to make sure Marie was not near
Cyril she called in a low voice if you care a shred for Marie for heavens sake call her up and tell her that you dote on pink roses and pink ribbons and pink breakfastsand pink wedding cake
But I dont
Oh yes you dotoday
You wouldif you could see Marie now
What do you mean
Nothing only she overheard part of Bertrams nonsensical talk with Kate a little while ago and shes ready to cast the last ravelling of white satin and conventionality behind her and go with you to the justice of the peace
Sensible girl
Yes but she cant you know with fifty guests coming to the wedding and twice as many more to the reception
Honestly Cyril shes brokenhearted
You must do something
Shes coming
And the receiver clicked sharply into place
Five minutes later Marie was called to the telephone
Dejectedly wistfuleyed she went
Just what were the words that hummed across the wire into the pink little ear of the bridetobe Billy never knew but a Marie that was anything but wistfuleyed and dejected left the telephone a little later and was heard very soon in the room above trilling merry snatches of a little song
Contentedly then Billy went back to her roses
It was a pretty wedding a very pretty wedding
Every one said that
The pink and green of the decorations the soft lights Kate had had her way about darkening the rooms the pretty frocks and smiling faces of the guests all helped
Then there were the dainty flower girl little Kate the charming maid of honor Billy the stalwart handsome best man Bertram to say nothing of the delicately beautiful bride who looked like some fairy visitor from another world in the floating shimmer of her gossamer silk and tulle
There was too not quite unnoticed the bridegroom tall of distinguished bearing and with features that were clear cut andtodayrather pale
Then came the receptionthe women and confusion of Cyrils fearsfollowed by the going away of the bride and groom with its merry warfare of confetti and old shoes
At four oclock however with only William and Bertram remaining for guests something like quiet descended at last on the little house
Well its over sighed Billy dropping exhaustedly into a big chair in the livingroom
And well over supplemented Aunt Hannah covering her white shawl with a warmer blue one
Yes I think it was nodded Kate
It was really a very pretty wedding
With your help Kateeh
teased William
Well I flatter myself I did do some good bridled Kate as she turned to help little Kate take the flower wreath from her head
Even if you did hurry into my room and scare me into conniption fits telling me Id be late laughed Billy
Kate tossed her head
Well how was I to know that Aunt Hannahs clock only meant halfpast eleven when it struck twelve
she retorted
Everybody laughed
Oh well it was a pretty wedding declared William with a long sigh
Itll dofor an understudy said Bertram softly for Billys ears alone
Only the added color and the swift glance showed that Billy heard for when she spoke she said And didnt Cyril behave beautifully
Most every time I looked at him he was talking to some woman
Oh no he wasntbegging your pardon my dear objected Bertram
I watched him too even more closely than you did and it was always the woman who was talking to Cyril Billy laughed
Well anyhow she maintained he listened
He didnt run away
As if a bridegroom could
cried Kate
Im going to avowed Bertram his nose in the air
Pooh
scoffed Kate
Then she added eagerly You must be married in church Billy and in the evening
Bertrams nose came suddenly out of the air
His eyes met Kates squarely
Billy hasnt decided yet how she does want to be married he said with unnecessary emphasis
Billy laughed and interposed a quick change of subject
I think people had a pretty good time too for a wedding dont you
she asked
I was sorry Mary Jane couldnt be heretwould have been such a good chance for him to meet our friends
AsMary Jane asked Bertram a little stiffly
Really my dear murmured Aunt Hannah I think it would be more respectful to call him by his name
By the way what is his name
questioned William
Thats what we dont know laughed Billy
Well you know the Arkwright dont you
put in Bertram
Bertram too laughed but it was a little forcedly
I suppose if you knew his name was Methuselah you wouldnt call him thatyet would you
Billy clapped her hands and threw a merry glance at Aunt Hannah
There
we never thought of Methuselah  she gurgled gleefully
Maybe it is Methuselah nowMethuselah John
You see hes told us to try to guess it she explained turning to William but honestly I dont believe whatever it is Ill ever think of him as anything but Mary Jane
 Well as far as I can judge he has nobody but himself to thank for that so he cant do any complaining smiled William as he rose to go
Well how about it Bertram
I suppose youre going to stay a while to comfort the lonelyeh boy
Of course he isand so are you too Uncle William spoke up Billy with affectionate cordiality
As if Id let you go back to a forlorn dinner in that great house tonight
Indeed no
William smiled hesitated and sat down
Well of course he began
Yes of course finished Billy quickly
Ill telephone Pete that youll stay hereboth of you
It was at this point that little Kate who had been turning interested eyes from one brother to the other interposed a clear highpitched question
Uncle William didnt you want to marry my goingtobeAunt Billy
Kate
gasped her mother didnt I tell you Her voice trailed into an incoherent murmur of remonstrance
Billy blushed
Bertram said a low word under his breath
Aunt Hannahs Oh my grief and conscience
was almost a groan
William laughed lightly
Well my little lady he suggested let us put it the other way and say that quite probably she didnt want to marry me
Does she want to marry Uncle Bertram
Kate
gasped Billy and Mrs Hartwell together this time fearful of what might be coming next
Well hope so nodded Uncle William speaking in a cheerfully matteroffact voice intended to discourage curiosity
The little girl frowned and pondered
Her elders cast about in their minds for a speedy change of subject but their somewhat scattered wits were not quick enough
It was little Kate who spoke next
Uncle William would she have got Uncle Cyril if Aunt Marie hadnt nabbed him first
Kate
The word was a chorus of dismay this time
Mrs Hartwell struggled to her feet
Come come Kate we must go upstairsto bed she stammered
The little girl drew back indignantly
To bed
Why mama I havent had my supper yet
What
Oh sure enoughthe lights
I forgot
Well then come upto change your dress finished Mrs Hartwell as with a despairing look and gesture she led her young daughter from the room
CHAPTER XIV M J
MAKES ANOTHER MOVE Billy came downstairs on the thirteenth of December to find everywhere the peculiar flatness that always follows a day which for weeks has been the focus of ones aims and thoughts and labor
Its just as if everything had stopped at Maries wedding and there wasnt anything more to do she complained to Aunt Hannah at the breakfast table
Everything seems soqueer
It wontlong dear smiled Aunt Hannah tranquilly as she buttered her roll specially after Bertram comes back
How long does he stay in New York
Only three days but Im just sure its going to seem three weeks now sighed Billy
But he simply had to goelse he wouldnt have gone
Ive no doubt of it observed Aunt Hannah
And at the meaning emphasis of her words Billy laughed a little
After a minute she said aggrievedly I had supposed that I could at least have a sort of after the ball celebration this morning picking up and straightening things around
But John and Rosa have done it all
There isnt so much as a rose leaf anywhere on the floor
Of course most of the flowers went to the hospital last night anyway
As for Maries roomit looks as spickandspan as if it had never seen a scrap of ribbon or an inch of tulle
Butthe wedding presents
All carried down to the kitchen and half packed now ready to go over to the new home
John says hell take them over in Peggy this afternoon after he takes Mrs Hartwells trunk to Uncle Williams
Well you can at least go over to the apartment and work suggested Aunt Hannah hopefully
Humph
Can I
scoffed Billy
As if I couldwhen Marie left strict orders that not one thing was to be touched till she got here
They arranged everything but the presents before the wedding anyway and Marie wants to fix those herself after she gets back
Mercy
Aunt Hannah if I should so much as move a plate one inch in the china closet Marie would know it and change it when she got home laughed Billy as she rose from the table
No I cant go to work over there
But theres your music my dear
You said you were going to write some new songs after the wedding
I was sighed Billy walking to the window and looking listlessly at the bare brown world outside but I cant write songswhen there arent any songs in my head to write
No of course not but theyll come dear in time
Youre tired now soothed Aunt Hannah as she turned to leave the room
Its the reaction of course murmured Aunt Hannah to herself on the way upstairs
Shes had the whole thing on her handsdear child
A few minutes later from the livingroom came a plaintive little minor melody
Billy was at the piano
Kate and little Kate had the night before gone home with William
It had been a sudden decision brought about by the realization that Bertrams trip to New York would leave William alone
Her trunk was to be carried there today and she would leave for home from there at the end of a two or three days visit
It began to snow at twelve oclock
All the morning the sky had been gray and threatening and the threats took visible shape at noon in myriads of white snow feathers that filled the air to the blinding point and turned the brown bare world into a thing of fairylike beauty
Billy however with a rare frown upon her face looked out upon it with disapproving eyes
I was going in townand I believe Ill go now she cried
Dont dear please dont begged Aunt Hannah
See the flakes are smaller now and the wind is coming up
Were in for a blizzard Im sure we are
And you know you have some cold already
All right sighed Billy
Then its me for the knitting work and the fire I suppose she finished with a whimsicality that did not hide the wistful disappointment of her voice
She was not knitting however she was sewing with Aunt Hannah when at four oclock Rosa brought in the card
Billy glanced at the name then sprang to her feet with a glad little cry
Its Mary Jane
she exclaimed as Rosa disappeared
Now wasnt he a dear to think to come today
Youll be down wont you
Aunt Hannah smiled even while she frowned
Oh Billy
she remonstrated
Yes Ill come down of course a little later and Im glad Mr
Arkwright came she said with reproving emphasis
Billy laughed and threw a mischievous glance over her shoulder
All right she nodded
Ill go and tell Mr
Arkwright youll be down directly
In the livingroom Billy greeted her visitor with a frankly cordial hand
How did you know Mr Arkwright that I was feeling specially restless and lonesome to day
she demanded
A glad light sprang to the mans dark eyes
I didnt know it he rejoined
I only knew that I was specially restless and lonesome myself
Arkwrights voice was not quite steady
The unmistakable friendliness in the girls words and manner had sent a quick throb of joy to his heart
Her evident delight in his coming had filled him with rapture
He could not know that it was only the chill of the snowstorm that had given warmth to her handclasp the dreariness of the day that had made her greeting so cordial the loneliness of a maiden whose lover is away that had made his presence so welcome
Well Im glad you came anyway sighed Billy contentedly though I suppose I ought to be sorry that you were lonesomebut Im afraid Im not for now youll know just how I felt so you wont mind if Im a little wild and erratic
You see the tension has snapped she added laughingly as she seated herself
Tension
The wedding you know
For so many weeks weve been seeing just December twelfth that wed apparently forgotten all about the thirteenth that came after it so when I got up this morning I felt just as you do when the clock has stopped ticking
But it was a lovely wedding Mr Arkwright
Im sorry you could not be here
Thank you so am Ithough usually I will confess Im not much good at attending functions and meeting strangers
As perhaps youve guessed Miss Neilson Im not particularly a society chap
Of course you arent
People who are doing thingsreal thingsseldom are
But we arent the society kind ourselves you knownot the capital S kind
We like sociability which is vastly different from liking Society
Oh we have friends to be sure who dote on pink teas and purple pageants as Cyril calls them and we even go ourselves sometimes
But if you had been here yesterday Mr Arkwright youd have met lots like yourself men and women who are doing things singing playing painting illustrating writing
Why we even had a poet sironly he didnt have long hair so he didnt look the part a bit she finished laughingly
Is long hairnecessaryfor poets
Arkwrights smile was quizzical
Dear me no not now
But it used to be didnt it
And for painters too
But now they look just likefolks
Arkwright laughed
It isnt possible that you are sighing for the velvet coats and flowing ties of the past is it Miss Neilson
Im afraid it is dimpled Billy
I love velvet coats and flowing ties
May singers wear them
I shall don them at once anyhow at a venture declared the man promptly
Billy smiled and shook her head
I dont think you will
You all like your horrid fuzzy tweeds and worsteds too well
You speak with feeling
One would almost suspect that you already had tried to bring about a reformand failed
Perhaps Mr Cyril now or Mr Bertram Arkwright stopped with a whimsical smile
Billy flushed a little
As it happened she had indeed had a merry tilt with Bertram on that very subject and he had laughingly promised that his wedding present to her would be a velvet house coat for himself
It was on the point of Billys tongue now to say this to Arkwright but another glance at the provoking smile on his lips drove the words back in angry confusion
For the second time in the presence of this man Billy found herself unable to refer to her engagement to Bertram Henshawthough this time she did not in the least doubt that Arkwright already knew of it
With a little gesture of playful scorn she rose and went to the piano
Come let us try some duets she suggested
Thats lots nicer than quarrelling over velvet coats and Aunt Hannah will be down presently to hear us sing
Before she had ceased speaking Arkwright was at her side with an exclamation of eager acquiescence
It was after the second duet that Arkwright asked a little diffidently
Have you written any new songs lately
No
Youre going to
Perhapsif I find one to write
You meanyou have no words
Yesand no
I have some words both of my own and other peoples but I havent found in any one of them yeta melody
Arkwright hesitated
His right hand went almost to his inner coat pocketthen fell back at his side
The next moment he picked up a sheet of music
Are you too tired to try this
he asked
A puzzled frown appeared on Billys face
Why no but Well children Ive come down to hear the music announced Aunt Hannah smilingly from the doorway onlyBilly will you run up and get my pink shawl too
This room is colder than I thought and theres only the white one down here
Of course cried Billy rising at once
You shall have a dozen shawls if you like she laughed as she left the room
What a cozy time it wasthe hour that followed after Billy returned with the pink shawl
Outside the wind howled at the windows and flung the snow against the glass in sleety crashes
Inside the man and the girl sang duets until they were tired then with Aunt Hannah they feasted royally on the buttered toast tea and frosted cakes that Rosa served on a little table before the roaring fire
It was then that Arkwright talked of himself telling them something of his studies and of the life he was living
After all you see theres just this difference between my friends and yours he said at last
Your friends are doing things
Theyve succeeded
Mine havent yettheyre only trying
But they will succeed cried Billy
Some of them amended the man
Notall of them
Billy looked a little troubled
Arkwright shook his head slowly
No
They couldntall of them you know
Some havent the talent some havent the perseverance and some havent the money
But all that seems such a pitywhen theyve tried grieved Billy
It is a pity Miss Neilson
Disappointed hopes are always a pity arent they
Yyes sighed the girl
Butif there were only something one could do tohelp
Arkwrights eyes grew deep with feeling but his voice when he spoke was purposely light
Im afraid that would be quite too big a contract for even your generosity Miss Neilson to mend all the broken hopes in the world he prophesied
I have known great good to come from great disappointments remarked Aunt Hannah a bit didactically
So have I laughed Arkwright still determined to drive the troubled shadow from the face he was watching so intently
For instance a fellow I know was feeling all cut up last Friday because he was just too late to get into Symphony Hall on the twentyfivecent admission
Half an hour afterwards his disappointment was turned to joya friend who had an orchestra chair couldnt use his ticket that day and so handed it over to him
Billy turned interestedly
What are those twentyfivecent tickets to the Symphony
Thenyou dont know
Not exactly
Ive heard of them in a vague fashion
Then youve missed one of the sights of Boston if you havent ever seen that long line of patient waiters at the door of Symphony Hall of a Friday morning
Morning
But the concert isnt till afternoon
No but the waiting is retorted Arkwright
You see those admissions are limitedfive hundred and five I believeand theyre rush seats at that
First come first served and if youre too late you arent served at all
So the first arrival comes bright and early
Ive heard that he has been known to come at peep of day when theres a Paderewski or a Melba for a drawing card
But Ive got my doubts of that
Anyhow I never saw them there much before halfpast eight
But manys the cold stormy day Ive seen those steps in front of the Hall packed for hours and a long line reaching away up the avenue
Billys eyes widened
And theyll stand all that time and wait
To be sure they will
You see each pays twentyfive cents at the door until the limit is reached then the rest are turned away
Naturally they dont want to be turned away so they try to get there early enough to be among the fortunate five hundred and five
Besides the earlier you are the better seat you are likely to get
But only think of standing all that time
Oh they bring camp chairs sometimes Ive heard and then there are the steps
You dont know what a really fine seat a stone step isif you have a big enough bundle of newspapers to cushion it with
They bring their luncheons too with books papers and knitting work for fine days Ive been toldsome of them
All the comforts of home you see smiled Arkwright
Why howhow dreadful
stammered Billy
Oh but they dont think its dreadful at all corrected Arkwright quickly
For twenty five cents they can hear all that you hear down in your orchestra chair for which youve paid so high a premium
But whowho are they
Where do they come from
Who would go and stand hours like that to get a twentyfivecent seat
questioned Billy
Who are they
Anybody everybody from anywhere
everywhere people who have the music hunger but not the money to satisfy it he rejoined
Students teachers a little milliner from South Boston a little dressmaker from Chelsea a housewife from Cambridge a stranger from the uttermost parts of the earth maybe a widow who used to sit downstairs or a professor who has seen better days
Really to know that line you should see it for yourself Miss Neilson smiled Arkwright as he reluctantly rose to go
Some Friday however before you take your seat just glance up at that packed top balcony and judge by the faces you see there whether their owners think theyre getting their twentyfivecents worth or not
I will nodded Billy with a smile but the smile came from her lips only not her eyes Billy was wishing at that moment that she owned the whole of Symphony Hallto give away
But that was like Billy
When she was seven years old she had proposed to her Aunt Ella that they take all the thirtyfive orphans from the Hampden Falls Orphan Asylum to live with them so that little Sallie Cook and the other orphans might have ice cream every day if they wanted it
Since then Billy had always been tryingin a wayto give ice cream to some one who wanted it
Arkwright was almost at the door when he turned abruptly
His face was an abashed red
From his pocket he had taken a small folded paper
Do you supposein thisyou might find that melody
he stammered in a low voice
The next moment he was gone having left in Billys fingers a paper upon which was written in a clearcut masculine hand six fourline stanzas
Billy read them at once hurriedly then more carefully
Why theyre beautiful she breathed just beautiful
Where did he get them I wonder
Its a love songand such a pretty one
I believe there is a melody in it she exulted pausing to hum a line or two
There isI know there is and Ill write itfor Bertram she finished crossing joyously to the piano
Halfway down Corey Hill at that moment Arkwright was buffeting the wind and snow
He too was thinking joyously of those stanzas joyously yet at the same time fearfully
Arkwright himself had written those linesthough not for Bertram
CHAPTER XV MR BILLY AND MISS MARY JANE On the fourteenth of December Billy came downstairs alert interested and happy
She had received a dear letter from Bertram mailed on the way to New York the sun was shining and her fingers were fairly tingling to put on paper the little melody that was now surging riotously through her brain
Emphatically the restlessness of the day before was gone now
Once more Billys clock had begun to tick
After breakfast Billy went straight to the telephone and called up Arkwright
Even one side of the conversation Aunt Hannah did not hear very clearly but in five minutes a radiant faced Billy danced into the room
Aunt Hannah just listen
Only think Mary Jane wrote the words himself so of course I can use them
Billy dear cant you say Mr
Arkwright
pleaded Aunt Hannah
Billy laughed and gave the anxiouseyed little old lady an impulsive hug
Of course
Ill say His Majesty if you like dear she chuckled
But did you heardid you realize
Theyre his own words so theres no question of rights or permission or anything
And hes coming up this afternoon to hear my melody and to make a few little changes in the words maybe
Oh Aunt Hannah you dont know how good it seems to get into my music again
Yes yes dear of course but Aunt Hannahs sentence ended in a vaguely troubled pause
Billy turned in surprise
Why Aunt Hannah arent you glad
You said youd be glad
Yes dear and I amvery glad
Its only if it doesnt take too much timeand if Bertram doesnt mind
Billy flushed
She laughed a little bitterly
No it wont take too much time I fancy andso far as Bertram is concernedif what Sister Kate says is true Aunt Hannah hell be glad to have me occupy a little of my time with something besides himself
Fiddlededee
bristled Aunt Hannah
What did she mean by that
Billy smiled ruefully
Well probably I did need it
She said it night before last just before she went home with Uncle William
She declared that I seemed to forget entirely that Bertram belonged to his Art first before he belonged to me and that it was exactly as she had supposed it would bea perfect absurdity for Bertram to think of marrying anybody
Fiddlededee
ejaculated the irate Aunt Hannah even more sharply
I hope you have too much good sense to mind what Kate says Billy
Yes I know sighed the girl but of course I can see some things for myself and I suppose I did makea little fuss about his going to New York the other night
And I will own that Ive had a real struggle with myself sometimes lately not to mindhis giving so much time to his portrait painting
And of course both of those are very reprehensiblein an artists wife she finished a little tremulously
Humph
Well I dont think I should worry about that observed Aunt Hannah with grim positiveness
No I dont mean to smiled Billy wistfully
I only told you so youd understand that it was just as well if I did have something to take up my mindbesides Bertram
And of course music would be the most natural thing
Yes of course agreed Aunt Hannah
And it seems actually almost providential that MaryI mean Mr Arkwright is here to help me now that Cyril is gone went on Billy still a little wistfully
Yes of course
He isnt likea stranger murmured Aunt Hannah
Aunt Hannahs voice sounded as if she were trying to convince herself of something
No indeed
He seems just like one of the family to me almost as if he were reallyyour niece Mary Jane laughed Billy
Aunt Hannah moved restlessly
Billy she hazarded he knows of course of your engagement
Why of course he does Aunt Hannah everybody does
Billys eyes were plainly surprised
Yes yes of coursehe must subsided Aunt Hannah confusedly hoping that Billy would not divine the hidden reason behind her question
She was relieved when Billys next words showed that she had not divined it
I told you didnt I
Hes coming up this afternoon
He cant get here till five though but hes so interested
Hes about as crazy over the thing as I am
And its going to be fine Aunt Hannah when its done
You just wait and see
she finished gayly as she tripped from the room
Left to herself Aunt Hannah drew a long breath
Im glad she didnt suspect she was thinking
I believe shed consider even the question disloyal to Bertramdear child
And of course MaryAunt Hannah corrected herself with cheeks aflameI mean Mr Arkwright does know
It was just here however that Aunt Hannah was mistaken
Mr Arkwright did notknow
He had not reached Boston when the engagement was announced
He knew none of Billys friends in town save the Henshaw brothers
He had not heard from Calderwell since he came to Boston
The very evident intimacy of Billy with the Henshaw brothers he accepted as a matter of course knowing the history of their acquaintance and the fact that Billy was Mr William Henshaws namesake
As to Bertram being Billys lover that idea had long ago been killed at birth by Calderwells emphatic assertion that the artist would never care for any girlexcept to paint
Since coming to Boston Arkwright had seen little of the two together
His work his friends and his general mode of life precluded that
Because of all this therefore Arkwright did not know which was a pityfor Arkwright and for some others
Promptly at five oclock that afternoon Arkwright rang Billys doorbell and was admitted by Rosa to the livingroom where Billy was at the piano
Billy sprang to her feet with a joyous word of greeting
Im so glad youve come she sighed happily
I want you to hear the melody your pretty words have sung to me
Though maybe after all you wont like it you know she finished with arch wistfulness
As if I could help liking it smiled the man trying to keep from his voice the ecstatic delight that the touch of her hand had brought him
Billy shook her head and seated herself again at the piano
The words are lovely she declared sorting out two or three sheets of manuscript music from the quantity on the rack before her
But theres one placethe rhythm you knowif you could change it
Therebut listen
First Im going to play it straight through to you
And she dropped her fingers to the keyboard
The next moment a tenderly sweet melodywith only a chord now and then for accompanimentfilled Arkwrights soul with rapture
Then Billy began to sing very softly the words
No wonder Arkwrights soul was filled with rapture
They were his words wrung straight from his heart and they were being sung by the girl for whom they were written
They were being sung with feeling tooso evident a feeling that the mans pulse quickened and his eyes flashed a sudden fire
Arkwright could not know of course that Billy in her own mind was singing that songto Bertram Henshaw
The fire was still in Arkwrights eyes when the song was ended but Billy very plainly did not see it
With a frowning sigh and a murmured There
she began to talk of rhythm and accent and cadence and to point out with anxious care why three syllables instead of two were needed at the end of a certain line
From this she passed eagerly to the accompaniment and Arkwright at once found himself lost in a maze of minor thirds and diminished sevenths until he was forced to turn from the singer to the song
Still watching her a little later he noticed her absorbed face and eager enthusiasm her earnest pursuance of an elusive harmony and he wondered did she or did she not sing that song with feeling a little while before
Arkwright had not settled this question to his own satisfaction when Aunt Hannah came in at halfpast five and he was conscious of a vague disappointment as he rose to greet her
Billy however turned an untroubled face to the newcomer
Were doing finely Aunt Hannah she cried
Then suddenly she flung a laughing question to the man
How about it sir
Are we going to put on the titlepage Words by Mary Jane Arkwrightor will you unveil the mystery for us now
Have you guessed it
he bantered
Nounless its Methuselah John
We did think of that the other day
Wrong again
he laughed
Then itll have to be Mary Jane  retorted Billy with calm naughtiness refusing to meet Aunt Hannahs beseechingly reproving eyes
Then suddenly she chuckled
It would be a combination wouldnt it
Words by Mary Jane Arkwright
Music by Billy Neilson
Wed have sighing swains writing to Dear Miss Arkwright telling how touching were her words and lovelorn damsels thanking Mr
Neilson for his soulinspiring music
Billy my dear
remonstrated Aunt Hannah faintly
Yes yes I know that was badand I wont again truly promised Billy
But her eyes danced and the next moment she had whirled about on the piano stool and dashed into a Chopin waltz
The room itself then seemed to be full of the twinkling feet of elves
CHAPTER XVI A GIRL AND A BIT OF LOWESTOFT Immediately after breakfast the next morning Billy was summoned to the telephone
Oh good morning Uncle William she called in answer to the masculine voice that replied to her Hullo
Billy are you very busy this morning
No indeednot if you want me
Well I do my dear
Uncle Williams voice was troubled
I want you to go with me if you can to see a Mrs Greggory
Shes got a teapot I want
Its a genuine Lowestoft Harlow says
Will you go
Of course I will
What time
Eleven if you can at Park Street
Shes at the West End
I dont dare to put it off for fear Ill lose it
Harlow says others will have to know of it of course
You see shes just made up her mind to sell it and asked him to find a customer
I wouldnt trouble you but he says theyre peculiarthe daughter especiallyand may need some careful handling
Thats why I wanted youthough I wanted you to see the teapot tooitll be yours some day you know
Billy all alone at her end of the line blushed
That she was one day to be mistress of the Strata and all it contained was still anything but common to her
Id love to see it and Ill come gladly but Im afraid I wont be much help Uncle William she worried
Ill take the risk of that
You see Harlow says that about half the time she isnt sure she wants to sell it after all
Why how funny
Well Ill come
At eleven you say at Park Street
Yes and thank you my dear
I tried to get Kate to go too but she wouldnt
By the way Im going to bring you home to luncheon
Kate leaves this afternoon you know and its been so snowy she hasnt thought best to try to get over to the house
Maybe Aunt Hannah would come too for luncheon
Would she
Im afraid not returned Billy with a rueful laugh
Shes got three shawls on this morning and you know that always means that shes felt a draft somewherepoor dear
Ill tell her though and Ill see you at eleven finished Billy as she hung up the receiver
Promptly at the appointed time Billy met Uncle William at Park Street and together they set out for the West End street named on the paper in his pocket
But when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached the man looked about him with a troubled frown
I declare Billy Im not sure but wed better turn back he fretted
I didnt mean to take you to such a place as this
Billy shivered a little but after one glance at the mans disappointed face she lifted a determined chin
Nonsense Uncle William
Of course you wont turn back
I dont mindfor myself but only think of the people whose homes are here she finished just above her breath
Mrs Greggory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four flights of stairs up which William Henshaw toiled with increasing weariness and dismay punctuating each flight with a despairing Billy really I think we should turn back
But Billy would not turn back and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweetfaced woman who said yes she was Mrs Greggory yes she was
Even as she uttered the words however she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the hall behind them a voice denying her assertion
Mrs Greggory was a cripple
Her slender little body was poised on two oncecostly crutches
Both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one
Billys eyes were brimming with pity and dismay
Mechanically she had taken the chair toward which Mrs Greggory had motioned her
She had tried not to seem to look about her but there was not one detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain
Mrs Greggory had seated herself now and William Henshaw had cleared his throat nervously
Billy did not know whether she herself were the more distressed or the more relieved to hear him stammer WeerI came from Harlow Mrs Greggory
He gave me to understand you had an erteapot thater With his eyes on the cracked white crockery pitcher on the table William Henshaw came to a helpless pause
A curious expression or rather series of expressions crossed Mrs Greggorys face
Terror joy dismay and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy
Relief in the end conquered though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke
The Lowestoft
Yes Im so gladthat is of course I must be glad
Ill get it
Her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair
There was only despairing sorrow on her face now
The man rose at once
But madam perhapsdont let me I he began stammeringly
Of courseBilly
he broke off in an entirely different voice
Jove
What a beauty
Mrs Greggory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the collectors chair disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot creamy in tint and exquisitely decorated in a rose design
Near it set a traylike plate of the same ware and decoration
If youll lift it down please yourself motioned Mrs Greggory
I dont like towith these she explained tapping the crutches at her side
With fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation the collector reached for the teapot
His eyes sparkled
Billy look what a beauty
And its a Lowestoft too the real thingthe genuine true soft paste
And theres the traydid you notice
he exulted turning back to the shelf
You dont see that every day
They get separated most generally you know
These pieces have been in our family for generations said Mrs Greggory with an accent of pride
Youll find them quite perfect I think
Perfect
I should say they were cried the man
They are thenvaluable
Mrs Greggorys voice shook
Indeed they are
But you must know that
I have been told so
Yet to me their chief value of course lies in their association
My mother and my grandmother owned that teapot sir
Again her voice broke
William Henshaw cleared his throat
But madam if you do not wish to sell He stopped abruptly
His longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china
Mrs Greggory gave a low cry
But I dothat is I must
Mr Harlow says that it is valuable and that it will bring in money and we needmoney
She threw a quick glance toward the hall door though she did not pause in her remarks
I cant do much at work that pays
I sew she nodded toward the machine by the window but with only one foot to make it go You see the other isis inclined to shirk a little she finished with a wistful whimsicality
Billy turned away sharply
There was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes
She was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against she did not know what exactly but she fancied it was against the teapot or against Uncle William for wanting the teapot or for not wanting itif he did not buy it
And so you see I do very much wish to sell Mrs Greggory said then
Perhaps you will tell me what it would be worth to you she concluded tremulously
The collectors eyes glowed
He picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it
Then he turned to the tray
After a moment he spoke
I have only one other in my collection as rare he said
I paid a hundred dollars for that
I shall be glad to give you the same for this madam
Mrs Greggory started visibly
A hundred dollars
So much as that
she cried almost joyously
Why nothing else that weve had has brought Of course if its worth that to you She paused suddenly
A quick step had sounded in the hall outside
The next moment the door flew open and a young woman who looked to be about twentythree or twenty four years old burst into the room
Mother only think Ive She stopped and drew back a little
Her startled eyes went from one face to another then dropped to the Lowestoft teapot in the mans hands
Her expression changed at once
She shut the door quickly and hurried forward
Mother what is it
Who are these people
she asked sharply
Billy lifted her chin the least bit
She was conscious of a feeling which she could not name Billy was not used to being called these people in precisely that tone of voice
William Henshaw too raised his chin
He also was not in the habit of being referred to as these people
My name is Henshaw MissGreggory I presume he said quietly
I was sent here by Mr
Harlow
About the teapot my dear you know stammered Mrs Greggory wetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and conciliation
This gentleman says he will be glad to buy it
Er my daughter Alice Mr Henshaw she hastened on in embarrassed introduction and Miss Neilson supplied the man as she looked at Billy and hesitated
A swift red stained Alice Greggorys face
With barely an acknowledgment of the introductions she turned to her mother
Yes dear but that wont be necessary now
As I started to tell you when I came in I have two new pupils and soturning to the man again I thank you for your offer but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present
As she finished her sentence she stepped one side as if to make room for the strangers to reach the door
William Henshaw frowned angrilythat was the man but his eyesthe collectors eyes sought the teapot longingly
Before either the man or the collector could speak however Mrs Greggory interposed quick words of remonstrance
But Alice my dear she almost sobbed
You didnt wait to let me tell you
Mr Henshaw says it is worth a hundred dollars to him
He will give usa hundred dollars
A hundred dollars
echoed the girl faintly
It was plain to be seen that she was wavering
Billy watching the little scene with mingled emotions saw the glance with which the girl swept the bare little room and she knew that there was not a patch or darn or poverty spot in sight or out of sight which that glance did not encompass
Billy was wondering which she herself desired morethat Uncle William should buy the Lowestoft or that he should not
She knew she wished Mrs Greggory to have the hundred dollars
There was no doubt on that point
Then Uncle William spoke
His words carried the righteous indignation of the man who thinks he has been unjustly treated and the final plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp
I am very sorry of course if my offer has annoyed you he said stiffly
I certainly should not have made it had I not had Mrs Greggorys assurance that she wished to sell the teapot
Alice Greggory turned as if stung
Wished to sell She repeated the words with superb disdain
She was plainly very angry
Her bluegray eyes gleamed with scorn and her whole face was suffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair
Do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that shes treasured all her life a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was livingnot merely existing
Alice Alice my love
protested the sweet faced cripple agitatedly
I cant help it stormed the girl hotly
I know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmothers
I know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all
And then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it
Perhaps they think too we wish to live in a place like this that we wish to have rugs that are darned and chairs that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes
Alice
gasped Mrs Greggory in dismayed horror
With a little outward fling of her two hands Alice Greggory stepped back
Her face had grown white again
I beg your pardon of course she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet
I should not have spoken so
You are very kind Mr Henshaw but I do not think we care to sell the Lowestoft today
Both words and manner were obviously a dismissal and with a puzzled sigh William Henshaw picked up his hat
His face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do or what to say but it showed too as clearly that he longed to do something or say something
During the brief minute that he hesitated however Billy sprang forward
Mrs Greggory please wont you let me buy the teapot
And thenwont you keep it for mehere
I havent the hundred dollars with me but Ill send it right away
You will let me do it wont you
It was an impulsive speech and a foolish one of course from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness but it was one that might be expected perhaps from Billy
Mrs Greggory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet and with a choking Dear child
she reached out and caught Billys hand in both her own even while she shook her head in denial
Not so her daughter
Alice Greggory flushed scarlet
She drew herself proudly erect
Thank you she said with crisp coldness but distasteful as darns and patches are to us we prefer them infinitely tocharity
Oh but please I didnt meanyou didnt understand faltered Billy
For answer Alice Greggory walked deliberately to the door and held it open
Oh Alice my dear pleaded Mrs Greggory again feebly
Come Billy
Well bid you good morning ladies said William Henshaw then decisively
And Billy with a little wistful pat on Mrs Greggorys clasped hands went
Once down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk William Henshaw drew a long breath
Well by Jove
Billy the next time I take you curio hunting it wont be to this place he fumed
Wasnt it awful
choked Billy
Awful
The girl was the most stubborn unreasonable vixenish little puss I ever saw
I didnt want her old Lowestoft if she didnt want to sell it
But to practically invite me there and then treat me like that
scolded the collector his face growing red with anger
Still I was sorry for the poor little old lady
I wish somehow she could have that hundred dollars
It was the man who said this not the collector
So do I rejoined Billy dolefully
But that girl was soso queer
she sighed with a frown
Billy was puzzled
For the first time perhaps in her life she knew what it was to have her proffered ice cream disdainfully refused
CHAPTER XVII ONLY A LOVE SONG BUT Kate and little Kate left for the West on the afternoon of the fifteenth and Bertram arrived from New York that evening
Notwithstanding the confusion of all this Billy still had time to give some thought to her experience of the morning with Uncle William
The forlorn little room with its povertystricken furnishings and its crippled mistress was very vivid in Billys memory
Equally vivid were the flashing eyes of Alice Greggory as she had opened the door at the last
For as Billy explained to Bertram that evening after she had told him the story of the mornings adventure you see dear I had never been really turned out of a house before
I should think not scowled her lover indignantly and its safe to say you never will again
The impertinence of it
But then you wont see them any more sweetheart so well just forget it
Forget it
Why Bertram I couldnt
You couldnt if youd been there
Besides of course I shall see them again
Bertrams jaw dropped
Why Billy you dont mean that Will or you either would try again for that trumpery teapot
Of course not flashed Billy heatedly
It isnt the teapotits that dear little Mrs Greggory
Why dearie you dont know how poor they are
Everything in sight is so old and thin and worn its enough to break your heart
The rug isnt anything but darns nor the tablecloth eitherexcept patches
Its awful Bertram
I know darling but you dont expect to buy them new rugs and new tablecloths do you
Billy gave one of her unexpected laughs
Mercy
she chuckled
Only picture Miss Alices face if I should try to buy them rugs and tablecloths
No dear she went on more seriously I shant do that of coursethough Id like to but I shall try to see Mrs Greggory again if its nothing more than a rose or a book or a new magazine that I can take to her
Or a smilewhich I fancy will be the best gift of the lot amended Bertram fondly
Billy dimpled and shook her head
Smilesmy smilesare not so valuable Im afraidexcept to you perhaps she laughed
Selfevident facts need no proving retorted Bertram
Well and what else has happened in all these ages Ive been away
Billy brought her hands together with a sudden cry
Oh and I havent told you
she exclaimed
Im writing a new songa love song
Mary Jane wrote the words
Theyre beautiful
Bertram stiffened
Indeed
And isMary Jane a poet with all the rest
he asked with affected lightness
Oh no of course not smiled Billy but these words are pretty
And they just sang themselves into the dearest little melody right away
So Im writing the music for them
Lucky Mary Jane
murmured Bertram still with a lightness that he hoped would pass for indifference
Bertram was ashamed of himself but deep within him was a growing consciousness that he knew the meaning of the vague irritation that he always felt at the mere mention of Arkwrights name
And will the titlepage say Words by Mary Jane Arkwright
he finished
Thats what I asked him laughed Billy
I even suggested Methuselah John for a change
Oh but dearie she broke off with shy eagerness I just want you to hear a little of what Ive done with it
You see really all the time I suspect Ive been singing itto you she confessed with an endearing blush as she sprang lightly to her feet and hurried to the piano
It was a bad ten minutes that Bertram Henshaw spent then
How he could love a song and hate it at the same time he did not understand but he knew that he was doing exactly that
To hear Billy carol Sweetheart my sweetheart
with that joyous tenderness was bliss unspeakable until he remembered that Arkwright wrote the Sweetheart my sweetheart
then it was Even in his thoughts Bertram bit the word off short
He was not a swearing man
When he looked at Billy now at the piano and thought of her singingas she said she had sungthat song to him all through the last three days his heart glowed
But when he looked at her and thought of Arkwright who had made possible that singing his heart froze with terror
From the very first it had been music that Bertram had feared
He could not forget that Billy herself had once told him that never would she love any man better than she loved her music that she was not going to marry
All this had been at the firstthe very first
He had boldly scorned the idea then and had said So its musica cold senseless thing of spidery marks on clean white paperthat is my only rival
He had said too that he was going to win
And he had wonbut not until after long weeks of fearing hoping striving and despairingthis last when Kates blundering had nearly made her Williams wife
Then on that memorable day in September Billy had walked straight into his arms and he knew that he had indeed won
That is he had supposed that he knewuntil Arkwright came
Very sharply now as he listened to Billys singing Bertram told himself to be reasonable to be sensible that Billy did indeed love him
Was she not according to her own dear assertion singing that song to him
But it was Arkwrights song
He remembered that tooand grew faint at the thought
True he had won when his rival music had been a cold senseless thing of spidery marks on paper but would that winning stand when music had become a thing of flesh and blooda man of undeniable charm good looks and winsomeness a man whose thoughts aims and words were the personification of the thing Billy in the long ago had declared she loved best of allmusic
Bertram shivered as with a sudden chill then Billy rose from the piano
There
she breathed her face shyly radiant with the glory of the song
Did youlike it
Bertram did his best but in his state of mind the very radiance of her face was only an added torture and his tongue stumbled over the words of praise and appreciation that he tried to say
He saw then the happy light in Billys eyes change to troubled questioning and grieved disappointment and he hated himself for a jealous brute
More earnestly than ever now he tried to force the ring of sincerity into his voice but he knew that he had miserably failed when he heard her falter Of course dear II havent got it nearly perfected yet
Itll be much better later
But it ssic fine now sweetheartindeed it is protested Bertram hurriedly
Well of course Im gladif you like it murmured Billy but the glow did not come back to her face
CHAPTER XVIII SUGARPLUMS Those short December days after Bertrams return from New York were busy ones for everybody
Miss Winthrop was not in town to give sittings for her portrait it is true but her absence only afforded Bertram time and opportunity to attend to other work that had been more or less delayed and neglected
He was often at Hillside however and the lovers managed to snatch many an hour of quiet happiness from the rush and confusion of the Christmas preparations
Bertram was assuring himself now that his jealous fears of Arkwright were groundless
Billy seldom mentioned the man and as the days passed she spoke only once of his being at the house
The song too she said little of and Bertramthough he was ashamed to own it to himselfbreathed more freely
The real facts of the case were that Billy had told Arkwright that she should have no time to give attention to the song until after Christmas and her manner had so plainly shown him that she considered himself synonymous with the song that he had reluctantly taken the hint and kept away
Ill make her care for me sometimefor something besides a song he told himself with fierce consolationbut Billy did not know this
Aside from Bertram Christmas filled all of Billys thoughts these days
There were such a lot of things she wished to do
But after all theyre only sugarplums you know that Im giving dear she declared to Bertram one day when he had remonstrated with with her for so taxing her time and strength
I cant really do much
Much
scoffed Bertram
But it isnt much honestlycompared to what there is to do argued Billy
You see dear its just this she went on her bright face sobering a little
There are such a lot of people in the world who arent really poor
That is they have bread and probably meat to eat and enough clothes to keep them warm
But when youve said that youve said it all
Books music fun and frosting on their cake they know nothing aboutexcept to long for them
But there are the churches and the charities and all those longnamed SocietiesI thought that was what they were for declared Bertram still a little aggrievedly his worried eyes on Billys tired face
Oh but the churches and charities dont frost cakes nor give sugarplums smiled Billy
And its right that they shouldnt too she added quickly
They have more than they can do now with the roast beef and coal and flannel petticoats that are really necessary
And so its just frosting and sugarplums is itthese books and magazines and concert tickets and lace collars for the crippled boy the spinster lady the little widow and all the rest of those people who were here last summer
Billy turned in confused surprise
Why Bertram however in the world did you find out about allthat
I didnt
I just guessed itand it seems the boy guessed right the very first time  laughed Bertram teasingly but with a tender light in his eyes
Oh and I suppose youll be sending a frosted cake to the Lowestoft lady too eh
Billys chin rose to a defiant stubbornness
Im going to try toif I can find out what kind of frosting she likes
How about the Alice ladyor perhaps I should say the Lady Alice
smiled the man
Billy relaxed visibly
Yes I know she sighed
There isthe Lady Alice
But anyhow she cant call a Christmas present charitynot if its only a little bit of frosting
Billys chin came up again
And youre going to really dare to send her something
Yes avowed Billy
Im going down there one of these days in the morning Youre going down there
Billynot alone
Yes
Why not
But dearie you mustnt
It was a horrid place Will says
So it was horridto live in
It was everything that was cheap and mean and forlorn
But it was quiet and respectable
Tisnt as if I didnt know the way Bertram and Im sure that where that poor crippled woman and daughter are safe I shall be
Mrs Greggory is a lady Bertram well born and wellbred Im sureand thats the pity of it to have to live in a place like that
They have seen better days I know
Those pitiful little worn crutches of hers were mahogany Im sure Bertram and they were silver mounted
Bertram made a restless movement
I know dear but if you had some one with you
It wouldnt do for Will of course nor me under the circumstances
But theres Aunt Hannah He paused hopefully
Billy chuckled
Bless your dear heart
Aunt Hannah would call for a dozen shawls in that placeif she had breath enough to call for any after she got to the top of those four flights
Yes I suppose so rejoined Bertram with an unwilling smile
Stillwell you can take Rosa he concluded decisively
How Miss Alice would like thatto catch me going slumming with my maid
cried Billy righteous indignation in her voice
Honestly Bertram I think even gentle Mrs Greggory wouldnt stand for that
Then leave Rosa outside in the hall planned Bertram promptly and after a few more arguments Billy finally agreed to this
It was with Rosa therefore that she set out the next morning for the little room up four flights on the narrow West End street
Leaving the maid on the top stair of the fourth flight Billy tapped at Mrs Greggorys door
To her joy Mrs Greggory herself answered the knock
Oh
Whywhy good morning murmured the lady in evident embarrassment
Wont youcome m
Thank you
May Ijust a minute
smiled Billy brightly
As she entered the room Billy threw a hasty look about her
There was no one but themselves present
With a sigh of satisfaction therefore the girl took the chair Mrs Greggory offered and began to speak
I was down this waythat is I came this way this morning she began a little hastily and I wanted just to come up and tell you how sorry I was aboutabout that teapot the other day
We didnt want it of courseif you didnt want us to have it
A swift change crossed Mrs Greggorys perturbed face
Oh then you didnt come for it againto day she said
Im so glad
I didnt want to refuseyou
Indeed I didnt come for itand we shant again
Dont worry about that please
Mrs Greggory sighed
Im afraid you thought me very rude andand impossible the other day she stammered
And please let me take this opportunity right now to apologize for my daughter
She was overwrought and excited
She didnt know what she was saying or doing Im sure
She was ashamed I think after you left
Billy raised a quick hand of protest
Dont please dont Mrs Greggory she begged
But it was our fault that you came
We asked you to comethrough Mr Harlow rejoined the other hurriedly
And Mr Henshaw was that his namewas so kind in every way
Im glad of this chance to tell you how much we really did appreciate itand your offer too which we could not of course accept she finished the bright color flooding her delicate face
Again Billy raised a protesting hand but the little woman in the opposite chair hurried on
There was still more evidently that she wished to say
I hope Mr Henshaw did not feel too disappointedabout the Lowestoft
We didnt want to let it go if we could help it and we hope now to keep it
Of course murmured Billy sympathetically
My daughter knew you see how much I have always thought of it and she was determined that I should not give it up
She said I should have that much left anyway
You seemy daughter is very unreconciled still to things as they are and no wonder perhaps
They are so different from what they were
Her voice broke a little
Of course said Billy again and this time the words were tinged with impatient indignation
If only there were something one could do to help
Thank you my dear but there isntindeed there isnt rejoined the other quickly and Billy looking into the proudly lifted face realized suddenly that daughter Alice had perhaps inherited some traits from mother
We shall get along very well I am sure
My daughter has still another pupil
She will be home soon to tell you herself perhaps
Billy rose with a haste so marked it was almost impolite as she murmured Will she
Im afraid though that I shant see her after all for I must go
And may I leave these please
she added hurriedly unpinning the bunch of white carnations from her coat
It seems a pity to let them wilt when you can put them in water right here
Her studiously casual voice gave no hint that those particular pinks had been bought less than half an hour before of a Park Street florist so that Mrs Greggory might put them in waterright there
Oh oh how lovely
breathed Mrs Greggory her face deep in the feathery bed of sweetness
Before she could half say Thank you however
she found herself alone
CHAPTER XIX ALICE GREGGORY Christmas came and went and in a flurry of snow and sleet January arrived
The holidays over matters and things seemed to settle down to the winter routine
Miss Winthrop had prolonged her visit in Washington until after Christmas but she had returned to Boston nowand with her she had brought a brandnew idea for her portrait an idea that caused her to sweep aside with superb disdain all poses and costumes and sketches to date and announce herself with disarming winsomeness as all ready now to really begin
Bertram Henshaw was vexed but helpless
Decidedly he wished to paint Miss Marguerite Winthrops portrait but to attempt to paint it when all matters were not to the ladys liking were worse than useless unless he wished to hang this portrait in the gallery of failures along with Andersons and Fullamsand that was not the goal he had set for it
As to the sordid money part of the affairthe great J G Winthrop himself had come to the artist and in one terse sentence had doubled the original price and expressed himself as hopeful that Henshaw would put up with the childs notions
It was the old financiers next sentence however that put the zest of real determination into Bertram for because of it the artist saw what this portrait was going to mean to the stern old man and how dear was the original of it to a heart that was commonly reported on the street to be made of stone
Obviously then indeed there was nothing for Bertram Henshaw to do but to begin the new portrait
And he began itthough still it must be confessed with inward questionings
Before a week had passed however every trace of irritation had fled and he was once again the absorbed artist who sees the vision of his desire taking palpable shape at the end of his brush
Its all right he said to Billy then one evening
Im glad she changed
Its going to be the best the very best thing Ive ever doneI think
by the sketches
Im so glad
exclaimed Billy
Im so glad
The repetition was so vehement that it sounded almost as if she were trying to convince herself as well as Bertram of something that was not true
But it was trueBilly told herself very indignantly that it was indeed it was
Yet the very fact that she had to tell herself this caused her to know how perilously near she was to being actually jealous of that portrait of Marguerite Winthrop
And it shamed her
Very sternly these days Billy reminded herself of what Kate had said about Bertrams belonging first to his Art
She thought with mortification too that it did look as if she were not the proper wife for an artist if she were going to feel like thisalways
Very resolutely then Billy turned to her music
This was all the more easily done for not only did she have her usual concerts and the opera to enjoy but she had become interested in an operetta her club was about to give also she had taken up the new song again
Christmas being over Mr Arkwright had been to the house several times
He had changed some of the words and she had improved the melody
The work on the accompaniment was progressing finely now and Billy was so gladwhen she was absorbed in her music she forgot sometimes that she was ever so unfit an artists sweetheart as to bejealous of a portrait
It was quite early in the month that the usually expected January thaw came and it was on a comparatively mild Friday at this time that a matter of business took Billy into the neighborhood of Symphony Hall at about eleven oclock in the morning
Dismissing John and the car upon her arrival she said that she would later walk to the home of a friend near by where she would remain until it was time for the Symphony Concert
This friend was a girl whom Billy had known at school
She was studying now at the Conservatory of Music and she had often urged Billy to come and have luncheon with her in her tiny apartment which she shared with three other girls and a widowed aunt for housekeeper
On this particular Friday it had occurred to Billy that owing to her business appointment at eleven and the Symphony Concert at halfpast two the intervening time would give her just the opportunity she had been seeking to enable her to accept her friends invitation
A question asked and enthusiastically answered in the affirmative over the telephone that morning therefore had speedily completed arrangements and she had agreed to be at her friends door by twelve oclock or before
As it happened business did not take quite so long as she had expected and halfpast eleven found her well on her way to Miss Hendersons home
In spite of the warm sunshine and the slushy snow in the streets there was a cold raw wind and Billy was beginning to feel thankful that she had not far to go when she rounded a corner and came upon a long line of humanity that curved itself back and forth on the wide expanse of steps before Symphony Hall and then stretched itself far up the Avenue
Why what she began under her breath then suddenly she understood
It was Friday
A worldfamous pianist was to play with the Symphony Orchestra that afternoon
This must be the line of patient waiters for the twentyfive cent balcony seats that Mr Arkwright had told about
With sympathetic interested eyes then Billy stepped one side to watch the line for a moment
Almost at once two girls brushed by her and one was saying What a shameand after all our struggles to get here
If only we hadnt lost that other train
Were too lateyou no need to hurry
the other wailed shrilly to a third girl who was hastening toward them
The line is way beyond the Childrens Hospital and around the corner nowand the ones there never get in
At the look of tragic disappointment that crossed the third girls face Billys heart ached
Her first impulse of course was to pull her own symphony ticket from her muff and hurry forward with a Here take mine
But that would hardly do she knewthough she would like to see Aunt Hannahs aghast face if this girl in the red sweater and white tamoshanter should suddenly emerge from among the sumptuous satins and furs and plumes that afternoon and claim the adjacent orchestra chair
But it was out of the question of course
There was only one seat and there were three girls besides all those others
With a sigh then Billy turned her eyes back to those othersthose many others that made up the long line stretching its weary length up the Avenue
There were more women than men yet the men were there jolly young men who were plainly students older men whose refined faces and threadbare overcoats hinted at cultured minds and starved bodies other men who showed no hollows in their cheeks nor nearholes in their garments
It seemed to Billy that women of almost all sorts were there young old and middleaged students in tailored suits widows in crape and veil girls that were members of a merry party women that were plainly forlorn and alone
Some in the line shuffled restlessly some stood rigidly quiet
One had brought a camp stool many were seated on the steps
Beyond where the line passed an open lot a wooden fence afforded a convenient prop
One read a book another a paper
Three were studying what was probably the score of the symphony or of the concerto they expected to hear that afternoon
A few did not appear to mind the biting wind but most of them by turnedup coatcollars or bent heads testified to the contrary
Not far from Billy a woman nibbled a sandwich furtively while beyond her a group of girls were hilariously merry over four triangles of pie which they held up where all might see
Many of the faces were youthful happy and alert with anticipation but others carried a wistfulness and a weariness that made Billys heart ache
Her eyes indeed filled with quick tears
Later she turned to go and it was then that she saw in the line a face that she knewa face that drooped with such a white misery of spent strength that she hurried straight toward it with a low cry
Miss Greggory
she exclaimed when she reached the girl
You look actually ill Are you ill
For a brief second only dazed questioning stared from the girls bluegray eyes
Billy knew when the recognition came for she saw the painful color stain the white face red
Thank you no
I am not ill Miss Neilson said the girl coldly
But you look so tired out
I have been standing here some time that is all
Billy threw a hurried glance down the far reaching line that she knew had formed since the girls two tired feet had taken their first position
But you must have comeso early
It isnt twelve oclock yet she faltered
A slight smile curved Alice Greggorys lips
Yes it was early she rejoined a little bitterly but it had to be you know
I wanted to hear the music and with this soloist and this weather I knew that many otherswould want to hear the music too
But you look so white
How much longer when will they let you in
demanded Billy raising indignant eyes to the huge graypillared building before her much as if she would pull down the walls if she could and make way for this tired girl at her side
Miss Greggorys thin shoulders rose and fell in an expressive shrug
Halfpast one
Billy gave a dismayed cry
Halfpast onealmost two hours more
But Miss Greggory you canthow can you stand it till then
Youve shivered three times since I came and you look as if you were going to faint away
Miss Greggory shook her head
It is nothing really she insisted
I am quite well
It is onlyI didnt happen to feel like eating much breakfast this morning and that with no luncheon She let a gesture finish her sentence
No luncheon
Whyoh you couldnt leave your place of course frowned Billy
No andAlice Greggory lifted her head a little proudlyI do not care to eat here
Her scornful eyes were on one of the pieces of pie down the lineno longer a triangle
Of course not agreed Billy promptly
She paused frowned and bit her lip
Suddenly her face cleared
There
the very thing she exulted
You shall have my ticket this afternoon Miss Greggory then you wont have to stay here another minute
Meanwhile there is an excellent restaurant Thank youno
I couldnt do that cut in the other sharply but in a low voice
But youll take my ticket begged Billy
Miss Greggory shook her head
Certainly not
But I want you to please
I shall be very unhappy if you dont grieved Billy
The other made a peremptory gesture
I should be very unhappy if I did she said with cold emphasis
Really Miss Neilson she went on in a low voice throwing an apprehensive glance at the man ahead who was apparently absorbed in his newspaper Im afraid I shall have to ask you to let me go on in my own way
You are very kind but there is nothing you can do nothing
You were very kind too of course to send the book and the flowers to mother at Christmas but Never mind that please interrupted Billy hurriedly
Billys head was lifted now
Her eyes were no longer pleading
Her round little chin looked square and determined
If you simply will not take my ticket this afternoon you must do this
Go to some restaurant near here and get a good luncheonsomething that will sustain you
I will take your place here
Miss Neilson Billy smiled radiantly
It was the first time she had ever seen Alice Greggorys haughtily cold reserve break into anything like naturalness the astonished incredulity of that Miss Neilson
was plainly straight from the heart so too were the amazed words that followed
Youwill stand here Certainly I will keep your place
Dont worry
You shant lose it
Billy spoke with a smiling indifference that was meant to convey the impression that standing in line for a twenty fivecent seat was a daily habit of hers
Theres a restaurant only a little wayright down there she finished
And before the dazed Alice Greggory knew quite what was happening she found herself outside the line and the other in her place
But Miss Neilson I cantyou mustnt she stammered then because of something in the unyieldingness of the square young chin above the sealskin coat and because she could not she knew use actual force to drag the owner of that chin out of the line she bowed her head in acquiescence
Well thenI will long enough for some coffee and maybe a sandwich
Andthank you she choked as she turned and hurried away
Billy drew the deep breath of one who has triumphed after long strugglesbut the breath broke off short in a gasp of dismay coming straight up the Avenue toward her was the one person in the world Billy wished least to see at that momentBertram Henshaw
Billy remembered then that she had twice lately heard her lover speak of calling at the Boston Opera House concerning a commission to paint an ideal head to represent Music for some decorative purpose
The Opera House was only a short distance up the Avenue
Doubtless he was on his way there now
He was very near by this time and Billy held her breath suspended
There was a chance of course that he might not notice her and Billy was counting on that chanceuntil a gust of wind whirled a loose halfsheet of newspaper from the hands of the man in front of her and naturally attracted Bertrams eyes to its vicinityand to hers
The next moment he was at her side and his dumfounded but softlybreathed Billy was in her ears
Billy bubbled into low laughterthere were such a lot of funny situations in the world and of them all this one was about the drollest she thought
Yes I know she gurgled
You dont have to say ityour face is saying even more than your tongue could This is just for a girl I know
Im keeping her place
Bertram frowned
He looked as if he were meditating picking Billy up and walking off with her
But Billy he protested just above his breath this isnt sugarplums nor frosting its plain suicidestanding out in this wind like this
Besides He stopped with an angrily despairing glance at her surroundings
Yes I know she nodded a little soberly understanding the look and answering that first it isnt pleasant nor comfortable in lots of waysbut shes had it all the morning
As for the coldIm as warm as toast
It wont be long anyway shes just gone to get something to eat
Then Im going to May Hendersons for luncheon
Bertram sighed impatiently and opened his lipsonly to close them with the words unsaid
There was nothing he could do and he had already said too much he thought with a savage glance at the man ahead who still had enough of his paper left to serve for a pretence at reading
As Bertram could see however the man was not reading a word he was too acutely conscious of the handsome young woman in the long sealskin coat behind him
Billy was already the cynosure of dozens of eyes and Bertram knew that his own arrival on the scene had not lessened the interest of the owners of those eyes
He only hoped devoutly that no one in the line knew him ar Billy and that no one quite knew what had happened
He did not wish to see himself and his fiancee the subject of inchhigh headlines in some evening paper figuring as Talented young composer and her famous artist lover take poor girls place in a twentyfive cent ticket line
He shivered at the thought
Are you cold
worried Billy
If you are dont stand here please
He shook his head silently
His eyes were searching the street for the only one whose coming could bring him relief
It must have been but a coffeeandsandwich luncheon for the girl for soon she came
The man surmised that it was she as soon as he saw her and stepped back at once
He had no wish for introductions
A moment later the girl was in Billys place and Billy herself was at his side
That was Alice Greggory Bertram she told him as they walked on swiftly and Bertram she was actually almost crying when she took my place
Humph
Well I should think shed better be growled Bertram perversely
Pooh
It didnt hurt me any dearie laughed Billy with a conciliatory pat on his arm as they turned down the street upon which her friend lived
And now can you come in and see May a minute
Im afraid not regretted Bertram
I wish I could but Im busier than busy today and I was supposed to be already late when I saw you
Jove Billy I just couldnt believe my eyes
You looked it twinkled Billy
It was worth a farm just to see your face
Id want the farmif I was going through that again retorted the man grimlyBertram was still seeing that newspaper heading
But Billy only laughed again
CHAPTER XX ARKWRIGHT TELLS A STORY Arkwright called Monday afternoon by appointment and together he and Billy put the finishing touches to the new song
It was when with Aunt Hannah they were having tea before the fire a little later that Billy told of her adventure the preceding Friday afternoon in front of Symphony Hall
You knew the girl of courseI think you said you knew the girl ventured Arkwright
Oh yes
She was Alice Greggory
I met her with Uncle William first over a Lowestoft teapot
Maybe youd like to know how I met her smiled Billy
Alice Greggory
Arkwrights eyes showed a sudden interest
I used to know an Alice Greggory but it isnt the same one probably
Her mother was a cripple
Billy gave a little cry
Why it isit must be
My Alice Greggorys mother is a cripple
Oh do you know them really
Well it does look like it rejoined Arkwright showing even deeper interest
I havent seen them for four or five years
They used to live in our town
The mother was a little sweet faced woman with young eyes and prematurely white hair
That describes my Mrs Greggory exactly cried Billys eager voice
And the daughter
Alice
Whyas I said its been four years since Ive seen her
A touch of constraint had come into Arkwrights voice which Billys keen ear was quick to detect
She was nineteen then and very pretty
About my height and with lightbrown hair and big bluegray eyes that look steely cold when shes angry
questioned Billy
I reckon thats about it acknowledged the man with a faint smile
Then they are the ones declared the girl plainly excited
Isnt that splendid
Now we can know them and perhaps do something for them
I love that dear little mother already and I think I should the daughterif she didnt put out so many prickers that I couldnt get near her
But tell us about them
How did they come here
Why didnt you know they were here
Are you good at answering a dozen questions at once
asked Aunt Hannah turning smiling eyes from Billy to the man at her side
Well I can try he offered
To begin with they are Judge Greggorys widow and daughter
They belong to fine families on both sides and they used to be well offreally wealthy for a small town
But the judge was better at moneymaking than he was at moneykeeping and when he came to die his income stopped of course and his estate was found to be in bad shape through reckless loans and worthless investments
That was eight years ago
Things went from bad to worse then until there was almost nothing left
I knew there was some such story as that back of them declared Billy
But how do you suppose they came here
To get away fromeverybody I suspect replied Arkwright
That would be like them
They were very proud and it isnt easy you know to be nobody where youve been somebody
It doesnt hurt quite so hardto be nobody where youve never been anything but nobody
I suppose so sighed Billy
Stillthey must have had friends
They did of course but when the love of ones friends becomes too highly seasoned with pity it doesnt make a pleasant morsel to swallow specially if you dont like the taste of the pity and there are people who dont you know
The Greggorys were that kind
They were morbidly so
From their cheap little cottage where they did their own work they stepped out in their shabby garments and oldfashioned hats with heads even more proudly erect than in the old days when their home and their gowns and their doings were the admiration and envy of the town
You see they didnt wantthat pity
I do see cried Billy her face aglow with sudden understanding and I dont believe pity would benice
Her own chin was held high as she spoke
It must have been hard indeed murmured Aunt Hannah with a sigh as she set down her teacup
It was nodded Arkwright
Of course Mrs Greggory with her crippled foot could do nothing to bring in any money except to sew a little
It all depended on Alice and when matters got to their worst she began to teach
She was fond of music and could play the piano well and of course she had had the best instruction she could get from city teachers only twenty miles away from our home town
Young as she was about seventeen when she began to teach I think she got a few beginners right away and in two years she had worked up quite a class meanwhile keeping on with her own studies herself
They might have carried the thing through maybe continued Arkwright and never apparently known that the pity existed if it hadnt been for some ugly rumors that suddenly arose attacking the Judges honesty in an old matter that somebody raked up
That was too much
Under this last straw their courage broke utterly
Alice dismissed every pupil sold almost all their remaining goodsthey had lots of quite valuable heirlooms I suspect thats where your Lowestoft teapot came inand with the money thus gained they left town
Until they could go they scarcely showed themselves once on the street they were never at home to callers and they left without telling one soul where they were going so far as we could ever learn
Why the poor dears
cried Billy
How they must have suffered
But things will be different now
Youll go to see them of course and At the look that came into Arkwrights face she stopped in surprise
You forget they wouldnt wish to see me demurred the man
And again Billy noticed the odd constraint in his voice
But they wouldnt mind youhere argued Billy
Im afraid they would
In fact Im sure theyd refuse entirely to see me
Billys eyes grew determined
But they cant refuseif I bring about a meeting just casually you know she challenged
Arkwright laughed
Well I wont pretend to say as to the consequences of that he rejoined rising to his feet but they might be disastrous
Wasnt it you yourself who were telling me a few minutes ago how steely cold Miss Alices eyes got when she was angry
Billy knew by the way the man spoke that for some reason he did not wish to prolong the subject of his meeting the Greggorys
She made a quick shift therefore to another phase of the matter
But tell me please before you go how did those rumors come outabout Judge Greggorys honesty I mean
Why I never knew exactly frowned Arkwright musingly
Yet it seems too that mother did say in one letter while I was in Paris that some of the accusations had been found to be false and that there was a prospect that the Judges good name might be saved after all
Oh I wish it might sighed Billy
Think what it would mean to those women
Twould mean everything cried Arkwright warmly and Ill write to mother tonight I will and find out just what there is to itif anything
Then you can tell them he finished a little stiffly
Yesor you nodded Billy lightly
And because she began at once to speak of something else the first part of her sentence passed without comment
The door had scarcely closed behind Arkwright when Billy turned to Aunt Hannah a beaming face
Aunt Hannah did you notice
she cried how Mary Jane looked and acted whenever Alice Greggory was spoken of
There was something between themIm sure there was and they quarrelled probably
Why no dear I didnt see anything unusual murmured the elder lady
Well I did
And Im going to be the fairy godmother that straightens everything all out too
See if Im not
Theyd make a splendid couple Aunt Hannah
Im going right down there tomorrow
Billy my dear
exclaimed the more conservative old lady arent you taking things a little too much for granted
Maybe they dont wish forfor a fairy godmother
Oh they wont know Im a fairy godmother not one of them and of course I wouldnt mention even a hint to anybody laughed Billy
Im just going down to get acquainted with the Greggorys thats all
Only think Aunt Hannah what they must have suffered
And look at the place theyre living in nowgentlewomen like them
Yes yes poor things poor things
sighed Aunt Hannah
I hope Ill find out that shes really goodat teaching I meanthe daughter resumed Billy after a moments pause
If she is theres one thing I can do to help anyhow
I can get some of Maries old pupils for her
I know some of them havent begun with a new teacher yet and Mrs Carleton told me last Friday that neither she nor her sister was at all satisfied with the one their girls have taken
Theyd change I know in a minute at my recommendationthat is of course if I can give the recommendation continued Billy with a troubled frown
Anyhow Im going down to begin operations tomorrow
CHAPTER XXI A MATTER OF STRAIGHT BUSINESS True to her assertion Billy went down to the Greggorys the next day
This time she did not take Rosa with her
Even Aunt Hannah conceded that it would not be necessary
She had not been gone ten minutes however when the telephone bell rang and Rosa came to say that Mr Bertram Henshaw wanted to speak with Mrs Stetson
Rosa says that Billys not there called Bertrams aggrieved voice when Aunt Hannah had said Good morning my boy
Dear me no Bertram
Shes in a fever of excitement this morning
Shell probably tell you all about it when you come out here tonight
You are coming out tonight arent you
Yes oh yes
But what is it
Wheres she gone
Aunt Hannah laughed softly
Well shes gone down to the Greggorys
The Greggorys
Whatagain
Oh you might as well get used to it Bertram bantered Aunt Hannah for therell be a good many agains I fancy
Why Aunt Hannah what do you mean
Bertrams voice was not quite pleased
Oh shell tell you
Its only that the Greggorys have turned out to be old friends of Mr
Arkwrights
Friends of Arkwrights
Bertrams voice was decidedly displeased now
Yes and theres quite a story to it all as well
Billy is wildly excited as youd know she would be
Youll hear all about it tonight of course
Yes of course echoed Bertram
But there was no ring of enthusiasm in his voice neither then nor when he said goodby a moment later
Billy meanwhile on her way to the Greggory home was as Aunt Hannah had said wildly excited
It seemed so strange and wonderful and delightfulthe whole affair that she should have found them because of a Lowestoft teapot that Arkwright should know them and that there should be the chance now that she might help themin some way though this last she knew could be accomplished only through the exercise of the greatest tact and delicacy
She had not forgotten that Arkwright had told her of their hatred of pity
In the sober second thought of the morning Billy was not sure now of a possible romance in connection with Arkwright and the daughter Alice but she had by no means abandoned the idea and she meant to keep her eyes openand if there should be a chance to bring such a thing about
Meanwhile of course she should not mention the matter even to Bertram
Just what would be her method of procedure this first morning Billy had not determined
The pretty potted azalea in her hand would be excuse for her entrance into the room
After that circumstances must decide for themselves
Mrs Greggory was found to be alone at home as before and Billy was glad
She would rather begin with one than two she thought
The little woman greeted her cordially gave mistyeyed thanks for the beautiful plant and also for Billys kind thoughtfulness Friday afternoon
From that she was very skilfully led to talk more of the daughter and soon Billy was getting just the information she wantedinformation concerning the character aims and daily life of Alice Greggory
You see we have some moneya very little explained Mrs Greggory after a time though to get it we have had to sell all our treasures but the Lowestoft with a quick glance into Billys eyes
We need not perhaps live in quite so poor a place but we preferjust now to spend the little money we have for something other than imitation comfortlessons for instance and an occasional concert
My daughter is studying even while she is teaching
She hopes to train herself for an accompanist and for a teacher
She does not aspire to concert solo work
She understands her limitations
But she is probablyvery goodat teaching
Billy hesitated a little
She is very good
She has the best of recommendations
A little proudly Mrs Greggory gave the names of two Boston pianistsnames that would carry weight anywhere
Unconsciously Billy relaxed
She did not know until that moment how she had worried for fear she could not conscientiously recommend this Alice Greggory
Of course resumed the mother Alices pupils are few and they pay low prices but she is gaining
She goes to the houses of course
She herself practises two hours a day at a house up on Pinckney Street
She gives lessons to a little girl in return
I see nodded Billy brightly and Ive been thinking Mrs Greggorymaybe I know of some pupils she could get
I have a friend who has just given hers up owing to her marriage
Sometime soon Im going to talk to your daughter if I may and And here she is right now interposed Mrs Greggory as the door opened under a hurried hand
Billy flushed and bit her lip
She was disturbed and disappointed
She did not particularly wish to see Alice Greggory just then
She wished even less to see her when she noted the swift change that came to the girls face at sight of herself
Oh
Whygood morning Miss Neilson murmured Miss Greggory with a smile so forced that her mother hurriedly looked to the azalea in search of a possible peacemaker
My dear see she stammered what Miss Neilson has brought me
And its so full of blossoms too
And she says itll remain so for a long long timeif well only keep it wet
Alice Greggory murmured a low something a something that she tried evidently very hard to make politely appropriate and appreciative
Yet her manner as she took off her hat and coat and sat down so plainly said You are very kind of course but I wish you would keep yourself and your plants at home
that Mrs Greggory began a hurried apology much as if the words had indeed been spoken
My daughter is really ill this morning
You mustnt mindthat is Im afraid youll think you see she took cold last week a bad cold and she isnt over it yet finished the little woman in painful embarrassment
Of course she took coldstanding all those hours in that horrid wind Friday
cried Billy indignantly
A quick red flew to Alice Greggorys face
Billy saw it at once and fervently wished she had spoken of anything but that Friday afternoon
It looked almost as if she were reminding them of what she had done that day
In her confusion and in her anxiety to say somethinganything that would get their minds off that ideashe uttered now the first words that came into her head
As it happened they were the last words that sober second thought would have told her to say
Never mind Mrs Greggory
Well have her all well and strong soon never fear
Just wait till I send Peggy and Mary Jane to take her out for a drive one of these mild sunny days
You have no idea how much good it will do her
Alice Greggory got suddenly to her feet
Her face was very white now
Her eyes had the steely coldness that Billy knew so well
Her voice when she spoke was low and sternly controlled
Miss Neilson you will think me rude of course especially after your great kindness to me the other day but I cant help it
It seems to me best to speak now before it goes any further
Alice dear remonstrated Mrs Greggory extending a frightened hand
The girl did not turn her head nor hesitate but she caught the extended hand and held it warmly in both her own with gentle little pats while she went on speaking
Im sure mother agrees with me that it is best for the present that we keep quite to ourselves
I cannot question your kindness of course after your somewhat unusual favor the other day but I am very sure that your friends Miss Peggy and Miss Mary Jane have no real desire to make my acquaintance norif youll pardon mehave I under the circumstances any wish to make theirs
Oh Alice Alice began the little mother in dismay but a rippling laugh from their visitor brought an angry flush even to her gentle face
Billy understood the flush and struggled for selfcontrol
Pleaseplease forgive me
she choked
But you seeyou couldnt of course know that Mary Jane and Peggy arent girls
Theyre just a man and an automobile
An unwilling smile trembled on Alice Greggorys lips but she still stood her ground
After all girls or men and automobiles Miss Neilsonit makes little difference
Theyre charity
And its not so long that weve been objects of charity that we quite really enjoy it yet
There was a moments hush
Billys eyes had filled with tears
I never even thoughtcharity said Billy so gently that a faint red stole into the white cheeks opposite
For a tense minute Alice Greggory held herself erect then with a complete change of manner and voice she released her mothers hand dropped into her own chair again and said wearily I know you didnt Miss Neilson
Its all my foolish pride of course
Its only that I was thinking how dearly I would love to meet girls againjust as girls ButI no longer have any business with pride of course
I shall be pleased Im sure she went on dully to accept anything you may do for us from automobile rides toto red flannel petticoats
Billy almostbut not quitelaughed
Still the laugh would have been near to a sob had it been given
Surprising as was the quick transition in the girls manner and absurd as was the juxtaposition of automobiles and red flannel petticoats the white misery of Alice Greggorys face and the weary despair of her attitude were tragic specially to one who knew her story as did Billy Neilson
And it was because Billy did know her story that she did not make the mistake now of offering pity
Instead she said with a bright smile and a casual manner that gave no hint of studied labor Well as it happens Miss Greggory what I want today has nothing whatever to do with automobiles or red flannel petticoats
Its a matter of straight business
How Billy blessed the thought that had so suddenly come to her
Your mother tells me you play accompaniments
Now a girls club of which I am a member is getting up an operetta for charity and we need an accompanist
There is no one in the club who is able and at the same time willing to spend the amount of time necessary for practice and rehearsals
So we had decided to hire one outside and I have been given the task of finding one
It has occurred to me that perhaps you would be willing to undertake it for us
Would you
Billy knew at once from the quick change in the others face and manner that she had taken exactly the right course to relieve the strain of the situation
Despair and lassitude fell away from Alice Greggory almost like a garment
Her countenance became alert and interested
Indeed I would
I should be glad to do it
Good
Then can you come out to my home sometime tomorrow and go over the music with me
Rehearsals will not begin until next week but I can give you the music and tell you something of what we are planning to do
Yes
I could come at ten in the morning for an hour or at three in the afternoon for two hours or more replied Miss Greggory after a moments hesitation
Suppose we call it in the afternoon then smiled Billy as she rose to her feet
And now I must goand heres my address she finished taking out her card and laying it on the table near her
For reasons of her own Billy went away that morning without saying anything more about the proposed new pupils
New pupils were not automobile rides nor petticoats to be surebut she did not care to risk disturbing the present interested happiness of Alice Greggorys face by mentioning anything that might be construed as too officious an assistance
On the whole Billy felt well pleased with her mornings work
To Aunt Hannah upon her return she expressed herself thus Its splendideven better than I hoped
I shall have a chance tomorrow of course to see for myself just how well she plays and all that
Im pretty sure though from what I hear that that part will be all right
Then the operetta will give us a chance to see a good deal of her and to bring about a natural meeting between her and Mary Jane
Oh Aunt Hannah I couldnt have planned it betterand there the whole thing just tumbled into my hands
I knew it had the minute I remembered about the operetta
You know Im chairman and they left me to get the accompanist and like a flash it came to me when I was wondering what to say or do to get her out of that awful state she was inAsk her to be your accompanist
And I did
And Im so glad I did
Oh Aunt Hannah its coming out lovelyI know it is
CHAPTER XXII PLANS AND PLOTTINGS To Billy Alice Greggorys first visit to Hillside was in every way a delight and a satisfaction
To Alice it was even more than that
For the first time in years she found herself welcomed into a home of wealth culture and refinement as an equal and the frank cordiality and naturalness of her hostesss evident expectation of meeting a congenial companion was like balm to a sensitive soul rendered morbid by long years of superciliousness and snubbing
No wonder that under the cheery friendliness of it all Alice Greggorys cold reserve vanished and that in its place came something very like her old ease and charm of manner
By the time Aunt Hannahaccording to previous agreement came into the room the two girls were laughing and chatting over the operetta as if they had known each other for years
Much to Billys delight Alice Greggory as a musician proved to be eminently satisfactory
She was quick at sight reading and accurate
She played easily and with good expression
Particularly was she a good accompanist possessing to a marked degree that happy faculty of accompanying a singer which means that she neither led the way nor lagged behind being always exactly in sympathetic stepthan which nothing is more soulsatisfying to the singer
It was after the music for the operetta had been wellpractised and discussed that Alice Greggory chanced to see one of Billys own songs lying near her
With a pleased smile she picked it up
Oh you know this too
she cried
I played it for a lady only the other day
Its so pretty I thinkall of hers are that I have seen
Billy Neilson is a girl you know they say in spite ofShe stopped abruptly
Her eyes grew wide and questioning
Miss Neilsonit cant beyou dont meanis your nameit isyou she finished joyously as the telltale color dyed Billys face
The next moment her own cheeks burned scarlet
And to think of my letting you stand in line for a twentyfivecent admission
she scorned
Nonsense
laughed Billy
It didnt hurt me any more than it did you
Come
in looking about for a quick something to take her guests attention Billys eyes fell on the manuscript copy of her new song bearing Arkwrights name
Yielding to a daring impulse she drew it hastily forward
Heres a new onea brand new one not even printed yet
Dont you think the words are pretty
she asked
As she had hoped Alice Greggorys eyes after they had glanced halfway through the first page sought the name at the left side below the title
 Words by M
J there was a visible start and a pause before the  Arkwright  was uttered in a slightly different tone
Billy noted both the start and the pauseand gloried in them
Yes the words are by M J Arkwright she said with smooth unconcern but with a covert glance at the others face
Ever hear of him
Alice Greggory gave a short little laugh
Probably notthis one
I used to know an M J Arkwright long ago but he wasnta poet so far as I know she finished with a little catch in her breath that made Billy long to take her into a warm embrace
Alice Greggory turned then to the music
She had much to say of thisvery much but she had nothing more whatever to say of Mr M J Arkwright in spite of the tempting conversation bait that Billy dropped so freely
After that Rosa brought in tea and toast and the little frosted cakes that were always such a favorite with Billys guests
Then Alice Greggory said goodbyher eyes full of tears that Billy pretended not to see
There
breathed Billy as soon as she had Aunt Hannah to herself again
What did I tell you
Did you see Miss Greggorys start and blush and hear her sigh just over the name of M J Arkwright
Just as if
Now I want them to meet only it must be casual Aunt Hannah casual
And Id rather wait till Mary Jane hears from his mother if possible so if there is anything good to tell the poor girl he can tell it
Yes of course
Dear childI hope he can murmured Aunt Hannah
Aunt Hannah had ceased now trying to make Billy refrain from the reprehensible Mary Jane
In fact if the truth were known Aunt Hannah herself in her thoughts and sometimes in her wordscalled him Mary Jane
But indeed my dear I didnt see anything stiff oror repelling about Miss Greggory as you said there was
There wasnttoday smiled Billy
Honestly Aunt Hannah I should never have known her for the same girlwho showed me the door that first morning she finished merrily as she turned to go upstairs
It was the next day that Cyril and Marie came home from their honeymoon
They went directly to their pretty little apartment on Beacon Street Brookline within easy walking distance of Billys own cozy home
Cyril intended to build in a year or two
Meanwhile they had a very pretty convenient home which was according to Bertram electrified to within an inch of its life and equipped with everything that was fireless smokeless dustless and laborless
In it Marie had a spotlessly white kitchen where she might make puddings to her hearts content
Marie hadagain according to Bertram a visiting acquaintance with a maid
In other words a stout woman was engaged to come two days in the week to wash iron and scrub also to come in each night to wash the dinner dishes thus leaving Maries evenings freefor the shaded lamp Billy said
Marie had not arrived at thisto her delightful arrangement of a visiting acquaintance without some opposition from her friends
Even Billy had stood somewhat aghast
But my dear wont it be hard for you to do so much
she argued one day
You know you arent very strong
I know but it wont be hard as Ive planned it replied Marie specially when Ive been longing for years to do this very thing
Why Billy if I had to stand by and watch a maid do all these things I want to do myself I should feel just like like a hungry man who sees another man eating up his dinner
Oh of course she added plaintively after Billys laughter had subsided I shant do it always
I dont expect to
Of course when we have a houseIm not sure then though that I shant dress up the maid and order her to receive the calls and go to the pink teas while I make her puddings she finished saucily as Billy began to laugh again
The bride and groom as was proper were soon after their arrival invited to dine at both Williams and Billys
Then until Maries At Homes should begin the devoted couple settled down to quiet days by themselves with only occasional visits from the family to interruptinterrupt was Bertrams word not Maries
Though it is safe to say it was not far different from the one Cyril usedin his thoughts
Bertram himself these days was more than busy
Besides working on Miss Winthrops portrait and on two or three other commissions he was putting the finishing touches to four pictures which he was to show in the exhibition soon to be held by a prominent Art Club of which he was the acknowledged star member
Naturally therefore his time was well occupied
Naturally too Billy knowing this lashed herself more sternly than ever into a daily reminder of Kates assertion that he belonged first to his Art
In pursuance of this idea Billy was careful to see that no engagement with herself should in any way interfere with the artists work and that no word of hers should attempt to keep him at her side when ART called
Billy always spelled that word now in her mind with tall black letters the way it had sounded when it fell from Kates lips
That these tactics on her part were beginning to fill her lover with vague alarm and a very definite unrest she did not once suspect
Eagerly thereforeeven with conscientious delight she welcomed the new songwords that Arkwright broughtthey would give her something else to take up her time and attention
She welcomed them also for another reason they would bring Arkwright more often to the house and this would of course lead to that casual meeting between him and Alice Greggory when the rehearsals for the operetta should commence which would be very soon now
And Billy did so long to bring about that meeting
To Billy all this was but occupying her mind and playing Cupids assistant to a worthy young couple torn cruelly apart by an unfeeling fate
To Bertramto Bertram it was terror and woe and all manner of torture for in it Bertram saw only a growing fondness on the part of Billy for Arkwright Arkwrights music Arkwrights words and Arkwrights friends
The first rehearsal for the operetta came on Wednesday evening
There would be another on Thursday afternoon
Billy had told Alice Greggory to arrange her pupils so that she could stay Wednesday night at Hillside if the crippled mother could get along aloneand she could Alice had said
Thursday forenoon therefore Alice Greggory would in all probability be at Hillside specially as there would doubtless be an appointment or two for private rehearsal with some nervous soloist whose part was not progressing well
Such being the case Billy had a plan she meant to carry out
She was highly pleased therefore when Thursday morning came and everything apparently was working exactly to her mind
Alice was there
She had an appointment at quarter of eleven with the leading tenor and another later with the alto
After breakfast therefore Billy said decisively Now if you please Miss Greggory Im going to put you upstairs on the couch in the sewing room for a nap
But Ive just got up remonstrated Miss Greggory
I know you have smiled Billy but you were very late to bed last night and youve got a hard day before you
I insist upon your resting
You will be absolutely undisturbed there and you must shut the door and not come downstairs till I send for you
Mr Johnson isnt due till quarter of eleven is he
Nno
Then come with me directed Billy leading the way upstairs
There now dont come down till I call you she went on when they had reached the little room at the end of the hall
Im going to leave Aunt Hannahs door open so youll have good airshe isnt in there
Shes writing letters in my room Now heres a book and you may read but I should prefer you to sleep she nodded brightly as she went out and shut the door quietly
Then like the guilty conspirator she was she went downstairs to wait for Arkwright
It was a fine plan
Arkwright was due at ten oclockBilly had specially asked him to come at that hour
He would not know of course that Alice Greggory was in the house but soon after his arrival Billy meant to excuse herself for a moment slip upstairs and send Alice Greggory down for a book a pair of scissors a shawl for Aunt Hannahanything would do for a pretext anything so that the girl might walk into the livingroom and find Arkwright waiting for her alone
And then What happened next was in Billys mind very vague but very attractive as a nucleus for ones thoughts nevertheless
All this was indeed a fine plan but If only fine plans would not so often have a but
In Billys case the but had to do with things so apparently unrelated as were Aunt Hannahs clock and a negros coal wagon
The clock struck eleven at halfpast ten and the wagon dumped itself to destruction directly in front of a trolley car in which sat Mr M J Arkwright hurrying to keep his appointment with Miss Billy Neilson
It was almost halfpast ten when Arkwright finally rang the bell at Hillside
Billy greeted him so eagerly and at the same time with such evident disappointment at his late arrival that Arkwrights heart sang with joy
But theres a rehearsal at quarter of eleven exclaimed Billy in answer to his hurried explanation of the delay and this gives so little time forforso little time you know she finished in confusion casting frantically about in her mind for an excuse to hurry upstairs and send Alice Greggory down before it should be quite too late
No wonder that Arkwright noting the sparkle in her eye the agitation in her manner and the embarrassed red in her cheek took new courage
For so long had this girl held him at the end of a major third or a diminished seventh for so long had she blithely accepted his every word and act as devotion to music not herselffor so long had she done all this that he had come to fear that never would she do anything else
No wonder then that now in the soft radiance of the strange new light on her face his own face glowed ardently and that he leaned forward with an impetuous rush of eager words
But there is time Miss Billyif youd give me leaveto say Im afraid I kept you waiting interrupted the hurried voice of Alice Greggory from the hall doorway
I was asleep I think when a clock somewhere striking eleven Why MrArkwright
Not until Alice Greggory had nearly crossed the room did she see that the man standing by her hostess wasnot the tenor she had expected to findbut an old acquaintance
Then it was that the tremulous MrArkwright
fell from her lips
Billy and Arkwright had turned at her first words
At her last Arkwright with a half despairing halfreproachful glance at Billy stepped forward
Miss Greggoryyou are Miss Alice Greggory I am sure he said pleasantly
At the first opportunity Billy murmured a hasty excuse and left the room
To Aunt Hannah she flew with a woebegone face
Oh Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah she wailed half laughing half crying that wretched little fibteller of a clock of yours spoiled it all
Spoiled it
Spoiled what child
My first meeting between Mary Jane and Miss Greggory
I had it all arranged that they were to have it alone but that miserable little fibber upstairs struck eleven at halfpast ten and Miss Greggory heard it and thought she was fifteen minutes late
So down she hurried half awake and spoiled all my plans
Now shes sitting in there with him in chairs the length of the room apart discussing the snowstorm last night or the moonrise this morningor some other such silly thing
And I had it so beautifully planned
Well well dear Im sorry Im sure smiled Aunt Hannah but I cant think any real harm is done
Did Mary Jane have anything to tell herabout her father I mean
Only the faintest flicker of Billys eyelid testified that the everyday accustomedness of that Mary Jane on Aunt Hannahs lips had not escaped her
No nothing definite
Yet there was a little
Friends are still trying to clear his name and I believe are meeting with increasing success
I dont know of course whether hell say anything about it todaynow
To think I had to be right round under foot like that when they met
went on Billy indignantly
I shouldnt have been in a minute more though
I was just trying to think up an excuse to come up and send down Miss Greggory when Mary Jane began to tell me somethingI havent the faintest idea what then she appeared and it was all over
And theres the doorbell and the tenor I suppose so of course its all over now she sighed rising to go downstairs
As it chanced however it was not the tenor but a message from hima message that brought dire consternation to the Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements
The tenor had thrown up his part
He could not take it it was too difficult
He felt that this should be toldat once rather than to worry along for another week or two and then give up
So he had told it
But what shall we do Miss Greggory
appealed Billy
It is a hard part you know but if Mr Tobey cant take it I dont know who can
We dont want to hire a singer for it if we can help it
The profits are to go to the Home for Crippled Children you know she explained turning to Arkwright and we decided to hire only the accompanist
An odd expression flitted across Miss Greggorys face
Mr Arkwright used to singtenor she observed quietly
As if he didnt nowa perfectly glorious tenor retorted Billy
But as if he would take this For only a brief moment did Arkwright hesitate then blandly he suggested Suppose you try him and see
Billy sat suddenly erect
Would you really
Could youtake the time and all
she cried
Yes I think I wouldunder the circumstances he smiled
I think I could too though I might not be able to attend all the rehearsals
Still if I find I have to ask permission Ill endeavor to convince the powersthatbe that singing in this operetta will be just the stepping stone I need to success in Grand Opera
Oh if you only would take it breathed Billy wed be so glad
Well said Arkwright his eyes on Billys frankly delighted face as I said beforeunder the circumstances I think I would
Thank you
Then its all beautifully settled rejoiced Billy with a happy sigh and unconsciously she gave Alice Greggorys hand near her a little pat
In Billys mind the circumstances of Arkwrights acceptance of the part were Alice Greggory and her position as accompanist of course
Billy would have been surprised indeedand dismayedhad she known that in Arkwrights mind the circumstances were herself and the fact that she too had a part in the operetta necessitating her presence at rehearsals and hinting at a delightful comradeship impossible perhaps otherwise
CHAPTER XXIII THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM February came The operetta for which Billy was working so hard was to be given the twentieth
The Art Exhibition for which Bertram was preparing his four pictures was to open the sixteenth with a private view for specially invited friends the evening before
On the eleventh day of February Mrs Greggory and her daughter arrived at Hillside for a ten days visit
Not until after a great deal of pleading and argument however had Billy been able to bring this about
But my dears both of you Billy had at last said to them just listen
We shall have numberless rehearsals during those last ten days before the thing comes off
They will be at all hours and of all lengths
You Miss Greggory will have to be on hand for them all of course and will have to stay all night several times probably
You Mrs Greggory ought not to be alone down here
There is no sensible valid reason why you should not both come out to the house for those ten days and I shall feel seriously hurt and offended if you do not consent to do it
Butmy pupils Alice Greggory had demurred
You can go in town from my home at any time to give your lessons and a little shifting about and arranging for those ten days will enable you to set the hours conveniently one after another I am sure so you can attend to several on one trip
Meanwhile your mother will be having a lovely time teaching Aunt Hannah how to knit a new shawl so you wont have to be worrying about her
After all it had been the great good and pleasure which the visit would bring to Mrs Greggory that had been the final straw to tip the scales
On the eleventh of February therefore in the company of the once scorned Peggy and Mary Jane Alice Greggory and her mother had arrived at Hillside
Ever since the first meeting of Alice Greggory and Arkwright Billy had been sorely troubled by the conduct of the two young people
She had as she mournfully told herself been able to make nothing of it
The two were civility itself to each other but very plainly they were not at ease in each others company and Billy much to her surprise had to admit that Arkwright did not appear to appreciate the circumstances now that he had them
The pair called each other ceremoniously Mr Arkwright and Miss Greggorybut then that of course did not signify Billy declared to herself
I suppose you dont ever call him Mary Jane  she said to the girl a little mischievously one day
 Mary Jane
Mr Arkwright
No I dont rejoined Miss Greggory with an odd smile
Then after a moment she added I believe his brothers and sisters used to however
Yes I know laughed Billy
We thought he was a real Mary Jane once
And she told the story of his arrival
So you see she finished when Alice Greggory had done laughing over the tale he always will be Mary Jane to us
By the way what is his name
Miss Greggory looked up in surprise
Why its She stopped short her eyes questioning
Why hasnt he ever told you
she queried
Billy lifted her chin
No
He told us to guess it and we have guessed everything we can think of even up to Methuselah John but he says we havent hit it yet
 Methuselah John indeed
laughed the other merrily
Well Im sure thats a nice solid name defended Billy her chin still at a challenging tilt
If it isnt Methuselah John what is it then
But Alice Greggory shook her head
She too it seemed could be firm on occasion
And though she smiled brightly all she would say was If he hasnt told you I shant
Youll have to go to him
Oh well I can still call him Mary Jane  retorted Billy with airy disdain
All this however so far as Billy could see was not in the least helping along the cause that had become so dear to herthe reuniting of a pair of lovers
It occurred to her then one day that perhaps after all they were not lovers and did not wish to be reunited
At this disquieting thought Billy decided suddenly to go almost to headquarters
She would speak to Mrs Greggory if ever the opportunity offered
Great was her joy therefore when a day or two after the Greggorys arrived at the house Mrs Greggorys chance reference to Arkwright and her daughter gave Billy the opportunity she sought
They used to know each other long ago Mr Arkwright tells me Billy began warily
Yes
The quietly polite monosyllable was not very encouraging to be sure but Billy secure in her conviction that her cause was a righteous one refused to be daunted
I think it was so romantictheir running across each other like this Mrs Greggory she murmured
And there was a romance wasnt there
I have just felt in my bones that there wasa romance
Billy held her breath
It was what she had meant to say but now that she had said it the words seemed very fearsome indeedto say to Mrs Greggory
Then Billy remembered her Cause and took heartBilly was spelling it now with a capital C For a long minute Mrs Greggory did not answerfor so long a minute that Billys breath dropped into a fluttering sigh and her Cause became suddenly IMPERTINENCE spelled in black capitals
Then Mrs Greggory spoke slowly a little sadly
I dont mind saying to you that I did hope once that there would be a romance there
They were the best of friends and they were well suited to each other in tastes and temperament
I think indeed that the romance was well under way though there was never an engagement when Mrs Greggory paused and wet her lips
Her voice when she resumed carried the stern note so familiar to Billy in her first acquaintance with this woman and her daughter
As I presume Mr Arkwright has told you we have met with many changes in our lifechanges which necessitated a new home and a new mode of living
Naturally under those circumstances old friendsand old romancesmust change too
But Mrs Greggory stammered Billy Im sure Mr Arkwright would want An up lifted hand silenced her peremptorily
Mr Arkwright was very kind and a gentleman always interposed the lady coldly but Judge Greggorys daughter would not allow herself to be placed where apologies for her father would be necessaryever There please dear Miss Neilson let us not talk of it any more begged Mrs Greggory brokenly
No indeed of course not
cried Billy but her heart rejoiced
She understood it all now
Arkwright and Alice Greggory had been almost lovers when the charges against the Judges honor had plunged the family into despairing humiliation
Then had come the time when according to Arkwrights own story the two women had shut themselves indoors refused to see their friends and left town as soon as possible
Thus had come the breaking of whatever tie there was between Alice Greggory and Arkwright
Not to have broken it would have meant for Alice the placing of herself in a position where sometime apologies must be made for her father
This was what Mrs Greggory had meantand again as Billy thought of it Billys heart rejoiced
Was not her way clear now before her
Did she not have it in her power possiblyeven probablyto bring happiness where only sadness was before
As if it would not be a simple thing to rekindle the old flameto make these two estranged hearts beat as one again
Not now was the Cause an IMPERTINENCE in tall black letters
It was instead a shining beacon in letters of flame guiding straight to victory
Billy went to sleep that night making plans for Alice Greggory and Arkwright to be thrown together naturallyjust as a matter of course you know she said drowsily to herself all in the dark
Some three or four miles away down Beacon Street at that moment Bertram Henshaw in the Strata was as it happened not falling asleep
He was lying broadly and unhappily awake Bertram very frequently lay broadly and unhappily awake these daysor rather nights
He told himself on these occasions that it was perfectly naturalindeed it wasthat Billy should be with Arkwright and his friends the Greggorys so much
There were the new songs and the operetta with its rehearsals as a cause for it all
At the same time deep within his fearful soul was the consciousness that Arkwright the Greggorys and the operetta were but MusicMusic the spectre that from the first had dogged his footsteps
With Billys behavior toward himself Bertram could find no fault
She was always her sweet loyal lovable self eager to hear of his work earnestly solicitous that it should be a success
She evenas he sometimes halfirritably rememberedhad once told him that she realized he belonged to Art before he did to himself and when he had indignantly denied this she had only laughed and thrown a kiss at him with the remark that he ought to hear his sister Kates opinion of that matter
As if he wanted Kates opinion on that or anything else that concerned him and Billy
Once torn by jealousy and exasperated at the frequent interruptions of their quiet hours together he had complained openly
Actually Billy its worse than Maries wedding he declared Then it was tablecloths and napkins that could be dumped in a chair
Now its a girl who wants to rehearse or a woman that wants a different wig or a telephone message that the sopranos have quarrelled again
I loathe that operetta
Billy laughed but she frowned too
I know dear I dont like that part
I wish they would let me alone when Im with you
But as for the operetta it is really a good thing dear and youll say so when you see it
Its going to be a great successI can say that because my part is only a small one you know
We shall make lots of money for the Home too Im sure
But youre wearing yourself all out with it dear scowled Bertram
Nonsense
I like it besides when Im doing this Im not telephoning you to come and amuse me
Just think what a lot of extra time you have for your work
Dont want it avowed Bertram
But the work may retorted Billy showing all her dimples
Never mind though itll all be over after the twentieth
This isnt an understudy like Maries wedding you know she finished demurely
Thank heaven for that
Bertram had breathed fervently
But even as he said the words he grew sick with fear
What if after all this were an understudy to what was to come later when Music his rival had really conquered
Bertram knew that however secure might seem Billys affection for himself there was still in his own mind a horrid fear lest underneath that security were an unconscious growing fondness for something he could not give for some one that he was nota fondness that would one day cause Billy to awake
As Bertram in his morbid fancy pictured it he realized only too well what that awakening would mean to himself
CHAPTER XXIV THE ARTIST AND HIS ART The private view of the paintings and drawings of the Brush and Pencil Club on the evening of the fifteenth was a great success
Society sent its fairest women in frocks that were pictures in themselves
Art sent its severest critics and its most ardent devotees
The Press sent reporters that the World might know what Art and Society were doing and how they did it
Before the canvases signed with Bertram Henshaws name there was always to be found an admiring group representing both Art and Society with the Press on the outskirts to report
William Henshaw coming unobserved upon one such group paused a moment to smile at the various more or less disconnected comments
What a lovely blue
Marvellous color sense
Now those shadows are He gets his high lights so I declare she looks just like Blanche Payton
Every line there is full of meaning
I suppose its very fine but Now I say Henshaw is Is this by the man thats painting Margy Winthrops portrait
Its idealism man idealism
Im going to have a dress just that shade of blue
Isnt that just too sweet
Now for realism I consider Henshaw There arent many with his sensitive brilliant touch
Oh what a pretty picture
William moved on then
Billy was rapturously proud of Bertram that evening
He was of course the centre of congratulations and hearty praise
At his side Billy with sparkling eyes welcomed each smiling congratulation and gloried in every commendatory word she heard
Oh Bertram isnt it splendid
Im so proud of you she whispered softly when a moments lull gave her opportunity
Theyre all words words idle words he laughed but his eyes shone
Just as if they werent all true
she bridled turning to greet William who came up at that moment
Isnt it fine Uncle William
she beamed
And arent we proud of him
We are indeed smiled the man
But if you and Bertram want to get the real opinion of this crowd you should go and stand near one of his pictures five minutes
As a sort of crazy quilt criticism it cant be beat
I know laughed Bertram
Ive done it in days long gone
Bertram not really
cried Billy
Sure
As if every young artist at the first didnt don goggles or a false mustache and study the pictures on either side of his own till he could paint them with his eyes shut
And what did you hear
demanded the girl
What didnt I hear
laughed her lover
But I didnt do it but once or twice
I lost my head one day and began to argue the question of perspective with a couple of old codgers who were criticizing a bit of foreshortening that was my special pet
I forgot my goggles and sailed in
The game was up then of course and I never put them on again
But it was worth a farm to see their faces when I stood discovered as the stagefolk say
Serves you right sirlistening like that scolded Billy
Bertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders
Well it cured me anyhow
I havent done it since he declared
It was some time later on the way home that Bertram said It was gratifying of course Billy and I liked it
It would be absurd to say I didnt like the many pleasant words of apparently sincere appreciation I heard tonight
But I couldnt help thinking of the next timealways the next time
The next time
Billys eyes were slightly puzzled
That I exhibit I mean
The Bohemian Ten hold their exhibition next month you know
I shall show just one picturethe portrait of Miss Winthrop
Oh Bertram
Itll be Oh Bertram
then dear if it isnt a success he sighed
I dont believe you realize yet what that thing is going to mean for me
Well I should think I might retorted Billy a little tremulously after all Ive heard about it
I should think everybody knew you were doing it Bertram
Actually Im not sure Maries scrublady wont ask me some day how Mr Bertrams picture is coming on
Thats the dickens of it in a way sighed Bertram with a faint smile
I am amazed and a little frightened Ill admitat the universality of the interest
You see the Winthrops have been pleased to spread it for one reason or another and of course many already know of the failures of Anderson and Fullam
Thats why if I should fail But you arent going to fail interposed the girl resolutely
No I know Im not
I only said if  fenced the man his voice not quite steady
There isnt going to be any if  settled Billy
Now tell me when is the exhibition
March twentieththe private view
Mr Winthrop is not only willing but anxious that I show it
I wasnt sure that hed want me to in an exhibition
But it seems he does
His daughter says he has every confidence in the portrait and wants everybody to see it
Thats where he shows his good sense declared Billy
Then with just a touch of constraint she asked And how is the new latest pose coming on
Very well I think answered Bertram a little hesitatingly
Weve had so many many interruptions though that it is surprising how slow it is moving
In the first place Miss Winthrop is gone more than half the time she goes again tomorrow for a week
 and in this portrait Im not painting a stroke without my model before me
I mean to take no chances you see and Miss Winthrop is perfectly willing to give me all the sittings I wish for
Of course if she hadnt changed the pose and costume so many times it would have been done long agoand she knows it
Of courseshe knows it murmured Billy a little faintly but with a peculiar intonation in her voice
And so you see sighed Bertram what the twentieth of March is going to mean for me
Its going to mean a splendid triumph
asserted Billy and this time her voice was not faint and it carried only a ring of loyal confidence
You blessed comforter
murmured Bertram giving with his eyes the caress that his lips would so much have preferred to giveunder more propitious circumstances
CHAPTER XXV THE OPERETTA The sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth of February were for Billy and for all concerned in the success of the operetta days of hurry worry and feverish excitement as was to be expected of course
Each afternoon and every evening saw rehearsals in whole or in parts
A friend of the Clubpresidents sisterinlawa woman whose husband was stage manager of a Boston theatrehad consented to come and coach the performers
At her appearance the performerspromptly thrown into nervous spasms by this fearsome nearness to the real thingforgot half their cues and conducted themselves generally like frightened school children on piece day much to their own and every one elses despair
Then on the evening of the nineteenth came the final dress rehearsal on the stage of the pretty little hall that had been engaged for the performance of the operetta
The dress rehearsal like most of its kind was for every one nothing but a nightmare of discord discouragement and disaster
Everybodys nerves were on edge everybody was sure the thing would be a flat failure
The soprano sang off the key the alto forgot to shriek Beware beware
until it was so late there was nothing to beware of the basso stepped on Billys trailing frock and tore it even the tenor Arkwright himself seemed to have lost every bit of vim from his acting
The chorus sang Oh be joyful
with dirgelike solemnity and danced as if legs and feet were made of wood
The lovers after the fashion of amateur actors from time immemorial made love like sticks
Billy when the dismal thing had dragged its way through the final note sat down front crying softly in the semidarkness while she was waiting for Alice Greggory to run it through just once more with a pair of tiredfaced fluffy skirted fairies who could not learn that a duet meant a duetnot two solos independently hurried or retarded as ones fancy for the moment dictated
To Billy just then life did not look to be even half worth the living
Her head ached her throat was goingtobesore her shoe hurt and her dress the trailing frock that had been under the bassos footcould not possibly be decently repaired before tomorrow night she was sure
Bad as these things were however they were only the intimate immediate woes
Beyond and around them lay others many others
To be sure Bertram and happiness were supposed to be somewhere in the dim and uncertain future but between her and them lay all these other woes chief of which was the unutterable tragedy of tomorrow night
It was to be a failure of course
Billy had calmly made up her mind to that now
But then she was used to failures she told herself
Was she not plainly failing every day of her life to bring about even friendship between Alice Greggory and Arkwright
Did they not emphatically and systematically refuse to be thrown together either naturally or unnaturally
And yet whenever again could she expect such opportunities to further her Cause as had been hers the past few weeks through the operetta and its rehearsals
Certainly never again
It had been a failure like all the rest like the operetta in particular
Billy did not mean that any one should know she was crying
She supposed that all the performers except herself and the two earthbound fairies by the piano with Alice Greggory were gone
She knew that John with Peggy was probably waiting at the door outside and she hoped that soon the fairies would decide to go home and go to bed and let other people do the same
For her part she did not see why they were struggling so hard anyway
Why neednt they go ahead and sing their duet like two solos if they wanted to
As if a little thing like that could make a feathers weight of difference in the grand total of tomorrow nights wretchedness when the final curtain should have been rung down on their shame
Miss Neilson you arentcrying
exclaimed a low voice and Billy turned to find Arkwright standing by her side in the dim light
Oh noyeswell maybe I was a little stammered Billy trying to speak very unconcernedly
How warm it is in here
Do you think its going to rainthat is outdoors of course I mean
Arkwright dropped into the seat behind Billy and leaned forward his eyes striving to read the girls halfaverted face
If Billy had turned she would have seen that Arkwrights own face showed white and a little drawnlooking in the feeble rays from the light by the piano
But Billy did not turn
She kept her eyes steadily averted and she went on speakingairy inconsequential words
Dear me if those girls would only pull together
But then whats the difference
I supposed you had gone home long ago Mr
Arkwright
Miss Neilson you are crying
Arkwrights voice was low and vibrant
As if anything or anybody in the world could make you cry
Please you have only to command me and I will sally forth at once to slay the offender
His words were light but his voice still shook with emotion
Billy gave an hysterical little giggle
Angrily she brushed the persistent tears from her eyes
All right then Ill dub you my Sir Knight she faltered
But Ill warn youyoull have your hands full
Youll have to slay my headache and my throatache and my shoe that hurts and the man who stepped on my dress andand everybody in the operetta including myself
Everybodyin the operetta
Arkwright did look a little startled at this wholesale slaughter
Yes
Did you ever see such an awful awful thing as that was tonight
moaned the girl
Arkwrights face relaxed
Oh so thats what it is
he laughed lightly
Then its only a bogy of fear that Ive got to slay after all and Ill despatch that right now with a single blow
Dress rehearsals always go like that tonight
Ive been in a dozen and I never yet saw one go half decent
Dont you worry
The worse the rehearsal the better the performance every time
Billy blinked off the tears and essayed a smile as she retorted Well if thats so then ours tomorrow night ought to be aa A corker helped out Arkwright promptly and it will be too
You poor child youre worn out and no wonder
But dont worry another bit about the operetta
Now is there anything else I can do for you
Anything else I can slay
Billy laughed tremulously
Nno thank you not that you canslay I fancy she sighed
That isnot that you will she amended wistfully with a sudden remembrance of the Cause for which he might do so muchif he only would
Arkwright bent a little nearer
His breath stirred the loose curling hair behind Billys ear
His eyes had flashed into sudden fire
But you dont know what Id do if I could he murmured unsteadily
If youd let me tell youif you only knew the wish that has lain closest to my heart for Miss Neilson please called the despairing voice of one of the earthbound fairies Miss Neilson you are there arent you
Yes Im right here answered Billy wearily
Arkwright answered too but not aloudwhich was wise
Oh dear
youre tired I know wailed the fairy but if you would please come and help us just a minute
Could you
Why yes of course
Billy rose to her feet still wearily
Arkwright touched her arm
She turned and saw his face
It was very whiteso white that her eyes widened in surprised questioning
As if answering the unspoken words the man shook his head
I cant now of course he said
But there is something I want to saya story I want to tell youafter tomorrow perhaps
May I
To Billy the tremor of his voice the suffering in his eyes and the story he was begging to tell could have but one interpretation Alice Greggory
Her face therefore was a glory of tender sympathy as she reached out her hand in farewell
Of course you may she cried
Come any time after tomorrow night please she smiled encouragingly as she turned toward the stage
Behind her Arkwright stumbled twice as he walked up the incline toward the outer door stumbled not because of the semidarkness of the little theatre but because of the blinding radiance of a girls illumined face which he had a moment before read all unknowingly exactly wrong
A little more than twentyfour hours later Billy Neilson in her own room drew a long breath of relief
It was twelve oclock on the night of the twentieth and the operetta was over
To Billy life was eminently worth living to night
Her head did not ache her throat was not sore her shoe did not hurt her dress had been mended so successfully by Aunt Hannah and with such comforting celerity that long before night one would never have suspected the filmy thing had known the devastating tread of any mans foot
Better yet the soprano had sung exactly to key the alto had shrieked Beware
to thrilling purpose Arkwright had shown all his old charm and vim and the chorus had been prodigies of joyousness and marvels of lightness
Even the lovers had lost their stiffness while the two earthbound fairies of the night before had found so amiable a meeting point that their solos sounded to the uninitiated very like indeed a duet
The operetta was in short a glorious and gratifying success both artistically and financially
Nor was this all that to Billy made life worth the living Arkwright had begged permission that evening to come up the following afternoon to tell her his story and Billy who was so joyously confident that this story meant the final crowning of her Cause with victory had given happy consent
Bertram was to come up in the evening and Billy was anticipating that too particularly it had been so long since they had known a really free comfortable evening together with nothing to interrupt
Doubtless too after Arkwrights visit of the afternoon she would be in a position to tell Bertram the story of the suspended romance between Arkwright and Miss Greggory and perhaps something also of her own efforts to bring the couple together again
On the whole life did indeed look decidedly worth the living as Billy with a contented sigh turned over to go to sleep
CHAPTER XXVI ARKWRIGHT TELLS ANOTHER STORY Promptly at the suggested hour on the day after the operetta Arkwright rang Billy Neilsons doorbell
Promptly too Billy herself came into the livingroom to greet him
Billy was in white todaya soft creamy white wool with a touch of black velvet at her throat and in her hair
The man thought she had never looked so lovely Arkwright was still under the spell wrought by the soft radiance of Billys face the two times he had mentioned his story
Until the night before the operetta Arkwright had been more than doubtful of the way that story would be received should he ever summon the courage to tell it
Since then his fears had been changed to rapturous hopes
It was very eagerly therefore that he turned now to greet Billy as she came into the room
Suppose we dont have any music today
Suppose we give the whole time up to the story she smiled brightly as she held out her hand
Arkwrights heart leaped but almost at once it throbbed with a vague uneasiness
He would have preferred to see her blush and be a little shy over that story
Stillthere was a chance of course that she did not know what the story was
But if that were the case what of the radiance in her face
What of Finding himself in a tangled labyrinth that led apparently only to disappointment and disaster Arkwright pulled himself up with a firm hand
You are very kind he murmured as he relinquished her fingers and seated himself near her
You are sure then that you wish to hear the story
Very sure smiled Billy
Arkwright hesitated
Again he longed to see a little embarrassment in the bright face opposite
Suddenly it came to him however that if Billy knew what he was about to say it would manifestly not be her part to act as if she knew
With a lighter heart then he began his story
You want it from the beginning
By all means
I never dip into books nor peek at the ending
I dont think its fair to the author
Then I will indeed begin at the beginning smiled Arkwright for Im specially anxious that you shall beeven more than fair to me
His voice shook a little but he hurried on
Theres agirlin it a very dear lovely girl
Of courseif its a nice story twinkled Billy
Andtheres a man too
Its a love story you see
Again of courseif its interesting
Billy laughed mischievously but she flushed a little
Still the man doesnt amount to much after all perhaps
I might as well own up at the beginningIm the man
That will do for you to say as long as youre telling the story smiled Billy
Well let it pass for proper modesty on your part
But I shall saythe personal touch only adds to the interest
Arkwright drew in his breath
Well hopeitll really be so he murmured
There was a moments silence
Arkwright seemed to be hesitating what to say
Well
prompted Billy with a smile
We have the hero and the heroine now what happens next
Do you know she added I have always thought that part must bother the story writersto get the couple to doing interesting things after theyd got them introduced
Arkwright sighed
Perhapson paper but you see my story has been lived so far
So its quite different
Very well thenwhat did happen
smiled Billy
I was trying to thinkof the first thing
You see it began with a picture a photograph of the girl
Mother had it
I saw it and wanted it and Arkwright had started to say and took it
But he stopped with the last two words unsaid
It was not time yet he deemed to tell this girl how much that picture had been to him for so many months past
He hurried on a little precipitately
You see I had heard about this girl a lot and I likedwhat I heard
You meanyou didnt know herat the first
Billys eyes were surprised
Billy had supposed that Arkwright had always known Alice Greggory
No I didnt know the girltill afterwards
Before that I was always dreaming and wondering what she would be like
Oh
Billy subsided into her chair still with the puzzled questioning in her eyes
Then I met her
Yes
And she was everything and more than I had pictured her
And you fell in love at once
Billys voice had grown confident again
Oh I was already in love sighed Arkwright
I simply sank deeper
Ohh
breathed Billy sympathetically
And the girl
She didnt careor knowfor a long time
Im not really sure she caresor knowseven now
Arkwrights eyes were wistfully fixed on Billys face
Oh but you cant tell always about girls murmured Billy hurriedly
A faint pink had stolen to her forehead
She was thinking of Alice Greggory and wondering if indeed Alice did care and if she Billy might dare to assure this manwhat she believed to be truethat his sweetheart was only waiting for him to come to her and tell her that he loved her
Arkwright saw the color sweep to Billys forehead and took sudden courage
He leaned forward eagerly
A tender light came to his eyes
The expression on his face was unmistakable
Billy do you mean really that there is hope for me
he begged brokenly
Billy gave a visible start
A quick something like shocked terror came to her eyes
She drew back and would have risen to her feet had the thought not come to her that twice before she had supposed a man was making love to her when subsequent events proved that she had been mortifyingly mistaken once when Cyril had told her of his love for Marie and again when William had asked her to come back as a daughter to the house she had left desolate
Telling herself sternly now not to be for the third time a foolish little simpleton she summoned all her wits forced a cheery smile to her lips and said Well really Mr Arkwright of course I cant answer for the girl so Im not the one to give hope and But you are the one interrupted the man passionately
Youre the only one
As if from the very first I hadnt loved you and No no not thatnot that
Im mistaken
Im not understanding what you mean pleaded a horrorstricken voice
Billy was on her feet now holding up two protesting hands palms outward
Miss Neilson you dont meanthat you havent knownall this timethat it was you
The man now was on his feet his eyes hurt and unbelieving looking into hers
Billy paled
She began slowly to back away
Her eyes still fixed on his carried the shrinking terror of one who sees a horrid vision
But you knowyou must know that I am not yours to win
she reproached him sharply
Im to be Bertram Henshawswife
From Billys shocked young lips the word dropped with a ringing force that was at once accusatory and prohibitive
It was as if by the mere utterance of the word wife she had drawn a sacred circle about her and placed herself in sanctuary
From the blazing accusation in her eyes Arkwright fell back
Wife
You are to be Bertram Henshaws wife
he exclaimed
There was no mistaking the amazed incredulity on his face
Billy caught her breath
The righteous indignation in her eyes fled and a terrified appeal took its place
You dont mean that you didntknow she faltered
There was a moments silence
A power quite outside herself kept Billys eyes on Arkwrights face and forced her to watch the change there from unbelief to belief and from belief to set misery
No I did not know said the man then dully as he turned rested his arm on the mantel behind him and half shielded his face with his hand
Billy sank into a low chair
Her fingers fluttered nervously to her throat
Her piteous beseeching eyes were on the broad back and bent head of the man before her
But II dont see how you could have helpedknowing she stammered at last
I dont see how such a thing could have happened that you shouldnt know
Ive been trying to think myself returned the man still in a dull emotionless voice
Its been soso much a matter of course
I supposed everybody knew it maintained Billy
Perhaps thats just itthat it wasso much a matter of course rejoined the man
You see I know very few of your friends anyway who would be apt to mention it to me
But the announcementsoh you werent here then moaned Billy
But you must have known thatthat he came here a good deal that we were together so much
To a certain extent yes sighed Arkwright
But I took your friendship with him and his brothers asas a matter of course
That was my matter of course you see he went on bitterly
I knew you were Mr William Henshaws namesake and Calderwell had told me the story of your coming to them when you were left alone in the world
Calderwell had said too that Arkwright paused then hurried on a little constrainedlywell he said something that led me to think Mr Bertram Henshaw was not a marrying man anyway
Billy winced and changed color
She had noticed the pause and she knew very well what it was that Calderwell had said to occasion that pause
Must always she be reminded that no one expected Bertram Henshaw to love any girl except to paint
Butbut Mr Calderwell must know about the engagementnow she stammered
Very likely but I have not happened to hear from him since my arrival in Boston
We do not correspond
There was a long silence then Arkwright spoke again
I think I understand nowmany things
I wonder I did not see them before but I never thought of Bertram Henshaws being If Calderwell hadnt said Again Arkwright stopped with his sentence half complete and again Billy winced
Ive been a blind fool
I was so intent on my own Ive been a blind fool thats all repeated Arkwright with a break in his voice
Billy tried to speak but instead of words there came only a choking sob
Arkwright turned sharply
Miss Neilson dontplease he begged
There is no need that you should suffertoo
But I am so ashamed that such a thing could happen she faltered
Im sure some way I must be to blame
But I never thought
I was blind too
I was wrapped up in my own affairs
I never suspected
I never even thought to suspect
I thought of course you knew
It was just the music that brought us together I supposed and you were just like one of the family anyway
I always thought of you as Aunt Hannahs She stopped with a vivid blush
As Aunt Hannahs niece Mary Jane of course supplied Arkwright bitterly turning back to his old position
And that was my own fault too
My name Miss Neilson is Michael Jeremiah he went on wearily after a moments hesitation his voice showing his utter abandonment to despair
When a boy at school I got heartily sick of the Mike and the Jerry and the even worse Tom and Jerry that my young friends delighted in so as soon as possible I sought obscurity and peace in M
J
Much to my surprise and annoyance the initials proved to be little better for they became at once the biggest sort of whet to peoples curiosity
Naturally the more determined persistent inquirers were to know the name the more determined I became that they shouldnt
All very silly and very foolish of course
Certainly it seems so now he finished
Billy was silent
She was trying to find something anything to say when Arkwright began speaking again still in that dull hopeless voice that Billy thought would break her heart
As for the Mary Janethat was another foolishness of course
My small brothers and sisters originated it others followed on occasion even Calderwell
Perhaps you did not know but he was the friend who by his laughing question Why dont you Mary Jane
put into my head the crazy scheme of writing to Aunt Hannah and letting her think I was a real Mary Jane
You see what I stooped to do Miss Neilson for the chance of meeting and knowing you
Billy gave a low cry
She had suddenly remembered the beginning of Arkwrights story
For the first time she realized that he had been talking then about herself not Alice Greggory
But you dont mean that youcared that I was the She could not finish
Arkwright turned from the mantel with a gesture of utter despair
Yes I cared then
I had heard of you
I had sung your songs
I was determined to meet you
So I cameand met you
After that I was more determined than ever to win you
Perhaps you see now why I was so blind toto any other possibility
But it doesnt do any goodto talk like this
I understand now
Only please dont blame yourself he begged as he saw her eyes fill with tears
The next moment he was gone
Billy had turned away and was crying softly so she did not see him go
CHAPTER XXVII THE THING THAT WAS THE TRUTH Bertram called that evening
Billy had no story now to tellnothing of the interrupted romance between Alice Greggory and Arkwright
Billy carefully indeed avoided mentioning Arkwrights name
Ever since the mans departure that afternoon Billy had been frantically trying to assure herself that she was not to blame that she would not be supposed to know he cared for her that it had all been as he said it washis foolish blindness
But even when she had partially comforted herself by these assertions she could not by any means escape the haunting vision of the mans sternset suffering face as she had seen it that afternoon nor could she keep from weeping at the memory of the words he had said and at the thought that never again could their pleasant friendship be quite the sameif indeed there could be any friendship at all between them
But if Billy expected that her red eyes pale cheeks and generally troubled appearance and unquiet manner were to be passed unnoticed by her lovers keen eyes that evening she found herself much mistaken
Sweetheart what is the matter
demanded Bertram resolutely at last when his more indirect questions had been evasively turned aside
You cant make me think there isnt something the trouble because I know there is
Well then there is dear smiled Billy tearfully but please just dont let us talk of it
II want to forget it
Truly I do
But I want to know so I can forget it persisted Bertram
What is it
Maybe I could help
She shook her head with a little frightened cry
No noyou cant helpreally
But sweetheart you dont know
Perhaps I could
Wont you tell me about it
Billy looked distressed
I cant deartruly
You see it isnt quite mineto tell
Not yours
Notentirely
But it makes you feel bad
Yesvery
Then cant I know that part
Oh nono indeed no
You seeit wouldnt be fairto the other
Bertram stared a little
Then his mouth set into stern lines
Billy what are you talking about
Seems to me I have a right to know
Billy hesitated
To her mind a girl who would tell of the unrequited love of a man for herself was unspeakably base
To tell Bertram Arkwrights love story was therefore impossible
Yet in some way she must set Bertrams mind at rest
Dearest she began slowly her eyes wistfully pleading just what it is I cant tell you
In a way its anothers secret and I dont feel that I have the right to tell it
Its just something that I learned this afternoon
But it has made you cry
Yes
It made me feel very unhappy
Thenit was something you couldnt help
To Bertrams surprise the face he was watching so intently flushed scarlet
No I couldnt help itnow though I might haveonce
Billy spoke this last just above her breath
Then she went on beseechingly Bertram please please dont talk of it any more
Itits just spoiling our happy evening together
Bertram bit his lip and drew a long sigh
All right dear you know best of course since I dont know anything about it he finished a little stiffly
Billy began to talk then very brightly of Aunt Hannah and her shawls and of a visit she had made to Cyril and Marie that morning
And do you know
Aunt Hannahs clock has done a good turn at last and justified its existence
Listen she cried gayly
Marie had a letter from her mothers Cousin Jane
Cousin Jane couldnt sleep nights because she was always lying awake to find out just what time it was so Marie had written her about Aunt Hannahs clock
And now this Cousin Jane has fixed her clock and she sleeps like a top just because she knows therell never be but half an hour that she doesnt know what time it is
Bertram smiled and murmured a polite Well Im sure thats fine
 but the words were plainly abstracted and the frown had not left his brow
Nor did it quite leave till some time later when Billy in answer to a question of his about another operetta cried with a shudder Mercy I hope not dear
I dont want to hear the word operetta again for a year
Bertram smiled then broadly
He too would be quite satisfied not to hear the word operetta for a year
Operetta to Bertram meant interruptions interferences and the constant presence of Arkwright the Greggorys and innumerable creatures who wished to rehearse or to change wigsall of which Bertram abhorred
No wonder therefore that he smiled and that the frown disappeared from his brow
He thought he saw ahead serene blissful days for Billy and himself
As the days however began to pass one by one Bertram Henshaw found them to be anything but serene and blissful
The operetta with its rehearsals and its interruptions was gone certainly but he was becoming seriously troubled about Billy
Billy did not act natural
Sometimes she seemed like her old self and he breathed more freely telling himself that his fears were groundless
Then would come the haunting shadow to her eyes the droop to her mouth and the nervousness to her manner that he so dreaded
Worse yet all this seemed to be connected in some strange way with Arkwright
He found this out by accident one day
She had been talking and laughing brightly about something when he chanced to introduce Arkwrights name
By the way where is Mary Jane these days
he asked then
I dont know Im sure
He hasnt been here lately murmured Billy reaching for a book on the table
At a peculiar something in her voice he had looked up quickly only to find to his great surprise that her face showed a painful flush as she bent over the book in her hand
He had said nothing more at the time but he had not forgotten
Several times after that he had introduced the mans name and never had it failed to bring a rush of color a biting of the lip or a quick change of position followed always by the troubled eyes and nervous manner that he had learned to dread
He noticed then that never of her own free will did she herself mention the man never did she speak of him with the old frank lightness as Mary Jane
By casual questions asked from time to time Bertram had learned that Arkwright never came there now and that the songwriting together had been given up
Curiously enough this discovery which would once have filled Bertram with joy served now only to deepen his distress
That there was anything inconsistent in the fact that he was more frightened now at the mans absence than he had been before at his presence did not occur to him
He knew only that he was frightened and badly frightened
Bertram had not forgotten the evening after the operetta and Billys tearstained face on that occasion
He dated the whole thing in fact from that evening
He fell to wondering one day if that too had anything to do with Arkwright
He determined then to find out
Shamelessly for the good of the causehe set a trap for Billys unwary feet
Very adroitly one day he led the talk straight to Arkwright then he asked abruptly Where is the chap I wonder
Why he hasnt shown up once since the operetta has he
Billy always truthfuland just now always embarrassed when Arkwrights name was mentioned walked straight into the trap
Oh yes well he was here oncethe day after the operetta
I havent seen him since
Bertram answered a light something but his face grew a little white
Now that the trap had been sprung and the victim caught he almost wished that he had not set any trap at all
He knew now it was true
Arkwright had been with Billy the day after the operetta and her tears and her distress that evening had been caused by something Arkwright had said
It was Arkwrights secret that she could not tell
It was Arkwright to whom she must be fair
It was Arkwrights sorrow that she could not helpnow
Naturally with these tools in his hands and aided by days of brooding and nights of sleeplessness it did not take Bertram long to fashion The Thing that finally loomed before him as The Truth
He understood it all now
Music had conquered
Billy and Arkwright had found that they loved each other
On the day after the operetta they had met and had had some sort of scene together doubtless Arkwright had declared his love
That was the secret that Billy could not tell and be fair
Billy of courseloyal little soul that she washad sent him away at once
Was her hand not already pledged
That was why she could not help itnow
Bertram writhed in agony at the thought
Since that meeting Arkwright had not been near the house
Billy had found however that her heart had gone with Arkwright hence the shadow in her eyes the nervousness in her manner and the embarrassment that she always showed at the mention of his name
That Billy was still outwardly loyal to himself and that she still kept to her engagement did not surprise Bertram in the least
That was like Billy
Bertram had not forgotten how less than a year before this same Billy had held herself loyal and true to an engagement with William because a wretched mistake all around had caused her to give her promise to be Williams wife under the impression that she was carrying out Williams dearest wish
Bertram remembered her face as it had looked all those long summer days while her heart was being slowly broken and he thought he could see that same look in her eyes now
All of which only goes to prove with what woeful skill Bertram had fashioned this Thing that was looming before him as The Truth
The exhibition of The Bohemian Ten was to open with a private view on the evening of the twentieth of March
Bertram Henshaws one contribution was to be his portrait of Miss Marguerite Winthropthe piece of work that had come to mean so much to him the piece of work upon which already he felt the focus of multitudes of eyes
Miss Winthrop was in Boston now and it was during these early March days that Bertram was supposed to be putting in his best work on the portrait but unfortunately it was during these same early March days that he was engaged also in fashioning The Thingand the two did not harmonize
The Thing indeed was a jealous creature and would brook no rival
She filled his eyes with horrid visions and his brain with sickening thoughts
Between him and his model she flung a veil of fear and she set his hand to trembling and his brush to making blunders with the paints on his palette
Bertram saw The Thing and saw too the grievous result of her presence
Despairingly he fought against her and her work but The Thing had become full grown now and was The Truth
Hence she was not to be banished
She even in a taunting way seemed sometimes to be justifying her presence for she reminded him After all whats the difference
What do you care for this or anything again if Billy is lost to you
But the artist told himself fiercely that he did carethat he must carefor his work and he struggledhow he struggledto ignore the horrid visions and the sickening thoughts and to pierce the veil of fear so that his hand might be steady and his brush regain its skill
And so he worked
Sometimes he let his work remain
Sometimes one hour saw only the erasing of what the hour before had wrought
Sometimes the elusive something in Marguerite Winthrops face seemed right at the tip of his brushon the canvas even
He saw success then so plainly that for a moment it almostbut not quite blotted out The Thing
At other times that elusive something on the highbred face of his model was a veritable willothewisp refusing to be caught and held even in his eye
The artist knew then that his picture would be hung with Andersons and Fullams
But the portrait was irrefutably nearing completion and it was to be exhibited the twentieth of the month
Bertram knew these for facts
CHAPTER XXVIII BILLY TAKES HER TURN If for Billy those first twenty days of March did not carry quite the tragedy they contained for Bertram they were nevertheless not really happy ones
She was vaguely troubled by a curious something in Bertrams behavior that she could not name she was grieved over Arkwrights sorrow and she was constantly probing her own past conduct to see if anywhere she could find that she was to blame for that sorrow
She missed too undeniably Arkwrights cheery presence and the charm and inspiration of his music
Nor was she finding it easy to give satisfactory answers to the questions Aunt Hannah William and Bertram so often asked her as to where Mary Jane was
Even her music was little comfort to her these days
She was not writing anything
There was no song in her heart to tempt her to write
Arkwrights new words that he had brought her were out of the question of course
They had been put away with the manuscript of the completed song which had not fortunately gone to the publishers
Billy had waited intending to send them together
She was so glad now that she had waited
Just once since Arkwrights last call she had tried to sing that song
But she had stopped at the end of the first two lines
The full meaning of those words as coming from Arkwright had swept over her then and she had snatched up the manuscript and hidden it under the bottom pile of music in her cabinet 


And she had presumed to sing that love song to Bertram
Arkwright had written Billy oncea kind courteous manly note that had made her cry
He had begged her again not to blame herself and he had said that he hoped he should be strong enough sometime to wish to call occasionally if she were willingand renew their pleasant hours with their music but for the present he knew there was nothing for him to do but to stay away
He had signed himself Michael Jeremiah Arkwright and to Billy that was the most pathetic thing in the letterit sounded so hopeless and dreary to one who knew the jaunty M
J
Alice Greggory Billy saw frequently
Billy and Aunt Hannah were great friends with the Greggorys now and had been ever since the Greggorys tendays visit at Hillside
The cheery little cripple with the gentle tap tap tap of her crutches had won everybodys heart the very first day and Alice was scarcely less of a favorite after the sunny friendliness of Hillside had thawed her stiff reserve into naturalness
Billy had little to say to Alice Greggory of Arkwright
Billy was no longer trying to play Cupids assistant
The Cause for which she had so valiantly worked had been felled by Arkwrights own handbut that there were still some faint stirrings of life in it was evidenced by Billys secret delight when one day Alice Greggory chanced to mention that Arkwright had called the night before upon her and her mother
He brought us news of our old home she explained a little hurriedly to Billy
He had heard from his mother and he thought some things she said would be interesting to us
Of course murmured Billy carefully excluding from her voice any hint of the delight she felt but hoping all the while that Alice would continue the subject
Alice however had nothing more to say and Billy was left in entire ignorance of what the news was that Arkwright had brought
She suspected though that it had something to do with Alices fathercertainly she hoped that it had for if Arkwright had called to tell it it must be good
Billy had found a new home for the Greggorys although at first they had drawn sensitively back and had said that they preferred to remain where they were they had later gratefully accepted it
A little couple from South Boston to whom Billy had given a two weeks outing the summer before had moved into town and taken a flat in the South End
They had two extra rooms which they had told Billy they would like to let for light house keeping if only they knew just the right people to take into such close quarters with themselves
Billy at once thought of the Greggorys and spoke of them
The little couple were delighted and the Greggorys were scarcely less so when they at last became convinced that only a very little more money than they were already paying would give themselves a much pleasanter home and would at the same time be a real boon to two young people who were trying to meet expenses
So the change was made and general happiness all round had resultedso much so that Bertram had said to Billy when he heard of it It looks as if this was a case where your cake is frosted on both sides
Nonsense
This isnt frostingits business Billy had laughed
And the new pupils you have found for Miss Alicetheyre business too I suppose
Certainly retorted Billy with decision
Then she had given a low laugh and said Mercy
If Alice Greggory thought it was anything but business I verily believe she would refuse every one of the new pupils and begin tonight to carry back the tables and chairs herself to those wretched rooms she left last month
Bertram had smiled but the smile had been a fleeting one and the brooding look of gloom that Billy had noticed so frequently of late had come back to his eyes
Billy was not a little disturbed over Bertram these days
He did not seem to be his natural cheery self at all
He talked little and what he did say seldom showed a trace of his usually whimsical way of putting things
He was kindness itself to her and seemed particularly anxious to please her in every way but she frequently found his eyes fixed on her with a sombre questioning that almost frightened her
The more she thought of it the more she wondered what the question was that he did not dare to ask and whether it was of herself or himself that he would ask itif he did dare
Then with benumbing force one day a possible solution of the mystery came to her he had found out that it was true what all his friends had declared of himhe did not really love any girl except to paint
The minute this thought came to her Billy thrust it indignantly away
It was disloyal to Bertram and unworthy of herself even to think such a thing
She told herself then that it was only the portrait of Miss Winthrop that was troubling him
She knew that he was worried over that
He had confessed to her that actually sometimes he was beginning to fear his hand had lost its cunning
As if that were not enough to bring the gloom to any mans faceto any artists
No sooner however had Billy arrived at this point in her mental argument than a new element enteredher old lurking jealousy of which she was heartily ashamed but which she had never yet been able quite to subdue her jealousy of the beautiful girl with the beautiful name not Billy whose portrait had needed so much time and so many sittings to finish
What if Bertram had found that he loved her What if that were why his hand had lost its cunningbecause though loving her he realized that he was bound to another Billy herself
This thought too Billy cast from her at once as again disloyal and unworthy
But both thoughts having once entered her brain had made for themselves roads over which the second passing was much easier than the firstas Billy found to her sorrow
Certainly as the days went by and as Bertrams face and manner became more and more a tragedy of suffering Billy found it increasingly difficult to keep those thoughts from wearing their roads of suspicion into horrid deep ruts of certainty
Only with William and Marie now could Billy escape from it all
With William she sought new curios and catalogued the old
With Marie she beat eggs and whipped cream in the shining kitchen and tried to think that nothing in the world mattered except that the cake in the oven should not fall
CHAPTER XXIX KATE WRITES A LETTER Bertram feared that he knew before the portrait was hung that it was a failure
He was sure that he knew it on the evening of the twentieth when he encountered the swiftly averted eyes of some of his artist friends and saw the perplexed frown on the faces of others
But he knew afterwards that he did not really know ittill he read the newspapers during the next few days
There was praiseoh yes the faint praise that kills
There was some adverse criticism too but it was of the light insincere variety that is given to mediocre work by unimportant artists
Then here and there appeared the signed critiques of the men whose opinion counted and Bertram knew that he had failed
Neither as a work of art nor as a likeness was the portrait the success that Henshaws former work would seem to indicate that it should have been
Indeed as one caustic pen put it if this were to be taken as a sample of what was to followthen the famous originator of The Face of a Girl had a most distinguished future behind him
Seldom if ever before had an exhibited portrait attracted so much attention
As Bertram had said uncounted eyes were watching for it before it was hung because it was a portrait of the noted beauty Marguerite Winthrop and because two other wellknown artists had failed where he Bertram Henshaw was hoping to succeed
After it was hung and the uncounted eyes had seen iteither literally or through the eyes of the criticsinterest seemed rather to grow than to lessen for other uncounted eyes wanted to see what all the fuss was about anyway
And when these eyes had seen their owners talked
Nor did they by any means all talk against the portrait
Some were as loud in its praise as were others in its condemnation all of which of course but helped to attract more eyes to the cause of it all
For Bertram and his friends these days were naturally trying ones
William finally dreaded to open his newspaper
It had become the fashion when murders and divorces were scarce occasionally to feature somebodys opinion of the Henshaw portrait on the first pagesomething that had almost never been known to happen before
Cyril according to Marie played perfectly awful things on his piano every day now
Aunt Hannah had said Oh my grief and conscience
so many times that it melted now into a wordless groan whenever a new unfriendly criticism of the portrait met her indignant eyes
Of all Bertrams friends Billy perhaps not unnaturally was the angriest
Not only did she after a time refuse to read the papers but she refused even to allow certain ones to be brought into the house foolish and unreasonable as she knew this to be
As to the artist himself Bertrams face showed drawn lines and his eyes sombre shadows but his words and manner carried a stolid indifference that to Billy was at once heartbreaking and maddening
But Bertram why dont you do something
Why dont you say something
Why dont you act something
she burst out one day
The artist shrugged his shoulders
But my dear what can I say or do or act
he asked
I dont know of course sighed Billy
But I know what Id like to do
I should like to go out andfight somebody
So fierce were words and manner coupled as they were with a pair of gentle eyes ablaze and two soft little hands doubled into menacing fists that Bertram laughed
What a fiery little champion it is to be sure he said tenderly
But as if fighting could do any goodin this case
Billys tense muscles relaxed
Her eyes filled with tears
No I dont suppose it would she choked beginning to cry so that Bertram had to turn comforter
Come come dear he begged dont take it so to heart
Its not so bad after all
Ive still my good right hand left and well hope theres something in it yetthatll be worth while
But this one isnt bad stormed Billy
Its splendid
Im sure I think its a bbeautiful portrait and I dont see what people mean by talking so about it
Bertram shook his head
His eyes grew sombre again
Thank you dear
But I knowand you know reallythat it isnt a splendid portrait
Ive done lots better work than that
Then why dont they look at those and let this alone
wailed Billy with indignation
Because I deliberately put up this for them to see smiled the artist wearily
Billy sighed and twisted in her chair
What doesMr Winthrop say
she asked at last in a faint voice
Bertram lifted his head
Mr Winthrops been a trump all through dear
Hes already insisted on paying for this and hes ordered another
Another
Yes
The old fellow never minces his words as you may know
He came to me one day put his hand on my shoulder and said tersely Will you give me another same terms
Go in boy and win
Show em
I lost the first ten thousand I made
I didnt the next
Thats all he said
Before I could even choke out an answer he was gone
Gorry
talk about his having a heart of stone
I dont believe another man in the country would have done thatand done it in the way he didin the face of all this talk finished Bertram his eyes luminous with feeling
Billy hesitated
Perhapshis daughterinfluenced himsome
Perhaps nodded Bertram
She too has been very kind all the way through
Billy hesitated again
But I thoughtit was going so splendidly she faltered in a halfstifled voice
So it wasat the first
Then whatailed it at the last do you suppose
Billy was holding her breath till he should answer
The man got to his feet
Billy dontdont ask me he begged
Please dont lets talk of it any more
It cant do any good
I just flunkedthats all
My hand failed me
Maybe I tried too hard
Maybe I was tired
Maybe somethingtroubled me
Never mind dear what it was
It can do no good even to think of thatnow
So just lets drop it please dear he finished his face working with emotion
And Billy dropped itso far as words were concerned but she could not drop it from her thoughtsspecially after Kates letter came
Kates letter was addressed to Billy and it said after speaking of various other matters And now about poor Bertrams failure
Billy frowned
In Billys presence no one was allowed to say Bertrams failure but a letter has a most annoying privilege of saying what it pleases without let or hindrance unless one tears it upand a letter destroyed unread remains always such a tantalizing mystery of possibilities
So Billy let the letter talk
Of course we have heard of it away out here
I do wish if Bertram must paint such famous people he would manage to flatter them upin the painting I mean of courseenough so that it might pass for a success
The technical part of all this criticism I dont pretend to understand in the least but from what I hear and read he must indeed have made a terrible mess of it and of course Im very sorry and some surprised too for usually he paints such pretty pictures
Still on the other hand Billy Im not surprised
William says that Bertram has been completely out of fix over something and as gloomy as an owl for weeks past and of course under those circumstances the poor boy could not be expected to do good work
Now William being a man is not supposed to understand what the trouble is
But I being a woman can see through a pane of glass when its held right up before me and I can guess of course that a woman is at the bottom of itshe always isand that you being his special fancy at the moment Billy almost did tear the letter nowbut not quite are that woman
Now Billy you dont like such frank talk of course but on the other hand I know you do not want to ruin the dear boys career
So for heavens sake if you two have been having one of those quarrels that lovers so delight indo please for the good of the cause make up quick or else quarrel harder and break it off entirelywhich honestly would be the better way I think all around
There there my dear child dont bristle up
I am very fond of you and would dearly love to have you for a sisterif youd only take William as you should
But as you very well know I never did approve of this last match at all for either of your sakes
He cant make you happy my dear and you cant make him happy
Bertram never was and never will bea marrying man
Hes too temperamentaltoo thoroughly wrapped up in his Art
Girls have never meant anything to him but a beautiful picture to paint
And they never will
They cant
Hes made that way
Listen
I can prove it to you
Up to this winter hes always been a carefree happy jolly fellow and you know what beautiful work he has done
Never before has he tied himself to any one girl till last fall
Then you two entered into this absurd engagement
Now what has it been since
William wrote me himself not a fortnight ago that hed been worried to death over Bertram for weeks past hes been so moody so irritable so fretted over his work so unlike himself
And his picture has failed dismally
Of course William doesnt understand but I do
I know youve probably quarrelled or something
You know how flighty and unreliable you can be sometimes Billy and I dont say that to mean anything against you either thats your way
Youre just as temperamental in your art music as Bertram is in his
Youre utterly unsuited to him
If Bertram is to marry anybody it should be some quiet staid sensible girl who would be a help to him
But when I think of you two flyaway flutterbudgets marrying
Now for heavens sake Billy do make up or somethingand do it now
Dont for pitys sake let Bertram ever put out another such a piece of work to shame us all like this
Do you want to ruin his career
Faithfully yours KATE HARTWELL
P S I think Williams the one for you
Hes devoted to you and his quiet sensible affection is just what your temperament needs
I always thought William was the one for you
Think it over
P S No

You can see by the above that it isnt you Im objecting to my dear
Its just you andBertram
K CHAPTER XXX IVE HINDERED HIM Billy was shaking with anger and terror by the time she had finished reading Kates letter
Anger was uppermost at the moment and with one sweeping wrench of her trembling fingers she tore the closely written sheets straight through the middle and flung them into the little wicker basket by her desk
Then she went downstairs and played her noisiest merriest Tarantella and tried to see how fast she could make her fingers fly
But Billy could not of course play tarantellas all day and even while she did play them she could not forget that wastebasket upstairs and the horror it contained
The anger was still uppermost but the terror was prodding her at every turn and demanding to know just what it was that Kate had written in that letter anyway
It is not strange then perhaps that before two hours passed Billy went upstairs took the letter from the basket matched together the torn halfsheets and forced her shrinking eyes to read every word againjust to satisfy that terror which would not be silenced
At the end of the second reading Billy reminded herself with stern calmness that it was only Kate after all that nobody ought to mind what Kate said that certainly she Billy ought notafter the experience she had already had with her unpleasant interference
Kate did not know what she was talking about anyway
This was only another case of her trying to manage
She did so love to manageeverything
At this point Billy got out her pen and paper and wrote to Kate
It was a formal cold little letter not at all the sort that Billys friends usually received
It thanked Kate for her advice and for her kind willingness to have Billy for a sister but it hinted that perhaps Kate did not realize that as long as Billy was the one who would have to live with the chosen man it would be pleasanter to take the one Billy loved which happened in this case to be Bertramnot William
As for any quarrel being the cause of whatever fancied trouble there was with the new picture the letter scouted that idea in no uncertain terms
There had been no suggestion of a quarrel even once since the engagement
Then Billy signed her name and took the letter out to post immediately
For the first few minutes after the letter had been dropped into the green box at the corner Billy held her head high and told herself that the matter was now closed
She had sent Kate a courteous dignified conclusive effectual answer and she thought with much satisfaction of the things she had said
Very soon however she began to thinknot so much of what she had saidbut of what Kate had said
Many of Kates sentences were unpleasantly vivid in her mind
They seemed indeed to stand out in letters of flame and they began to burn and burn and burn
These were some of them William says that Bertram has been completely out of fix over something and as gloomy as an owl for weeks past
A woman is at the bottom of it


you are that woman
You cant make him happy
Bertram never wasand never will bea marrying man
Girls have never meant anything to him but a beautiful picture to paint
And they never will
Up to this winter hes always been a carefree happy jolly fellow and you know what beautiful work he has done
Never before has he tied himself to any one girl until last fall
Now what has it been since
Hes been so moody so irritable so fretted over his work so unlike himself and his picture has failed dismally
Do you want to ruin his career
Billy began to see now that she had not really answered Kates letter at all
The matter was not closed
Her reply had been perhaps courteous and dignifiedbut it had not been conclusive nor effectual
Billy had reached home now and she was crying
Bertram had acted strangely of late
Bertram had seemed troubled over something
His picture had With a little shudder Billy tossed aside these thoughts and dug at her teary eyes with a determined hand
Fiercely she told herself that the matter was settled
Very scornfully she declared that it was only Kate after all and that she would not let Kate make her unhappy again
Forthwith she picked up a current magazine and began to read
As it chanced however even here Billy found no peace for the first article she opened to was headed in huge black type MARRIAGE AND THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT
With a little cry Billy flung the magazine far from her and picked up another
But even The Elusiveness of Chopin which she found here could not keep her thoughts nor her eyes from wandering to the discarded thing in the corner lying ignominiously face down with crumpled outflung leaves
Billy knew that in the end she should go over and pick that magazine up and read that article from beginning to end
She was not surprised therefore when she did itbut she was not any the happier for having done it
The writer of the article did not approve of marriage and the artistic temperament
He said the artist belonged to his Art and to posterity through his Art
The essay fairly bristled with manylettered words and highsounding phrases few of which Billy really understood
She did understand enough however to feel guiltily when the thing was finished that already she had married Bertram and by so doing had committed a Crime
She had slain Art stifled Ambition destroyed Inspiration and been a nuisance generally
In consequence of which Bertram would henceforth and forevermore be doomed to Littleness
Naturally in this state of mind and with this vision before her Billy was anything but her bright easy self when she met Bertram an hour or two later
Naturally too Bertram still the tormented victim of the bugaboo his jealous fears had fashioned was just in the mood to place the worst possible construction on his sweethearts very evident unhappiness
With sighs unspoken questions and frequently averted eyes therefore the wretched evening passed a pitiful misery to them both
During the days that followed Billy thought that the world itself must be in league with Kate so often did she encounter Kates letter masquerading under some thin disguise
She did not stop to realize that because she was so afraid she would find it she did find it
In the books she read in the plays she saw in the chance words she heard spoken by friend or stranger always there was something to feed her fears in one way or another
Even in a yellowed newspaper that had covered the top shelf in her closet she found one day a symposium on whether or not an artists wife should be an artist and she shudderedbut she read every opinion given
Some writers said no and some yes and some said it all dependedon the artist and his wife
Billy found much food for thought some for amusement and a little that made for peace of mind
On the whole it opened up a new phase of the matter perhaps
At all events upon finishing it she almost sobbed One would think that just because I write a song now and then I was going to let Bertram starve and go with holes in his socks and no buttons on his clothes
It was that afternoon that Billy went to see Marie but even there she did not escape for the gentle Marie all unknowingly added her mite to the woeful whole
Billy found Marie in tears
Why Marie
she cried in dismay
Shh
warned Marie turning agonized eyes toward the closed door of Cyrils den
But dear what is it
begged Billy with no less dismay but with greater caution
Shh
admonished Marie again
On tiptoe then she led the way to a room at the other end of the tiny apartment
Once there she explained in a more natural tone of voice Cyrils at work on a new piece for the piano
Well what if he is
demanded Billy
That neednt make you cry need it
Oh nono indeed demurred Marie in a shocked voice
Well then what is it
Marie hesitated then with the abandon of a hurt child that longs for sympathy she sobbed Itits just that Im afraid after all that Im not good enough for Cyril
Billy stared frankly
Not good enough Marie Henshaw
Whatever in the world do you mean
Well not good for him then
Listen
Today I know in lots of ways I must have disappointed him
First he put on some socks that Id darned
They were the first since our marriage that Id found to darn and Id been so proud andand happy while I was darning them
Butbut he took em off right after breakfast and threw em in a corner
Then he put on a new pair and said that II neednt darn any more that it madebunches
Billy my darnsbunches Maries face and voice were tragic
Nonsense dear
Dont let that fret you comforted Billy promptly trying not to laugh too hard
It wasnt your darns it was just darnsanybodys darns
Cyril wont wear darned socks
Aunt Hannah told me so long ago and I said then thered be a tragedy when you found it out
So dont worry over that
Oh but that isnt all moaned Marie
Listen
You know how quiet he must have everything when hes composingand he ought to have it too
But I forgot this morning and put on some old shoes that didnt have any rubber heels and I ran the carpet sweeper and I rattled tins in the kitchen
But I never thought a thing until he opened his door and asked me please to change my shoes and let thethe confounded dirt go and didnt I have any dishes in the house but what were made of that abominable tin sstuff she finished in a wail of misery
Billy burst into a ringing laugh but Maries aghast face and upraised hand speedily reduced it to a convulsive giggle
You dear child
Cyrils always like that when hes composing soothed Billy
I supposed you knew it dear
Dont you fret
Run along and make him his favorite pudding and by night both of you will have forgotten there ever were such things in the world as tins and shoes and carpet sweepers that clatter
Marie shook her head
Her dismal face did not relax
You dont understand she moaned
Its myself
Ive hindered him
She brought out the word with an agony of slow horror
And only today I readhere look
she faltered going to the table and picking up with shaking hands a magazine
Billy recognized it by the cover at onceanother like it had been flung not so long ago by her own hand into the corner
She was not surprised therefore to see very soon at the end of Maries trembling finger Marriage and the Artistic Temperament
Billy did not give a ringing laugh this time
She gave an involuntary little shudder though she tried valiantly to turn it all off with a light word of scorn and a cheery pat on Maries heaving shoulders
But she went home very soon and it was plain to be seen that her visit to Marie had not brought her peace
Billy knew Kates letter by heart now both in the original and in its different versions and she knew that despite her struggles she was being forced straight toward Kates own verdict that she Billy was the cause in some way of the deplorable change in Bertrams appearance manner and work
Before she would quite surrender to this heartsickening belief however she determined to ask Bertram himself
Falteringly but resolutely therefore one day she questioned him
Bertram once you hinted that the picture did not go right because you were troubled over something and Ive been wonderingwas it about me in any way that you were troubled
Billy had her answer before the man spoke
She had it in the quick terror that sprang to his eyes and the dull red that swept from his neck to his forehead
His reply so far as words went did not count for it evaded everything and told nothing
But Billy knew without words
She knew too what she must do
For the time being she took Bertrams evasive answer as he so evidently wished it to be taken but that evening after he had gone she wrote him a little note and broke the engagement
So heartbroken was sheand so fearful was she that he should suspect thisthat her note when completed was a cold little thing of few words which carried no hint that its very coldness was but the heartbreak in the disguise of pride
This was like Billy in all ways
Billy had she lived in the days of the Christian martyrs would have been the first to walk with head erect into the Arena of Sacrifice
The arena now was just everyday living the lions were her own devouring misery and the cause was Bertrams best good
From Bertrams own self she had it nowthat she had been the cause of his being troubled so she could doubt no longer
The only part that was uncertain was the reason why he had been troubled
Whether his bond to her had become irksome because of his love for another or because of his love for no girlexcept to paint Billy did not know
But that it was irksome she did not doubt now
Besides as if she were going to slay his Art stifle his Ambition destroy his Inspiration and be a nuisance generally just so that she might be happy
Indeed no
Hence she broke the engagement
This was the letter DEAR BERTRAMYou wont make the move so I must
I knew from the way you spoke today that it was about me that you were troubled even though you generously tried to make me think it was not
And so the picture did not go well
Now dear we have not been happy together lately
You have seen it so have I I fear our engagement was a mistake so Im going to send back your ring tomorrow and Im writing this letter tonight
Please dont try to see me just yet
You know what I am doing is bestall round
Always your friend BILLY
CHAPTER XXXI FLIGHT Billy feared if she did not mail the letter at once she would not have the courage to mail it at all
So she slipped downstairs very quietly and went herself to the post box a little way down the street then she came back and sobbed herself to sleep though not until after she had sobbed awake for long hours of wretchedness
When she awoke in the morning heavyeyed and unrested there came to her first the vague horror of some shadow hanging over her then the sickening consciousness of what that shadow was
For one wild minute Billy felt that she must run to the telephone summon Bertram and beseech him to return unread the letter he would receive from her that day
Then there came to her the memory of Bertrams face as it had looked the night before when she had asked him if she were the cause of his being troubled
There came too the memory of Kates scathing Do you want to ruin his career
Even the hated magazine article and Maries tragic Ive hindered him
added their mite and Billy knew that she should not go to the telephone nor summon Bertram
The one fatal mistake now would be to let Bertram see her own distress
If once he should suspect how she suffered in doing this thing there would be a scene that Billy felt she had not the courage to face
She must therefore manage in some way not to see Bertramnot to let him see her until she felt more sure of her selfcontrol no matter what he said
The easiest way to do this was of course to go away
But where
How
She must think
Meanwhile for these first few hours she would not tell any one even Aunt Hannah what had happened
There must no one speak to her of it yet
That she could not endure
Aunt Hannah would of course shiver groan Oh my grief and conscience
and call for another shawl and Billy just now felt as if she should scream if she heard Aunt Hannah say Oh my grief and conscience
over that
Billy went down to breakfast therefore with a determination to act exactly as usual so that Aunt Hannah should not knowyet
When people try to act exactly as usual they generally end in acting quite the opposite and Billy was no exception to the rule
Hence her attempted cheerfulness became flippantness and her laughter giggles that rang too frequently to be quite sincerethough from Aunt Hannah it all elicited only an affectionate smile at the dear childs high spirits
A little later when Aunt Hannah was glancing over the morning papernow no longer barred from the doorshe gave a sudden cry
Billy just listen to this
she exclaimed reading from the paper in her hand
 A new tenor in The Girl of the Golden West
Appearance of Mr M J Arkwright at the Boston Opera House tonight
Owing to the sudden illness of Dubassi who was to have taken the part of Johnson tonight an exceptional opportunity has come to a young tenor singer one of the most promising pupils at the Conservatory school
Arkwright is said to have a fine voice a particularly good stage presence and a purity of tone and smoothness of execution that few of his age and experience can show
Only a short time ago he appeared as the duke at one of the popularpriced Saturday night performances of Rigoletto and his extraordinary success on that occasion coupled with his familiarity with and fitness for the part of Johnson in The Girl of the Golden West led to his being chosen to take Dubassis place tonight
His performance is awaited with the greatest of interest
Now isnt that splendid for Mary Jane
Im so glad
beamed Aunt Hannah
Of course were glad
cried Billy
And didnt it come just in time
This is the last week of opera anyway you know
But it says he sang beforeon a Saturday night declared Aunt Hannah going back to the paper in her hand
Now wouldnt you have thought wed have heard of it or read of it
And wouldnt you have thought hed have told us
Oh well maybe he didnt happen to see us so he could tell us returned Billy with elaborate carelessness
I know it but its so funny he hasnt seen us contended Aunt Hannah frowning
You know how much he used to be here
Billy colored and hurried into the fray
Oh but he must have been so busy with all this you know
And of course we didnt see it in the paperbecause we didnt have any paper at that time probably
Oh yes thats my fault I know she laughed and I was silly Ill own
But well make up for it now
Well go of course I wish it had been on our regular seasonticket night but I fancy we can get seats somewhere and Im going to ask Alice Greggory and her mother too
Ill go down there this morning to tell them and to get the tickets
Ive got it all planned
Billy had indeed got it all planned
She had been longing for something that would take her away from the houseand if possible away from herself
This would do the one easily and might help on the other
She rose at once
Ill go right away she said
But my dear frowned Aunt Hannah anxiously I dont believe I can go tonightthough Id love to dearly
But why not
Im tired and half sick with a headache this morning
I didnt sleep and Ive taken cold somewhere sighed the lady pulling the top shawl a little higher about her throat
Why you poor dear what a shame
Wont Bertram go
asked Aunt Hannah
Billy shook her headbut she did not meet Aunt Hannahs eyes
Oh no
I shant even ask him
He said last night he had a banquet on for tonightone of his art clubs I believe
Billys voice was casualness itself
But youll have the Greggorysthat is Mrs Greggory can go cant she
inquired Aunt Hannah
Oh yes Im sure she can nodded Billy
You know she went to the operetta and this is just the sameonly bigger
Yes yes I know murmured Aunt Hannah
Dear me
How can she get about so on those two wretched little sticks
Shes a perfect marvel to me
She is to me too sighed Billy as she hurried from the room
Billy was indeed in a hurry
To herself she said she wanted to get awayaway
And she got away as soon as she could
She had her plans all made
She would go first to the Greggorys and invite them to attend the opera with her that evening
Then she would get the tickets
Just what she would do with the rest of the day she did not know
She knew only that she would not go home until time to dress for dinner and the opera
She did not tell Aunt Hannah this however when she left the house
She planned to telephone it from somewhere down town later
She told herself that she could not stay all day under the sharp eyes of Aunt Hannah but she managed nevertheless to bid that lady a particularly blithe and brightfaced goodby
Billy had not been long gone when the telephone bell rang
Aunt Hannah answered it
Why Bertram is that you
she called in answer to the words that came to her across the wire
Why I hardly knew your voice
Didnt you
Well isis Billy there
No she isnt
Shes gone down to see Alice Greggory
Oh
So evident was the disappointment in the voice that Aunt Hannah added hastily Im so sorry
She hasnt been gone ten minutes
Butis there any message
No thank you
Theres nomessage
The voice hesitated then went on a little constrainedly
Howhow is Billy this morning
Sheshes all right isnt she
Aunt Hannah laughed in obvious amusement
Bless your dear heart yes my boy
Has it been such a long time since last eveningwhen you saw her yourself
Yes shes all right
In fact I was thinking at the breakfast table how pretty she looked with her pink cheeks and her bright eyes
She seemed to be in such high spirits
An inarticulate something that Aunt Hannah could not quite catch came across the line then a somewhat hurried All right
Thank you
Goodby
The next time Aunt Hannah was called to the telephone Billy spoke to her
Aunt Hannah dont wait luncheon for me please
I shall get it in town
And dont expect me till five oclock
I have some shopping to do
All right dear replied Aunt Hannah
Did you get the tickets
Yes and the Greggorys will go
Oh and Aunt Hannah
Yes dear
Please tell John to bring Peggy around early enough tonight so we can go down and get the Greggorys
I told them wed call for them
Very well dear
Ill tell him
Thank you
Hows the poor head
Better a little I think
Thats good
Wont you repent and go too
Nooh no indeed
All right then goodby
Im sorry
Som I Goodby sighed Aunt Hannah as she hung up the receiver and turned away
It was after five oclock when Billy got home and so hurried were the dressing and the dinner that Aunt Hannah forgot to mention Bertrams telephone call till just as Billy was ready to start for the Greggorys
There
and I forgot she confessed
Bertram called you up just after you left this morning my dear
Did he
Billys face was turned away but Aunt Hannah did not notice that
Yes
Oh he didnt want anything special smiled the lady onlywell he did ask if you were all right this morning she finished with quiet mischief
Did he
murmured Billy again
This time there was a little sound after the words which Aunt Hannah would have taken for a sob if she had not known that it must have been a laugh
Then Billy was gone
At eight oclock the doorbell rang and a minute later Rosa came up to say that Mr Bertram Henshaw was downstairs and wished to see Mrs Stetson
Mrs Stetson went down at once
Why my dear boy she exclaimed as she entered the room Billy said you had a banquet on for tonight
Yes I know butI didnt go
Bertrams face was pale and drawn
His voice did not sound natural
Why Bertram you look ill
Are you ill
The man made an impatient gesture
No no Im not illIm not ill at all
Rosa saysBillys not here
No shes gone to the opera with the Greggorys
The opera There was a grieved hurt in Bertrams voice that Aunt Hannah quite misunderstood
She hastened to give an apologetic explanation
Yes
She would have told youshe would have asked you to join them Im sure but she said you were going to a banquet
Im sure she said so
Yes I did tell her solast night nodded Bertram dully
Aunt Hannah frowned a little
Still more anxiously she endeavored to explain to this disappointed lover why his sweetheart was not at home to greet him
Well then of course my boy shed never think of your coming here tonight and when she found Mr Arkwright was going to sing Arkwright
There was no listlessness in Bertrams voice or manner now
Yes
Didnt you see it in the paper
Such a splendid chance for him
His picture was there too
No
I didnt see it
Then you dont know about it of course smiled Aunt Hannah
But hes to take the part of Johnson in The Girl of the Golden West
Isnt that splendid
Im so glad
And Billy was too
She hurried right off this morning to get the tickets and to ask the Greggorys
Oh
Bertram got to his feet a little abruptly and held out his hand
Well then I might as well say goodby then I suppose he suggested with a laugh that Aunt Hannah thought was a bit forced
Before she could remind him again though that Billy was really not to blame for not being there to welcome him he was gone
And Aunt Hannah could only go upstairs and meditate on the unreasonableness of lovers in general and of Bertram in particular
Aunt Hannah had gone to bed but she was still awake when Billy came home so she heard the automobile come to a stop before the door and she called to Billy when the girl came upstairs
Billy dear come in here
Im awake
I want to hear about it
Was it good
Billy stopped in the doorway
The light from the hall struck her face
There was no brightness in her eyes now no pink in her cheeks
Oh yes it was goodvery good she replied listlessly
Why Billy how queer you answer
What was the matter
Wasnt Mary Janeall right
Mary Jane
Ohoh yes he was very good Aunt Hannah
 Very good indeed
echoed the lady indignantly
He must have beenwhen you speak as if youd actually forgotten that he sang at all anyway
Billy had forgottenalmost
Billy had found that in spite of her getting away from the house she had not got away from herself once all day
She tried now however to summon her acting powers of the morning
But it was splendid really Aunt Hannah she cried with some show of animation
And they clapped and cheered and gave him any number of curtain calls
We were so proud of him
But you see I am tired she broke off wearily
You poor child of course you are and you look like a ghost
I wont keep you another minute
Run along to bed
OhBertram didnt go to that banquet after all
He came here she added as Billy turned to go
Bertram
The girl wheeled sharply
Yes
He wanted you of course
I found I didnt do at all chuckled Aunt Hannah
Did you suppose I would
There was no answer
Billy had gone
In the long night watches Billy fought it out with herself
Billy had always fought things out with herself
She must go away
She knew that
Already Bertram had telephoned and called
He evidently meant to see herand she could not see him
She dared not
If she didBilly knew now how pitifully little it would take to make her actually willing to slay Bertrams Art stifle his Ambition destroy his Inspiration and be a nuisance generallyif only she could have Bertram while she was doing it all
Sternly then she asked herself if she had no pride if she had forgotten that it was because of her that the Winthrop portrait had not been a successbecause of her either for the reason that he loved now Miss Winthrop or else that he loved no girlexcept to paint
Very early in the morning a whitefaced red eyed Billy appeared at Aunt Hannahs bedside
Billy
exclaimed Aunt Hannah plainly appalled
Billy sat down on the edge of the bed
Aunt Hannah she began in a monotonous voice as if she were reciting a lesson she had learned by heart please listen and please try not to be too surprised
You were saying the other day that you would like to visit your old home town
Well I think thats a very nice idea
If you dont mind well go today
Aunt Hannah pulled herself half erect in bed
Todaychild
Yes nodded Billy unsmilingly
We shall have to go somewhere today and I thought you would like that place best
ButBilly what does this mean
Billy sighed heavily
Yes I understand
Youll have to know the rest of course
Ive broken my engagement
I dont want to see Bertram
Thats why Im going away
Aunt Hannah fell nervelessly back on the pillow
Her teeth fairly chattered
Oh my grief and conscienceBilly Wont you please pull up that blanket she moaned
Billy what do you mean
Billy shook her head and got to her feet
I cant tell any more now really Aunt Hannah
Please dont ask me and donttalk
You willgo with me wont you
And Aunt Hannah with her terrified eyes on Billys piteously agitated face nodded her head and choked Why of course Ill goanywherewith you Billy butwhy did you do it why did you do it
A little later Billy in her own room wrote this note to Bertram DEAR BERTRAMIm going away today
Thatll be best all around
Youll agree to that Im sure
Please dont try to see me and please dont write
It wouldnt make either one of us any happier
You must know that
As ever your friend BILLY
Bertram when he read it grew only a shade more white a degree more sick at heart
Then he kissed the letter gently and put it away with the other
To Bertram the thing was very clear
Billy had come now to the conclusion that it would be wrong to give herself where she could not give her heart
And in this he agreed with herbitter as it was for him
Certainly he did not want Billy if Billy did not want him he told himself
He would now of course accede to her request
He would not write to herand make her suffer more
But to Bertram at that moment it seemed that the very sun in the heavens had gone out
CHAPTER XXXII PETE TO THE RESCUE One by one the weeks passed and became a month
Then other weeks became other months
It was July when Billy homesick and weary came back to Hillside with Aunt Hannah
Home looked wonderfully good to Billy in spite of the fact that she had so dreaded to see it
Billy had made up her mind however that come sometime she must
She could not of course stay always away
Perhaps too it would be just as easy at home as it was away
Certainly it could not be any harder
She was convinced of that
Besides she did not want Bertram to think Billy had received only meagre news from Boston since she went away
Bertram had not written at all
William had written twicehurt grieved puzzled questioning letters that were very hard to answer
From Marie too had come letters of much the same sort
By far the cheeriest epistles had come from Alice Greggory
They contained indeed about the only comfort Billy had known for weeks for they showed very plainly to Billy that Arkwrights heart had been caught on the rebound and that in Alice Greggory he was finding the sweetest sort of balm for his wounded feelings
From these letters Billy learned too that Judge Greggorys honor had been wholly vindicated and as Billy told Aunt Hannah anybody could put two and two together and make four now
It was eight oclock on a rainy July evening that Billy and Aunt Hannah arrived at Hillside and it was only a little past eight that Aunt Hannah was summoned to the telephone
When she came back to Billy she was crying and wringing her hands
Billy sprang to her feet
Why Aunt Hannah what is it
Whats the matter
she demanded
Aunt Hannah sank into a chair still wringing her hands
Oh Billy Billy how can I tell you how can I tell you
she moaned
You must tell me
Aunt Hannah what is it
Ohohoh
Billy I cantI cant
But youll have to
What is it Aunt Hannah
ItsBBertram
Bertram
Billys face grew ashen
Quick quickwhat do you mean
For answer Aunt Hannah covered her face with her hands and began to sob aloud
Billy almost beside herself now with terror and anxiety dropped on her knees and tried to pull away the shaking hands
Aunt Hannah you must tell me
You must you must
I cant Billy
Its Bertram
Heshurt choked Aunt Hannah hysterically
Hurt
How
I dont know
Pete told me
Pete
Yes
Rosa had told him we were coming and he called me up
He said maybe I could do something
So he told me
Yes yes
But told you what
That he was hurt
How
I couldnt hear all but I think twas an accidentautomobile
And Billy BillyPete says its his armhis right armand that maybe he cant ever ppaint again
Ohh
Billy fell back as if the words had been a blow
Not that Aunt Hannahnot that
Thats what Pete said
I couldnt get all of it but I got that
And Billy hes been out of his headthough he isnt now Pete saysand andand hes been calling for you
Forme A swift change came to Billys face
Yes
Over and over again he called for you while he was crazy you know
Thats why Pete told me
He said he didnt rightly understand what the trouble was but he didnt believe there was any trouble really between you two anyway that you wouldnt think there was if you could hear him and know how he wanted you andwhy Billy
Billy was on her feet now
Her fingers were on the electric pushbutton that would summon Rosa
Her face was illumined
The next moment Rosa appeared
Tell John to bring Peggy to the door at once please directed her mistress
Billy
gasped Aunt Hannah again as the maid disappeared
Billy was tremblingly putting on the hat she had but just taken off
Billy what are you going to do
Billy turned in obvious surprise
Why Im going to Bertram of course
To Bertram
But its nearly halfpast eight child and it rains and everything
But Bertram wants me
exclaimed Billy
As if Id mind rain or time or anything else now Butbutoh my grief and conscience
groaned Aunt Hannah beginning to wring her hands again
Billy reached for her coat
Aunt Hannah stirred into sudden action
But Billy if youd only wait till tomorrow she quavered putting out a feebly restraining hand
Tomorrow
The young voice rang with supreme scorn
Do you think Id wait till to morrowafter all this
I say Bertram wants me
Billy picked up her gloves
But you broke it off dearyou said you did and to go down there tonightlike this Billy lifted her head
Her eyes shone
Her whole face was a glory of love and pride
That was before
I didnt know
He wants me Aunt Hannah
Did you hear
He wants me
And now I wont evenhinder him if he cant ppaint again
Billys voice broke
The glory left her face
Her eyes brimmed with tears but her head was still bravely uplifted
Im going to Bertram
Blindly Aunt Hannah got to her feet
Still more blindly she reached for her bonnet and cloak on the chair near her
Oh will you go too
asked Billy abstractedly hurrying to the window to look for the motor car
Will I go too
burst out Aunt Hannahs indignant voice
Do you think Id let you go alone and at this time of night on such a wild goose chase as this
I dont know Im sure murmured Billy still abstractedly peering out into the rain
Dont know indeed
Oh my grief and conscience
groaned Aunt Hannah setting her bonnet hopelessly askew on top of her agitated head
But Billy did not even answer now
Her face was pressed hard against the windowpane
CHAPTER XXXIII BERTRAM TAKES THE REINS With stiffly pompous dignity Pete opened the door
The next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starryeyed flushedcheeked young woman who demanded Where is he Pete
Miss Billy
gasped the old man
Then he saw Aunt HannahAunt Hannah with her bonnet askew her neckbow awry one hand bare and the other half covered with a glove wrong side out
Aunt Hannahs cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way Pete had said Miss Billys name
It was one matter for her to object to this thing Billy was doingbut quite another for Pete to do it
Of course its she
retorted Aunt Hannah testily
As if you yourself didnt bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night
Pete where is he
interposed Billy
Tell Mr Bertram I am hereor wait
Ill go right in and surprise him
Billy This time it was Aunt Hannah who gasped her name
Pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward Aunt Hannah
His face was beaming and his old eyes were shining
Miss Billy Miss Billy youre an angel straight from heaven you areyou are
Oh Im so glad you came
Itll be all right nowall right
Hes in the den Miss Billy
Billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall Aunt Hannahs indignant voice arrested her
Billystop
Youre not an angel youre a young womanand a crazy one at that
Whatever angels do young women dont go unannounced and unchaperoned into young mens rooms
Pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us
Petes lips twitched
The emphatic we and us were not lost on him
But his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
Mr Bertram is up and dressed maam
Hes in the den
Ill speak to him
Pete once again the punctilious butler stalked to the door of Bertrams den and threw it wide open
Opposite the door on a low couch lay Bertram his head bandaged and his right arm in a sling
His face was turned toward the door but his eyes were closed
He looked very white and his features were pitifully drawn with suffering
Mr Bertram began Petebut he got no further
A flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch with a low cry
Bertrams eyes flew open
Across his face swept such a radiant look of unearthly joy that Pete sobbed audibly and fled to the kitchen
Dong Ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over Bertrams tray
In the hall above Aunt Hannah was crying into Williams gray linen duster that hung on the hallrackAunt Hannahs handkerchief was on the floor back at Hillside
In the den neither Billy nor Bertram knew or cared what had become of Aunt Hannah and Pete
There were just two people in their worldtwo people and unutterable incredible overwhelming rapture and peace
Then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained in it all
But dearest what does it meanyou here like this
asked Bertram then
As if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closerBertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
Billy on her knees by the couch snuggled into the curve of the one arm with a contented little sigh
Well you see just as soon as I found out to night that you wanted me I came she said
You darling
That was Bertram stopped suddenly
A puzzled frown showed below the fantastic bandage about his head
 As soon as  he quoted then scornfully
Were you ever by any possible chance thinking I didnt want you
Billys eyes widened a little
Why Bertram dear dont you see
When you were so troubled that the picture didnt go well and I found out it was about me you were troubledI Well
Bertrams voice was a little strained
Why ofof course stammered Billy I couldnt help thinking that maybe you had found out you didnt want me
Didnt want you groaned Bertram his tense muscles relaxing
May I ask why
Billy blushed
I wasnt quite sure why she faltered only of course I thought ofof Miss Winthrop you know or that maybe it was because you didnt care for any girl only to paintoh oh Bertram
Pete told us she broke off wildly beginning to sob
Pete told you that I didnt care for any girl only to paint
demanded Bertram angry and mystified
No no sobbed Billy not that
It was all the others that told me that
Pete told Aunt Hannah about the accident you know and he said he said Oh Bertram I cant say it
But thats one of the things that made me know I could come now you see because II wouldnt hinder you nor slay your Art nor any other of those dreadful things ifif you couldnt everppaint again finished Billy in an uncontrollable burst of grief
There there dear comforted Bertram patting the bronzegold head on his breast
I havent the faintest idea what youre talking about except the last but I know there cant be anything that ought to make you cry like that
As for my not painting againyou didnt understand Pete dearie
That was what they were afraid of at firstthat Id lose my arm but that danger is all past now
Im loads better
Of course Im going to paint againand better than ever beforenow Billy lifted her head
A look that was almost terror came to her eyes
She pulled herself half away from Bertrams encircling arm
Why Billy cried the man in pained surprise
You dont mean to say youre sorry Im going to paint again
No no
Oh no Bertramnever that
she faltered still regarding him with fearful eyes
Its onlyfor me you know
I cant go back now and not have youafter thiseven if I do hinder you and Hinder me What are you talking about Billy
Billy drew a quivering sigh
Well to begin with Kate said Good heavens
Is Kate in this too
Bertrams voice was savage now
Well she wrote a letter
Ill warrant she did
Great Scott Billy
Dont you know Kate by this time
Yyes I said so too
But Bertram what she wrote was true
I found it everywhere afterwards in magazines and papers and even in Marie
Humph
Well dearie I dont know yet what you found but I do know you wouldnt have found it at all if it hadnt been for Kateand I wish I had her here this minute
Billy giggled hysterically
I dontnot right here she cooed nestling comfortably against her lovers arm
But you see dear she never has approved of the marriage
Well whos doing the marryingshe or I
Thats what I said tooonly in another way sighed Billy
But she called us flyaway flutterbudgets and she said Id ruin your career if I did marry you
Well I can tell you right now Billy you will ruin it if you dont
declared Bertram
Thats what ailed me all the time I was painting that miserable portrait
I was so worriedfor fear Id lose you
Lose me
Why Bertram Henshaw what do you mean
A shamed red crept to the mans forehead
Well I suppose I might as well own up now as any time
I was scared blue Billy with jealousy ofArkwright
Billy laughed gaylybut she shifted her position and did not meet her lovers eyes
Arkwright
Nonsense
she cried
Why hes going to marry Alice Greggory
I know he is
I can see it as plain as day in her letters
Hes there a lot
And you never did think for a minute Billy that you cared for him
Bertrams gaze searched Billys face a little fearfully
He had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids
But Billy looked him now straight in the face it was a level frank gaze of absolute truth
Never dear she said firmly
Billy was so glad Bertram had turned the question on her love instead of Arkwrights
There has never really been any one but you
Thank God for that breathed Bertram as he drew the bright head nearer and held it close
After a minute Billy stirred and sighed happily
Arent lovers the beatem for imagining things
she murmured
They certainly are
You seeI wasnt in love with Mr
Arkwright
I seeI hope
 Andand you didnt care specially forfor Miss Winthrop
Eh
Well no
exploded Bertram
Do you mean to say you really Billy put a soft finger on his lips
Erpeople who live in glass houses you know she reminded him with roguish eyes
Bertram kissed the finger and subsided
Humph
he commented
There was a long silence then a little breathlessly Billy asked And you dontafter all love mejust to paint
Well what is that
Is that Kate too
demanded Bertram grimly
Billy laughed
Nooh she said it all right but you see everybody said that to me Bertram and thats what made me soso worried sometimes when you talked about the tilt of my chin and all that
Well by Jove
breathed Bertram
There was another silence
Then suddenly Bertram stirred
Billy Im going to marry you tomorrow he announced decisively
Billy lifted her head and sat back in palpitating dismay
Bertram
What an absurd idea
Well I am
I dont know as I can trust you out of my sight till then Youll read something or hear something or get a letter from Kate after breakfast tomorrow morning that will set you saving me again and I dont want to be saved that way
Im going to marry you tomorrow
Ill get He stopped short with a sudden frown
Confound that law
I forgot
Great Scott Billy Ill have to trust you five days after all
Theres a new law about the license
Weve got to wait five daysand maybe more counting in the notice and all
Billy laughed softly
Five days indeed sir
I wonder if you think I can get ready to be married in five days
Dont want you to get ready retorted Bertram promptly
I saw Marie get ready and I had all I wanted of it
If you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings well do it afterwardsnot before
But Besides I need you to take care of me cut in Bertram craftily
Bertram do youreally
The tender glow on Billys face told its own story and Bertrams eager eyes were not slow to read it
Sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
And forthwith he began to tell her how much he did indeed need her
Billy my dear
It was Aunt Hannahs plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
We must go home and William is here too and wants to see you
Billy rose at once as Aunt Hannah entered the room
Yes Aunt Hannah Ill come besides she glanced at Bertram mischievously I shall need all the time Ive got to prepare formy wedding
 Your wedding
You mean itll be before October
Aunt Hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly
Something in their smiling faces sent a quick suspicion to her eyes
Yes nodded Billy demurely
Its next Tuesday you see
Next Tuesday
But thats only a week away gasped Aunt Hannah
Yes a week
But child your trousseauthe wedding thethea week
Aunt Hannah could not articulate further
Yes I know that is a good while cut in Bertram airily
We wanted it tomorrow but we had to wait on account of the new license law
Otherwise it wouldnt have been so long and But Aunt Hannah was gone
With a low breathed Long
Oh my grief and conscience William she had fled through the hall door
Well it is long maintained Bertram with tender eyes as he reached out his hand to say goodnight
