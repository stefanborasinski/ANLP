BURNING DAYLIGHT by Jack London PART I CHAPTER I It was a quiet night in the Shovel
At the bar which ranged along one side of the large chinkedlog room leaned half a dozen men two of whom were discussing the relative merits of sprucetea and limejuice as remedies for scurvy
They argued with an air of depression and with intervals of morose silence
The other men scarcely heeded them
In a row against the opposite wall were the gambling games
The craptable was deserted
One lone man was playing at the farotable
The rouletteball was not even spinning and the gamekeeper stood by the roaring redhot stove talking with the young darkeyed woman comely of face and figure who was known from Juneau to Fort Yukon as the Virgin
Three men sat in at studpoker but they played with small chips and without enthusiasm while there were no onlookers
On the floor of the dancingroom which opened out at the rear three couples were waltzing drearily to the strains of a violin and a piano
Circle City was not deserted nor was money tight
The miners were in from Moseyed Creek and the other diggings to the west the summer washing had been good and the mens pouches were heavy with dust and nuggets
The Klondike had not yet been discovered nor had the miners of the Yukon learned the possibilities of deep digging and woodfiring
No work was done in the winter and they made a practice of hibernating in the large camps like Circle City during the long Arctic night
Time was heavy on their hands their pouches were well filled and the only social diversion to be found was in the saloons
Yet the Shovel was practically deserted and the Virgin standing by the stove yawned with uncovered mouth and said to Charley Bates If something dont happen soon Im gin to bed
Whats the matter with the camp anyway
Everybody dead
Bates did not even trouble to reply but went on moodily rolling a cigarette
Dan MacDonald pioneer saloonman and gambler on the upper Yukon owner and proprietor of the Tivoli and all its games wandered forlornly across the great vacant space of floor and joined the two at the stove
Anybody dead
the Virgin asked him
Looks like it was the answer
Then it must be the whole camp she said with an air of finality and with another yawn
MacDonald grinned and nodded and opened his mouth to speak when the front door swung wide and a man appeared in the light
A rush of frost turned to vapor by the heat of the room swirled about him to his knees and poured on across the floor growing thinner and thinner and perishing a dozen feet from the stove
Taking the wisp broom from its nail inside the door the newcomer brushed the snow from his moccasins and high German socks
He would have appeared a large man had not a huge FrenchCanadian stepped up to him from the bar and gripped his hand
Hello Daylight
was his greeting
By Gar you good for sore eyes
Hello Louis when did youall blow in
returned the newcomer
Come up and have a drink and tell us all about Bone Creek
Why doggone youall shake again
Wheres that pardner of yours
Im looking for him
Another huge man detached himself from the bar to shake hands
Olaf Henderson and French Louis partners together on Bone Creek were the two largest men in the country and though they were but half a head taller than the newcomer between them he was dwarfed completely
Hello Olaf youre my meat savvee that said the one called Daylight
Tomorrows my birthday and Im going to put youall on your backsavvee
And you too Louis
I can put youall on your back on my birthdaysavvee
Come up and drink Olaf and Ill tell youall about it
The arrival of the newcomer seemed to send a flood of warmth through the place
Its Burning Daylight the Virgin cried the first to recognize him as he came into the light
Charley Bates tight features relaxed at the sight and MacDonald went over and joined the three at the bar
With the advent of Burning Daylight the whole place became suddenly brighter and cheerier
The barkeepers were active
Voices were raised
Somebody laughed
And when the fiddler peering into the front room remarked to the pianist Its Burning Daylight the waltztime perceptibly quickened and the dancers catching the contagion began to whirl about as if they really enjoyed it
It was known to them of old time that nothing languished when Burning Daylight was around
He turned from the bar and saw the woman by the stove and the eager look of welcome she extended him
Hello Virgin old girl he called
Hello Charley
Whats the matter with youall
Why wear faces like that when coffins cost only three ounces
Come up youall and drink
Come up you unburied dead and name your poison
Come up everybody
This is my night and Im going to ride it
Tomorrow Im thirty and then Ill be an old man
Its the last fling of youth
Are youall with me
Surge along then
Surge along
Hold on there Davis he called to the farodealer who had shoved his chair back from the table
Im going you one flutter to see whether youall drink with me or weall drink with you
Pulling a heavy sack of golddust from his coat pocket he dropped it on the HIGH CARD
Fifty he said
The farodealer slipped two cards
The high card won
He scribbled the amount on a pad and the weigher at the bar balanced fifty dollars worth of dust in the goldscales and poured it into Burning Daylights sack
The waltz in the back room being finished the three couples followed by the fiddler and the pianist and heading for the bar caught Daylights eye
Surge along youall he cried
Surge along and name it
This is my night and it aint a night that comes frequent
Surge up you Siwashes and Salmoneaters
Its my night I tell youall A blame mangy night Charley Bates interpolated
Youre right my son Burning Daylight went on gaily
A mangy night but its MY night you see
Im the mangy old hewolf
Listen to me howl
And howl he did like a lone gray timber wolf till the Virgin thrust her pretty fingers in her ears and shivered
A minute later she was whirled away in his arms to the dancingfloor where along with the other three women and their partners a rollicking Virginia reel was soon in progress
Men and women danced in moccasins and the place was soon aroar Burning Daylight the centre of it and the animating spark with quip and jest and rough merriment rousing them out of the slough of despond in which he had found them
The atmosphere of the place changed with his coming
He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality
Men who entered from the street felt it immediately and in response to their queries the barkeepers nodded at the back room and said comprehensively Burning Daylights on the tear
And the men who entered remained and kept the barkeepers busy
The gamblers took heart of life and soon the tables were filled the click of chips and whir of the rouletteball rising monotonously and imperiously above the hoarse rumble of mens voices and their oaths and heavy laughs
Few men knew Elam Harnish by any other name than Burning Daylight the name which had been given him in the early days in the land because of his habit of routing his comrades out of their blankets with the complaint that daylight was burning
Of the pioneers in that far Arctic wilderness where all men were pioneers he was reckoned among the oldest
Men like Al Mayo and Jack McQuestion antedated him but they had entered the land by crossing the Rockies from the Hudson Bay country to the east
He however had been the pioneer over the Chilcoot and Chilcat passes
In the spring of 1883 twelve years before a stripling of eighteen he had crossed over the Chilcoot with five comrades
In the fall he had crossed back with one
Four had perished by mischance in the bleak uncharted vastness
And for twelve years Elam Harnish had continued to grope for gold among the shadows of the Circle
And no man had groped so obstinately nor so enduringly
He had grown up with the land
He knew no other land
Civilization was a dream of some previous life
Camps like Forty Mile and Circle City were to him metropolises
And not alone had he grown up with the land for raw as it was he had helped to make it
He had made history and geography and those that followed wrote of his traverses and charted the trails his feet had broken
Heroes are seldom given to heroworship but among those of that young land young as he was he was accounted an elder hero
In point of time he was before them
In point of deed he was beyond them
In point of endurance it was acknowledged that he could kill the hardiest of them
Furthermore he was accounted a nervy man a square man and a white man
In all lands where life is a hazard lightly played with and lightly flung aside men turn almost automatically to gambling for diversion and relaxation
In the Yukon men gambled their lives for gold and those that won gold from the ground gambled for it with one another
Nor was Elam Harnish an exception
He was a mans man primarily and the instinct in him to play the game of life was strong
Environment had determined what form that game should take
He was born on an Iowa farm and his father had emigrated to eastern Oregon in which mining country Elams boyhood was lived
He had known nothing but hard knocks for big stakes
Pluck and endurance counted in the game but the great god Chance dealt the cards
Honest work for sure but meagre returns did not count
A man played big
He risked everything for everything and anything less than everything meant that he was a loser
So for twelve Yukon years Elam Harnish had been a loser
True on Moosehide Creek the past summer he had taken out twenty thousand dollars and what was left in the ground was twenty thousand more
But as he himself proclaimed that was no more than getting his ante back
He had anted his life for a dozen years and forty thousand was a small pot for such a stakethe price of a drink and a dance at the Tivoli of a winters flutter at Circle City and a grubstake for the year to come
The men of the Yukon reversed the old maxim till it read hard come easy go
At the end of the reel Elam Harnish called the house up to drink again
Drinks were a dollar apiece gold rated at sixteen dollars an ounce there were thirty in the house that accepted his invitation and between every dance the house was Elams guest
This was his night and nobody was to be allowed to pay for anything
Not that Elam Harnish was a drinking man
Whiskey meant little to him
He was too vital and robust too untroubled in mind and body to incline to the slavery of alcohol
He spent months at a time on trail and river when he drank nothing stronger than coffee while he had gone a year at a time without even coffee
But he was gregarious and since the sole social expression of the Yukon was the saloon he expressed himself that way
When he was a lad in the mining camps of the West men had always done that
To him it was the proper way for a man to express himself socially
He knew no other way
He was a striking figure of a man despite his garb being similar to that of all the men in the Tivoli
Softtanned moccasins of moosehide beaded in Indian designs covered his feet
His trousers were ordinary overalls his coat was made from a blanket
Longgauntleted leather mittens lined with wool hung by his side
They were connected in the Yukon fashion by a leather thong passed around the neck and across the shoulders
On his head was a fur cap the earflaps raised and the tyingcords dangling
His face lean and slightly long with the suggestion of hollows under the cheekbones seemed almost Indian
The burnt skin and keen dark eyes contributed to this effect though the bronze of the skin and the eyes themselves were essentially those of a white man
He looked older than thirty and yet smoothshaven and without wrinkles he was almost boyish
This impression of age was based on no tangible evidence
It came from the abstracter facts of the man from what he had endured and survived which was far beyond that of ordinary men
He had lived life naked and tensely and something of all this smouldered in his eyes vibrated in his voice and seemed forever awhisper on his lips
The lips themselves were thin and prone to close tightly over the even white teeth
But their harshness was retrieved by the upward curl at the corners of his mouth
This curl gave to him sweetness as the minute puckers at the corners of the eyes gave him laughter
These necessary graces saved him from a nature that was essentially savage and that otherwise would have been cruel and bitter
The nose was lean fullnostrilled and delicate and of a size to fit the face while the high forehead as if to atone for its narrowness was splendidly domed and symmetrical
In line with the Indian effect was his hair very straight and very black with a gloss to it that only health could give
Burning Daylights burning candlelight laughed Dan MacDonald as an outburst of exclamations and merriment came from the dancers
An he is der boy to do it eh Louis
said Olaf Henderson
Yes by Gar
you bet on dat said French Louis
Dat boy is all gold And when God Almighty washes Daylights soul out on the last big slucin day MacDonald interrupted why God Almightyll have to shovel gravel along with him into the sluiceboxes
Dot iss goot Olaf Henderson muttered regarding the gambler with profound admiration
Ver good affirmed French Louis
I tink we take a drink on dat one time eh
CHAPTER II It was two in the morning when the dancers bent on getting something to eat adjourned the dancing for half an hour
And it was at this moment that Jack Kearns suggested poker
Jack Kearns was a big blufffeatured man who along with Bettles had made the disastrous attempt to found a post on the headreaches of the Koyokuk far inside the Arctic Circle
After that Kearns had fallen back on his posts at Forty Mile and Sixty Mile and changed the direction of his ventures by sending out to the States for a small sawmill and a river steamer
The former was even then being sledded across Chilcoot Pass by Indians and dogs and would come down the Yukon in the early summer after the icerun
Later in the summer when Bering Sea and the mouth of the Yukon cleared of ice the steamer put together at St Michaels was to be expected up the river loaded to the guards with supplies
Jack Kearns suggested poker
French Louis Dan MacDonald and Hal Campbell who had make a strike on Moosehide all three of whom were not dancing because there were not girls enough to go around inclined to the suggestion
They were looking for a fifth man when Burning Daylight emerged from the rear room the Virgin on his arm the train of dancers in his wake
In response to the hail of the pokerplayers he came over to their table in the corner
Want you to sit in said Campbell
Hows your luck
I sure got it tonight Burning Daylight answered with enthusiasm and at the same time felt the Virgin press his arm warningly
She wanted him for the dancing
I sure got my luck with me but Id sooner dance
I aint hankerin to take the money away from youall
Nobody urged
They took his refusal as final and the Virgin was pressing his arm to turn him away in pursuit of the supperseekers when he experienced a change of heart
It was not that he did not want to dance nor that he wanted to hurt her but that insistent pressure on his arm put his free mannature in revolt
The thought in his mind was that he did not want any woman running him
Himself a favorite with women nevertheless they did not bulk big with him
They were toys playthings part of the relaxation from the bigger game of life
He met women along with the whiskey and gambling and from observation he had found that it was far easier to break away from the drink and the cards than from a woman once the man was properly entangled
He was a slave to himself which was natural in one with a healthy ego but he rebelled in ways either murderous or panicky at being a slave to anybody else
Loves sweet servitude was a thing of which he had no comprehension
Men he had seen in love impressed him as lunatics and lunacy was a thing he had never considered worth analyzing
But comradeship with men was different from love with women
There was no servitude in comradeship
It was a business proposition a square deal between men who did not pursue each other but who shared the risks of trail and river and mountain in the pursuit of life and treasure
Men and women pursued each other and one must needs bend the other to his will or hers
Comradeship was different
There was no slavery about it and though he a strong man beyond strengths seeming gave far more than he received he gave not something due but in royal largess his gifts of toil or heroic effort falling generously from his hands
To pack for days over the galeswept passes or across the mosquitoridden marshes and to pack double the weight his comrade packed did not involve unfairness or compulsion
Each did his best
That was the business essence of it
Some men were stronger than otherstrue but so long as each man did his best it was fair exchange the business spirit was observed and the square deal obtained
But with womenno
Women gave little and wanted all
Women had apronstrings and were prone to tie them about any man who looked twice in their direction
There was the Virgin yawning her head off when he came in and mightily pleased that he asked her to dance
One dance was all very well but because he danced twice and thrice with her and several times more she squeezed his arm when they asked him to sit in at poker
It was the obnoxious apronstring the first of the many compulsions she would exert upon him if he gave in
Not that she was not a nice bit of a woman healthy and strapping and good to look upon also a very excellent dancer but that she was a woman with all a womans desire to rope him with her apronstrings and tie him hand and foot for the branding
Better poker
Besides he liked poker as well as he did dancing
He resisted the pull on his arm by the mere negative mass of him and said I sort of feel a hankering to give youall a flutter
Again came the pull on his arm
She was trying to pass the apronstring around him
For the fraction of an instant he was a savage dominated by the wave of fear and murder that rose up in him
For that infinitesimal space of time he was to all purposes a frightened tiger filled with rage and terror at the apprehension of the trap
Had he been no more than a savage he would have leapt wildly from the place or else sprung upon her and destroyed her
But in that same instant there stirred in him the generations of discipline by which man had become an inadequate social animal
Tact and sympathy strove with him and he smiled with his eyes into the Virgins eyes as he said Youall go and get some grub
I aint hungry
And well dance some more by and by
The nights young yet
Go to it old girl
He released his arm and thrust her playfully on the shoulder at the same time turning to the pokerplayers
Take off the limit and Ill go youall
Limits the roof said Jack Kearns
Take off the roof
The players glanced at one another and Kearns announced The roofs off
Elam Harnish dropped into the waiting chair started to pull out his goldsack and changed his mind
The Virgin pouted a moment then followed in the wake of the other dancers
Ill bring you a sandwich Daylight she called back over her shoulder
He nodded
She was smiling her forgiveness
He had escaped the apronstring and without hurting her feelings too severely
Lets play markers he suggested
Chips do everlastingly clutter up the tableIf its agreeable to youall
Im willing answered Hal Campbell
Let mine run at five hundred
Mine too answered Harnish while the others stated the values they put on their own markers French Louis the most modest issuing his at a hundred dollars each
In Alaska at that time there were no rascals and no tinhorn gamblers
Games were conducted honestly and men trusted one another
A mans word was as good as his gold in the blower
A marker was a flat oblong composition chip worth perhaps a cent
But when a man betted a marker in a game and said it was worth five hundred dollars it was accepted as worth five hundred dollars
Whoever won it knew that the man who issued it would redeem it with five hundred dollars worth of dust weighed out on the scales
The markers being of different colors there was no difficulty in identifying the owners
Also in that early Yukon day no one dreamed of playing tablestakes
A man was good in a game for all that he possessed no matter where his possessions were or what was their nature
Harnish cut and got the deal
At this good augury and while shuffling the deck he called to the barkeepers to set up the drinks for the house
As he dealt the first card to Dan MacDonald on his left he called out Get down to the ground youall Malemutes huskies and Siwash purps
Get down and dig in
Tighten up them traces
Put your weight into the harness and bust the breastbands
Whoopla
Yow
Were off and bound for Helen Breakfast
And I tell youall clear and plain theres goin to be stiff grades and fast goin tonight before we win to that same lady
And somebodys goin to bumphard
Once started it was a quiet game with little or no conversation though all about the players the place was aroar
Elam Harnish had ignited the spark
More and more miners dropped in to the Tivoli and remained
When Burning Daylight went on the tear no man cared to miss it
The dancingfloor was full
Owing to the shortage of women many of the men tied bandanna handkerchiefs around their arms in token of femininity and danced with other men
All the games were crowded and the voices of the men talking at the long bar and grouped about the stove were accompanied by the steady click of chips and the sharp whir rising and falling of the rouletteball
All the materials of a proper Yukon night were at hand and mixing
The luck at the table varied monotonously no big hands being out
As a result high play went on with small hands though no play lasted long
A filled straight belonging to French Louis gave him a pot of five thousand against two sets of threes held by Campbell and Kearns
One pot of eight hundred dollars was won by a pair of trays on a showdown
And once Harnish called Kearns for two thousand dollars on a cold steal
When Kearns laid down his hand it showed a bobtail flush while Harnishs hand proved that he had had the nerve to call on a pair of tens
But at three in the morning the big combination of hands arrived
It was the moment of moments that men wait weeks for in a poker game
The news of it tingled over the Tivoli
The onlookers became quiet
The men farther away ceased talking and moved over to the table
The players deserted the other games and the dancingfloor was forsaken so that all stood at last fivescore and more in a compact and silent group around the pokertable
The high betting had begun before the draw and still the high betting went on with the draw not in sight
Kearns had dealt and French Louis had opened the pot with one markerin his case one hundred dollars
Campbell had merely seen it but Elam Harnish corning next had tossed in five hundred dollars with the remark to MacDonald that he was letting him in easy
MacDonald glancing again at his hand put in a thousand in markers
Kearns debating a long time over his hand finally saw
It then cost French Louis nine hundred to remain in the game which he contributed after a similar debate
It cost Campbell likewise nine hundred to remain and draw cards but to the surprise of all he saw the nine hundred and raised another thousand
Youall are on the grade at last Harnish remarked as he saw the fifteen hundred and raised a thousand in turn
Helen Breakfasts sure on top this divide and youall had best look out for bustin harness
Me for that same lady accompanied MacDonalds markers for two thousand and for an additional thousanddollar raise
It was at this stage that the players sat up and knew beyond peradventure that big hands were out
Though their features showed nothing each man was beginning unconsciously to tense
Each man strove to appear his natural self and each natural self was different
Hal Campbell affected his customary cautiousness
French Louis betrayed interest
MacDonald retained his wholesouled benevolence though it seemed to take on a slightly exaggerated tone
Kearns was coolly dispassionate and noncommittal while Elam Harnish appeared as quizzical and jocular as ever
Eleven thousand dollars were already in the pot and the markers were heaped in a confused pile in the centre of the table
I aint go no more markers Kearns remarked plaintively
Wed best begin IOUs
Glad youre going to stay was MacDonalds cordial response
I aint stayed yet
Ive got a thousand in already
Hows it stand now
Itll cost you three thousand for a look in but nobody will stop you from raising
Raisehell
You must think I got a pat like yourself
Kearns looked at his hand
But Ill tell you what Ill do Mac
Ive got a hunch and Ill just see that three thousand
He wrote the sum on a slip of paper signed his name and consigned it to the centre of the table
French Louis became the focus of all eyes
He fingered his cards nervously for a space
Then with a By Gar
Ah got not one leetle beet hunch he regretfully tossed his hand into the discards
The next moment the hundred and odd pairs of eyes shifted to Campbell
I wont hump you Jack he said contenting himself with calling the requisite two thousand
The eyes shifted to Harnish who scribbled on a piece of paper and shoved it forward
Ill just let youall know this aint no Sundayschool society of philanthropy he said
I see you Jack and I raise you a thousand
Heres where youall get action on your pat Mac
Actions what I fatten on and I lift another thousand was MacDonalds rejoinder
Still got that hunch Jack
I still got the hunch
Kearns fingered his cards a long time
And Ill play it but youve got to know how I stand
Theres my steamer the Bellaworth twenty thousand if shes worth an ounce
Theres Sixty Mile with five thousand in stock on the shelves
And you know I got a sawmill coming in
Its at Linderman now and the scow is building
Am I good
Dig in youre sure good was Daylights answer
And while were about it I may mention casual that I got twenty thousand in Macs safe there and theres twenty thousand more in the ground on Moosehide
You know the ground Campbell
Is they thatall in the dirt
There sure is Daylight
How much does it cost now
Kearns asked
Two thousand to see
Well sure hump you if youall come in Daylight warned him
Its an almighty good hunch Kearns said adding his slip for two thousand to the growing heap
I can feel her crawlin up and down my back
I aint got a hunch but I got a tolerable likeable hand Campbell announced as he slid in his slip but its not a raising hand
Mine is Daylight paused and wrote
I see that thousand and raise her the same old thousand
The Virgin standing behind him then did what a mans best friend was not privileged to do
Reaching over Daylights shoulder she picked up his hand and read it at the same time shielding the faces of the five cards close to his chest
What she saw were three queens and a pair of eights but nobody guessed what she saw
Every players eyes were on her face as she scanned the cards but no sign did she give
Her features might have been carved from ice for her expression was precisely the same before during and after
Not a muscle quivered nor was there the slightest dilation of a nostril nor the slightest increase of light in the eyes
She laid the hand face down again on the table and slowly the lingering eyes withdrew from her having learned nothing
MacDonald smiled benevolently
I see you Daylight and I hump this time for two thousand
Hows that hunch Jack
Still acrawling Mac
You got me now but that hunch is a ripsnorter persuadin sort of a critter and its my plain duty to ride it
I call for three thousand
And I got another hunch Daylights going to call too
He sure is Daylight agreed after Campbell had thrown up his hand
He knows when hes up against it and he plays accordin
I see that two thousand and then Ill see the draw
In a dead silence save for the low voices of the three players the draw was made
Thirtyfour thousand dollars were already in the pot and the play possibly not half over
To the Virgins amazement Daylight held up his three queens discarding his eights and calling for two cards
And this time not even she dared look at what he had drawn
She knew her limit of control
Nor did he look
The two new cards lay face down on the table where they had been dealt to him
Cards
Kearns asked of MacDonald
Got enough was the reply
You can draw if you want to you know Kearns warned him
Nope thisll do me
Kearns himself drew two cards but did not look at them
Still Harnish let his cards lie
I never bet in the teeth of a pat hand he said slowly looking at the saloonkeeper
Youall start her rolling Mac
MacDonald counted his cards carefully to make doubles sure it was not a foul hand wrote a sum on a paper slip and slid it into the pot with the simple utterance Five thousand
Kearns with every eye upon him looked at his twocard draw counted the other three to dispel any doubt of holding more than five cards and wrote on a betting slip
I see you Mac he said and I raise her a little thousand just so as not to keep Daylight out
The concentrated gaze shifted to Daylight
He likewise examined his draw and counted his five cards
I see that six thousand and I raise her five thousandjust to try and keep you out Jack
And I raise you five thousand just to lend a hand at keeping Jack out MacDonald said in turn
His voice was slightly husky and strained and a nervous twitch in the corner of his mouth followed speech
Kearns was pale and those who looked on noted that his hand trembled as he wrote his slip
But his voice was unchanged
I lift her along for five thousand he said
Daylight was now the centre
The kerosene lamps above flung high lights from the rash of sweat on his forehead
The bronze of his cheeks was darkened by the accession of blood
His black eyes glittered and his nostrils were distended and eager
They were large nostrils tokening his descent from savage ancestors who had survived by virtue of deep lungs and generous airpassages
Yet unlike MacDonald his voice was firm and customary and unlike Kearns his hand did not tremble when he wrote
I call for ten thousand he said
Not that Im afraid of youall Mac
Its that hunch of Jacks
I hump his hunch for five thousand just the same said MacDonald
I had the best hand before the draw and I still guess I got it
Mebbe this is a case where a hunch after the draw is bettern the hunch before Kearns remarked wherefore duty says Lift her Jack lift her and so I lift her another five thousand
Daylight leaned back in his chair and gazed up at the kerosene lamps while he computed aloud
I was in nine thousand before the draw and I saw and raised eleven thousandthat makes thirty
Im only good for ten more
He leaned forward and looked at Kearns
So I call that ten thousand
You can raise if you want Kearns answered
Your dogs are good for five thousand in this game
Nary dawg
Youall can win my dust and dirt but nary one of my dawgs
I just call
MacDonald considered for a long time
No one moved or whispered
Not a muscle was relaxed on the part of the onlookers
Not the weight of a body shifted from one leg to the other
It was a sacred silence
Only could be heard the roaring draft of the huge stove and from without muffled by the logwalls the howling of dogs
It was not every night that high stakes were played on the Yukon and for that matter this was the highest in the history of the country
The saloonkeeper finally spoke
If anybody else wins theyll have to take a mortgage on the Tivoli
The two other players nodded
So I call too
MacDonald added his slip for five thousand
Not one of them claimed the pot and not one of them called the size of his hand
Simultaneously and in silence they faced their cards on the table while a general tiptoeing and craning of necks took place among the onlookers
Daylight showed four queens and an ace MacDonald four jacks and an ace and Kearns four kings and a trey
Kearns reached forward with an encircling movement of his arm and drew the pot in to him his arm shaking as he did so
Daylight picked the ace from his hand and tossed it over alongside MacDonalds ace saying Thats what cheered me along Mac
I knowed it was only kings that could beat me and he had them
What did youall have
he asked all interest turning to Campbell
Straight flush of four open at both endsa good drawing hand
You bet
You could a made a straight a straight flush or a flush out of it
Thats what I thought Campbell said sadly
It cost me six thousand before I quit
I wisht youalld drawn Daylight laughed
Then I wouldnt a caught that fourth queen
Now Ive got to take Billy Rawlins mail contract and mush for Dyea
Whats the size of the killing Jack
Kearns attempted to count the pot but was too excited
Daylight drew it across to him with firm fingers separating and stacking the markers and IOU
s and with clear brain adding the sum
One hundred and twentyseven thousand he announced
Youall can sell out now Jack and head for home
The winner smiled and nodded but seemed incapable of speech
Id shout the drinks MacDonald said only the house dont belong to me any more
Yes it does Kearns replied first wetting his lips with his tongue
Your notes good for any length of time
But the drinks are on me
Name your snakejuice youallthe winner pays
Daylight called out loudly to all about him at the same time rising from his chair and catching the Virgin by the arm
Come on for a reel youall dancers
The nights young yet and its Helen Breakfast and the mail contract for me in the morning
Here youall Rawlins youI hereby do take over that same contract and I start for salt water at nine AMsavvee
Come on youall
Wheres that fiddler
CHAPTER III It was Daylights night
He was the centre and the head of the revel unquenchably joyous a contagion of fun
He multiplied himself and in so doing multiplied the excitement
No prank he suggested was too wild for his followers and all followed save those that developed into singing imbeciles and fell warbling by the wayside
Yet never did trouble intrude
It was known on the Yukon that when Burning Daylight made a night of it wrath and evil were forbidden
On his nights men dared not quarrel
In the younger days such things had happened and then men had known what real wrath was and been manhandled as only Burning Daylight could manhandle
On his nights men must laugh and be happy or go home
Daylight was inexhaustible
In between dances he paid over to Kearns the twenty thousand in dust and transferred to him his Moosehide claim
Likewise he arranged the taking over of Billy Rawlins mail contract and made his preparations for the start
He despatched a messenger to rout out Kama his dogdrivera Tananaw Indian farwandered from his tribal home in the service of the invading whites
Kama entered the Tivoli tall lean muscular and furclad the pick of his barbaric race and barbaric still unshaken and unabashed by the revellers that rioted about him while Daylight gave his orders
Um said Kama tabling his instructions on his fingers
Get um letters from Rawlins
Load um on sled
Grub for Selkirkyou think um plenty doggrub stop Selkirk
Plenty doggrub Kama
Um bring sled this place nine um clock
Bring um snowshoes
No bring um tent
Mebbe bring um fly
um little fly
No fly Daylight answered decisively
Um much cold
We travel lightsavvee
We carry plenty letters out plenty letters back
You are strong man
Plenty cold plenty travel all right
Sure all right Kama muttered with resignation
Much cold no care a damn
Um ready nine um clock
He turned on his moccasined heel and walked out imperturbable sphinxlike neither giving nor receiving greetings nor looking to right or left
The Virgin led Daylight away into a corner
Look here Daylight she said in a low voice youre busted
Highern a kite
Ive eight thousand in Macs safe she began
But Daylight interrupted
The apronstring loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt
It dont matter he said
Busted I came into the world busted I go out and Ive been busted most of the time since I arrived
Come on lets waltz
But listen she urged
My moneys doing nothing
I could lend it to youa grubstake she added hurriedly at sight of the alarm in his face
Nobody grubstakes me was the answer
I stake myself and when I make a killing its sure all mine
No thank you old girl
Much obliged
Ill get my stake by running the mail out and in
Daylight she murmured in tender protest
But with a sudden wellassumed ebullition of spirits he drew her toward the dancingfloor and as they swung around and around in a waltz she pondered on the iron heart of the man who held her in his arms and resisted all her wiles
At six the next morning scorching with whiskey yet ever himself he stood at the bar putting every mans hand down
The way of it was that two men faced each other across a corner their right elbows resting on the bar their right hands gripped together while each strove to press the others hand down
Man after man came against him but no man put his hand down even Olaf Henderson and French Louis failing despite their hugeness
When they contended it was a trick a trained muscular knack he challenged them to another test
Look here youall he cried
Im going to do two things first weigh my sack and second bet it that after youall have lifted clean from the floor all the sacks of flour youall are able Ill put on two more sacks and lift the whole caboodle clean
By Gar
Ah take dat
French Louis rumbled above the cheers
Hold on
Olaf Henderson cried
I ban yust as good as you Louis
I yump half that bet
Put on the scales Daylights sack was found to balance an even four hundred dollars and Louis and Olaf divided the bet between them
Fiftypound sacks of flour were brought in from MacDonalds cache
Other men tested their strength first
They straddled on two chairs the flour sacks beneath them on the floor and held together by ropelashings
Many of the men were able in this manner to lift four or five hundred pounds while some succeeded with as high as six hundred
Then the two giants took a hand tying at seven hundred
French Louis then added another sack and swung seven hundred and fifty clear
Olaf duplicated the performance whereupon both failed to clear eight hundred
Again and again they strove their foreheads beaded with sweat their frames crackling with the effort
Both were able to shift the weight and to bump it but clear the floor with it they could not
By Gar
Daylight dis tam you mek one beeg meestake French Louis said straightening up and stepping down from the chairs
Only one damn iron man can do dat
One hundred pun moremy frien not ten poun more
The sacks were unlashed but when two sacks were added Kearns interfered
Only one sack more
Two
some one cried
Two was the bet
They didnt lift that last sack Kearns protested
They only lifted seven hundred and fifty
But Daylight grandly brushed aside the confusion
Whats the good of youall botherin around that way
Whats one more sack
If I cant lift three more I sure cant lift two
Put em in
He stood upon the chairs squatted and bent his shoulders down till his hands closed on the rope
He shifted his feet slightly tautened his muscles with a tentative pull then relaxed again questing for a perfect adjustment of all the levers of his body
French Louis looking on sceptically cried out Pool lak hell Daylight
Pool lak hell
Daylights muscles tautened a second time and this time in earnest until steadily all the energy of his splendid body was applied and quite imperceptibly without jerk or strain the bulky nine hundred pounds rose from the door and swung back and forth pendulum like between his legs
Olaf Henderson sighed a vast audible sigh
The Virgin who had tensed unconsciously till her muscles hurt her relaxed
While French Louis murmured reverently Msieu Daylight salut
Ay am one beeg baby
You are one beeg man
Daylight dropped his burden leaped to the floor and headed for the bar
Weigh in
he cried tossing his sack to the weigher who transferred to it four hundred dollars from the sacks of the two losers
Surge up everybody
Daylight went on
Name your snakejuice
The winner pays
This is my night 
he was shouting ten minutes later
Im the lone hewolf and Ive seen thirty winters
This is my birthday my one day in the year and I can put any man on his back
Come on youall
Im going to put youall in the snow
Come on you chechaquos 1 and sourdoughs2 and get your baptism
1 Tenderfeet
2 Oldtimers
The rout streamed out of doors all save the barkeepers and the singing Bacchuses
Some fleeting thought of saving his own dignity entered MacDonalds head for he approached Daylight with outstretched hand
What
You first
Daylight laughed clasping the others hand as if in greeting
No no the other hurriedly disclaimed
Just congratulations on your birthday
Of course you can put me in the snow
What chance have I against a man that lifts nine hundred pounds
MacDonald weighed one hundred and eighty pounds and Daylight had him gripped solely by his hand yet by a sheer abrupt jerk he took the saloonkeeper off his feet and flung him face downward in the snow
In quick succession seizing the men nearest him he threw half a dozen more
Resistance was useless
They flew helterskelter out of his grips landing in all manner of attitudes grotesquely and harmlessly in the soft snow
It soon became difficult in the dim starlight to distinguish between those thrown and those waiting their turn and he began feeling their backs and shoulders determining their status by whether or not he found them powdered with snow
Baptized yet
became his stereotyped question as he reached out his terrible hands
Several score lay down in the snow in a long row while many others knelt in mock humility scooping snow upon their heads and claiming the rite accomplished
But a group of five stood upright backwoodsmen and frontiersmen they eager to contest any mans birthday
Graduates of the hardest of manhandling schools veterans of multitudes of roughandtumble battles men of blood and sweat and endurance they nevertheless lacked one thing that Daylight possessed in high degreenamely an almost perfect brain and muscular coordination
It was simple in its way and no virtue of his
He had been born with this endowment
His nerves carried messages more quickly than theirs his mental processes culminating in acts of will were quicker than theirs his muscles themselves by some immediacy of chemistry obeyed the messages of his will quicker than theirs
He was so made his muscles were highpower explosives
The levers of his body snapped into play like the jaws of steel traps
And in addition to all this his was that superstrength that is the dower of but one human in millionsa strength depending not on size but on degree a supreme organic excellence residing in the stuff of the muscles themselves
Thus so swiftly could he apply a stress that before an opponent could become aware and resist the aim of the stress had been accomplished
In turn so swiftly did he become aware of a stress applied to him that he saved himself by resistance or by delivering a lightning counterstress
It aint no use youall standing there Daylight addressed the waiting group
Youall might as well get right down and take your baptizing
Youall might down me any other day in the year but on my birthday I want youall to know Im the best man
Is that Pat Hanrahans mug looking hungry and willing
Come on Pat
Pat Hanrahan exbareknuckleprize fighter and roughhouseexpert stepped forth
The two men came against each other in grips and almost before he had exerted himself the Irishman found himself in the merciless vise of a halfNelson that buried him head and shoulders in the snow
Joe Hines exlumberjack came down with an impact equal to a fall from a twostory buildinghis overthrow accomplished by a crossbuttock delivered he claimed before he was ready
There was nothing exhausting in all this to Daylight
He did not heave and strain through long minutes
No time practically was occupied
His body exploded abruptly and terrifically in one instant and on the next instant was relaxed
Thus Doc Watson the graybearded iron bodied man without a past a fighting terror himself was overthrown in the fraction of a second preceding his own onslaught
As he was in the act of gathering himself for a spring Daylight was upon him and with such fearful suddenness as to crush him backward and down
Olaf Henderson receiving his cue from this attempted to take Daylight unaware rushing upon him from one side as he stooped with extended hand to help Doc Watson up
Daylight dropped on his hands and knees receiving in his side Olafs knees
Olafs momentum carried him clear over the obstruction in a long flying fall
Before he could rise Daylight had whirled him over on his back and was rubbing his face and ears with snow and shoving handfuls down his neck
Ay ban yust as good a man as you ban Daylight Olaf spluttered as he pulled himself to his feet but by Yupiter I ban navver see a grip like that
French Louis was the last of the five and he had seen enough to make him cautious
He circled and baffled for a full minute before coming to grips and for another full minute they strained and reeled without either winning the advantage
And then just as the contest was becoming interesting Daylight effected one of his lightning shifts changing all stresses and leverages and at the same time delivering one of his muscular explosions
French Louis resisted till his huge frame crackled and then slowly was forced over and under and downward
The winner pays
Daylight cried as he sprang to his feet and led the way back into the Tivoli
Surge along youall
This way to the snakeroom
They lined up against the long bar in places two or three deep stamping the frost from their moccasined feet for outside the temperature was sixty below
Bettles himself one of the gamest of the oldtimers in deeds and daring ceased from his drunken lay of the Sassafras Root and titubated over to congratulate Daylight
But in the midst of it he felt impelled to make a speech and raised his voice oratorically
I tell you fellers Im plum proud to call Daylight my friend
Weve hit the trail together afore now and hes eighteen carat from his moccasins up damn his mangy old hide anyway
He was a shaver when he first hit this country
When you fellers was his age you want dry behind the ears yet
He never was no kid
He was born a fullgrown man
An I tell you a man had to be a man in them days
This want no effete civilization like its come to be now
Bettles paused long enough to put his arm in a proper bearhug around Daylights neck
When you an me mushed into the Yukon in the good ole days it didnt rain soup and they want no freelunch joints
Our camp fires was lit where we killed our game and most of the time we lived on salmontracks and rabbitbelliesaint I right
But at the roar of laughter that greeted his inversion Bettles released the bearhug and turned fiercely on them
Laugh you mangy shorthorns laugh
But I tell you plain and simple the best of you aint kneehigh fit to tie Daylights moccasin strings
Aint I right Campbell
Aint I right Mac
Daylights one of the old guard one of the real sourdoughs
And in them days they want ary a steamboat or ary a tradingpost and we cusses had to live offen salmonbellies and rabbittracks
He gazed triumphantly around and in the applause that followed arose cries for a speech from Daylight
He signified his consent
A chair was brought and he was helped to stand upon it
He was no more sober than the crowd above which he now towereda wild crowd uncouthly garmented every foot moccasined or muclucked3 with mittens dangling from necks and with furry earflaps raised so that they took on the seeming of the winged helmets of the Norsemen
Daylights black eyes were flashing and the flush of strong drink flooded darkly under the bronze of his cheeks
He was greeted with round on round of affectionate cheers which brought a suspicious moisture to his eyes albeit many of the voices were inarticulate and inebriate
And yet men have so behaved since the world began feasting fighting and carousing whether in the dark cavemouth or by the fire of the squattingplace in the palaces of imperial Rome and the rock strongholds of robber barons or in the skyaspiring hotels of modern times and in the boozingkens of sailortown
Just so were these men empirebuilders in the Arctic Light boastful and drunken and clamorous winning surcease for a few wild moments from the grim reality of their heroic toil
Modern heroes they and in nowise different from the heroes of old time
Well fellows I dont know what to say to youall Daylight began lamely striving still to control his whirling brain
I think Ill tell youall a story
I had a pardner wunst down in Juneau
He come from North Caroliney and he used to tell this same story to me
It was down in the mountains in his country and it was a wedding
There they was the family and all the friends
The parson was just puttin on the last touches and he says They as the Lord have joined let no man put asunder
3 Mucluc a watertight Eskimo boot made from walrushide and trimmed with fur
Parson says the bridegroom I rises to question your grammar in that there sentence
I want this weddin done right
When the smoke clears away the bride she looks around and sees a dead parson a dead bridegroom a dead brother two dead uncles and five dead weddingguests
So she heaves a mighty strong sigh and says Them newfangled selfcocking revolvers sure has played hell with my prospects
And so I say to youall Daylight added as the roar of laughter died down that them four kings of Jack Kearns sure has played hell with my prospects
Im busted highern a kite and Im hittin the trail for Dyea Goin out
some one called
A spasm of anger wrought on his face for a flashing instant but in the next his goodhumor was back again
I know youall are only pokin fun asking such a question he said with a smile
Of course I aint going out
Take the oath again Daylight the same voice cried
I sure will
I first come over Chilcoot in 83
I went out over the Pass in a fall blizzard with a rag of a shirt and a cup of raw flour
I got my grubstake in Juneau that winter and in the spring I went over the Pass once more
And once more the famine drew me out
Next spring I went in again and I swore then that Id never come out till I made my stake
Well I aint made it and here I am
And I aint going out now
I get the mail and I come right back
I wont stop the night at Dyea
Ill hit up Chilcoot soon as I change the dogs and get the mail and grub
And so I swear once more by the milltails of hell and the head of John the Baptist Ill never hit for the Outside till I make my pile
And I tell youall here and now its got to be an almighty big pile
How much might you call a pile
Bettles demanded from beneath his arms clutched lovingly around Daylights legs
Yes how much
What do you call a pile
others cried
Daylight steadied himself for a moment and debated
Four or five millions he said slowly and held up his hand for silence as his statement was received with derisive yells
Ill be real conservative and put the bottom notch at a million
And for not an ounce lessn that will I go out of the country
Again his statement was received with an outburst of derision
Not only had the total gold output of the Yukon up to date been below five millions but no man had ever made a strike of a hundred thousand much less of a million
Youall listen to me
You seen Jack Kearns get a hunch tonight
We had him sure beat before the draw
His ornery three kings was no good
But he just knew there was another king comingthat was his hunchand he got it
And I tell youall I got a hunch
Theres a big strike coming on the Yukon and its just about due
I dont mean no ornery Moosehide BirchCreek kind of a strike
I mean a real ripsnorter hairraiser
I tell youall shes in the air and hellbent for election
Nothing can stop her and shell come up river
Theres where youall track my moccasins in the near future if youall want to find mesomewhere in the country around Stewart River Indian River and Klondike River
When I get back with the mail Ill head that way so fast youall wont see my trail for smoke
Shes acoming fellows gold from the grass roots down a hundred dollars to the pan and a stampede in from the Outside fifty thousand strong
Youallll think all hells busted loose when that strike is made
He raised his glass to his lips
Heres kindness and hoping youall will be in on it
He drank and stepped down from the chair falling into another one of Bettles bearhugs
If I was you Daylight I wouldnt mush today Joe Hines counselled coming in from consulting the spirit thermometer outside the door
Were in for a good cold snap
Its sixtytwo below now and still goin down
Better wait till she breaks
Daylight laughed and the old sourdoughs around him laughed
Just like you shorthorns Bettles cried afeard of a little frost
And blamed little you know Daylight if you think frost kin stop m
Freeze his lungs if he travels in it was the reply
Freeze pap and lollypop
Look here Hines you only ben in this here country three years
You aint seasoned yet
Ive seen Daylight do fifty miles up on the Koyokuk on a day when the thermometer busted at seventytwo
Hines shook his head dolefully
Thems the kind that does freeze their lungs he lamented
If Daylight pulls out before this snap breaks hell never get throughan him travelin without tent or fly
Its a thousand miles to Dyea Bettles announced climbing on the chair and supporting his swaying body by an arm passed around Daylights neck
Its a thousand miles Im sayin an most of the trail unbroke but I bet any chechaquoanything he wantsthat Daylight makes Dyea in thirty days
Thats an average of over thirtythree miles a day Doc Watson warned and Ive travelled some myself
A blizzard on Chilcoot would tie him up for a week
Yep Bettles retorted an Daylightll do the second thousand back again on end in thirty days more and I got five hundred dollars that says so and damn the blizzards
To emphasize his remarks he pulled out a goldsack the size of a bologna sausage and thumped it down on the bar
Doc Watson thumped his own sack alongside
Hold on
Daylight cried
Bettless right and I want in on this
I bet five hundred that sixty days from now I pull up at the Tivoli door with the Dyea mail
A sceptical roar went up and a dozen men pulled out their sacks
Jack Kearns crowded in close and caught Daylights attention
I take youDaylight he cried
Two to one you dontnot in seventyfive days
No charity Jack was the reply
The bettins even and the time is sixty days
Seventyfive days and two to one you dont Kearns insisted
Fifty Milell be wide open and the rimice rotten
What you win from me is yours Daylight went on
And by thunder Jack you cant give it back that way
I wont bet with you
Youre trying to give me money
But I tell youall one thing Jack I got another hunch
Im goin to win it back some one of these days
Youall just wait till the big strike up river
Then you and mell take the roof off and sit in a game thatll be full mans size
Is it a go
They shook hands
Of course hell make it Kearns whispered in Bettles ear
And theres five hundred Daylights back in sixty days he added aloud
Billy Rawlins closed with the wager and Bettles hugged Kearns ecstatically
By Yupiter I ban take that bet Olaf Henderson said dragging Daylight away from Bettles and Kearns
Winner pays
Daylight shouted closing the wager
And Im sure going to win and sixty days is a long time between drinks so I pay now
Name your brand you hoochinoos
Name your brand
Bettles a glass of whiskey in hand climbed back on his chair and swaying back and forth sang the one song he knew O its Henry Ward Beecher And Sundayschool teachers All sing of the sassafrasroot But you bet all the same If it had its right name Its the juice of the forbidden fruit
The crowd roared out the chorus But you bet all the same If it had its right name Its the juice of the forbidden fruit
Somebody opened the outer door
A vague gray light filtered in
Burning daylight burning daylight some one called warningly
Daylight paused for nothing heading for the door and pulling down his earflaps
Kama stood outside by the sled a long narrow affair sixteen inches wide and seven and a half feet in length its slatted bottom raised six inches above the steelshod runners
On it lashed with thongs of moosehide were the light canvas bags that contained the mail and the food and gear for dogs and men
In front of it in a single line lay curled five frostrimed dogs
They were huskies matched in size and color all unusually large and all gray
From their cruel jaws to their bushy tails they were as like as peas in their likeness to timberwolves
Wolves they were domesticated it was true but wolves in appearance and in all their characteristics
On top the sled load thrust under the lashings and ready for immediate use were two pairs of snowshoes
Bettles pointed to a robe of Arctic hare skins the end of which showed in the mouth of a bag
Thats his bed he said
Six pounds of rabbit skins
Warmest thing he ever slept under but Im damned if it could keep me warm and I can go some myself
Daylights a hellfire furnace thats what he is
Id hate to be that Indian Doc Watson remarked
Hell killm hell killm sure Bettles chanted exultantly
I know
Ive ben with Daylight on trail
That man aint never ben tired in his life
Dont know what it means
I seen him travel all day with wet socks at forty five below
There aint another man living can do that
While this talk went on Daylight was saying goodby to those that clustered around him
The Virgin wanted to kiss him and fuddled slightly though he was with the whiskey he saw his way out without compromising with the apronstring
He kissed the Virgin but he kissed the other three women with equal partiality
He pulled on his long mittens roused the dogs to their feet and took his Place at the gee pole
4 4 A geepole stout pole projecting forward from one side of the front end of the sled by which the sled is steered
Mush you beauties
he cried
The animals threw their weights against their breastbands on the instant crouching low to the snow and digging in their claws
They whined eagerly and before the sled had gone half a dozen lengths both Daylight and Kama in the rear were running to keep up
And so running man and dogs dipped over the bank and down to the frozen bed of the Yukon and in the gray light were gone
CHAPTER IV On the river where was a packed trail and where snowshoes were unnecessary the dogs averaged six miles an hour
To keep up with them the two men were compelled to run
Daylight and Kama relieved each other regularly at the geepole for here was the hard work of steering the flying sled and of keeping in advance of it
The man relieved dropped behind the sled occasionally leaping upon it and resting
It was severe work but of the sort that was exhilarating
They were flying getting over the ground making the most of the packed trail
Later on they would come to the unbroken trail where three miles an hour would constitute good going
Then there would be no riding and resting and no running
Then the geepole would be the easier task and a man would come back to it to rest after having completed his spell to the fore breaking trail with the snowshoes for the dogs
Such work was far from exhilarating also they must expect places where for miles at a time they must toil over chaotic icejams where they would be fortunate if they made two miles an hour
And there would be the inevitable bad jams short ones it was true but so bad that a mile an hour would require terrific effort
Kama and Daylight did not talk
In the nature of the work they could not nor in their own natures were they given to talking while they worked
At rare intervals when necessary they addressed each other in monosyllables Kama for the most part contenting himself with grunts
Occasionally a dog whined or snarled but in the main the team kept silent
Only could be heard the sharp jarring grate of the steel runners over the hard surface and the creak of the straining sled
As if through a wall Daylight had passed from the hum and roar of the Tivoli into another worlda world of silence and immobility
Nothing stirred
The Yukon slept under a coat of ice three feet thick
No breath of wind blew
Nor did the sap move in the hearts of the spruce trees that forested the river banks on either hand
The trees burdened with the last infinitesimal pennyweight of snow their branches could hold stood in absolute petrifaction
The slightest tremor would have dislodged the snow and no snow was dislodged
The sled was the one point of life and motion in the midst of the solemn quietude and the harsh churn of its runners but emphasized the silence through which it moved
It was a dead world and furthermore a gray world
The weather was sharp and clear there was no moisture in the atmosphere no fog nor haze yet the sky was a gray pall
The reason for this was that though there was no cloud in the sky to dim the brightness of day there was no sun to give brightness
Far to the south the sun climbed steadily to meridian but between it and the frozen Yukon intervened the bulge of the earth
The Yukon lay in a night shadow and the day itself was in reality a long twilightlight
At a quarter before twelve where a wide bend of the river gave a long vista south the sun showed its upper rim above the skyline
But it did not rise perpendicularly
Instead it rose on a slant so that by high noon it had barely lifted its lower rim clear of the horizon
It was a dim wan sun
There was no heat to its rays and a man could gaze squarely into the full orb of it without hurt to his eyes
No sooner had it reached meridian than it began its slant back beneath the horizon and at quarter past twelve the earth threw its shadow again over the land
The men and dogs raced on
Daylight and Kama were both savages so far as their stomachs were concerned
They could eat irregularly in time and quantity gorging hugely on occasion and on occasion going long stretches without eating at all
As for the dogs they ate but once a day and then rarely did they receive more than a pound each of dried fish
They were ravenously hungry and at the same time splendidly in condition
Like the wolves their forebears their nutritive processes were rigidly economical and perfect
There was no waste
The last least particle of what they consumed was transformed into energy
And Kama and Daylight were like them
Descended themselves from the generations that had endured they too endured
Theirs was the simple elemental economy
A little food equipped them with prodigious energy
Nothing was lost
A man of soft civilization sitting at a desk would have grown lean and woebegone on the fare that kept Kama and Daylight at the topnotch of physical efficiency
They knew as the man at the desk never knows what it is to be normally hungry all the time so that they could eat any time
Their appetites were always with them and on edge so that they bit voraciously into whatever offered and with an entire innocence of indigestion
By three in the afternoon the long twilight faded into night
The stars came out very near and sharp and bright and by their light dogs and men still kept the trail
They were indefatigable
And this was no record run of a single day but the first day of sixty such days
Though Daylight had passed a night without sleep a night of dancing and carouse it seemed to have left no effect
For this there were two explanations first his remarkable vitality and next the fact that such nights were rare in his experience
Again enters the man at the desk whose physical efficiency would be more hurt by a cup of coffee at bedtime than could Daylights by a whole night long of strong drink and excitement
Daylight travelled without a watch feeling the passage of time and largely estimating it by subconscious processes
By what he considered must be six oclock he began looking for a campingplace
The trail at a bend plunged out across the river
Not having found a likely spot they held on for the opposite bank a mile away
But midway they encountered an icejam which took an hour of heavy work to cross
At last Daylight glimpsed what he was looking for a dead tree close by the bank
The sled was run in and up
Kama grunted with satisfaction and the work of making camp was begun
The division of labor was excellent
Each knew what he must do
With one ax Daylight chopped down the dead pine
Kama with a snowshoe and the other ax cleared away the two feet of snow above the Yukon ice and chopped a supply of ice for cooking purposes
A piece of dry birch bark started the fire and Daylight went ahead with the cooking while the Indian unloaded the sled and fed the dogs their ration of dried fish
The food sacks he slung high in the trees beyond leapingreach of the huskies
Next he chopped down a young spruce tree and trimmed off the boughs
Close to the fire he trampled down the soft snow and covered the packed space with the boughs
On this flooring he tossed his own and Daylights gearbags containing dry socks and underwear and their sleepingrobes
Kama however had two robes of rabbit skin to Daylights one
They worked on steadily without speaking losing no time
Each did whatever was needed without thought of leaving to the other the least task that presented itself to hand
Thus Kama saw when more ice was needed and went and got it while a snowshoe pushed over by the lunge of a dog was stuck on end again by Daylight
While coffee was boiling bacon frying and flapjacks were being mixed Daylight found time to put on a big pot of beans
Kama came back sat down on the edge of the spruce boughs and in the interval of waiting mended harness
I tink dat Skookum and Booga make um plenty fight maybe Kama remarked as they sat down to eat
Keep an eye on them was Daylights answer
And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
Once with a muttered imprecation Kama leaped away a stick of firewood in hand and clubbed apart a tangle of fighting dogs
Daylight between mouthfuls fed chunks of ice into the tin pot where it thawed into water
The meal finished Kama replenished the fire cut more wood for the morning and returned to the spruce bough bed and his harnessmending
Daylight cut up generous chunks of bacon and dropped them in the pot of bubbling beans
The moccasins of both men were wet and this in spite of the intense cold so when there was no further need for them to leave the oasis of spruce boughs they took off their moccasins and hung them on short sticks to dry before the fire turning them about from time to time
When the beans were finally cooked Daylight ran part of them into a bag of floursacking a foot and a half long and three inches in diameter
This he then laid on the snow to freeze
The remainder of the beans were left in the pot for breakfast
It was past nine oclock and they were ready for bed
The squabbling and bickering among the dogs had long since died down and the weary animals were curled in the snow each with his feet and nose bunched together and covered by his wolfs brush of a tail
Kama spread his sleepingfurs and lighted his pipe
Daylight rolled a brownpaper cigarette and the second conversation of the evening took place
I think we come near sixty miles said Daylight
Um I tink so said Kama
They rolled into their robes allstanding each with a woolen Mackinaw jacket on in place of the parkas5 they had worn all day
Swiftly almost on the instant they closed their eyes they were asleep
The stars leaped and danced in the frosty air and overhead the colored bars of the aurora borealis were shooting like great searchlights
5 Parka a light hooded smocklike garment made of cotton drill
In the darkness Daylight awoke and roused Kama
Though the aurora still flamed another day had begun
Warmedover flapjacks warmedover beans fried bacon and coffee composed the breakfast
The dogs got nothing though they watched with wistful mien from a distance sitting up in the snow their tails curled around their paws
Occasionally they lifted one fore paw or the other with a restless movement as if the frost tingled in their feet
It was bitter cold at least sixtyfive below zero and when Kama harnessed the dogs with naked hands he was compelled several times to go over to the fire and warm the numbing fingertips
Together the two men loaded and lashed the sled
They warmed their hands for the last time pulled on their mittens and mushed the dogs over the bank and down to the rivertrail
According to Daylights estimate it was around seven oclock but the stars danced just as brilliantly and faint luminous streaks of greenish aurora still pulsed overhead
Two hours later it became suddenly darkso dark that they kept to the trail largely by instinct and Daylight knew that his timeestimate had been right
It was the darkness before dawn never anywhere more conspicuous than on the Alaskan wintertrail
Slowly the gray light came stealing through the gloom imperceptibly at first so that it was almost with surprise that they noticed the vague loom of the trail underfoot
Next they were able to see the wheeldog and then the whole string of running dogs and snowstretches on either side
Then the near bank loomed for a moment and was gone loomed a second time and remained
In a few minutes the far bank a mile away unobtrusively came into view and ahead and behind the whole frozen river could be seen with off to the left a wideextending range of sharpcut snowcovered mountains
And that was all
No sun arose
The gray light remained gray
Once during the day a lynx leaped lightly across the trail under the very nose of the leaddog and vanished in the white woods
The dogs wild impulses roused
They raised the huntingcry of the pack surged against their collars and swerved aside in pursuit
Daylight yelling Whoa
struggled with the geepole and managed to overturn the sled into the soft snow
The dogs gave up the sled was righted and five minutes later they were flying along the hardpacked trail again
The lynx was the only sign of life they had seen in two days and it leaping velvetfooted and vanishing had been more like an apparition
At twelve oclock when the sun peeped over the earthbulge they stopped and built a small fire on the ice
Daylight with the ax chopped chunks off the frozen sausage of beans
These thawed and warmed in the fryingpan constituted their meal
They had no coffee
He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury
The dogs stopped wrangling with one another and looked on wistfully
Only at night did they get their pound of fish
In the meantime they worked
The cold snap continued
Only men of iron kept the trail at such low temperatures and Kama and Daylight were picked men of their races
But Kama knew the other was the better man and thus at the start he was himself foredoomed to defeat
Not that he slackened his effort or willingness by the slightest conscious degree but that he was beaten by the burden he carried in his mind
His attitude toward Daylight was worshipful
Stoical taciturn proud of his physical prowess he found all these qualities incarnated in his white companion
Here was one that excelled in the things worth excelling in a mangod ready to hand and Kama could not but worshipwithal he gave no signs of it
No wonder the race of white men conquered was his thought when it bred men like this man
What chance had the Indian against such a dogged enduring breed
Even the Indians did not travel at such low temperatures and theirs was the wisdom of thousands of generations yet here was this Daylight from the soft Southland harder than they laughing at their fears and swinging along the trail ten and twelve hours a day
And this Daylight thought that he could keep up a days pace of thirtythree miles for sixty days
Wait till a fresh fall of snow came down or they struck the unbroken trail or the rotten rimice that fringed open water
In the meantime Kama kept the pace never grumbling never shirking
Sixtyfive degrees below zero is very cold
Since water freezes at thirtytwo above sixtyfive below meant ninetyseven degrees below freezingpoint
Some idea of the significance of this may be gained by conceiving of an equal difference of temperature in the opposite direction
One hundred and twentynine on the thermometer constitutes a very hot day yet such a temperature is but ninetyseven degrees above freezing
Double this difference and possibly some slight conception may be gained of the cold through which Kama and Daylight travelled between dark and dark and through the dark
Kama froze the skin on his cheekbones despite frequent rubbings and the flesh turned black and sore
Also he slightly froze the edges of his lungtissuesa dangerous thing and the basic reason why a man should not unduly exert himself in the open at sixtyfive below
But Kama never complained and Daylight was a furnace of heat sleeping as warmly under his six pounds of rabbit skins as the other did under twelve pounds
On the second night fifty more miles to the good they camped in the vicinity of the boundary between Alaska and the Northwest Territory
The rest of the journey save the last short stretch to Dyea would be travelled on Canadian territory
With the hard trail and in the absence of fresh snow Daylight planned to make the camp of Forty Mile on the fourth night
He told Kama as much but on the third day the temperature began to rise and they knew snow was not far off for on the Yukon it must get warm in order to snow
Also on this day they encountered ten miles of chaotic icejams where a thousand times they lifted the loaded sled over the huge cakes by the strength of their arms and lowered it down again
Here the dogs were wellnigh useless and both they and the men were tried excessively by the roughness of the way
An hours extra running that night caught up only part of the lost time
In the morning they awoke to find ten inches of snow on their robes
The dogs were buried under it and were loath to leave their comfortable nests
This new snow meant hard going
The sled runners would not slide over it so well while one of the men must go in advance of the dogs and pack it down with snowshoes so that they should not wallow
Quite different was it from the ordinary snow known to those of the Southland
It was hard and fine and dry
It was more like sugar
Kick it and it flew with a hissing noise like sand
There was no cohesion among the particles and it could not be moulded into snow balls
It was not composed of flakes but of crystalstiny geometrical frostcrystals
In truth it was not snow but frost
The weather was warm as well barely twenty below zero and the two men with raised earflaps and dangling mittens sweated as they toiled
They failed to make Forty Mile that night and when they passed that camp next day Daylight paused only long enough to get the mail and additional grub
On the afternoon of the following day they camped at the mouth of the Klondike River
Not a soul had they encountered since Forty Mile and they had made their own trail
As yet that winter no one had travelled the river south of Forty Mile and for that matter the whole winter through they might be the only ones to travel it
In that day the Yukon was a lonely land
Between the Klondike River and Salt Water at Dyea intervened six hundred miles of snowcovered wilderness and in all that distance there were but two places where Daylight might look forward to meeting men
Both were isolated tradingposts Sixty Mile and Fort Selkirk
In the summertime Indians might be met with at the mouths of the Stewart and White rivers at the Big and Little Salmons and on Lake Le Barge but in the winter as he well knew they would be on the trail of the mooseherds following them back into the mountains
That night camped at the mouth of the Klondike Daylight did not turn in when the evenings work was done
Had a white man been present Daylight would have remarked that he felt his hunch working
As it was he tied on his snowshoes left the dogs curled in the snow and Kama breathing heavily under his rabbit skins and climbed up to the big flat above the high earthbank
But the spruce trees were too thick for an outlook and he threaded his way across the flat and up the first steep slopes of the mountain at the back
Here flowing in from the east at right angles he could see the Klondike and bending grandly from the south the Yukon
To the left and downstream toward Moosehide Mountain the huge splash of white from which it took its name showing clearly in the starlight
Lieutenant Schwatka had given it its name but he Daylight had first seen it long before that intrepid explorer had crossed the Chilcoot and rafted down the Yukon
But the mountain received only passing notice
Daylights interest was centered in the big flat itself with deep water all along its edge for steamboat landings
A sure enough likely town site he muttered
Room for a camp of forty thousand men
All thats needed is the goldstrike
He meditated for a space
Ten dollars to the panll do it and itd be the allfiredest stampede Alaska ever seen
And if it dont come here itll come somewhere hereabouts
Its a sure good idea to keep an eye out for town sites all the way up
He stood a while longer gazing out over the lonely flat and visioning with constructive imagination the scene if the stampede did come
In fancy he placed the sawmills the big trading stores the saloons and dancehalls and the long streets of miners cabins
And along those streets he saw thousands of men passing up and down while before the stores were the heavy freightingsleds with long strings of dogs attached
Also he saw the heavy freighters pulling down the main street and heading up the frozen Klondike toward the imagined somewhere where the diggings must be located
He laughed and shook the vision from his eyes descended to the level and crossed the flat to camp
Five minutes after he had rolled up in his robe he opened his eyes and sat up amazed that he was not already asleep
He glanced at the Indian sleeping beside him at the embers of the dying fire at the five dogs beyond with their wolfs brushes curled over their noses and at the four snowshoes standing upright in the snow
Its sure hell the way that hunch works on me he murmured
His mind reverted to the poker game
Four kings
He grinned reminiscently
That WAS a hunch
He lay down again pulled the edge of the robe around his neck and over his earflaps closed his eyes and this time fell asleep
CHAPTER V At Sixty Mile they restocked provisions added a few pounds of letters to their load and held steadily on
From Forty Mile they had had unbroken trail and they could look forward only to unbroken trail clear to Dyea
Daylight stood it magnificently but the killing pace was beginning to tell on Kama
His pride kept his mouth shut but the result of the chilling of his lungs in the cold snap could not be concealed
Microscopically small had been the edges of the lungtissue touched by the frost but they now began to slough off giving rise to a dry hacking cough
Any unusually severe exertion precipitated spells of coughing during which he was almost like a man in a fit
The blood congested in his eyes till they bulged while the tears ran down his cheeks
A whiff of the smoke from frying bacon would start him off for a halfhours paroxysm and he kept carefully to windward when Daylight was cooking
They plodded days upon days and without end over the soft unpacked snow
It was hard monotonous work with none of the joy and bloodstir that went with flying over hard surface
Now one man to the fore in the snowshoes and now the other it was a case of stubborn unmitigated plod
A yard of powdery snow had to be pressed down and the widewebbed shoe under a mans weight sank a full dozen inches into the soft surface
Snowshoe work under such conditions called for the use of muscles other than those used in ordinary walking
From step to step the rising foot could not come up and forward on a slant
It had to be raised perpendicularly
When the snowshoe was pressed into the snow its nose was confronted by a vertical wall of snow twelve inches high
If the foot in rising slanted forward the slightest bit the nose of the shoe penetrated the obstructing wall and tipped downward till the heel of the shoe struck the mans leg behind
Thus up straight up twelve inches each foot must be raised every time and all the time ere the forward swing from the knee could begin
On this partially packed surface followed the dogs the man at the geepole and the sled
At the best toiling as only picked men could toil they made no more than three miles an hour
This meant longer hours of travel and Daylight for good measure and for a margin against accidents hit the trail for twelve hours a day
Since three hours were consumed by making camp at night and cooking beans by getting breakfast in the morning and breaking camp and by thawing beans at the midday halt nine hours were left for sleep and recuperation and neither men nor dogs wasted many minutes of those nine hours
At Selkirk the trading post near Pelly River Daylight suggested that Kama lay over rejoining him on the back trip from Dyea
A strayed Indian from Lake Le Barge was willing to take his place but Kama was obdurate
He grunted with a slight intonation of resentment and that was all
The dogs however Daylight changed leaving his own exhausted team to rest up against his return while he went on with six fresh dogs
They travelled till ten oclock the night they reached Selkirk and at six next morning they plunged ahead into the next stretch of wilderness of nearly five hundred miles that lay between Selkirk and Dyea
A second cold snap came on but cold or warm it was all the same an unbroken trail
When the thermometer went down to fifty below it was even harder to travel for at that low temperature the hard frostcrystals were more like sandgrains in the resistance they offered to the sled runners
The dogs had to pull harder than over the same snow at twenty or thirty below zero
Daylight increased the days travel to thirteen hours
He jealously guarded the margin he had gained for he knew there were difficult stretches to come
It was not yet quite midwinter and the turbulent Fifty Mile River vindicated his judgment
In many places it ran wide open with precarious rimice fringing it on either side
In numerous places where the water dashed against the steepsided bluffs rimice was unable to form
They turned and twisted now crossing the river now coming back again sometimes making half a dozen attempts before they found a way over a particularly bad stretch
It was slow work
The icebridges had to be tested and either Daylight or Kama went in advance snowshoes on their feet and long poles carried crosswise in their hands
Thus if they broke through they could cling to the pole that bridged the hole made by their bodies
Several such accidents were the share of each
At fifty below zero a man wet to the waist cannot travel without freezing so each ducking meant delay
As soon as rescued the wet man ran up and down to keep up his circulation while his dry companion built a fire
Thus protected a change of garments could be made and the wet ones dried against the next misadventure
To make matters worse this dangerous river travel could not be done in the dark and their working day was reduced to the six hours of twilight
Every moment was precious and they strove never to lose one
Thus before the first hint of the coming of gray day camp was broken sled loaded dogs harnessed and the two men crouched waiting over the fire
Nor did they make the midday halt to eat
As it was they were running far behind their schedule each day eating into the margin they had run up
There were days when they made fifteen miles and days when they made a dozen
And there was one bad stretch where in two days they covered nine miles being compelled to turn their backs three times on the river and to portage sled and outfit over the mountains
At last they cleared the dread Fifty Mile River and came out on Lake Le Barge
Here was no open water nor jammed ice
For thirty miles or more the snow lay level as a table withal it lay three feet deep and was soft as flour
Three miles an hour was the best they could make but Daylight celebrated the passing of the Fifty Mile by traveling late
At eleven in the morning they emerged at the foot of the lake
At three in the afternoon as the Arctic night closed down he caught his first sight of the head of the lake and with the first stars took his bearings
At eight in the evening they left the lake behind and entered the mouth of the Lewes River
Here a halt of half an hour was made while chunks of frozen boiled beans were thawed and the dogs were given an extra ration of fish
Then they pulled on up the river till one in the morning when they made their regular camp
They had hit the trail sixteen hours on end that day the dogs had come in too tired to fight among themselves or even snarl and Kama had perceptibly limped the last several miles yet Daylight was on trail next morning at six oclock
By eleven he was at the foot of White Horse and that night saw him camped beyond the Box Canon the last bad riverstretch behind him the string of lakes before him
There was no let up in his pace
Twelve hours a day six in the twilight and six in the dark they toiled on the trail
Three hours were consumed in cooking repairing harnesses and making and breaking camp and the remaining nine hours dogs and men slept as if dead
The iron strength of Kama broke
Day by day the terrific toil sapped him
Day by day he consumed more of his reserves of strength
He became slower of movement the resiliency went out of his muscles and his limp became permanent
Yet he labored stoically on never shirking never grunting a hint of complaint
Daylight was thinfaced and tired
He looked tired yet somehow with that marvelous mechanism of a body that was his he drove on ever on remorselessly on
Never was he more a god in Kamas mind than in the last days of the southbound traverse as the failing Indian watched him ever to the fore pressing onward with urgency of endurance such as Kama had never seen nor dreamed could thrive in human form
The time came when Kama was unable to go in the lead and break trail and it was a proof that he was far gone when he permitted Daylight to toil all day at the heavy snowshoe work
Lake by lake they crossed the string of lakes from Marsh to Linderman and began the ascent of Chilcoot
By all rights Daylight should have camped below the last pitch of the pass at the dim end of day but he kept on and over and down to Sheep Camp while behind him raged a snowstorm that would have delayed him twentyfour hours
This last excessive strain broke Kama completely
In the morning he could not travel
At five when called he sat up after a struggle groaned and sank back again
Daylight did the camp work of both harnessed the dogs and when ready for the start rolled the helpless Indian in all three sleeping robes and lashed him on top of the sled
The going was good they were on the last lap and he raced the dogs down through Dyea Canon and along the hardpacked trail that led to Dyea Post
And running still Kama groaning on top the load and Daylight leaping at the geepole to avoid going under the runners of the flying sled they arrived at Dyea by the sea
True to his promise Daylight did not stop
An hours time saw the sled loaded with the ingoing mail and grub fresh dogs harnessed and a fresh Indian engaged
Kama never spoke from the time of his arrival till the moment Daylight ready to depart stood beside him to say goodby
They shook hands
You kill um dat damn Indian Kama said
Sawee Daylight
You kill um
Hell sure last as far as Pelly Daylight grinned
Kama shook his head doubtfully and rolled over on his side turning his back in token of farewell
Daylight won across Chilcoot that same day dropping down five hundred feet in the darkness and the flurrying snow to Crater Lake where he camped
It was a cold camp far above the timberline and he had not burdened his sled with firewood
That night three feet of snow covered them and in the black morning when they dug themselves out the Indian tried to desert
He had had enough of traveling with what he considered a madman
But Daylight persuaded him in grim ways to stay by the outfit and they pulled on across Deep Lake and Long Lake and dropped down to the levelgoing of Lake Linderman
It was the same killing pace going in as coming out and the Indian did not stand it as well as Kama
He too never complained
Nor did he try again to desert
He toiled on and did his best while he renewed his resolve to steer clear of Daylight in the future
The days slipped into days nights and twilights alternating cold snaps gave way to snowfalls and cold snaps came on again and all the while through the long hours the miles piled up behind them
But on the Fifty Mile accident befell them
Crossing an icebridge the dogs broke through and were swept under the downstream ice
The traces that connected the team with the wheeldog parted and the team was never seen again
Only the one wheeldog remained and Daylight harnessed the Indian and himself to the sled
But a man cannot take the place of a dog at such work and the two men were attempting to do the work of five dogs
At the end of the first hour Daylight lightened up
Dogfood extra gear and the spare ax were thrown away
Under the extraordinary exertion the dog snapped a tendon the following day and was hopelessly disabled
Daylight shot it and abandoned the sled
On his back he took one hundred and sixty pounds of mail and grub and on the Indians put one hundred and twentyfive pounds
The stripping of gear was remorseless
The Indian was appalled when he saw every pound of worthless mail matter retained while beans cups pails plates and extra clothing were thrown by the board
One robe each was kept one ax one tin pail and a scant supply of bacon and flour
Bacon could be eaten raw on a pinch and flour stirred in hot water could keep men going
Even the rifle and the score of rounds of ammunition were left behind
And in this fashion they covered the two hundred miles to Selkirk
Daylight travelled late and early the hours formerly used by campmaking and dogtending being now devoted to the trail
At night they crouched over a small fire wrapped in their robes drinking flour broth and thawing bacon on the ends of sticks and in the morning darkness without a word they arose slipped on their packs adjusted headstraps and hit the trail
The last miles into Selkirk Daylight drove the Indian before him a hollowcheeked gaunteyed wraith of a man who else would have lain down and slept or abandoned his burden of mail
At Selkirk the old team of dogs fresh and in condition were harnessed and the same day saw Daylight plodding on alternating places at the geepole as a matter of course with the Le Barge Indian who had volunteered on the way out
Daylight was two days behind his schedule and falling snow and unpacked trail kept him two days behind all the way to Forty Mile
And here the weather favored
It was time for a big cold snap and he gambled on it cutting down the weight of grub for dogs and men
The men of Forty Mile shook their heads ominously and demanded to know what he would do if the snow still fell
That cold snaps sure got to come he laughed and mushed out on the trail
A number of sleds had passed back and forth already that winter between Forty Mile and Circle City and the trail was well packed
And the cold snap came and remained and Circle City was only two hundred miles away
The Le Barge Indian was a young man unlearned yet in his own limitations and filled with pride
He took Daylights pace with joy and even dreamed at first that he would play the white man out
The first hundred miles he looked for signs of weakening and marveled that he saw them not
Throughout the second hundred miles he observed signs in himself and gritted his teeth and kept up
And ever Daylight flew on and on running at the geepole or resting his spell on top the flying sled
The last day clearer and colder than ever gave perfect going and they covered seventy miles
It was ten at night when they pulled up the earthbank and flew along the main street of Circle City and the young Indian though it was his spell to ride leaped off and ran behind the sled
It was honorable braggadocio and despite the fact that he had found his limitations and was pressing desperately against them he ran gamely on
CHAPTER VI A crowd filled the Tivolithe old crowd that had seen Daylight depart two months before for this was the night of the sixtieth day and opinion was divided as ever as to whether or not he would compass the achievement
At ten oclock bets were still being made though the odds rose bet by bet against his success
Down in her heart the Virgin believed he had failed yet she made a bet of twenty ounces with Charley Bates against forty ounces that Daylight would arrive before midnight
She it was who heard the first yelps of the dogs
Listen
she cried
Its Daylight
There was a general stampede for the door but where the double stormdoors were thrown wide open the crowd fell back
They heard the eager whining of dogs the snap of a dogwhip and the voice of Daylight crying encouragement as the weary animals capped all they had done by dragging the sled in over the wooden floor
They came in with a rush and with them rushed in the frost a visible vapor of smoking white through which their heads and backs showed as they strained in the harness till they had all the seeming of swimming in a river
Behind them at the geepole came Daylight hidden to the knees by the swirling frost through which he appeared to wade
He was the same old Daylight withal lean and tiredlooking and his black eyes were sparkling and flashing brighter than ever
His parka of cotton drill hooded him like a monk and fell in straight lines to his knees
Grimed and scorched by campsmoke and fire the garment in itself told the story of his trip
A twomonths beard covered his face and the beard in turn was matted with the ice of his breathing through the long seventymile run
His entry was spectacular melodramatic and he knew it
It was his life and he was living it at the top of his bent
Among his fellows he was a great man an Arctic hero
He was proud of the fact and it was a high moment for him fresh from two thousand miles of trail to come surging into that barroom dogs sled mail Indian paraphernalia and all
He had performed one more exploit that would make the Yukon ring with his namehe Burning Daylight the king of travelers and dogmushers
He experienced a thrill of surprise as the roar of welcome went up and as every familiar detail of the Tivoli greeted his visionthe long bar and the array of bottles the gambling games the big stove the weigher at the goldscales the musicians the men and women the Virgin Celia and Nellie Dan MacDonald Bettles Billy Rawlins Olaf Henderson Doc Watsonall of them
It was just as he had left it and in all seeming it might well be the very day he had left
The sixty days of incessant travel through the white wilderness suddenly telescoped and had no existence in time
They were a moment an incident
He had plunged out and into them through the wall of silence and back through the wall of silence he had plunged apparently the next instant and into the roar and turmoil of the Tivoli
A glance down at the sled with its canvas mailbags was necessary to reassure him of the reality of those sixty days and the two thousand miles over the ice
As in a dream he shook the hands that were thrust out to him
He felt a vast exaltation
Life was magnificent
He loved it all
A great sense of humanness and comradeship swept over him
These were all his his own kind
It was immense tremendous
He felt melting in the heart of him and he would have liked to shake hands with them all at once to gather them to his breast in one mighty embrace
He drew a deep breath and cried The winner pays and Im the winner aint I
Surge up youall Malemutes and Siwashes and name your poison
Theres your Dyea mail straight from Salt Water and no hornswogglin about it
Cast the lashings adrift youall and wade into it
A dozen pairs of hands were at the sledlashings when the young Le Barge Indian bending at the same task suddenly and limply straightened up
In his eyes was a great surprise
He stared about him wildly for the thing he was undergoing was new to him
He was profoundly struck by an unguessed limitation
He shook as with a palsy and he gave at the knees slowly sinking down to fall suddenly across the sled and to know the smashing blow of darkness across his consciousness
Exhaustion said Daylight
Take him off and put him to bed some of youall
Hes sure a good Indian
Daylights right was Doc Watsons verdict a moment later
The mans plumb tuckered out
The mail was taken charge of the dogs driven away to quarters and fed and Bettles struck up the paean of the sassafras root as they lined up against the long bar to drink and talk and collect their debts
A few minutes later Daylight was whirling around the dancefloor waltzing with the Virgin
He had replaced his parka with his fur cap and blanketcloth coat kicked off his frozen moccasins and was dancing in his stocking feet
After wetting himself to the knees late that afternoon he had run on without changing his footgear and to the knees his long German socks were matted with ice
In the warmth of the room it began to thaw and to break apart in clinging chunks
These chunks rattled together as his legs flew around and every little while they fell clattering to the floor and were slipped upon by the other dancers
But everybody forgave Daylight
He who was one of the few that made the Law in that far land who set the ethical pace and by conduct gave the standard of right and wrong was nevertheless above the Law
He was one of those rare and favored mortals who can do no wrong
What he did had to be right whether others were permitted or not to do the same things
Of course such mortals are so favored by virtue of the fact that they almost always do the right and do it in finer and higher ways than other men
So Daylight an elder hero in that young land and at the same time younger than most of them moved as a creature apart as a man above men as a man who was greatly man and all man
And small wonder it was that the Virgin yielded herself to his arms as they danced dance after dance and was sick at heart at the knowledge that he found nothing in her more than a good friend and an excellent dancer
Small consolation it was to know that he had never loved any woman
She was sick with love of him and he danced with her as he would dance with any woman as he would dance with a man who was a good dancer and upon whose arm was tied a handkerchief to conventionalize him into a woman
One such man Daylight danced with that night
Among frontiersmen it has always been a test of endurance for one man to whirl another down and when Ben Davis the farodealer a gaudy bandanna on his arm got Daylight in a Virginia reel the fun began
The reel broke up and all fell back to watch
Around and around the two men whirled always in the one direction
Word was passed on into the big barroom and bar and gambling tables were deserted
Everybody wanted to see and they packed and jammed the danceroom
The musicians played on and on and on and on the two men whirled
Davis was skilled at the trick and on the Yukon he had put many a strong man on his back
But after a few minutes it was clear that he and not Daylight was going
For a while longer they spun around and then Daylight suddenly stood still released his partner and stepped back reeling himself and fluttering his hands aimlessly as if to support himself against the air
But Davis a giddy smile of consternation on his face gave sideways turned in an attempt to recover balance and pitched headlong to the floor
Still reeling and staggering and clutching at the air with his hands Daylight caught the nearest girl and started on in a waltz
Again he had done the big thing
Weary from two thousand miles over the ice and a run that day of seventy miles he had whirled a fresh man down and that man Ben Davis
Daylight loved the high places and though few high places there were in his narrow experience he had made a point of sitting in the highest he had ever glimpsed
The great world had never heard his name but it was known far and wide in the vast silent North by whites and Indians and Eskimos from Bering Sea to the Passes from the head reaches of remotest rivers to the tundra shore of Point Barrow
Desire for mastery was strong in him and it was all one whether wrestling with the elements themselves with men or with luck in a gambling game
It was all a game life and its affairs
And he was a gambler to the core
Risk and chance were meat and drink
True it was not altogether blind for he applied wit and skill and strength but behind it all was the everlasting Luck the thing that at times turned on its votaries and crushed the wise while it blessed the foolsLuck the thing all men sought and dreamed to conquer
And so he
Deep in his lifeprocesses Life itself sang the siren song of its own majesty ever awhisper and urgent counseling him that he could achieve more than other men win out where they failed ride to success where they perished
It was the urge of Life healthy and strong unaware of frailty and decay drunken with sublime complacence egomad enchanted by its own mighty optimism
And ever in vaguest whisperings and clearest trumpetcalls came the message that sometime somewhere somehow he would run Luck down make himself the master of Luck and tie it and brand it as his own
When he played poker the whisper was of four aces and royal flushes
When he prospected it was of gold in the grassroots gold on bedrock and gold all the way down
At the sharpest hazards of trail and river and famine the message was that other men might die but that he would pull through triumphant
It was the old old lie of Life fooling itself believing itselfimmortal and indestructible bound to achieve over other lives and win to its hearts desire
And so reversing at times Daylight waltzed off his dizziness and led the way to the bar
But a united protest went up
His theory that the winner paid was no longer to be tolerated
It was contrary to custom and common sense and while it emphasized goodfellowship nevertheless in the name of goodfellowship it must cease
The drinks were rightfully on Ben Davis and Ben Davis must buy them
Furthermore all drinks and general treats that Daylight was guilty of ought to be paid by the house for Daylight brought much custom to it whenever he made a night
Bettles was the spokesman and his argument tersely and offensively vernacular was unanimously applauded
Daylight grinned stepped aside to the roulettetable and bought a stack of yellow chips
At the end of ten minutes he weighed in at the scales and two thousand dollars in golddust was poured into his own and an extra sack
Luck a mere flutter of luck but it was his
Elation was added to elation
He was living and the night was his
He turned upon his wellwishing critics
Now the winner sure does pay he said
And they surrendered
There was no withstanding Daylight when he vaulted on the back of life and rode it bitted and spurred
At one in the morning he saw Elijah Davis herding Henry Finn and Joe Hines the lumberjack toward the door
Daylight interfered
Where are youall going
he demanded attempting to draw them to the bar
Bed Elijah Davis answered
He was a lean tobaccochewing New Englander the one daring spirit in his family that had heard and answered the call of the West shouting through the Mount Desert back oddlots
Got to Joe Hines added apologetically
Were mushing out in the mornin
Daylight still detained them
Where to
Whats the excitement
No excitement Elijah explained
Were just agoin to play your hunch an tackle the Upper Country
Dont you want to come along
I sure do Daylight affirmed
But the question had been put in fun and Elijah ignored the acceptance
Were tacklin the Stewart he went on
Al Mayo told me he seen some likely lookin bars first time he come down the Stewart and were goin to sample em while the rivers froze
You listen Daylight an mark my words the times comin when winter digginsll be all the go
Therell be men in them days thatll laugh at our summer stratchin an groundwallerin
At that time winter mining was undreamed of on the Yukon
From the moss and grass the land was frozen to bedrock and frozen gravel hard as granite defied pick and shovel
In the summer the men stripped the earth down as fast as the sun thawed it
Then was the time they did their mining
During the winter they freighted their provisions went moosehunting got all ready for the summers work and then loafed the bleak dark months through in the big central camps such as Circle City and Forty Mile
Winter diggins sure comin Daylight agreed
Wait till that big strike is made up river
Then youallll see a new kind of mining
Whats to prevent woodburning and sinking shafts and drifting along bedrock
Wont need to timber
That frozen muck and gravelll stand till hell is froze and its milltails is turned to icecream
Why theyll be working paystreaks a hundred feet deep in them days thats comin
Im sure going along with youall Elijah
Elijah laughed gathered his two partners up and was making a second attempt to reach the door Hold on Daylight called
I sure mean it
The three men turned back suddenly upon him in their faces surprise delight and incredulity
Gwan youre foolin said Finn the other lumberjack a quiet steady Wisconsin man
Theres my dawgs and sled Daylight answered
Thatll make two teams and halve the loadsthough weallll have to travel easy for a spell for them dawgs is sure tired
The three men were overjoyed but still a trifle incredulous
Now look here Joe Hines blurted out none of your foolin Daylight
We mean business
Will you come
Daylight extended his hand and shook
Then youd best be gettin to bed Elijah advised
Were mushin out at six and four hours sleep is none so long
Mebbe we ought to lay over a day and let him rest up Finn suggested
Daylights pride was touched
No you dont he cried
We all start at six
What time do youall want to be called
Five
All right Ill rouse youall out
You oughter have some sleep Elijah counselled gravely
You cant go on forever
Daylight was tired profoundly tired
Even his iron body acknowledged weariness
Every muscle was clamoring for bed and rest was appalled at continuance of exertion and at thought of the trail again
All this physical protest welled up into his brain in a wave of revolt
But deeper down scornful and defiant was Life itself the essential fire of it whispering that all Daylights fellows were looking on that now was the time to pile deed upon deed to flaunt his strength in the face of strength
It was merely Life whispering its ancient lies
And in league with it was whiskey with all its consummate effrontery and vainglory
Mebbe youall think I aint weaned yet
Daylight demanded
Why I aint had a drink or a dance or seen a soul in two months
Youall get to bed
Ill call youall at five
And for the rest of the night he danced on in his stocking feet and at five in the morning rapping thunderously on the door of his new partners cabin he could be heard singing the song that had given him his name Burning daylight youall Stewart River hunchers
Burning daylight
Burning daylight
Burning daylight
CHAPTER VII This time the trail was easier
It was better packed and they were not carrying mail against time
The days run was shorter and likewise the hours on trail
On his mail run Daylight had played out three Indians but his present partners knew that they must not be played out when they arrived at the Stewart bars so they set the slower pace
And under this milder toil where his companions nevertheless grew weary Daylight recuperated and rested up
At Forty Mile they laid over two days for the sake of the dogs and at Sixty Mile Daylights team was left with the trader
Unlike Daylight after the terrible run from Selkirk to Circle City they had been unable to recuperate on the back trail
So the four men pulled on from Sixty Mile with a fresh team of dogs on Daylights sled
The following night they camped in the cluster of islands at the mouth of the Stewart
Daylight talked town sites and though the others laughed at him he staked the whole maze of high wooded islands
Just supposing the big strike does come on the Stewart he argued
Mebbe youallll be in on it and then again mebbe youall wont
But I sure will
Youalld better reconsider and go in with me on it
But they were stubborn
Youre as bad as Harper and Joe Ladue said Joe Hines
Theyre always at that game
You know that big flat jest below the Klondike and under Moosehide Mountain
Well the recorder at Forty Mile was tellin me they staked that not a month agoThe Harper  Ladue Town Site
Ha
Ha
Ha
Elijah and Finn joined him in his laughter but Daylight was gravely in earnest
There she is
he cried
The hunch is working
Its in the air I tell youall
Whatd theyall stake the big flat for if theyall didnt get the hunch
Wish Id staked it
The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter
Laugh youall laugh
Thats whats the trouble with youall
Youall think goldhunting is the only way to make a stake
But let me tell youall that when the big strike sure does come youallll do a little surfacescratchin and muckraking but danged little youallll have to show for it
Youall laugh at quicksilver in the riffles and think flour gold was manufactured by God Almighty for the express purpose of fooling suckers and chechaquos
Nothing but coarse gold for youall thats your way not getting half of it out of the ground and losing into the tailings half of what youall do get
But the men that land big will be them that stake the town sites organize the tradin companies start the banks Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out
Banks in Alaska
The idea of it was excruciating
Yep and start the stock exchanges Again they were convulsed
Joe Hines rolled over on his sleepingrobe holding his sides
And after them will come the big mining sharks that buy whole creeks where youall have been scratching like a lot of picayune hens and theyall will go to hydraulicking in summer and steamthawing in winter Steamthawing
That was the limit
Daylight was certainly exceeding himself in his consummate funmaking
Steamthawingwhen even woodburning was an untried experiment a dream in the air
Laugh dang you laugh
Why your eyes aint open yet
Youall are a bunch of little mewing kittens
I tell youall if that strike comes on Klondike Harper and Ladue will be millionaires
And if it comes on Stewart youall watch the Elam Harnish town site boom
In them days when youall come around makin poor mouths He heaved a sigh of resignation
Well I suppose Ill have to give youall a grubstake or soup or something or other
Daylight had vision
His scope had been rigidly limited yet whatever he saw he saw big
His mind was orderly his imagination practical and he never dreamed idly
When he superimposed a feverish metropolis on a waste of timbered snowcovered flat he predicated first the goldstrike that made the city possible and next he had an eye for steamboat landings sawmill and warehouse locations and all the needs of a farnorthern mining city
But this in turn was the mere setting for something bigger namely the play of temperament
Opportunities swarmed in the streets and buildings and human and economic relations of the city of his dream
It was a larger table for gambling
The limit was the sky with the Southland on one side and the aurora borealis on the other
The play would be big bigger than any Yukoner had ever imagined and he Burning Daylight would see that he got in on that play
In the meantime there was naught to show for it but the hunch
But it was coming
As he would stake his last ounce on a good poker hand so he staked his life and effort on the hunch that the future held in store a big strike on the Upper River
So he and his three companions with dogs and sleds and snowshoes toiled up the frozen breast of the Stewart toiled on and on through the white wilderness where the unending stillness was never broken by the voices of men the stroke of an ax or the distant crack of a rifle
They alone moved through the vast and frozen quiet little mites of earthmen crawling their score of miles a day melting the ice that they might have water to drink camping in the snow at night their wolfdogs curled in frostrimed hairy bunches their eight snowshoes stuck on end in the snow beside the sleds
No signs of other men did they see though once they passed a rude polingboat cached on a platform by the river bank
Whoever had cached it had never come back for it and they wondered and mushed on
Another time they chanced upon the site of an Indian village but the Indians had disappeared undoubtedly they were on the higher reaches of the Stewart in pursuit of the mooseherds
Two hundred miles up from the Yukon they came upon what Elijah decided were the bars mentioned by Al Mayo
A permanent camp was made their outfit of food cached on a high platform to keep it from the dogs and they started work on the bars cutting their way down to gravel through the rim of ice
It was a hard and simple life
Breakfast over and they were at work by the first gray light and when night descended they did their cooking and campchores smoked and yarned for a while then rolled up in their sleepingrobes and slept while the aurora borealis flamed overhead and the stars leaped and danced in the great cold
Their fare was monotonous sourdough bread bacon beans and an occasional dish of rice cooked along with a handful of prunes
Fresh meat they failed to obtain
There was an unwonted absence of animal life
At rare intervals they chanced upon the trail of a snowshoe rabbit or an ermine but in the main it seemed that all life had fled the land
It was a condition not unknown to them for in all their experience at one time or another they had travelled one year through a region teeming with game where a year or two or three years later no game at all would be found
Gold they found on the bars but not in paying quantities
Elijah while on a hunt for moose fifty miles away had panned the surface gravel of a large creek and found good colors
They harnessed their dogs and with light outfits sledded to the place
Here and possibly for the first time in the history of the Yukon woodburning in sinking a shaft was tried
It was Daylights initiative
After clearing away the moss and grass a fire of dry spruce was built
Six hours of burning thawed eight inches of muck
Their picks drove full depth into it and when they had shoveled out another fire was started
They worked early and late excited over the success of the experiment
Six feet of frozen muck brought them to gravel likewise frozen
Here progress was slower
But they learned to handle their fires better and were soon able to thaw five and six inches at a burning
Flour gold was in this gravel and after two feet it gave away again to muck
At seventeen feet they struck a thin streak of gravel and in it coarse gold testpans running as high as six and eight dollars
Unfortunately this streak of gravel was not more than an inch thick
Beneath it was more muck tangled with the trunks of ancient trees and containing fossil bones of forgotten monsters
But gold they had foundcoarse gold and what more likely than that the big deposit would be found on bedrock
Down to bedrock they would go if it were forty feet away
They divided into two shifts working day and night on two shafts and the smoke of their burning rose continually
It was at this time that they ran short of beans and that Elijah was despatched to the main camp to bring up more grub
Elijah was one of the hardbitten oldtime travelers himself
The round trip was a hundred miles but he promised to be back on the third day one day going light two days returning heavy
Instead he arrived on the night of the second day
They had just gone to bed when they heard him coming
What in hells the matter now
Henry Finn demanded as the empty sled came into the circle of firelight and as he noted that Elijahs long serious face was longer and even more serious
Joe Hines threw wood on the fire and the three men wrapped in their robes huddled up close to the warmth
Elijahs whiskered face was matted with ice as were his eyebrows so that what of his fur garb he looked like a New England caricature of Father Christmas
You recollect that big spruce that held up the corner of the cache next to the river
Elijah began
The disaster was quickly told
The big tree with all the seeming of hardihood promising to stand for centuries to come had suffered from a hidden decay
In some way its rooted grip on the earth had weakened
The added burden of the cache and the winter snow had been too much for it the balance it had so long maintained with the forces of its environment had been overthrown it had toppled and crashed to the ground wrecking the cache and in turn overthrowing the balance with environment that the four men and eleven dogs had been maintaining
Their supply of grub was gone
The wolverines had got into the wrecked cache and what they had not eaten they had destroyed
They plumb et all the bacon and prunes and sugar and dogfood Elijah reported and gosh darn my buttons if they didnt gnaw open the sacks and scatter the flour and beans and rice from Dan to Beersheba
I found empty sacks where theyd dragged them a quarter of a mile away
Nobody spoke for a long minute
It was nothing less than a catastrophe in the dead of an Arctic winter and in a gameabandoned land to lose their grub
They were not panicstricken but they were busy looking the situation squarely in the face and considering
Joe Hines was the first to speak
We can pan the snow for the beans and rice though there want moren eight or ten pounds of rice left
And somebody will have to take a team and pull for Sixty Mile Daylight said next
Ill go said Finn
They considered a while longer
But how are we going to feed the other team and three men till he gets back
Hines demanded
Only one thing to it was Elijahs contribution
Youll have to take the other team Joe and pull up the Stewart till you find them Indians
Then you come back with a load of meat
Youll get here long before Henry can make it from Sixty Mile and while youre gone therell only be Daylight and me to feed and well feed good and small
And in the morning weallll pull for the cache and pan snow to find what grub weve got
Daylight lay back as he spoke and rolled in his robe to sleep then added Better turn in for an early start
Two of you can take the dogs down
Elijah and mell skin out on both sides and see if weall can scare up a moose on the way down
CHAPTER VIII No time was lost
Hines and Finn with the dogs already on short rations were two days in pulling down
At noon of the third day Elijah arrived reporting no moose sign
That night Daylight came in with a similar report
As fast as they arrived the men had started careful panning of the snow all around the cache
It was a large task for they found stray beans fully a hundred yards from the cache
One more day all the men toiled
The result was pitiful and the four showed their caliber in the division of the few pounds of food that had been recovered
Little as it was the lions share was left with Daylight and Elijah
The men who pulled on with the dogs one up the Stewart and one down would come more quickly to grub
The two who remained would have to last out till the others returned
Furthermore while the dogs on several ounces each of beans a day would travel slowly nevertheless the men who travelled with them on a pinch would have the dogs themselves to eat
But the men who remained when the pinch came would have no dogs
It was for this reason that Daylight and Elijah took the more desperate chance
They could not do less nor did they care to do less
The days passed and the winter began merging imperceptibly into the Northland spring that comes like a thunderbolt of suddenness
It was the spring of 1896 that was preparing
Each day the sun rose farther east of south remained longer in the sky and set farther to the west
March ended and April began and Daylight and Elijah lean and hungry wondered what had become of their two comrades
Granting every delay and throwing in generous margins for good measure the time was long since passed when they should have returned
Without doubt they had met with disaster
The party had considered the possibility of disaster for one man and that had been the principal reason for despatching the two in different directions
But that disaster should have come to both of them was the final blow
In the meantime hoping against hope Daylight and Elija eked out a meagre existence
The thaw had not yet begun so they were able to gather the snow about the ruined cache and melt it in pots and pails and gold pans
Allowed to stand for a while when poured off a thin deposit of slime was found on the bottoms of the vessels
This was the flour the infinitesimal trace of it scattered through thousands of cubic yards of snow
Also in this slime occurred at intervals a watersoaked tealeaf or coffeeground and there were in it fragments of earth and litter
But the farther they worked away from the site of the cache the thinner became the trace of flour the smaller the deposit of slime
Elijah was the older man and he weakened first so that he came to lie up most of the time in his furs
An occasional tree squirrel kept them alive
The hunting fell upon Daylight and it was hard work
With but thirty rounds of ammunition he dared not risk a miss and since his rifle was a 4590 he was compelled to shoot the small creatures through the head
There were very few of them and days went by without seeing one
When he did see one he took infinite precautions
He would stalk it for hours
A score of times with arms that shook from weakness he would draw a sight on the animal and refrain from pulling the trigger
His inhibition was a thing of iron
He was the master
Not til absolute certitude was his did he shoot
No matter how sharp the pangs of hunger and desire for that palpitating morsel of chattering life he refused to take the slightest risk of a miss
He born gambler was gambling in the bigger way
His life was the stake his cards were the cartridges and he played as only a big gambler could play with infinite precaution with infinite consideration
Each shot meant a squirrel and though days elapsed between shots it never changed his method of play
Of the squirrels nothing was lost
Even the skins were boiled to make broth the bones pounded into fragments that could be chewed and swallowed
Daylight prospected through the snow and found occasional patches of mossberries
At the best mossberries were composed practically of seeds and water with a tough rind of skin about them but the berries he found were of the preceding year dry and shrivelled and the nourishment they contained verged on the minus quality
Scarcely better was the bark of young saplings stewed for an hour and swallowed after prodigious chewing
April drew toward its close and spring smote the land
The days stretched out their length
Under the heat of the sun the snow began to melt while from down under the snow arose the trickling of tiny streams
For twentyfour hours the Chinook wind blew and in that twentyfour hours the snow was diminished fully a foot in depth
In the late afternoons the melting snow froze again so that its surface became ice capable of supporting a mans weight
Tiny white snowbirds appeared from the south lingered a day and resumed their journey into the north
Once high in the air looking for open water and ahead of the season a wedged squadron of wild geese honked northwards
And down by the river bank a clump of dwarf willows burst into bud
These young buds stewed seemed to posess an encouraging nutrition
Elijah took heart of hope though he was cast down again when Daylight failed to find another clump of willows
The sap was rising in the trees and daily the trickle of unseen streamlets became louder as the frozen land came back to life
But the river held in its bonds of frost
Winter had been long months in riveting them and not in a day were they to be broken not even by the thunderbolt of spring
May came and stray lastyears mosquitoes fullgrown but harmless crawled out of rock crevices and rotten logs
Crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
And still the river held
By May tenth the ice of the Stewart with a great rending and snapping tore loose from the banks and rose three feet
But it did not go downstream
The lower Yukon up to where the Stewart flowed into it must first break and move on
Until then the ice of the Stewart could only rise higher and higher on the increasing flood beneath
When the Yukon would break was problematical
Two thousand miles away it flowed into Bering Sea and it was the ice conditions of Bering Sea that would determine when the Yukon could rid itself of the millions of tons of ice that cluttered its breast
On the twelfth of May carrying their sleepingrobes a pail an ax and the precious rifle the two men started down the river on the ice
Their plan was to gain to the cached polingboat they had seen so that at the first open water they could launch it and drift with the stream to Sixty Mile
In their weak condition without food the going was slow and difficult
Elijah developed a habit of falling down and being unable to rise
Daylight gave of his own strength to lift him to his feet whereupon the older man would stagger automatically on until he stumbled and fell again
On the day they should have reached the boat Elijah collapsed utterly
When Daylight raised him he fell again
Daylight essayed to walk with him supporting him but such was Daylights own weakness that they fell together
Dragging Elijah to the bank a rude camp was made and Daylight started out in search of squirrels
It was at this time that he likewise developed the falling habit
In the evening he found his first squirrel but darkness came on without his getting a certain shot
With primitive patience he waited till next day and then within the hour the squirrel was his
The major portion he fed to Elijah reserving for himself the tougher parts and the bones
But such is the chemistry of life that this small creature this trifle of meat that moved by being eaten transmuted to the meat of the men the same power to move
No longer did the squirrel run up spruce trees leap from branch to branch or cling chattering to giddy perches
Instead the same energy that had done these things flowed into the wasted muscles and reeling wills of the men making them movenay moving themtill they tottered the several intervening miles to the cached boat underneath which they fell together and lay motionless a long time
Light as the task would have been for a strong man to lower the small boat to the ground it took Daylight hours
And many hours more day by day he dragged himself around it lying on his side to calk the gaping seams with moss
Yet when this was done the river still held
Its ice had risen many feet but would not start downstream
And one more task waited the launching of the boat when the river ran water to receive it
Vainly Daylight staggered and stumbled and fell and crept through the snow that was wet with thaw or across it when the nights frost still crusted it beyond the weight of a man searching for one more squirrel striving to achieve one more transmutation of furry leap and scolding chatter into the lifts and tugs of a mans body that would hoist the boat over the rim of shoreice and slide it down into the stream
Not till the twentieth of May did the river break
The downstream movement began at five in the morning and already were the days so long that Daylight sat up and watched the icerun
Elijah was too far gone to be interested in the spectacle
Though vaguely conscious he lay without movement while the ice tore by great cakes of it caroming against the bank uprooting trees and gouging out earth by hundreds of tons
All about them the land shook and reeled from the shock of these tremendous collisions
At the end of an hour the run stopped
Somewhere below it was blocked by a jam
Then the river began to rise lifting the ice on its breast till it was higher than the bank
From behind ever more water bore down and ever more millions of tons of ice added their weight to the congestion
The pressures and stresses became terrific
Huge cakes of ice were squeezed out till they popped into the air like melon seeds squeezed from between the thumb and forefinger of a child while all along the banks a wall of ice was forced up
When the jam broke the noise of grinding and smashing redoubled
For another hour the run continued
The river fell rapidly
But the wall of ice on top the bank and extending down into the falling water remained
The tail of the icerun passed and for the first time in six months Daylight saw open water
He knew that the ice had not yet passed out from the upper reaches of the Stewart that it lay in packs and jams in those upper reaches and that it might break loose and come down in a second run any time but the need was too desperate for him to linger
Elijah was so far gone that he might pass at any moment
As for himself he was not sure that enough strength remained in his wasted muscles to launch the boat
It was all a gamble
If he waited for the second icerun Elijah would surely die and most probably himself
If he succeeded in launching the boat if he kept ahead of the second icerun if he did not get caught by some of the runs from the upper Yukon if luck favored in all these essential particulars as well as in a score of minor ones they would reach Sixty Mile and be saved ifand again the ifhe had strength enough to land the boat at Sixty Mile and not go by
He set to work
The wall of ice was five feet above the ground on which the boat rested
First prospecting for the best launchingplace he found where a huge cake of ice shelved upward from the river that ran fifteen feet below to the top of the wall
This was a score of feet away and at the end of an hour he had managed to get the boat that far
He was sick with nausea from his exertions and at times it seemed that blindness smote him for he could not see his eyes vexed with spots and points of light that were as excruciating as diamonddust his heart pounding up in his throat and suffocating him
Elijah betrayed no interest did not move nor open his eyes and Daylight fought out his battle alone
At last falling on his knees from the shock of exertion he got the boat poised on a secure balance on top the wall
Crawling on hands and knees he placed in the boat his rabbitskin robe the rifle and the pail
He did not bother with the ax
It meant an additional crawl of twenty feet and back and if the need for it should arise he well knew he would be past all need
Elijah proved a bigger task than he had anticipated
A few inches at a time resting in between he dragged him over the ground and up a broken rubble of ice to the side of the boat
But into the boat he could not get him
Elijahs limp body was far more difficult to lift and handle than an equal weight of like dimensions but rigid
Daylight failed to hoist him for the body collapsed at the middle like a partempty sack of corn
Getting into the boat Daylight tried vainly to drag his comrade in after him
The best he could do was to get Elijahs head and shoulders on top the gunwale
When he released his hold to heave from farther down the body Elijah promptly gave at the middle and came down on the ice
In despair Daylight changed his tactics
He struck the other in the face
God Almighty aint youall a man
he cried
There
damn youall
there 
At each curse he struck him on the cheeks the nose the mouth striving by the shock of the hurt to bring back the sinking soul and farwandering will of the man
The eyes fluttered open
Now listen
he shouted hoarsely
When I get your head to the gunwale hang on
Hear me
Hang on
Bite into it with your teeth but HANG ON 
The eyes fluttered down but Daylight knew the message had been received
Again he got the helpless mans head and shoulders on the gunwale
Hang on damn you
Bite in he shouted as he shifted his grip lower down
One weak hand slipped off the gunwale the fingers of the other hand relaxed but Elijah obeyed and his teeth held on
When the lift came his face ground forward and the splintery wood tore and crushed the skin from nose lips and chin and face downward he slipped on and down to the bottom of the boat till his limp middle collapsed across the gunwale and his legs hung down outside
But they were only his legs and Daylight shoved them in after him
Breathing heavily he turned Elijah over on his back and covered him with his robes
The final task remainedthe launching of the boat
This of necessity was the severest of all for he had been compelled to load his comrade in aft of the balance
It meant a supreme effort at lifting
Daylight steeled himself and began
Something must have snapped for though he was unaware of it the next he knew he was lying doubled on his stomach across the sharp stern of the boat
Evidently and for the first time in his life he had fainted
Furthermore it seemed to him that he was finished that he had not one more movement left in him and that strangest of all he did not care
Visions came to him clearcut and real and concepts sharp as steel cuttingedges
He who all his days had looked on naked Life had never seen so much of Lifes nakedness before
For the first time he experienced a doubt of his own glorious personality
For the moment Life faltered and forgot to lie
After all he was a little earthmaggot just like all the other earthmaggots like the squirrel he had eaten like the other men he had seen fail and die like Joe Hines and Henry Finn who had already failed and were surely dead like Elijah lying there uncaring with his skinned face in the bottom of the boat
Daylights position was such that from where he lay he could look up river to the bend around which sooner or later the next icerun would come
And as he looked he seemed to see back through the past to a time when neither white man nor Indian was in the land and ever he saw the same Stewart River winter upon winter breasted with ice and spring upon spring bursting that ice asunder and running free
And he saw also into an illimitable future when the last generations of men were gone from off the face of Alaska when he too would be gone and he saw ever remaining that river freezing and fresheting and running on and on
Life was a liar and a cheat
It fooled all creatures
It had fooled him Burning Daylight one of its chiefest and most joyous exponents
He was nothinga mere bunch of flesh and nerves and sensitiveness that crawled in the muck for gold that dreamed and aspired and gambled and that passed and was gone
Only the dead things remained the things that were not flesh and nerves and sensitiveness the sand and muck and gravel the stretching flats the mountains the river itself freezing and breaking year by year down all the years
When all was said and done it was a scurvy game
The dice were loaded
Those that died did not win and all died
Who won
Not even Life the stoolpigeon the archcapper for the gameLife the ever flourishing graveyard the everlasting funeral procession
He drifted back to the immediate present for a moment and noted that the river still ran wide open and that a moosebird perched on the bow of the boat was surveying him impudently
Then he drifted dreamily back to his meditations
There was no escaping the end of the game
He was doomed surely to be out of it all
And what of it
He pondered that question again and again
Conventional religion had passed Daylight by
He had lived a sort of religion in his square dealing and right playing with other men and he had not indulged in vain metaphysics about future life
Death ended all
He had always believed that and been unafraid
And at this moment the boat fifteen feet above the water and immovable himself fainting with weakness and without a particle of strength left in him he still believed that death ended all and he was still unafraid
His views were too simply and solidly based to be overthrown by the first squirm or the last of deathfearing life
He had seen men and animals die and into the field of his vision by scores came such deaths
He saw them over again just as he had seen them at the time and they did not shake him
What of it
They were dead and dead long since
They werent bothering about it
They werent lying on their bellies across a boat and waiting to die
Death was easyeasier than he had ever imagined and now that it was near the thought of it made him glad
A new vision came to him
He saw the feverish city of his dreamthe gold metropolis of the North perched above the Yukon on a high earthbank and farspreading across the flat
He saw the river steamers tied to the bank and lined against it three deep he saw the sawmills working and the long dogteams with double sleds behind freighting supplies to the diggings
And he saw further the gamblinghouses banks stockexchanges and all the gear and chips and markers the chances and opportunities of a vastly bigger gambling game than any he had ever seen
It was sure hell he thought with the hunch aworking and that big strike coming to be out of it all
Life thrilled and stirred at the thought and once more began uttering his ancient lies
Daylight rolled over and off the boat leaning against it as he sat on the ice
He wanted to be in on that strike
And why shouldnt he
Somewhere in all those wasted muscles of his was enough strength if he could gather it all at once to upend the boat and launch it
Quite irrelevantly the idea suggested itself of buying a share in the Klondike town site from Harper and Joe Ladue
They would surely sell a third interest cheap
Then if the strike came on the Stewart he would be well in on it with the Elam Harnish town site if on the Klondike he would not be quite out of it
In the meantime he would gather strength
He stretched out on the ice full length face downward and for half an hour he lay and rested
Then he arose shook the flashing blindness from his eyes and took hold of the boat
He knew his condition accurately
If the first effort failed the following efforts were doomed to fail
He must pull all his rallied strength into the one effort and so thoroughly must he put all of it in that there would be none left for other attempts
He lifted and he lifted with the soul of him as well as with the body consuming himself body and spirit in the effort
The boat rose
He thought he was going to faint but he continued to lift
He felt the boat give as it started on its downward slide
With the last shred of his strength he precipitated himself into it landing in a sick heap on Elijahs legs
He was beyond attempting to rise and as he lay he heard and felt the boat take the water
By watching the treetops he knew it was whirling
A smashing shock and flying fragments of ice told him that it had struck the bank
A dozen times it whirled and struck and then it floated easily and free
Daylight came to and decided he had been asleep
The sun denoted that several hours had passed
It was early afternoon
He dragged himself into the stern and sat up
The boat was in the middle of the stream
The wooded banks with their baselines of flashing ice were slipping by
Near him floated a huge uprooted pine
A freak of the current brought the boat against it
Crawling forward he fastened the painter to a root
The tree deeper in the water was travelling faster and the painter tautened as the boat took the tow
Then with a last giddy look around wherein he saw the banks tilting and swaying and the sun swinging in pendulumsweep across the sky Daylight wrapped himself in his rabbitskin robe lay down in the bottom and fell asleep
When he awoke it was dark night
He was lying on his back and he could see the stars shining
A subdued murmur of swollen waters could be heard
A sharp jerk informed him that the boat swerving slack into the painter had been straightened out by the swiftermoving pine tree
A piece of stray driftice thumped against the boat and grated along its side
Well the following jam hadnt caught him yet was his thought as he closed his eyes and slept again
It was bright day when next he opened his eyes
The sun showed it to be midday
A glance around at the faraway banks and he knew that he was on the mighty Yukon
Sixty Mile could not be far away
He was abominably weak
His movements were slow fumbling and inaccurate accompanied by panting and headswimming as he dragged himself into a sittingup position in the stern his rifle beside him
He looked a long time at Elijah but could not see whether he breathed or not and he was too immeasurably far away to make an investigation
He fell to dreaming and meditating again dreams and thoughts being often broken by sketches of blankness wherein he neither slept nor was unconscious nor was aware of anything
It seemed to him more like cogs slipping in his brain
And in this intermittent way he reviewed the situation
He was still alive and most likely would be saved but how came it that he was not lying dead across the boat on top the icerim
Then he recollected the great final effort he had made
But why had he made it
he asked himself
It had not been fear of death
He had not been afraid that was sure
Then he remembered the hunch and the big strike he believed was coming and he knew that the spur had been his desire to sit in for a hand at that big game
And again why
What if he made his million
He would die just the same as those that never won more than grubstakes
Then again why
But the blank stretches in his thinking process began to come more frequently and he surrendered to the delightful lassitude that was creeping over him
He roused with a start
Something had whispered in him that he must awake
Abruptly he saw Sixty Mile not a hundred feet away
The current had brought him to the very door
But the same current was now sweeping him past and on into the downriver wilderness
No one was in sight
The place might have been deserted save for the smoke he saw rising from the kitchen chimney
He tried to call but found he had no voice left
An unearthly guttural hiss alternately rattled and wheezed in his throat
He fumbled for the rifle got it to his shoulder and pulled the trigger
The recoil of the discharge tore through his frame racking it with a thousand agonies
The rifle had fallen across his knees and an attempt to lift it to his shoulder failed
He knew he must be quick and felt that he was fainting so he pulled the trigger of the gun where it lay
This time it kicked off and overboard
But just before darkness rushed over him he saw the kitchen door open and a woman look out of the big log house that was dancing a monstrous jig among the trees
CHAPTER IX Ten days later Harper and Joe Ladue arrived at Sixty Mile and Daylight still a trifle weak but strong enough to obey the hunch that had come to him traded a third interest in his Stewart town site for a third interest in theirs on the Klondike
They had faith in the Upper Country and Harper left downstream with a raftload of supplies to start a small post at the mouth of the Klondike
Why dont you tackle Indian River Daylight
Harper advised at parting
Theres whole slathers of creeks and draws draining in up there and somewhere gold just crying to be found
Thats my hunch
Theres a big strike coming and Indian River aint going to be a million miles away
And the place is swarming with moose Joe Ladue added
Bob Hendersons up there somewhere been there three years now swearing something big is going to happen living offn straight moose and prospecting around like a crazy man
Daylight decided to go Indian River a flutter as he expressed it but Elijah could not be persuaded into accompanying him
Elijahs soul had been seared by famine and he was obsessed by fear of repeating the experience
I jest cant bear to separate from grub he explained
I know its downright foolishness but I jest cant help it
Its all I can do to tear myself away from the table when I know Im full to bustin and aint got storage for another bite
Im going back to Circle to camp by a cache until I get cured
Daylight lingered a few days longer gathering strength and arranging his meagre outfit
He planned to go in light carrying a pack of seventyfive pounds and making his five dogs pack as well Indian fashion loading them with thirty pounds each
Depending on the report of Ladue he intended to follow Bob Hendersons example and live practically on straight meat
When Jack Kearns scow laden with the sawmill from Lake Linderman tied up at Sixty Mile Daylight bundled his outfit and dogs on board turned his townsite application over to Elijah to be filed and the same day was landed at the mouth of Indian River
Forty miles up the river at what had been described to him as Quartz Creek he came upon signs of Bob Hendersons work and also at Australia Creek thirty miles farther on
The weeks came and went but Daylight never encountered the other man
However he found moose plentiful and he and his dogs prospered on the meat diet
He found pay that was no more than wages on a dozen surface bars and from the generous spread of flour gold in the muck and gravel of a score of creeks he was more confident than ever that coarse gold in quantity was waiting to be unearthed
Often he turned his eyes to the northward ridge of hills and pondered if the gold came from them
In the end he ascended Dominion Creek to its head crossed the divide and came down on the tributary to the Klondike that was later to be called Hunker Creek
While on the divide had he kept the big dome on his right he would have come down on the Gold Bottom so named by Bob Henderson whom he would have found at work on it taking out the first paygold ever panned on the Klondike
Instead Daylight continued down Hunker to the Klondike and on to the summer fishing camp of the Indians on the Yukon
Here for a day he camped with Carmack a squawman and his Indian brotherinlaw Skookum Jim bought a boat and with his dogs on board drifted down the Yukon to Forty Mile
August was drawing to a close the days were growing shorter and winter was coming on
Still with unbounded faith in his hunch that a strike was coming in the Upper Country his plan was to get together a party of four or five and if that was impossible at least a partner and to pole back up the river before the freezeup to do winter prospecting
But the men of Forty Mile were without faith
The diggings to the westward were good enough for them
Then it was that Carmack his brotherinlaw Skookum Jim and Cultus Charlie another Indian arrived in a canoe at Forty Mile went straight to the gold commissioner and recorded three claims and a discovery claim on Bonanza Creek
After that in the Sourdough Saloon that night they exhibited coarse gold to the sceptical crowd
Men grinned and shook their heads
They had seen the motions of a gold strike gone through before
This was too patently a scheme of Harpers and Joe Ladues trying to entice prospecting in the vicinity of their town site and trading post
And who was Carmack
A squawman
And who ever heard of a squawman striking anything
And what was Bonanza Creek
Merely a moose pasture entering the Klondike just above its mouth and known to oldtimers as Rabbit Creek
Now if Daylight or Bob Henderson had recorded claims and shown coarse gold theyd known there was something in it
But Carmack the squawman
And Skookum Jim
And Cultus Charlie
No no that was asking too much
Daylight too was sceptical and this despite his faith in the Upper Country
Had he not only a few days before seen Carmack loafing with his Indians and with never a thought of prospecting
But at eleven that night sitting on the edge of his bunk and unlacing his moccasins a thought came to him
He put on his coat and hat and went back to the Sourdough
Carmack was still there flashing his coarse gold in the eyes of an unbelieving generation
Daylight ranged alongside of him and emptied Carmacks sack into a blower
This he studied for a long time
Then from his own sack into another blower he emptied several ounces of Circle City and Forty Mile gold
Again for a long time he studied and compared
Finally he pocketed his own gold returned Carmacks and held up his hand for silence
Boys I want to tell youall something he said
Shes sure comethe upriver strike
And I tell youall clear and forcible this is it
There aint never been gold like that in a blower in this country before
Its new gold
Its got more silver in it
Youall can see it by the color
Carmacks sure made a strike
Whoalls got faith to come along with me
There were no volunteers
Instead laughter and jeers went up
Mebbe you got a town site up there some one suggested
I sure have was the retort and a third interest in Harper and Ladues
And I can see my corner lots selling out for more than your henscratching ever turned up on Birch Creek
Thats all right Daylight one Curly Parson interposed soothingly
Youve got a reputation and we know youre dead sure on the square
But youre as likely as any to be mistook on a flimflam game such as these loafers is putting up
I ask you straight When did Carmack do this here prospecting
You said yourself he was lying in camp fishing salmon along with his Siwash relations and that was only the other day
And Daylight told the truth Carmack interrupted excitedly
And Im telling the truth the gospel truth
I wasnt prospecting
Hadnt no idea of it
But when Daylight pulls out the very same day who drifts in down river on a raftload of supplies but Bob Henderson
Hed come out to Sixty Mile planning to go back up Indian River and portage the grub across the divide between Quartz Creek and Gold Bottom Where in hells Gold Bottom
Curly Parsons demanded
Over beyond Bonanza that was Rabbit Creek the squawman went on
Its a draw of a big creek that runs into the Klondike
Thats the way I went up but I come back by crossing the divide keeping along the crest several miles and dropping down into Bonanza
Come along with me Carmack and get staked says Bob Henderson to me
Ive hit it this time on Gold Bottom
Ive took out fortyfive ounces already
And I went along Skookum Jim and Cultus Charlie too
And we all staked on Gold Bottom
I come back by Bonanza on the chance of finding a moose
Along down Bonanza we stopped and cooked grub
I went to sleep and what does Skookum Jim do but try his hand at prospecting
Hed been watching Henderson you see
He goes right slap up to the foot of a birch tree first pan fills it with dirt and washes out moren a dollar coarse gold
Then he wakes me up and I goes at it
I got two and a half the first lick
Then I named the creek Bonanza staked Discovery and we come here and recorded
He looked about him anxiously for signs of belief but found himself in a circle of incredulous facesall save Daylight who had studied his countenance while he told his story
How much is Harper and Ladue givin you for manufacturing a stampede
some one asked
They dont know nothing about it Carmack answered
I tell you its the God Almightys truth
I washed out three ounces in an hour
And theres the gold Daylight said
I tell youall boys they aint never been gold like that in the blower before
Look at the color of it
A trifle darker Curly Parson said
Most likely Carmacks been carrying a couple of silver dollars along in the same sack
And whats more if theres anything in it why aint Bob Henderson smoking along to record
Hes up on Gold Bottom Carmack explained
We made the strike coming back
A burst of laughter was his reward
Whoallll go pardners with me and pull out in a polingboat tomorrow for this here Bonanza
Daylight asked
No one volunteered
Then whoallll take a job from me cash wages in advance to pole up a thousand pounds of grub
Curly Parsons and another Pat Monahan accepted and with his customary speed Daylight paid them their wages in advance and arranged the purchase of the supplies though he emptied his sack in doing so
He was leaving the Sourdough when he suddenly turned back to the bar from the door
Got another hunch
was the query
I sure have he answered
Flours sure going to be worth what a man will pay for it this winter up on the Klondike
Wholl lend me some money
On the instant a score of the men who had declined to accompany him on the wildgoose chase were crowding about him with proffered goldsacks
How much flour do you want
asked the Alaska Commercial Companys storekeeper
About two ton
The proffered goldsacks were not withdrawn though their owners were guilty of an outrageous burst of merriment
What are you going to do with two tons
the storekeeper demanded
Son Daylight made reply youall aint been in this country long enough to know all its curves
Im going to start a sauerkraut factory and combined dandruff remedy
He borrowed money right and left engaging and paying six other men to bring up the flour in half as many more polingboats
Again his sack was empty and he was heavily in debt
Curly Parsons bowed his head on the bar with a gesture of despair
What gets me he moaned is what youre going to do with it all
Ill tell youall in simple A B C and one two three
Daylight held up one finger and began checking off
Hunch number one a big strike coming in Upper Country
Hunch number two Carmacks made it
Hunch number three aint no hunch at all
Its a cinch
If one and two is right then flour just has to go skyhigh
If Im riding hunches one and two I just got to ride this cinch which is number three
If Im right flourll balance gold on the scales this winter
I tell youall boys when youall got a hunch play it for all its worth
Whats luck good for if youall aint to ride it
And when youall ride it ride like hell
Ive been years in this country just waiting for the right hunch to come along
And here she is
Well Im going to play her thats all
Good night youall good night
CHAPTER X Still men were without faith in the strike
When Daylight with his heavy outfit of flour arrived at the mouth of the Klondike he found the big flat as desolate and tenantless as ever
Down close by the river Chief Isaac and his Indians were camped beside the frames on which they were drying salmon
Several oldtimers were also in camp there
Having finished their summer work on Ten Mile Creek they had come down the Yukon bound for Circle City
But at Sixty Mile they had learned of the strike and stopped off to look over the ground
They had just returned to their boat when Daylight landed his flour and their report was pessimistic
Damned moosepasture quoth one Long Jim Harney pausing to blow into his tin mug of tea
Dont you have nothin to do with it Daylight
Its a blamed rotten sell
Theyre just going through the motions of a strike
Harper and Ladues behind it and Carmacks the stoolpigeon
Whoever heard of mining a moosepasture half a mile between rimrock and God alone knows how far to bedrock
Daylight nodded sympathetically and considered for a space
Did youall pan any
he asked finally
Pan hell
was the indignant answer
Think I was born yesterday
Only a chechaquod fool around that pasture long enough to fill a pan of dirt
You dont catch me at any such foolishness
One look was enough for me
Were pulling on in the morning for Circle City
I aint never had faith in this Upper Country
Headreaches of the Tanana is good enough for me from now on and mark my words when the big strike comes shell come down river
Johnny here staked a couple of miles below Discovery but he dont know no better
Johnny looked shamefaced
I just did it for fun he explained
Id give my chance in the creek for a pound of Star plug
Ill go you Daylight said promptly
But dont youall come squealing if I take twenty or thirty thousand out of it
Johnny grinned cheerfully
Gimme the tobacco he said
Wish Id staked alongside Long Jim murmured plaintively
It aint too late Daylight replied
But its a twentymile walk there and back
Ill stake it for you tomorrow when I go up Daylight offered
Then you do the same as Johnny
Get the fees from Tim Logan
Hes tending bar in the Sourdough and hell lend it to me
Then fill in your own name transfer to me and turn the papers over to Tim
Me too chimed in the third oldtimer
And for three pounds of Star plug chewing tobacco Daylight bought outright three fivehundredfoot claims on Bonanza
He could still stake another claim in his own name the others being merely transfers
Must say youre almighty brash with your chewin tobacco Long Jim grinned
Got a factory somewheres
Nope but I got a hunch was the retort and I tell youall its cheaper than dirt to ride her at the rate of three plugs for three claims
But an hour later at his own camp Joe Ladue strode in fresh from Bonanza Creek
At first noncommittal over Carmacks strike then later dubious he finally offered Daylight a hundred dollars for his share in the town site
Cash
Daylight queried
Sure
There she is
So saying Ladue pulled out his goldsack
Daylight hefted it absentmindedly and still absentmindedly untied the strings and ran some of the golddust out on his palm
It showed darker than any dust he had ever seen with the exception of Carmacks
He ran the gold back tied the mouth of the sack and returned it to Ladue
I guess youall need it moren I do was Daylights comment
Nope got plenty more the other assured him
Where that come from
Daylight was all innocence as he asked the question and Ladue received the question as stolidly as an Indian
Yet for a swift instant they looked into each others eyes and in that instant an intangible something seemed to flash out from all the body and spirit of Joe Ladue
And it seemed to Daylight that he had caught this flash sensed a secret something in the knowledge and plans behind the others eyes
Youall know the creek bettern me Daylight went on
And if my share in the town sites worth a hundred to youall with what youall know its worth a hundred to me whether I know it or not
Ill give you three hundred Ladue offered desperately
Still the same reasoning
No matter what I dont know its worth to me whatever youall are willing to pay for it
Then it was that Joe Ladue shamelessly gave over
He led Daylight away from the camp and men and told him things in confidence
Shes sure there he said in conclusion
I didnt sluice it or cradle it
I panned it all in that sack yesterday on the rimrock
I tell you you can shake it out of the grassroots
And whats on bedrock down in the bottom of the creek they aint no way of tellin
But shes big I tell you big
Keep it quiet and locate all you can
Its in spots but I wouldnt be none surprised if some of them claims yielded as high as fifty thousand
The only trouble is that its spotted
   A month passed by and Bonanza Creek remained quiet
A sprinkling of men had staked but most of them after staking had gone on down to Forty Mile and Circle City
The few that possessed sufficient faith to remain were busy building log cabins against the coming of winter
Carmack and his Indian relatives were occupied in building a sluice box and getting a head of water
The work was slow for they had to saw their lumber by hand from the standing forest
But farther down Bonanza were four men who had drifted in from up river Dan McGilvary Dave McKay Dave Edwards and Harry Waugh
They were a quiet party neither asking nor giving confidences and they herded by themselves
But Daylight who had panned the spotted rim of Carmacks claim and shaken coarse gold from the grassroots and who had panned the rim at a hundred other places up and down the length of the creek and found nothing was curious to know what lay on bedrock
He had noted the four quiet men sinking a shaft close by the stream and he had heard their whipsaw going as they made lumber for the sluice boxes
He did not wait for an invitation but he was present the first day they sluiced
And at the end of five hours shovelling for one man he saw them take out thirteen ounces and a half of gold
It was coarse gold running from pinheads to a twelvedollar nugget and it had come from off bedrock
The first fall snow was flying that day and the Arctic winter was closing down but Daylight had no eyes for the bleakgray sadness of the dying shortlived summer
He saw his vision coming true and on the big flat was upreared anew his golden city of the snows
Gold had been found on bedrock
That was the big thing
Carmacks strike was assured
Daylight staked a claim in his own name adjoining the three he had purchased with his plug tobacco
This gave him a block of property two thousand feet long and extending in width from rimrock to rimrock
Returning that night to his camp at the mouth of Klondike he found in it Kama the Indian he had left at Dyea
Kama was travelling by canoe bringing in the last mail of the year
In his possession was some two hundred dollars in golddust which Daylight immediately borrowed
In return he arranged to stake a claim for him which he was to record when he passed through Forty Mile
When Kama departed next morning he carried a number of letters for Daylight addressed to all the oldtimers down river in which they were urged to come up immediately and stake
Also Kama carried letters of similar import given him by the other men on Bonanza
It will sure be the goshdangdest stampede that ever was Daylight chuckled as he tried to vision the excited populations of Forty Mile and Circle City tumbling into polingboats and racing the hundreds of miles up the Yukon for he knew that his word would be unquestioningly accepted
With the arrival of the first stampeders Bonanza Creek woke up and thereupon began a longdistance race between unveracity and truth wherein lie no matter how fast men were continually overtaken and passed by truth
When men who doubted Carmacks report of two and a half to the pan themselves panned two and a half they lied and said that they were getting an ounce
And long ere the lie was fairly on its way they were getting not one ounce but five ounces
This they claimed was ten ounces but when they filled a pan of dirt to prove the lie they washed out twelve ounces
And so it went
They continued valiantly to lie but the truth continued to outrun them
One day in December Daylight filled a pan from bed rock on his own claim and carried it into his cabin
Here a fire burned and enabled him to keep water unfrozen in a canvas tank
He squatted over the tank and began to wash Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan
As he imparted to it a circular movement the lighter coarser particles washed out over the edge
At times he combed the surface with his fingers raking out handfuls of gravel
The contents of the pan diminished
As it drew near to the bottom for the purpose of fleeting and tentative examination he gave the pan a sudden sloshing movement emptying it of water
And the whole bottom showed as if covered with butter
Thus the yellow gold flashed up as the muddy water was flirted away
It was goldgolddust coarse gold nuggets large nuggets
He was all alone
He set the pan down for a moment and thought long thoughts
Then he finished the washing and weighed the result in his scales
At the rate of sixteen dollars to the ounce the pan had contained seven hundred and odd dollars
It was beyond anything that even he had dreamed
His fondest anticipations had gone no farther than twenty or thirty thousand dollars to a claim but here were claims worth half a million each at the least even if they were spotted
He did not go back to work in the shaft that day nor the next nor the next
Instead capped and mittened a light stampeding outfit including his rabbit skin robe strapped on his back he was out and away on a manydays tramp over creeks and divides inspecting the whole neighboring territory
On each creek he was entitled to locate one claim but he was chary in thus surrendering up his chances
On Hunker Creek only did he stake a claim
Bonanza Creek he found staked from mouth to source while every little draw and pup and gulch that drained into it was likewise staked
Little faith was had in these sidestreams
They had been staked by the hundreds of men who had failed to get in on Bonanza
The most popular of these creeks was Adams
The one least fancied was Eldorado which flowed into Bonanza just above Karmacks Discovery claim
Even Daylight disliked the looks of Eldorado but still riding his hunch he bought a half share in one claim on it for half a sack of flour
A month later he paid eight hundred dollars for the adjoining claim
Three months later enlarging this block of property he paid forty thousand for a third claim and though it was concealed in the future he was destined not long after to pay one hundred and fifty thousand for a fourth claim on the creek that had been the least liked of all the creeks
In the meantime and from the day he washed seven hundred dollars from a single pan and squatted over it and thought a long thought he never again touched hand to pick and shovel
As he said to Joe Ladue the night of that wonderful washing Joe I aint never going to work hard again
Heres where I begin to use my brains
Im going to farm gold
Gold will grow gold if youall have the savvee and can get hold of some for seed
When I seen them seven hundred dollars in the bottom of the pan I knew I had the seed at last
Where are you going to plant it
Joe Ladue had asked
And Daylight with a wave of his hand definitely indicated the whole landscape and the creeks that lay beyond the divides
There she is he said and youall just watch my smoke
Theres millions here for the man who can see them
And I seen all them millions this afternoon when them seven hundred dollars peeped up at me from the bottom of the pan and chirruped Well if here aint Burning Daylight come at last
CHAPTER XI The hero of the Yukon in the younger days before the Carmack strike Burning Daylight now became the hero of the strike
The story of his hunch and how he rode it was told up and down the land
Certainly he had ridden it far and away beyond the boldest for no five of the luckiest held the value in claims that he held
And furthermore he was still riding the hunch and with no diminution of daring
The wise ones shook their heads and prophesied that he would lose every ounce he had won
He was speculating they contended as if the whole country was made of gold and no man could win who played a placer strike in that fashion
On the other hand his holdings were reckoned as worth millions and there were men so sanguine that they held the man a fool who coppered6 any bet Daylight laid
Behind his magnificent freehandedness and careless disregard for money were hard practical judgment imagination and vision and the daring of the big gambler
He foresaw what with his own eyes he had never seen and he played to win much or lose all
6 To copper a term in faro meaning to play a card to lose
Theres too much gold here in Bonanza to be just a pocket he argued
Its sure come from a motherlode somewhere and other creeks will show up
Youall keep your eyes on Indian River
The creeks that drain that side the Klondike watershed are just as likely to have gold as the creeks that drain this side
And he backed this opinion to the extent of grubstaking half a dozen parties of prospectors across the big divide into the Indian River region
Other men themselves failing to stake on lucky creeks he put to work on his Bonanza claims
And he paid them wellsixteen dollars a day for an eighthour shift and he ran three shifts
He had grub to start them on and when on the last water the Bella arrived loaded with provisions he traded a warehouse site to Jack Kearns for a supply of grub that lasted all his men through the winter of 1896
And that winter when famine pinched and flour sold for two dollars a pound he kept three shifts of men at work on all four of the Bonanza claims
Other mineowners paid fifteen dollars a day to their men but he had been the first to put men to work and from the first he paid them a full ounce a day
One result was that his were picked men and they more than earned their higher pay
One of his wildest plays took place in the early winter after the freezeup
Hundreds of stampeders after staking on other creeks than Bonanza had gone on disgruntled down river to Forty Mile and Circle City
Daylight mortgaged one of his Bonanza dumps with the Alaska Commercial Company and tucked a letter of credit into his pouch
Then he harnessed his dogs and went down on the ice at a pace that only he could travel
One Indian down another Indian back and four teams of dogs was his record
And at Forty Mile and Circle City he bought claims by the score
Many of these were to prove utterly worthless but some few of them were to show up more astoundingly than any on Bonanza
He bought right and left paying as low as fifty dollars and as high as five thousand
This highest one he bought in the Tivoli Saloon
It was an upper claim on Eldorado and when he agreed to the price Jacob Wilkins an oldtimer just returned from a look at the moosepasture got up and left the room saying Daylight Ive known you seven year and youve always seemed sensible till now
And now youre just letting them rob you right and left
Thats what it isrobbery
Five thousand for a claim on that damned moosepasture is bunco
I just cant stay in the room and see you buncoed that way
I tell youall Daylight answered Wilkins Carmacks strikes so big that weall cant see it all
Its a lottery
Every claim I buy is a ticket
And theres sure going to be some capital prizes
Jacob Wilkins standing in the open door sniffed incredulously
Now supposing Wilkins Daylight went on supposing youall knew it was going to rain soup
Whatd youall do
Buy spoons of course
Well Im sure buying spoons
Shes going to rain soup up there on the Klondike and them that has forks wont be catching none of it
But Wilkins here slammed the door behind him and Daylight broke off to finish the purchase of the claim
Back in Dawson though he remained true to his word and never touched hand to pick and shovel he worked as hard as ever in his life
He had a thousand irons in the fire and they kept him busy
Representation work was expensive and he was compelled to travel often over the various creeks in order to decide which claims should lapse and which should be retained
A quartz miner himself in his early youth before coming to Alaska he dreamed of finding the motherlode
A placer camp he knew was ephemeral while a quartz camp abided and he kept a score of men in the quest for months
The motherlode was never found and years afterward he estimated that the search for it had cost him fifty thousand dollars
But he was playing big
Heavy as were his expenses he won more heavily
He took lays bought half shares shared with the men he grubstaked and made personal locations
Day and night his dogs were ready and he owned the fastest teams so that when a stampede to a new discovery was on it was Burning Daylight to the fore through the longest coldest nights till he blazed his stakes next to Discovery
In one way or another to say nothing of the many worthless creeks he came into possession of properties on the good creeks such as Sulphur Dominion Excelsis Siwash Cristo Alhambra and Doolittle
The thousands he poured out flowed back in tens of thousands
Forty Mile men told the story of his two tons of flour and made calculations of what it had returned him that ranged from half a million to a million
One thing was known beyond all doubt namely that the half share in the first Eldorado claim bought by him for a half sack of flour was worth five hundred thousand
On the other hand it was told that when Freda the dancer arrived from over the passes in a Peterborough canoe in the midst of a drive of mushice on the Yukon and when she offered a thousand dollars for ten sacks and could find no sellers he sent the flour to her as a present without ever seeing her
In the same way ten sacks were sent to the lone Catholic priest who was starting the first hospital
His generosity was lavish
Others called it insane
At a time when riding his hunch he was getting half a million for half a sack of flour it was nothing less than insanity to give twenty whole sacks to a dancinggirl and a priest
But it was his way
Money was only a marker
It was the game that counted with him
The possession of millions made little change in him except that he played the game more passionately
Temperate as he had always been save on rare occasions now that he had the wherewithal for unlimited drinks and had daily access to them he drank even less
The most radical change lay in that except when on trail he no longer did his own cooking
A brokendown miner lived in his log cabin with him and now cooked for him
But it was the same food bacon beans flour prunes dried fruits and rice
He still dressed as formerly overalls German socks moccasins flannel shirt fur cap and blanket coat
He did not take up with cigars which cost the cheapest from half a dollar to a dollar each
The same Bull Durham and brownpaper cigarette handrolled contented him
It was true that he kept more dogs and paid enormous prices for them
They were not a luxury but a matter of business
He needed speed in his travelling and stampeding
And by the same token he hired a cook
He was too busy to cook for himself that was all
It was poor business playing for millions to spend time building fires and boiling water
Dawson grew rapidly that winter of 1896
Money poured in on Daylight from the sale of town lots
He promptly invested it where it would gather more
In fact he played the dangerous game of pyramiding and no more perilous pyramiding than in a placer camp could be imagined
But he played with his eyes wide open
Youall just wait till the news of this strike reaches the Outside he told his oldtimer cronies in the Moosehorn Saloon
The news wont get out till next spring
Then theres going to be three rushes
A summer rush of men coming in light a fall rush of men with outfits and a spring rush the next year after that of fifty thousand
Youall wont be able to see the landscape for chechaquos
Well theres the summer and fall rush of 1897 to commence with
What are youall going to do about it
What are you going to do about it
a friend demanded
Nothing he answered
Ive sure already done it
Ive got a dozen gangs strung out up the Yukon getting out logs
Youallll see their rafts coming down after the river breaks
Cabins
They sure will be worth what a man can pay for them next fall
Lumber
It will sure go to top notch
Ive got two sawmills freighting in over the passes
Theyll come down as soon as the lakes open up
And if youall are thinking of needing lumber Ill make youall contracts right nowthree hundred dollars a thousand undressed
Corner lots in desirable locations sold that winter for from ten to thirty thousand dollars
Daylight sent word out over the trails and passes for the newcomers to bring down lografts and as a result the summer of 1897 saw his sawmills working day and night on three shifts and still he had logs left over with which to build cabins
These cabins land included sold at from one to several thousand dollars
Twostory log buildings in the business part of town brought him from forty to fifty thousand dollars apiece
These fresh accretions of capital were immediately invested in other ventures
He turned gold over and over until everything that he touched seemed to turn to gold
But that first wild winter of Carmacks strike taught Daylight many things
Despite the prodigality of his nature he had poise
He watched the lavish waste of the mushroom millionaires and failed quite to understand it
According to his nature and outlook it was all very well to toss an ante away in a nights frolic
That was what he had done the night of the pokergame in Circle City when he lost fifty thousandall that he possessed
But he had looked on that fifty thousand as a mere ante
When it came to millions it was different
Such a fortune was a stake and was not to be sown on barroom floors literally sown flung broadcast out of the moosehide sacks by drunken millionaires who had lost all sense of proportion
There was McMann who ran up a single barroom bill of thirtyeight thousand dollars and Jimmie the Rough who spent one hundred thousand a month for four months in riotous living and then fell down drunk in the snow one March night and was frozen to death and Swiftwater Bill who after spending three valuable claims in an extravagance of debauchery borrowed three thousand dollars with which to leave the country and who out of this sum because the ladylove that had jilted him liked eggs cornered the one hundred and ten dozen eggs on the Dawson market paying twentyfour dollars a dozen for them and promptly feeding them to the wolfdogs
Champagne sold at from forty to fifty dollars a quart and canned oyster stew at fifteen dollars
Daylight indulged in no such luxuries
He did not mind treating a barroom of men to whiskey at fifty cents a drink but there was somewhere in his own extravagant nature a sense of fitness and arithmetic that revolted against paying fifteen dollars for the contents of an oyster can
On the other hand he possibly spent more money in relieving hardluck cases than did the wildest of the new millionaires on insane debauchery
Father Judge of the hospital could have told of far more important donations than that first ten sacks of flour
And oldtimers who came to Daylight invariably went away relieved according to their need
But fifty dollars for a quart of fizzy champagne
That was appalling
And yet he still on occasion made one of his oldtime hellroaring nights
But he did so for different reasons
First it was expected of him because it had been his way in the old days
And second he could afford it
But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion
He had developed in a new way the taste for power
It had become a lust with him
By far the wealthiest miner in Alaska he wanted to be still wealthier
It was a big game he was playing in and he liked it better than any other game
In a way the part he played was creative
He was doing something
And at no time striking another chord of his nature could he take the joy in a milliondollar Eldorado dump that was at all equivalent to the joy he took in watching his two sawmills working and the big down river lografts swinging into the bank in the big eddy just above Moosehide Mountain
Gold even on the scales was after all an abstraction
It represented things and the power to do
But the sawmills were the things themselves concrete and tangible and they were things that were a means to the doing of more things
They were dreams come true hard and indubitable realizations of fairy gossamers
With the summer rush from the Outside came special correspondents for the big newspapers and magazines and one and all using unlimited space they wrote Daylight up so that so far as the world was concerned Daylight loomed the largest figure in Alaska
Of course after several months the world became interested in the Spanish War and forgot all about him but in the Klondike itself Daylight still remained the most prominent figure
Passing along the streets of Dawson all heads turned to follow him and in the saloons chechaquos watched him awesomely scarcely taking their eyes from him as long as he remained in their range of vision
Not alone was he the richest man in the country but he was Burning Daylight the pioneer the man who almost in the midst of antiquity of that young land had crossed the Chilcoot and drifted down the Yukon to meet those elder giants Al Mayo and Jack McQuestion
He was the Burning Daylight of scores of wild adventures the man who carried word to the icebound whaling fleet across the tundra wilderness to the Arctic Sea who raced the mail from Circle to Salt Water and back again in sixty days who saved the whole Tanana tribe from perishing in the winter of 91in short the man who smote the chechaquos imaginations more violently than any other dozen men rolled into one
He had the fatal facility for selfadvertisement
Things he did no matter how adventitious or spontaneous struck the popular imagination as remarkable
And the latest thing he had done was always on mens lips whether it was being first in the heartbreaking stampede to Danish Creek in killing the record baldface grizzly over on Sulphur Creek or in winning the singlepaddle canoe race on the Queens Birthday after being forced to participate at the last moment by the failure of the sourdough representative to appear
Thus one night in the Moosehorn he locked horns with Jack Kearns in the longpromised return game of poker
The sky and eight oclock in the morning were made the limits and at the close of the game Daylights winnings were two hundred and thirty thousand dollars
To Jack Kearns already a severaltimes millionaire this loss was not vital
But the whole community was thrilled by the size of the stakes and each one of the dozen correspondents in the field sent out a sensational article
CHAPTER XII Despite his many sources of revenue Daylights pyramiding kept him pinched for cash throughout the first winter
The paygravel thawed on bedrock and hoisted to the surface immediately froze again
Thus his dumps containing several millions of gold were inaccessible
Not until the returning sun thawed the dumps and melted the water to wash them was he able to handle the gold they contained
And then he found himself with a surplus of gold deposited in the two newly organized banks and he was promptly besieged by men and groups of men to enlist his capital in their enterprises
But he elected to play his own game and he entered combinations only when they were generally defensive or offensive
Thus though he had paid the highest wages he joined the Mineowners Association engineered the fight and effectually curbed the growing insubordination of the wageearners
Times had changed
The old days were gone forever
This was a new era and Daylight the wealthy mineowner was loyal to his class affiliations
It was true the oldtimers who worked for him in order to be saved from the club of the organized owners were made foremen over the gang of chechaquos but this with Daylight was a matter of heart not head
In his heart he could not forget the old days while with his head he played the economic game according to the latest and most practical methods
But outside of such groupcombinations of exploiters he refused to bind himself to any mans game
He was playing a great lone hand and he needed all his money for his own backing
The newly founded stockexchange interested him keenly
He had never before seen such an institution but he was quick to see its virtues and to utilize it
Most of all it was gambling and on many an occasion not necessary for the advancement of his own schemes he as he called it went the stockexchange a flutter out of sheer wantonness and fun
It sure beats faro was his comment one day when after keeping the Dawson speculators in a fever for a week by alternate bulling and bearing he showed his hand and cleaned up what would have been a fortune to any other man
Other men having made their strike had headed south for the States taking a furlough from the grim Arctic battle
But asked when he was going Outside Daylight always laughed and said when he had finished playing his hand
He also added that a man was a fool to quit a game just when a winning hand had been dealt him
It was held by the thousands of heroworshipping chechaquos that Daylight was a man absolutely without fear
But Bettles and Dan MacDonald and other sourdoughs shook their heads and laughed as they mentioned women
And they were right
He had always been afraid of them from the time himself a lad of seventeen when Queen Anne of Juneau made open and ridiculous love to him
For that matter he never had known women
Born in a miningcamp where they were rare and mysterious having no sisters his mother dying while he was an infant he had never been in contact with them
True running away from Queen Anne he had later encountered them on the Yukon and cultivated an acquaintance with themthe pioneer ones who crossed the passes on the trail of the men who had opened up the first diggings
But no lamb had ever walked with a wolf in greater fear and trembling than had he walked with them
It was a matter of masculine pride that he should walk with them and he had done so in fair seeming but women had remained to him a closed book and he preferred a game of solo or sevenup any time
And now known as the King of the Klondike carrying several other royal titles such as Eldorado King Bonanza King the Lumber Baron and the Prince of the Stampeders not to omit the proudest appellation of all namely the Father of the Sourdoughs he was more afraid of women than ever
As never before they held out their arms to him and more women were flocking into the country day by day
It mattered not whether he sat at dinner in the gold commissioners house called for the drinks in a dancehall or submitted to an interview from the woman representative of the New York Sun one and all of them held out their arms
There was one exception and that was Freda the girl that danced and to whom he had given the flour
She was the only woman in whose company he felt at ease for she alone never reached out her arms
And yet it was from her that he was destined to receive next to his severest fright
It came about in the fall of 1897
He was returning from one of his dashes this time to inspect Henderson a creek that entered the Yukon just below the Stewart
Winter had come on with a rush and he fought his way down the Yukon seventy miles in a frail Peterborough canoe in the midst of a run of mushice
Hugging the rimice that had already solidly formed he shot across the icespewing mouth of the Klondike just in time to see a lone man dancing excitedly on the rim and pointing into the water
Next he saw the furclad body of a woman face under sinking in the midst of the driving mushice
A lane opening in the swirl of the current it was a matter of seconds to drive the canoe to the spot reach to the shoulder in the water and draw the woman gingerly to the canoes side
It was Freda
And all might yet have been well with him had she not later when brought back to consciousness blazed at him with angry blue eyes and demanded Why did you
Oh why did you
This worried him
In the nights that followed instead of sinking immediately to sleep as was his wont he lay awake visioning her face and that blue blaze of wrath and conning her words over and over
They rang with sincerity
The reproach was genuine
She had meant just what she said
And still he pondered
The next time he encountered her she had turned away from him angrily and contemptuously
And yet again she came to him to beg his pardon and she dropped a hint of a man somewhere sometimeshe said not howwho had left her with no desire to live
Her speech was frank but incoherent and all he gleaned from it was that the event whatever it was had happened years before
Also he gleaned that she had loved the man
That was the thinglove
It caused the trouble
It was more terrible than frost or famine
Women were all very well in themselves good to look upon and likable but along came this thing called love and they were seared to the bone by it made so irrational that one could never guess what they would do next
This Fredawoman was a splendid creature fullbodied beautiful and nobodys fool but love had come along and soured her on the world driving her to the Klondike and to suicide so compellingly that she was made to hate the man that saved her life
Well he had escaped love so far just as he had escaped smallpox yet there it was as contagious as smallpox and a whole lot worse in running its course
It made men and women do such fearful and unreasonable things
It was like delirium tremens only worse
And if he Daylight caught it he might have it as badly as any of them
It was lunacy stark lunacy and contagious on top of it all
A half dozen young fellows were crazy over Freda
They all wanted to marry her
Yet she in turn was crazy over that some other fellow on the other side of the world and would have nothing to do with them
But it was left to the Virgin to give him his final fright
She was found one morning dead in her cabin
A shot through the head had done it and she had left no message no explanation
Then came the talk
Some wit voicing public opinion called it a case of too much Daylight
She had killed herself because of him
Everybody knew this and said so
The correspondents wrote it up and once more Burning Daylight King of the Klondike was sensationally featured in the Sunday supplements of the United States
The Virgin had straightened up so the featurestories ran and correctly so
Never had she entered a Dawson City dancehall
When she first arrived from Circle City she had earned her living by washing clothes
Next she had bought a sewingmachine and made mens drill parkas fur caps and moosehide mittens
Then she had gone as a clerk into the First Yukon Bank
All this and more was known and told though one and all were agreed that Daylight while the cause had been the innocent cause of her untimely end
And the worst of it was that Daylight knew it was true
Always would he remember that last night he had seen her
He had thought nothing of it at the time but looking back he was haunted by every little thing that had happened
In the light of the tragic event he could understand everythingher quietness that calm certitude as if all vexing questions of living had been smoothed out and were gone and that certain ethereal sweetness about all that she had said and done that had been almost maternal
He remembered the way she had looked at him how she had laughed when he narrated Mickey Dolans mistake in staking the fraction on Skookum Gulch
Her laughter had been lightly joyous while at the same time it had lacked its oldtime robustness
Not that she had been grave or subdued
On the contrary she had been so patently content so filled with peace
She had fooled him fool that he was
He had even thought that night that her feeling for him had passed and he had taken delight in the thought and caught visions of the satisfying future friendship that would be theirs with this perturbing love out of the way
And then when he stood at the door cap in hand and said good night
It had struck him at the time as a funny and embarrassing thing her bending over his hand and kissing it
He had felt like a fool but he shivered now when he looked back on it and felt again the touch of her lips on his hand
She was saying goodby an eternal goodby and he had never guessed
At that very moment and for all the moments of the evening coolly and deliberately as he well knew her way she had been resolved to die
If he had only known it
Untouched by the contagious malady himself nevertheless he would have married her if he had had the slightest inkling of what she contemplated
And yet he knew furthermore that hers was a certain stiffkneed pride that would not have permitted her to accept marriage as an act of philanthropy
There had really been no saving her after all
The lovedisease had fastened upon her and she had been doomed from the first to perish of it
Her one possible chance had been that he too should have caught it
And he had failed to catch it
Most likely if he had it would have been from Freda or some other woman
There was Dartworthy the college man who had staked the rich fraction on Bonanza above Discovery
Everybody knew that old Doolittles daughter Bertha was madly in love with him
Yet when he contracted the disease of all women it had been with the wife of Colonel Walthstone the great Guggenhammer mining expert
Result three lunacy cases Dartworthy selling out his mine for onetenth its value the poor woman sacrificing her respectability and sheltered nook in society to flee with him in an open boat down the Yukon and Colonel Walthstone breathing murder and destruction taking out after them in another open boat
The whole impending tragedy had moved on down the muddy Yukon passing Forty Mile and Circle and losing itself in the wilderness beyond
But there it was love disorganizing mens and womens lives driving toward destruction and death turning topsyturvy everything that was sensible and considerate making bawds or suicides out of virtuous women and scoundrels and murderers out of men who had always been clean and square
For the first time in his life Daylight lost his nerve
He was badly and avowedly frightened
Women were terrible creatures and the lovegerm was especially plentiful in their neighborhood
And they were so reckless so devoid of fear
THEY were not frightened by what had happened to the Virgin
They held out their arms to him more seductively than ever
Even without his fortune reckoned as a mere man just past thirty magnificently strong and equally goodlooking and goodnatured he was a prize for most normal women
But when to his natural excellences were added the romance that linked with his name and the enormous wealth that was his practically every free woman he encountered measured him with an appraising and delighted eye to say nothing of more than one woman who was not free
Other men might have been spoiled by this and led to lose their heads but the only effect on him was to increase his fright
As a result he refused most invitations to houses where women might be met and frequented bachelor boards and the Moosehorn Saloon which had no dancehall attached
CHAPTER XIII Six thousand spent the winter of 1897 in Dawson work on the creeks went on apace while beyond the passes it was reported that one hundred thousand more were waiting for the spring
Late one brief afternoon Daylight on the benches between French Hill and Skookum Hill caught a wider vision of things
Beneath him lay the richest part of Eldorado Creek while up and down Bonanza he could see for miles
It was a scene of a vast devastation
The hills to their tops had been shorn of trees and their naked sides showed signs of goring and perforating that even the mantle of snow could not hide
Beneath him in every direction were the cabins of men
But not many men were visible
A blanket of smoke filled the valleys and turned the gray day to melancholy twilight
Smoke arose from a thousand holes in the snow where deep down on bedrock in the frozen muck and gravel men crept and scratched and dug and ever built more fires to break the grip of the frost
Here and there where new shafts were starting these fires flamed redly
Figures of men crawled out of the holes or disappeared into them or on raised platforms of handhewn timber windlassed the thawed gravel to the surface where it immediately froze
The wreckage of the spring washing appeared everywherepiles of sluiceboxes sections of elevated flumes huge waterwheelsall the debris of an army of goldmad men
Italls plain gophering Daylight muttered aloud
He looked at the naked hills and realized the enormous wastage of wood that had taken place
From this birdseye view he realized the monstrous confusion of their excited workings
It was a gigantic inadequacy
Each worked for himself and the result was chaos
In this richest of diggings it cost out by their feverish unthinking methods another dollar was left hopelessly in the earth
Given another year and most of the claims would be worked out and the sum of the gold taken out would no more than equal what was left behind
Organization was what was needed he decided and his quick imagination sketched Eldorado Creek from mouth to source and from mountain top to mountain top in the hands of one capable management
Even steamthawing as yet untried but bound to come he saw would be a makeshift
What should be done was to hydraulic the valley sides and benches and then on the creek bottom to use golddredges such as he had heard described as operating in California
There was the very chance for another big killing
He had wondered just what was precisely the reason for the Guggenhammers and the big English concerns sending in their highsalaried experts
That was their scheme
That was why they had approached him for the sale of workedout claims and tailings
They were content to let the small mineowners gopher out what they could for there would be millions in the leavings
And gazing down on the smoky inferno of crude effort Daylight outlined the new game he would play a game in which the Guggenhammers and the rest would have to reckon with him
Cut along with the delight in the new conception came a weariness
He was tired of the long Arctic years and he was curious about the Outsidethe great world of which he had heard other men talk and of which he was as ignorant as a child
There were games out there to play
It was a larger table and there was no reason why he with his millions should not sit in and take a hand
So it was that afternoon on Skookum Hill that he resolved to play this last best Klondike hand and pull for the Outside
It took time however
He put trusted agents to work on the heels of great experts and on the creeks where they began to buy he likewise bought
Wherever they tried to corner a workedout creek they found him standing in the way owning blocks of claims or artfully scattered claims that put all their plans to naught
I play youall wide open to winam I right he told them once in a heated conference
Followed wars truces compromises victories and defeats
By 1898 sixty thousand men were on the Klondike and all their fortunes and affairs rocked back and forth and were affected by the battles Daylight fought
And more and more the taste for the larger game urged in Daylights mouth
Here he was already locked in grapples with the great Guggenhammers and winning fiercely winning
Possibly the severest struggle was waged on Ophir the veriest of moosepastures whose lowgrade dirt was valuable only because of its vastness
The ownership of a block of seven claims in the heart of it gave Daylight his grip and they could not come to terms
The Guggenhammer experts concluded that it was too big for him to handle and when they gave him an ultimatum to that effect he accepted and bought them out
The plan was his own but he sent down to the States for competent engineers to carry it out
In the Rinkabilly watershed eighty miles away he built his reservoir and for eighty miles the huge wooden conduit carried the water across country to Ophir
Estimated at three millions the reservoir and conduit cost nearer four
Nor did he stop with this
Electric power plants were installed and his workings were lighted as well as run by electricity
Other sourdoughs who had struck it rich in excess of all their dreams shook their heads gloomily warned him that he would go broke and declined to invest in so extravagant a venture
But Daylight smiled and sold out the remainder of his townsite holdings
He sold at the right time at the height of the placer boom
When he prophesied to his old cronies in the Moosehorn Saloon that within five years town lots in Dawson could not be given away while the cabins would be chopped up for firewood he was laughed at roundly and assured that the motherlode would be found ere that time
But he went ahead when his need for lumber was finished selling out his sawmills as well
Likewise he began to get rid of his scattered holdings on the various creeks and without thanks to any one he finished his conduit built his dredges imported his machinery and made the gold of Ophir immediately accessible
And he who five years before had crossed over the divide from Indian River and threaded the silent wilderness his dogs packing Indian fashion himself living Indian fashion on straight moose meat now heard the hoarse whistles calling his hundreds of laborers to work and watched them toil under the white glare of the arclamps
But having done the thing he was ready to depart
And when he let the word go out the Guggenhammers vied with the English concerns and with a new French company in bidding for Ophir and all its plant
The Guggenhammers bid highest and the price they paid netted Daylight a clean million
It was current rumor that he was worth anywhere from twenty to thirty millions
But he alone knew just how he stood and that with his last claim sold and the table swept clean of his winnings he had ridden his hunch to the tune of just a trifle over eleven millions
His departure was a thing that passed into the history of the Yukon along with his other deeds
All the Yukon was his guest Dawson the seat of the festivity
On that one last night no mans dust save his own was good
Drinks were not to be purchased
Every saloon ran open with extra relays of exhausted bartenders and the drinks were given away
A man who refused this hospitality and persisted in paying found a dozen fights on his hands
The veriest chechaquos rose up to defend the name of Daylight from such insult
And through it all on moccasined feet moved Daylight hellroaring Burning Daylight overspilling with good nature and camaraderie howling his hewolf howl and claiming the night as his bending mens arms down on the bars performing feats of strength his bronzed face flushed with drink his black eyes flashing clad in overalls and blanket coat his earflaps dangling and his gauntleted mittens swinging from the cord across the shoulders
But this time it was neither an ante nor a stake that he threw away but a mere marker in the game that he who held so many markers would not miss
As a night it eclipsed anything that Dawson had ever seen
It was Daylights desire to make it memorable and his attempt was a success
A goodly portion of Dawson got drunk that night
The fall weather was on and though the freezeup of the Yukon still delayed the thermometer was down to twentyfive below zero and falling
Wherefore it was necessary to organize gangs of lifesavers who patrolled the streets to pick up drunken men from where they fell in the snow and where an hours sleep would be fatal
Daylight whose whim it was to make them drunk by hundreds and by thousands was the one who initiated this life saving
He wanted Dawson to have its night but in his deeper processes never careless nor wanton he saw to it that it was a night without accident
And like his olden nights his ukase went forth that there should be no quarrelling nor fighting offenders to be dealt with by him personally
Nor did he have to deal with any
Hundreds of devoted followers saw to it that the evilly disposed were rolled in the snow and hustled off to bed
In the great world where great captains of industry die all wheels under their erstwhile management are stopped for a minute
But in the Klondike such was its hilarious sorrow at the departure of its captain that for twentyfour hours no wheels revolved
Even great Ophir with its thousand men on the payroll closed down
On the day after the night there were no men present or fit to go to work
Next morning at break of day Dawson said goodby
The thousands that lined the bank wore mittens and their earflaps pulled down and tied
It was thirty below zero the rimice was thickening and the Yukon carried a run of mushice
From the deck of the Seattle Daylight waved and called his farewells
As the lines were cast off and the steamer swung out into the current those near him saw the moisture well up in Daylights eyes
In a way it was to him departure from his native land this grim Arctic region which was practically the only land he had known
He tore off his cap and waved it
Goodby youall
he called
Goodby youall
PART II CHAPTER I In no blaze of glory did Burning Daylight descend upon San Francisco
Not only had he been forgotten but the Klondike along with him
The world was interested in other things and the Alaskan adventure like the Spanish War was an old story
Many things had happened since then
Exciting things were happening every day and the sensationspace of newspapers was limited
The effect of being ignored however was an exhilaration
Big man as he had been in the Arctic game it merely showed how much bigger was this new game when a man worth eleven millions and with a history such as his passed unnoticed
He settled down in St Francis Hotel was interviewed by the cubreporters on the hotelrun and received brief paragraphs of notice for twentyfour hours
He grinned to himself and began to look around and get acquainted with the new order of beings and things
He was very awkward and very selfpossessed
In addition to the stiffening afforded his backbone by the conscious ownership of eleven millions he possessed an enormous certitude
Nothing abashed him nor was he appalled by the display and culture and power around him
It was another kind of wilderness that was all and it was for him to learn the ways of it the signs and trails and waterholes where good hunting lay and the bad stretches of field and flood to be avoided
As usual he fought shy of the women
He was still too badly scared to come to close quarters with the dazzling and resplendent creatures his own millions made accessible
They looked and longed but he so concealed his timidity that he had all the seeming of moving boldly among them
Nor was it his wealth alone that attracted them
He was too much a man and too much an unusual type of man
Young yet barely thirtysix eminently handsome magnificently strong almost bursting with a splendid virility his free trailstride never learned on pavements and his black eyes hinting of great spaces and unwearied with the close perspective of the city dwellers drew many a curious and wayward feminine glance
He saw grinned knowingly to himself and faced them as so many dangers with a cool demeanor that was a far greater personal achievement than had they been famine frost or flood
He had come down to the States to play the mans game not the womans game and the men he had not yet learned
They struck him as softsoft physically yet he divined them hard in their dealings but hard under an exterior of supple softness
It struck him that there was something catlike about them
He met them in the clubs and wondered how real was the goodfellowship they displayed and how quickly they would unsheathe their claws and gouge and rend
Thats the proposition he repeated to himself what will theyall do when the play is close and down to brass tacks
He felt unwarrantably suspicious of them
Theyre sure slick was his secret judgment and from bits of gossip dropped now and again he felt his judgment well buttressed
On the other hand they radiated an atmosphere of manliness and the fair play that goes with manliness
They might gouge and rend in a fightwhich was no more than natural but he felt somehow that they would gouge and rend according to rule
This was the impression he got of thema generalization tempered by knowledge that there was bound to be a certain percentage of scoundrels among them
Several months passed in San Francisco during which time he studied the game and its rules and prepared himself to take a hand
He even took private instruction in English and succeeded in eliminating his worst faults though in moments of excitement he was prone to lapse into youall knowed sure and similar solecisms
He learned to eat and dress and generally comport himself after the manner of civilized man but through it all he remained himself not unduly reverential nor considerative and never hesitating to stride roughshod over any softfaced convention if it got in his way and the provocation were great enough
Also and unlike the average run of weaker men coming from back countries and far places he failed to reverence the particular tin gods worshipped variously by the civilized tribes of men
He had seen totems before and knew them for what they were
Tiring of being merely an onlooker he ran up to Nevada where the new goldmining boom was fairly startedjust to try a flutter as he phrased it to himself
The flutter on the Tonopah Stock Exchange lasted just ten days during which time his smashing wildbull game played ducks and drakes with the more stereotyped gamblers and at the end of which time having gambled Floridel into his fist he let go for a net profit of half a million
Whereupon smacking his lips he departed for San Francisco and the St Francis Hotel
It tasted good and his hunger for the game became more acute
And once more the papers sensationalized him
BURNING DAYLIGHT was a bigletter headline again
Interviewers flocked about him
Old files of magazines and newspapers were searched through and the romantic and historic Elam Harnish Adventurer of the Frost King of the Klondike and father of the Sourdoughs strode upon the breakfast table of a million homes along with the toast and breakfast foods
Even before his elected time he was forcibly launched into the game
Financiers and promoters and all the flotsam and jetsam of the sea of speculation surged upon the shores of his eleven millions
In selfdefence he was compelled to open offices
He had made them sit up and take notice and now willynilly they were dealing him hands and clamoring for him to play
Well play he would hed show em even despite the elated prophesies made of how swiftly he would be trimmedprophesies coupled with descriptions of the bucolic game he would play and of his wild and woolly appearance
He dabbled in little things at firststalling for time as he explained it to Holdsworthy a friend he had made at the AltaPacific Club
Daylight himself was a member of the club and Holdsworthy had proposed him
And it was well that Daylight played closely at first for he was astounded by the multitudes of sharksgroundsharks he called themthat flocked about him
He saw through their schemes readily enough and even marveled that such numbers of them could find sufficient prey to keep them going
Their rascality and general dubiousness was so transparent that he could not understand how any one could be taken in by them
And then he found that there were sharks and sharks
Holdsworthy treated him more like a brother than a mere fellowclubman watching over him advising him and introducing him to the magnates of the local financial world
Holdsworthys family lived in a delightful bungalow near Menlo Park and here Daylight spent a number of weekends seeing a fineness and kindness of home life of which he had never dreamed
Holdsworthy was an enthusiast over flowers and a half lunatic over raising prize poultry and these engrossing madnesses were a source of perpetual joy to Daylight who looked on in tolerant good humor
Such amiable weaknesses tokened the healthfulness of the man and drew Daylight closer to him
A prosperous successful business man without great ambition was Daylights estimate of hima man too easily satisfied with the small stakes of the game ever to launch out in big play
On one such weekend visit Holdsworthy let him in on a good thing a good little thing a brickyard at Glen Ellen
Daylight listened closely to the others description of the situation
It was a most reasonable venture and Daylights one objection was that it was so small a matter and so far out of his line and he went into it only as a matter of friendship Holdsworthy explaining that he was himself already in a bit and that while it was a good thing he would be compelled to make sacrifices in other directions in order to develop it
Daylight advanced the capital fifty thousand dollars and as he laughingly explained afterward I was stung all right but it wasnt Holdsworthy that did it half as much as those blamed chickens and fruittrees of his
It was a good lesson however for he learned that there were few faiths in the business world and that even the simple homely faith of breaking bread and eating salt counted for little in the face of a worthless brickyard and fifty thousand dollars in cash
But the sharks and sharks of various orders and degrees he concluded were on the surface
Deep down he divined were the integrities and the stabilities
These big captains of industry and masters of finance he decided were the men to work with
By the very nature of their huge deals and enterprises they had to play fair
No room there for little sharpers tricks and bunco games
It was to be expected that little men should salt goldmines with a shotgun and work off worthless brickyards on their friends but in high finance such methods were not worth while
There the men were engaged in developing the country organizing its railroads opening up its mines making accessible its vast natural resources
Their play was bound to be big and stable
They sure cant afford tinhorn tactics was his summing up
So it was that he resolved to leave the little men the Holdsworthys alone and while he met them in goodfellowship he chummed with none and formed no deep friendships
He did not dislike the little men the men of the AltaPacific for instance
He merely did not elect to choose them for partners in the big game in which he intended to play
What that big game was even he did not know
He was waiting to find it
And in the meantime he played small hands investing in several aridlands reclamation projects and keeping his eyes open for the big chance when it should come along
And then he met John Dowsett the great John Dowsett
The whole thing was fortuitous
This cannot be doubted as Daylight himself knew it was by the merest chance when in Los Angeles that he heard the tuna were running strong at Santa Catalina and went over to the island instead of returning directly to San Francisco as he had planned
There he met John Dowsett resting off for several days in the middle of a flying western trip
Dowsett had of course heard of the spectacular Klondike King and his rumored thirty millions and he certainly found himself interested by the man in the acquaintance that was formed
Somewhere along in this acquaintanceship the idea must have popped into his brain
But he did not broach it preferring to mature it carefully
So he talked in large general ways and did his best to be agreeable and win Daylights friendship
It was the first big magnate Daylight had met face to face and he was pleased and charmed
There was such a kindly humanness about the man such a genial democraticness that Daylight found it hard to realize that this was THE John Dowsett president of a string of banks insurance manipulator reputed ally of the lieutenants of Standard Oil and known ally of the Guggenhammers
Nor did his looks belie his reputation and his manner
Physically he guaranteed all that Daylight knew of him
Despite his sixty years and snowwhite hair his handshake was firmly hearty and he showed no signs of decrepitude walking with a quick snappy step making all movements definitely and decisively
His skin was a healthy pink and his thin clean lips knew the way to writhe heartily over a joke
He had honest blue eyes of palest blue they looked out at one keenly and frankly from under shaggy gray brows
His mind showed itself disciplined and orderly and its workings struck Daylight as having all the certitude of a steel trap
He was a man who KNEW and who never decorated his knowledge with foolish frills of sentiment or emotion
That he was accustomed to command was patent and every word and gesture tingled with power
Combined with this was his sympathy and tact and Daylight could note easily enough all the earmarks that distinguished him from a little man of the Holdsworthy caliber
Daylight knew also his history the prime old American stock from which he had descended his own war record the John Dowsett before him who had been one of the banking buttresses of the Cause of the Union the Commodore Dowsett of the War of 1812 the General Dowsett of Revolutionary fame and that first far Dowsett owner of lands and slaves in early New England
Hes sure the real thing he told one of his fellowclubmen afterwards in the smokingroom of the AltaPacific
I tell you Gallon he was a genuine surprise to me
I knew the big ones had to be like that but I had to see him to really know it
Hes one of the fellows that does things
You can see it sticking out all over him
Hes one in a thousand thats straight a man to tie to
Theres no limit to any game he plays and you can stack on it that he plays right up to the handle
I bet he can lose or win half a dozen million without batting an eye
Gallon puffed at his cigar and at the conclusion of the panegyric regarded the other curiously but Daylight ordering cocktails failed to note this curious stare
Going in with him on some deal I suppose Gallon remarked
Nope not the slightest idea
Heres kindness
I was just explaining that Id come to understand how these big fellows do big things
Why dye know he gave me such a feeling that he knew everything that I was plumb ashamed of myself
I guess I could give him cards and spades when it comes to driving a dogteam though Daylight observed after a meditative pause
And I really believe I could put him on to a few wrinkles in poker and placer mining and maybe in paddling a birch canoe
And maybe I stand a better chance to learn the game hes been playing all his life than he would stand of learning the game I played up North
CHAPTER II It was not long afterward that Daylight came on to New York
A letter from John Dowsett had been the causea simple little typewritten letter of several lines
But Daylight had thrilled as he read it
He remembered the thrill that was his a callow youth of fifteen when in Tempas Butte through lack of a fourth man Tom Galsworthy the gambler had said Get in Kid take a hand
That thrill was his now
The bald typewritten sentences seemed gorged with mystery
Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel
He is to be trusted
We must not be seen together
You will understand after we have had our talk
Daylight conned the words over and over
That was it
The big game had arrived and it looked as if he were being invited to sit in and take a hand
Surely for no other reason would one man so peremptorily invite another man to make a journey across the continent
They metthanks to our Mr Howisonup the Hudson in a magnificent country home
Daylight according to instructions arrived in a private motorcar which had been furnished him
Whose car it was he did not know any more than did he know the owner of the house with its generous rolling treestudded lawns
Dowsett was already there and another man whom Daylight recognized before the introduction was begun
It was Nathaniel Letton and none other
Daylight had seen his face a score of times in the magazines and newspapers and read about his standing in the financial world and about his endowed University of Daratona
He likewise struck Daylight as a man of power though he was puzzled in that he could find no likeness to Dowsett
Except in the matter of cleannessa cleanness that seemed to go down to the deepest fibers of himNathaniel Letton was unlike the other in every particular
Thin to emaciation he seemed a cold flame of a man a man of a mysterious chemic sort of flame who under a glacierlike exterior conveyed somehow the impression of the ardent heat of a thousand suns
His large gray eyes were mainly responsible for this feeling and they blazed out feverishly from what was almost a deathshead so thin was the face the skin of which was a ghastly dull dead white
Not more than fifty thatched with a sparse growth of irongray hair he looked several times the age of Dowsett
Yet Nathaniel Letton possessed controlDaylight could see that plainly
He was a thinfaced ascetic living in a state of high attenuated calma molten planet under a transcontinental ice sheet
And yet above all most of all Daylight was impressed by the terrific and almost awful cleanness of the man
There was no dross in him
He had all the seeming of having been purged by fire
Daylight had the feeling that a healthy manoath would be a deadly offence to his ears a sacrilege and a blasphemy
They drankthat is Nathaniel Letton took mineral water served by the smoothly operating machine of a lackey who inhabited the place while Dowsett took Scotch and soda and Daylight a cocktail
Nobody seemed to notice the unusualness of a Martini at midnight though Daylight looked sharply for that very thing for he had long since learned that Martinis had their strictly appointed times and places
But he liked Martinis and being a natural man he chose deliberately to drink when and how he pleased
Others had noticed this peculiar habit of his but not so Dowsett and Letton and Daylights secret thought was They sure wouldnt bat an eye if I called for a glass of corrosive sublimate
Leon Guggenhammer arrived in the midst of the drink and ordered Scotch
Daylight studied him curiously
This was one of the great Guggenhammer family a younger one but nevertheless one of the crowd with which he had locked grapples in the North
Nor did Leon Guggenhammer fail to mention cognizance of that old affair
He complimented Daylight on his prowessThe echoes of Ophir came down to us you know
And I must say Mr Daylighter Mr Harnish that you whipped us roundly in that affair
Echoes
Daylight could not escape the shock of the phraseechoes had come down to them of the fight into which he had flung all his strength and the strength of his Klondike millions
The Guggenhammers sure must go some when a fight of that dimension was no more than a skirmish of which they deigned to hear echoes
They sure play an almighty big game down here was his conclusion accompanied by a corresponding elation that it was just precisely that almighty big game in which he was about to be invited to play a hand
For the moment he poignantly regretted that rumor was not true and that his eleven millions were not in reality thirty millions
Well that much he would be frank about he would let them know exactly how many stacks of chips he could buy
Leon Guggenhammer was young and fat
Not a day more than thirty his face save for the adumbrated puff sacks under the eyes was as smooth and lineless as a boys
He too gave the impression of cleanness
He showed in the pink of health his unblemished smoothshaven skin shouted advertisement of his splendid physical condition
In the face of that perfect skin his very fatness and mature rotund paunch could be nothing other than normal
He was constituted to be prone to fatness that was all
The talk soon centred down to business though Guggenhammer had first to say his say about the forthcoming international yacht race and about his own palatial steam yacht the Electra whose recent engines were already antiquated
Dowsett broached the plan aided by an occasional remark from the other two while Daylight asked questions
Whatever the proposition was he was going into it with his eyes open
And they filled his eyes with the practical vision of what they had in mind
They will never dream you are with us Guggenhammer interjected as the outlining of the matter drew to a close his handsome Jewish eyes flashing enthusiastically
Theyll think you are raiding on your own in proper buccaneer style
Of course you understand Mr Harnish the absolute need for keeping our alliance in the dark Nathaniel Letton warned gravely
Daylight nodded his head
And you also understand Letton went on that the result can only be productive of good
The thing is legitimate and right and the only ones who may be hurt are the stock gamblers themselves
It is not an attempt to smash the market
As you see yourself you are to bull the market
The honest investor will be the gainer
Yes thats the very thing Dowsett said
The commercial need for copper is continually increasing
Ward Valley Copper and all that it stands forpractically onequarter of the worlds supply as I have shown youis a big thing how big even we can scarcely estimate
Our arrangements are made
We have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
Also there is too much Ward Valley out to suit our present plans
Thus we kill both birds with one stone And I am the stone Daylight broke in with a smile
Yes just that
Not only will you bull Ward Valley but you will at the same time gather Ward Valley in
This will be of inestimable advantage to us while you and all of us will profit by it as well
And as Mr Letton has pointed out the thing is legitimate and square
On the eighteenth the directors meet and instead of the customary dividend a double dividend will be declared
And where will the shorts be then
Leon Guggenhammer cried excitedly
The shorts will be the speculators Nathaniel Letton explained the gamblers the froth of Wall Streetyou understand
The genuine investors will not be hurt
Furthermore they will have learned for the thousandth time to have confidence in Ward Valley
And with their confidence we can carry through the large developments we have outlined to you
There will be all sorts of rumors on the street Dowsett warned Daylight but do not let them frighten you
These rumors may even originate with us
You can see how and why clearly
But rumors are to be no concern of yours
You are on the inside
All you have to do is buy buy buy and keep on buying to the last stroke when the directors declare the double dividend
Ward Valley will jump so that it wont be feasible to buy after that
What we want Letton took up the strain pausing significantly to sip his mineral water what we want is to take large blocks of Ward Valley off the hands of the public
We could do this easily enough by depressing the market and frightening the holders
And we could do it more cheaply in such fashion
But we are absolute masters of the situation and we are fair enough to buy Ward Valley on a rising market
Not that we are philanthropists but that we need the investors in our big development scheme
Nor do we lose directly by the transaction
The instant the action of the directors becomes known Ward Valley will rush heavenward
In addition and outside the legitimate field of the transaction we will pinch the shorts for a very large sum
But that is only incidental you understand and in a way unavoidable
On the other hand we shall not turn up our noses at that phase of it
The shorts shall be the veriest gamblers of course and they will get no more than they deserve
And one other thing Mr Harnish Guggenhammer said if you exceed your available cash or the amount you care to invest in the venture dont fail immediately to call on us
Remember we are behind you
Yes we are behind you Dowsett repeated
Nathaniel Letton nodded his head in affirmation
Now about that double dividend on the eighteenth John Dowsett drew a slip of paper from his notebook and adjusted his glasses
Let me show you the figures
Here you see And thereupon he entered into a long technical and historical explanation of the earnings and dividends of Ward Valley from the day of its organization
The whole conference lasted not more than an hour during which time Daylight lived at the topmost of the highest peak of life that he had ever scaled
These men were big players
They were powers
True as he knew himself they were not the real inner circle
They did not rank with the Morgans and Harrimans
And yet they were in touch with those giants and were themselves lesser giants
He was pleased too with their attitude toward him
They met him deferentially but not patronizingly
It was the deference of equality and Daylight could not escape the subtle flattery of it for he was fully aware that in experience as well as wealth they were far and away beyond him
Well shake up the speculating crowd Leon Guggenhammer proclaimed jubilantly as they rose to go
And you are the man to do it Mr Harnish
They are bound to think you are on your own and their shears are all sharpened for the trimming of newcomers like you
They will certainly be misled Letton agreed his eerie gray eyes blazing out from the voluminous folds of the huge Mueller with which he was swathing his neck to the ears
Their minds run in ruts
It is the unexpected that upsets their stereotyped calculationsany new combination any strange factor any fresh variant
And you will be all that to them Mr Harnish
And I repeat they are gamblers and they will deserve all that befalls them
They clog and cumber all legitimate enterprise
You have no idea of the trouble they cause men like ussometimes by their gambling tactics upsetting the soundest plans even overturning the stablest institutions
Dowsett and young Guggenhammer went away in one motorcar and Letton by himself in another
Daylight with still in the forefront of his consciousness all that had occurred in the preceding hour was deeply impressed by the scene at the moment of departure
The three machines stood like weird night monsters at the gravelled foot of the wide stairway under the unlighted portecochere
It was a dark night and the lights of the motorcars cut as sharply through the blackness as knives would cut through solid substance
The obsequious lackeythe automatic genie of the house which belonged to none of the three menstood like a graven statue after having helped them in
The furcoated chauffeurs bulked dimly in their seats
One after the other like spurred steeds the cars leaped into the blackness took the curve of the driveway and were gone
Daylights car was the last and peering out he caught a glimpse of the unlighted house that loomed hugely through the darkness like a mountain
Whose was it
he wondered
How came they to use it for their secret conference
Would the lackey talk
How about the chauffeurs
Were they trusted men like our Mr Howison
Mystery
The affair was alive with it
And hand in hand with mystery walked Power
He leaned back and inhaled his cigarette
Big things were afoot
The cards were shuffled even the for a mighty deal and he was in on it
He remembered back to his poker games with Jack Kearns and laughed aloud
He had played for thousands in those days on the turn of a card but now he was playing for millions
And on the eighteenth when that dividend was declared he chuckled at the confusion that would inevitably descend upon the men with the sharpened shears waiting to trim himhim Burning Daylight
CHAPTER III Back at his hotel though nearly two in the morning he found the reporters waiting to interview him
Next morning there were more
And thus with blare of paper trumpet was he received by New York
Once more with beating of tomstoms and wild hullaballoo his picturesque figure strode across the printed sheet
The King of the Klondike the hero of the Arctic the thirtymilliondollar millionaire of the North had come to New York
What had he come for
To trim the New Yorkers as he had trimmed the Tonopah crowd in Nevada
Wall Street had best watch out for the wild man of Klondike had just come to town
Or perchance would Wall Street trim him
Wall Street had trimmed many wild men would this be Burning Daylights fate
Daylight grinned to himself and gave out ambiguous interviews
It helped the game and he grinned again as he meditated that Wall Street would sure have to go some before it trimmed him
They were prepared for him to play and when heavy buying of Ward Valley began it was quickly decided that he was the operator
Financial gossip buzzed and hummed
He was after the Guggenhammers once more
The story of Ophir was told over again and sensationalized until even Daylight scarcely recognized it
Still it was all grist to his mill
The stock gamblers were clearly befooled
Each day he increased his buying and so eager were the sellers that Ward Valley rose but slowly
It sure beats poker Daylight whispered gleefully to himself as he noted the perturbation he was causing
The newspapers hazarded countless guesses and surmises and Daylight was constantly dogged by a small battalion of reporters
His own interviews were gems
Discovering the delight the newspapers took in his vernacular in his youalls and sures and surgeups he even exaggerated these particularities of speech exploiting the phrases he had heard other frontiersmen use and inventing occasionally a new one of his own
A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth
Not only was he gambling as he had never gambled before but he was gambling at the biggest table in the world and for stakes so large that even the casehardened habitues of that table were compelled to sit up
In spite of the unlimited selling his persistent buying compelled Ward Valley steadily to rise and as Thursday approached the situation became acute
Something had to smash
How much Ward Valley was this Klondike gambler going to buy
How much could he buy
What was the Ward Valley crowd doing all this time
Daylight appreciated the interviews with them that appearedinterviews delightfully placid and noncommittal
Leon Guggenhammer even hazarded the opinion that this Northland Croesus might possibly be making a mistake
But not that they cared John Dowsett explained
Nor did they object
While in the dark regarding his intentions of one thing they were certain namely that he was bulling Ward Valley
And they did not mind that
No matter what happened to him and his spectacular operations Ward Valley was all right and would remain all right as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar
No they had no Ward Valley to sell thank you
This purely fictitious state of the market was bound shortly to pass and Ward Valley was not to be induced to change the even tenor of its way by any insane stock exchange flurry
It is purely gambling from beginning to end were Nathaniel Lettons words and we refuse to have anything to do with it or to take notice of it in any way
During this time Daylight had several secret meetings with his partnersone with Leon Guggenhammer one with John Dowsett and two with Mr Howison
Beyond congratulations they really amounted to nothing for as he was informed everything was going satisfactorily
But on Tuesday morning a rumor that was disconcerting came to Daylights ears
It was also published in the Wall Street Journal and it was to the effect on apparently straight inside information that on Thursday when the directors of Ward Valley met instead of the customary dividend being declared an assessment would be levied
It was the first check Daylight had received
It came to him with a shock that if the thing were so he was a broken man
And it also came to him that all this colossal operating of his was being done on his own money
Dowsett Guggenhammer and Letton were risking nothing
It was a panic shortlived it was true but sharp enough while it lasted to make him remember Holdsworthy and the brickyard and to impel him to cancel all buying orders while he rushed to a telephone
Nothing in itonly a rumor came Leon Guggenhammers throaty voice in the receiver
As you know said Nathaniel Letton I am one of the directors and I should certainly be aware of it were such action contemplated
And John Dowsett I warned you against just such rumors
There is not an iota of truth in itcertainly not
I tell you on my honor as a gentleman
Heartily ashamed of himself for his temporary loss of nerve Daylight returned to his task
The cessation of buying had turned the Stock Exchange into a bedlam and down all the line of stocks the bears were smashing
Ward Valley as the ape received the brunt of the shock and was already beginning to tumble
Daylight calmly doubled his buying orders
And all through Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday morning he went on buying while Ward Valley rose triumphantly higher
Still they sold and still he bought exceeding his power to buy many times over when delivery was taken into account
What of that
On this day the double dividend would be declared he assured himself
The pinch of delivery would be on the shorts
They would be making terms with him
And then the thunderbolt struck
True to the rumor Ward Valley levied the assessment
Daylight threw up his arms
He verified the report and quit
Not alone Ward Valley but all securities were being hammered down by the triumphant bears
As for Ward Valley Daylight did not even trouble to learn if it had fetched bottom or was still tumbling
Not stunned not even bewildered while Wall Street went mad Daylight withdrew from the field to think it over
After a short conference with his brokers he proceeded to his hotel on the way picking up the evening papers and glancing at the headlines
BURNING DAYLIGHT CLEANED OUT he read DAYLIGHT GETS HIS ANOTHER WESTERNER FAILS TO FIND EASY MONEY
As he entered his hotel a later edition announced the suicide of a young man a lamb who had followed Daylights play
What in hell did he want to kill himself for
was Daylights muttered comment
He passed up to his rooms ordered a Martini cocktail took off his shoes and sat down to think
After half an hour he roused himself to take the drink and as he felt the liquor pass warmingly through his body his features relaxed into a slow deliberate yet genuine grin
He was laughing at himself
Buncoed by gosh
he muttered
Then the grin died away and his face grew bleak and serious
Leaving out his interests in the several Western reclamation projects which were still assessing heavily he was a ruined man
But harder hit than this was his pride
He had been so easy
They had goldbricked him and he had nothing to show for it
The simplest farmer would have had documents while he had nothing but a gentlemans agreement and a verbal one at that
Gentlemans agreement
He snorted over it
John Dowsetts voice just as he had heard it in the telephone receiver sounded in his ears the words On my honor as a gentleman
They were sneakthieves and swindlers that was what they were and they had given him the doublecross
The newspapers were right
He had come to New York to be trimmed and Messrs Dowsett Letton and Guggenhammer had done it
He was a little fish and they had played with him ten daysample time in which to swallow him along with his eleven millions
Of course they had been unloading on him all the time and now they were buying Ward Valley back for a song ere the market righted itself
Most probably out of his share of the swag Nathaniel Letton would erect a couple of new buildings for that university of his
Leon Guggenhammer would buy new engines for that yacht or a whole fleet of yachts
But what the devil Dowsett would do with his whack was beyond himmost likely start another string of banks
And Daylight sat and consumed cocktails and saw back in his life to Alaska and lived over the grim years in which he had battled for his eleven millions
For a while murder ate at his heart and wild ideas and sketchy plans of killing his betrayers flashed through his mind
That was what that young man should have done instead of killing himself
He should have gone gunning
Daylight unlocked his grip and took out his automatic pistola big Colts 44
He released the safety catch with his thumb and operating the sliding outer barrel ran the contents of the clip through the mechanism
The eight cartridges slid out in a stream
He refilled the clip threw a cartridge into the chamber and with the trigger at full cock thrust up the safety ratchet
He shoved the weapon into the side pocket of his coat ordered another Martini and resumed his seat
He thought steadily for an hour but he grinned no more
Lines formed in his face and in those lines were the travail of the North the bite of the frost all that he had achieved and sufferedthe long unending weeks of trail the bleak tundra shore of Point Barrow the smashing icejam of the Yukon the battles with animals and men the leandragged days of famine the long months of stinging hell among the mosquitoes of the Koyokuk the toil of pick and shovel the scars and mars of packstrap and tumpline the straight meat diet with the dogs and all the long procession of twenty full years of toil and sweat and endeavor
At ten oclock he arose and pored over the city directory
Then he put on his shoes took a cab and departed into the night
Twice he changed cabs and finally fetched up at the night office of a detective agency
He superintended the thing himself laid down money in advance in profuse quantities selected the six men he needed and gave them their instructions
Never for so simple a task had they been so well paid for to each in addition to office charges he gave a fivehundreddollar bill with the promise of another if he succeeded
Some time next day he was convinced if not sooner his three silent partners would come together
To each one two of his detectives were to be attached
Time and place was all he wanted to learn
Stop at nothing boys were his final instructions
I must have this information
Whatever you do whatever happens Ill sure see you through
Returning to his hotel he changed cabs as before went up to his room and with one more cocktail for a nightcap went to bed and to sleep
In the morning he dressed and shaved ordered breakfast and the newspapers sent up and waited
But he did not drink
By nine oclock his telephone began to ring and the reports to come in
Nathaniel Letton was taking the train at Tarrytown
John Dowsett was coming down by the subway
Leon Guggenhammer had not stirred out yet though he was assuredly within
And in this fashion with a map of the city spread out before him Daylight followed the movements of his three men as they drew together
Nathaniel Letton was at his offices in the MutualSolander Building
Next arrived Guggenhammer
Dowsett was still in his own offices
But at eleven came the word that he also had arrived and several minutes later Daylight was in a hired motorcar and speeding for the MutualSolander Building
CHAPTER IV Nathaniel Letton was talking when the door opened he ceased and with his two companions gazed with controlled perturbation at Burning Daylight striding into the room
The free swinging movements of the trailtraveler were unconsciously exaggerated in that stride of his
In truth it seemed to him that he felt the trail beneath his feet
Howdy gentlemen howdy he remarked ignoring the unnatural calm with which they greeted his entrance
He shook hands with them in turn striding from one to another and gripping their hands so heartily that Nathaniel Letton could not forbear to wince
Daylight flung himself into a massive chair and sprawled lazily with an appearance of fatigue
The leather grip he had brought into the room he dropped carelessly beside him on the floor Goddle mighty but Ive sure been going some he sighed
We sure trimmed them beautiful
It was real slick
And the beauty of the play never dawned on me till the very end
It was pure and simple knock down and drag out
And the way they fell for it was amazin
The geniality in his lazy Western drawl reassured them
He was not so formidable after all
Despite the act that he had effected an entrance in the face of Lettons instructions to the outer office he showed no indication of making a scene or playing rough
Well Daylight demanded goodhumoredly aint youall got a good word for your pardner
Or has his sure enough brilliance plumb dazzled youall
Letton made a dry sound in his throat
Dowsett sat quietly and waited while Leon Guggenhammer struggled into articulation
You have certainly raised Cain he said
Daylights black eyes flashed in a pleased way
Didnt I though
he proclaimed jubilantly
And didnt we foolem
I was totally surprised
I never dreamed they would be that easy
And now he went on not permitting the pause to grow awkward weall might as well have an accounting
Im pullin West this afternoon on that blamed Twentieth Century
He tugged at his grip got it open and dipped into it with both his hands
But dont forget boys when youall want me to hornswoggle Wall Street another flutter all youall have to do is whisper the word
Ill sure be right there with the goods
His hands emerged clutching a great mass of stubs checkbooks and brokers receipts
These he deposited in a heap on the big table and dipping again he fished out the stragglers and added them to the pile
He consulted a slip of paper drawn from his coat pocket and read aloud Ten million twentyseven thousand and fortytwo dollars and sixtyeight cents is my figurin on my expenses
Of course thatalls taken from the winnings before weall get to figurin on the whackup
Wheres your figures
It must a been a Goddle mighty big cleanup
The three men looked their bepuzzlement at one another
The man was a bigger fool than they had imagined or else he was playing a game which they could not divine
Nathaniel Letton moistened his lips and spoke up
It will take some hours yet Mr Harnish before the full accounting can be made
Mr Howison is at work upon it now
Weahas you say it has been a gratifying cleanup
Suppose we have lunch together and talk it over
Ill have the clerks work through the noon hour so that you will have ample time to catch your train
Dowsett and Guggenhammer manifested a relief that was almost obvious
The situation was clearing
It was disconcerting under the circumstances to be pent in the same room with this heavymuscled Indianlike man whom they had robbed
They remembered unpleasantly the many stories of his strength and recklessness
If Letton could only put him off long enough for them to escape into the policed world outside the office door all would be well and Daylight showed all the signs of being put off
Im real glad to hear that he said
I dont want to miss that train and youall have done me proud gentlemen letting me in on this deal
I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings
But I am sure almighty curious and Id like terrible to know Mr Letton what your figures of our winning is
Can youall give me a rough estimate
Nathaniel Letton did not look appealingly at his two friends but in the brief pause they felt that appeal pass out from him
Dowsett of sterner mould than the others began to divine that the Klondiker was playing
But the other two were still older the blandishment of his childlike innocence
It is extremelyerdifficult Leon Guggenhammer began
You see Ward Valley has fluctuated so er That no estimate can possibly be made in advance Letton supplemented
Approximate it approximate it Daylight counselled cheerfully
It dont hurt if youall are a million or so out one side or the other
The figuresll straighten that up
But Im that curious Im just itching all over
What dye say
Why continue to play at cross purposes
Dowsett demanded abruptly and coldly
Let us have the explanation here and now
Mr Harnish is laboring under a false impression and he should be set straight
In this deal But Daylight interrupted
He had played too much poker to be unaware or unappreciative of the psychological factor and he headed Dowsett off in order to play the denouncement of the present game in his own way
Speaking of deals he said reminds me of a poker game I once seen in Reno Nevada
It want what youall would call a square game
Theyall was tinhorns that sat in
But they was a tenderfootshorthorns theyall are called out there
He stands behind the dealer and sees that same dealer give hisself four aces offen the bottom of the deck
The tenderfoot is sure shocked
He slides around to the player facin the dealer across the table
Say he whispers I seen the dealer deal hisself four aces
Well an what of it
says the player
Im tryin to tell youall because I thought youall ought to know says the tenderfoot
I tell youall I seen him deal hisself four aces
Say mister says the player youalld better get outa here
Youall dont understand the game
Its his deal aint it
The laughter that greeted his story was hollow and perfunctory but Daylight appeared not to notice it
Your story has some meaning I suppose Dowsett said pointedly
Daylight looked at him innocently and did not reply
He turned jovially to Nathaniel Letton
Fire away he said
Give us an approximation of our winning
As I said before a million out one way or the other wont matter its bound to be such an almighty big winning
By this time Letton was stiffened by the attitude Dowsett had taken and his answer was prompt and definite
I fear you are under a misapprehension Mr Harnish
There are no winnings to be divided with you
Now dont get excited I beg of you
I have but to press this button Far from excited Daylight had all the seeming of being stunned
He felt absently in his vest pocket for a match lighted it and discovered that he had no cigarette
The three men watched him with the tense closeness of cats
Now that it had come they knew that they had a nasty few minutes before them
Do youall mind saying that over again
Daylight said
Seems to me I aint got it just exactly right
Youall said
He hung with painful expectancy on Nathaniel Lettons utterance
I said you were under a misapprehension Mr Harnish that was all
You have been stock gambling and you have been hard hit
But neither Ward Valley nor I nor my associates feel that we owe you anything
Daylight pointed at the heap of receipts and stubs on the table
Thatall represents ten million twentyseven thousand and fortytwo dollars and sixtyeight cents hard cash
Aint it good for anything here
Letton smiled and shrugged his shoulders
Daylight looked at Dowsett and murmured I guess that story of mine had some meaning after all
He laughed in a sickly fashion
It was your deal all right and youall dole them right too
Well I aint kicking
Im like the player in that poker game
It was your deal and youall had a right to do your best
And you done itcleaned me out slickern a whistle
He gazed at the heap on the table with an air of stupefaction
And thatall aint worth the paper its written on
Gol dast it youall can sure deal em round when you get a chance
Oh no I aint akicking
It was your deal and youall certainly done me and a man aint half a man that squeals on another mans deal
And now the hand is played out and the cards are on the table and the deals over but His hand dipping swiftly into his inside breast pocket appeared with the big Colts automatic
As I was saying the old deals finished
Now its MY deal and Im agoing to see if I can hold them four aces Take your hand away you whited sepulchre
he cried sharply
Nathaniel Lettons hand creeping toward the pushbutton on the desk was abruptly arrested
Change chairs Daylight commanded
Take that chair over there you gangrenelivered skunk
Jump
By God
or Ill make you leak till folksll think your father was a water hydrant and your mother a sprinklingcart
Youall move your chair alongside Guggenhammer and youall Dowsett sit right there while I just irrelevantly explain the virtues of this here automatic
Shes loaded for big game and she goes off eight times
Shes a sure hummer when she gets started
Preliminary remarks being over I now proceed to deal
Remember I aint making no remarks about your deal
You done your darndest and it was all right
But this is my deal and its up to me to do my darndest
In the first place youall know me
Im Burning Daylightsavvee
Aint afraid of God devil death nor destruction
Thems my four aces and they sure copper your bets
Look at that there living skeleton
Letton youre sure afraid to die
Your bones is all rattling together youre that scared
And look at that fat Jew there
This little weapons sure put the fear of God in his heart
Hes yellow as a sick persimmon
Dowsett youre a cool one
Youall aint batted an eye nor turned a hair
Thats because youre great on arithmetic
And that makes youall dead easy in this deal of mine
Youre sitting there and adding two and two together and youall know I sure got you skinned
You know me and that I aint afraid of nothing
And youall adds up all your money and knows you aint agoing to die if you can help it
Ill see you hanged was Dowsetts retort
Not by a damned sight
When the fun starts youre the first I plug
Ill hang all right but youall wont live to see it
Youall die here and now while Ill die subject to the laws delaysavvee
Being dead with grass growing out of your carcasses you wont know when I hang but Ill sure have the pleasure a long time of knowing youall beat me to it
Daylight paused
You surely wouldnt kill us
Letton asked in a queer thin voice
Daylight shook his head
Its sure too expensive
Youall aint worth it
Id sooner have my chips back
And I guess youalld sooner give my chips back than go to the deadhouse
A long silence followed
Well Ive done dealt
Its up to youall to play
But while youre deliberating I want to give youall a warning if that door opens and any one of you cusses lets on theres anything unusual right here and then I sure start plugging
They aint a soulll get out the room except feet first
A long session of three hours followed
The deciding factor was not the big automatic pistol but the certitude that Daylight would use it
Not alone were the three men convinced of this but Daylight himself was convinced
He was firmly resolved to kill the men if his money was not forthcoming
It was not an easy matter on the spur of the moment to raise ten millions in paper currency and there were vexatious delays
A dozen times Mr Howison and the head clerk were summoned into the room
On these occasions the pistol lay on Daylights lap covered carelessly by a newspaper while he was usually engaged in rolling or lighting his brownpaper cigarettes
But in the end the thing was accomplished
A suitcase was brought up by one of the clerks from the waiting motorcar and Daylight snapped it shut on the last package of bills
He paused at the door to make his final remarks
Theres three several things I sure want to tell youall
When I get outside this door youallll be set free to act and I just want to warn youall about what to do
In the first place no warrants for my arrestsavvee
This moneys mine and I aint robbed you of it
If it gets out how you gave me the doublecross and how I done you back again the laughll be on you and itll sure be an almighty big laugh
Youall cant afford that laugh
Besides having got back my stake that youall robbed me of if you arrest me and try to rob me a second time Ill go gunning for youall and Ill sure get you
No little fraidcat shrimps like youall can skin Burning Daylight
If you win you lose and therell sure be some several unexpected funerals around this burg
Just look me in the eye and youallll savvee I mean business
Them stubs and receipts on the table is all yourn
Good day
As the door shut behind him Nathaniel Letton sprang for the telephone and Dowsett intercepted him
What are you going to do
Dowsett demanded
The police
Its downright robbery
I wont stand it
I tell you I wont stand it
Dowsett smiled grimly but at the same time bore the slender financier back and down into his chair
Well talk it over he said and in Leon Guggenhammer he found an anxious ally
And nothing ever came of it
The thing remained a secret with the three men
Nor did Daylight ever give the secret away though that afternoon leaning back in his stateroom on the Twentieth Century his shoes off and feet on a chair he chuckled long and heartily
New York remained forever puzzled over the affair nor could it hit upon a rational explanation
By all rights Burning Daylight should have gone broke yet it was known that he immediately reappeared in San Francisco possessing an apparently unimpaired capital
This was evidenced by the magnitude of the enterprises he engaged in such as for instance Panama Mail by sheer weight of money and fighting power wresting the control away from Shiftily and selling out in two months to the Harriman interests at a rumored enormous advance
CHAPTER V Back in San Francisco Daylight quickly added to his reputation In ways it was not an enviable reputation
Men were afraid of him
He became known as a fighter a fiend a tiger
His play was a ripping and smashing one and no one knew where or how his next blow would fall
The element of surprise was large
He balked on the unexpected and fresh from the wild North his mind not operating in stereotyped channels he was able in unusual degree to devise new tricks and stratagems
And once he won the advantage he pressed it remorselessly
As relentless as a Red Indian was said of him and it was said truly
On the other hand he was known as square
His word was as good as his bond and this despite the fact that he accepted nobodys word
He always shied at propositions based on gentlemens agreements and a man who ventured his honor as a gentleman in dealing with Daylight inevitably was treated to an unpleasant time
Daylight never gave his own word unless he held the whiphand
It was a case with the other fellow taking it or nothing
Legitimate investment had no place in Daylights play
It tied up his money and reduced the element of risk
It was the gambling side of business that fascinated him and to play in his slashing manner required that his money must be ready to hand
It was never tied up save for short intervals for he was principally engaged in turning it over and over raiding here there and everywhere a veritable pirate of the financial main
A fiveper cent safe investment had no attraction for him but to risk millions in sharp harsh skirmish standing to lose everything or to win fifty or a hundred per cent was the savor of life to him
He played according to the rules of the game but he played mercilessly
When he got a man or a corporation down and they squealed he gouged no less hard
Appeals for financial mercy fell on deaf ears
He was a free lance and had no friendly business associations
Such alliances as were formed from time to time were purely affairs of expediency and he regarded his allies as men who would give him the doublecross or ruin him if a profitable chance presented
In spite of this point of view he was faithful to his allies
But he was faithful just as long as they were and no longer
The treason had to come from them and then it was Ware Daylight
The business men and financiers of the Pacific coast never forgot the lesson of Charles Klinkner and the California  Altamont Trust Company
Klinkner was the president
In partnership with Daylight the pair raided the San Jose Interurban
The powerful Lake Power  Electric Lighting corporation came to the rescue and Klinkner seeing what he thought was the opportunity went over to the enemy in the thick of the pitched battle
Daylight lost three millions before he was done with it and before he was done with it he saw the California  Altamont Trust Company hopelessly wrecked and Charles Klinkner a suicide in a felons cell
Not only did Daylight lose his grip on San Jose Interurban but in the crash of his battle front he lost heavily all along the line
It was conceded by those competent to judge that he could have compromised and saved much
But instead he deliberately threw up the battle with San Jose Interurban and Lake Power and apparently defeated with Napoleonic suddenness struck at Klinkner
It was the last unexpected thing Klinkner would have dreamed of and Daylight knew it
He knew further that the California  Altamont Trust Company has an intrinsically sound institution but that just then it was in a precarious condition due to Klinkners speculations with its money
He knew also that in a few months the Trust Company would be more firmly on its feet than ever thanks to those same speculations and that if he were to strike he must strike immediately
Its just that much money in pocket and a whole lot more he was reported to have said in connection with his heavy losses
Its just so much insurance against the future
Henceforth men who go in with me on deals will think twice before they try to doublecross me and then some
The reason for his savageness was that he despised the men with whom he played
He had a conviction that not one in a hundred of them was intrinsically square and as for the square ones he prophesied that playing in a crooked game they were sure to lose and in the long run go broke
His New York experience had opened his eyes
He tore the veils of illusion from the business game and saw its nakedness
He generalized upon industry and society somewhat as follows Society as organized was a vast bunco game
There were many hereditary inefficientsmen and women who were not weak enough to be confined in feebleminded homes but who were not strong enough to be ought else than hewers of wood and drawers of water
Then there were the fools who took the organized bunco game seriously honoring and respecting it
They were easy game for the others who saw clearly and knew the bunco game for what it was
Work legitimate work was the source of all wealth
That was to say whether it was a sack of potatoes a grand piano or a sevenpassenger touring car it came into being only by the performance of work
Where the bunco came in was in the distribution of these things after labor had created them
He failed to see the hornyhanded sons of toil enjoying grand pianos or riding in automobiles
How this came about was explained by the bunco
By tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands men sat up nights and schemed how they could get between the workers and the things the workers produced
These schemers were the business men
When they got between the worker and his product they took a whack out of it for themselves The size of the whack was determined by no rule of equity but by their own strength and swinishness
It was always a case of all the traffic can bear
He saw all men in the business game doing this
One day in a mellow mood induced by a string of cocktails and a hearty lunch he started a conversation with Jones the elevator boy
Jones was a slender mopheaded mangrown truculent flame of an individual who seemed to go out of his way to insult his passengers
It was this that attracted Daylights interest and he was not long in finding out what was the matter with Jones
He was a proletarian according to his own aggressive classification and he had wanted to write for a living
Failing to win with the magazines and compelled to find himself in food and shelter he had gone to the little valley of Petacha not a hundred miles from Los Angeles
Here toiling in the daytime he planned to write and study at night
But the railroad charged all the traffic would bear
Petacha was a desert valley and produced only three things cattle firewood and charcoal
For freight to Los Angeles on a carload of cattle the railroad charged eight dollars
This Jones explained was due to the fact that the cattle had legs and could be driven to Los Angeles at a cost equivalent to the charge per car load
But firewood had no legs and the railroad charged just precisely twentyfour dollars a carload
This was a fine adjustment for by working hammerand tongs through a twelvehour day after freight had been deducted from the selling price of the wood in Los Angeles the woodchopper received one dollar and sixty cents
Jones had thought to get ahead of the game by turning his wood into charcoa
His estimates were satisfactory
But the railroad also made estimates
It issued a rate of fortytwo dollars a car on charcoal
At the end of three months Jones went over his figures and found that he was still making one dollar and sixty cents a day
So I quit Jones concluded
I went hobbling for a year and I got back at the railroads
Leaving out the little things I came across the Sierras in the summer and touched a match to the snowsheds
They only had a little thirty thousanddollar fire
I guess that squared up all balances due on Petacha
Son aint you afraid to be turning loose such information
Daylight gravely demanded
Not on your life quoth Jones
They cant prove it
You could say I said so and I could say I didnt say so and a hell of a lot that evidence would amount to with a jury
Daylight went into his office and meditated awhile
That was it all the traffic would bear
From top to bottom that was the rule of the game and what kept the game going was the fact that a sucker was born every minute
If a Jones were born every minute the game wouldnt last very long
Lucky for the players that the workers werent Joneses
But there were other and larger phases of the game
Little business men shopkeepers and such ilk took what whack they could out of the product of the worker but after all it was the large business men who formed the workers through the little business men
When all was said and done the latter like Jones in Petacha Valley got no more than wages out of their whack
In truth they were hired men for the large business men
Still again higher up were the big fellows
They used vast and complicated paraphernalia for the purpose on a large scale of getting between hundreds of thousands of workers and their products
These men were not so much mere robbers as gamblers
And not content with their direct winnings being essentially gamblers they raided one another
They called this feature of the game HIGH FINANCE
They were all engaged primarily in robbing the worker but every little while they formed combinations and robbed one another of the accumulated loot
This explained the fiftythousanddollar raid on him by Holdsworthy and the tenmilliondollar raid on him by Dowsett Letton and Guggenhammer
And when he raided Panama Mail he had done exactly the same thing
Well he concluded it was finer sport robbing the robbers than robbing the poor stupid workers
Thus all unread in philosophy Daylight preempted for himself the position and vocation of a twentiethcentury superman
He found with rare and mythical exceptions that there was no noblesse oblige among the business and financial supermen
As a clever traveler had announced in an afterdinner speech at the AltaPacific There was honor amongst thieves and this was what distinguished thieves from honest men
That was it
It hit the nail on the head
These modern supermen were a lot of sordid banditti who had the successful effrontery to preach a code of right and wrong to their victims which they themselves did not practise
With them a mans word was good just as long as he was compelled to keep it
THOU SHALT NOT STEAL was only applicable to the honest worker
They the supermen were above such commandments
They certainly stole and were honored by their fellows according to the magnitude of their stealings
The more Daylight played the game the clearer the situation grew
Despite the fact that every robber was keen to rob every other robber the band was well organized
It practically controlled the political machinery of society from the ward politician up to the Senate of the United States
It passed laws that gave it privilege to rob
It enforced these laws by means of the police the marshals the militia and regular army and the courts
And it was a snap
A supermans chiefest danger was his fellowsuperman
The great stupid mass of the people did not count
They were constituted of such inferior clay that the veriest chicanery fooled them
The superman manipulated the strings and when robbery of the workers became too slow or monotonous they turned loose and robbed one another
Daylight was philosophical but not a philosopher
He had never read the books
He was a hardheaded practical man and farthest from him was any intention of ever reading the books
He had lived life in the simple where books were not necessary for an understanding of life and now life in the complex appeared just as simple
He saw through its frauds and fictions and found it as elemental as on the Yukon
Men were made of the same stuff
They had the same passions and desires
Finance was poker on a larger scale
The men who played were the men who had stakes
The workers were the fellows toiling for grubstakes
He saw the game played out according to the everlasting rules and he played a hand himself
The gigantic futility of humanity organized and befuddled by the bandits did not shock him
It was the natural order
Practically all human endeavors were futile
He had seen so much of it
His partners had starved and died on the Stewart
Hundreds of oldtimers had failed to locate on Bonanza and Eldorado while Swedes and chechaquos had come in on the moosepasture and blindly staked millions
It was life and life was a savage proposition at best
Men in civilization robbed because they were so made
They robbed just as cats scratched famine pinched and frost bit
So it was that Daylight became a successful financier
He did not go in for swindling the workers
Not only did he not have the heart for it but it did not strike him as a sporting proposition
The workers were so easy so stupid
It was more like slaughtering fat handreared pheasants on the English preserves he had heard about
The sport to him was in waylaying the successful robbers and taking their spoils from them
There was fun and excitement in that and sometimes they put up the very devil of a fight
Like Robin Hood of old Daylight proceeded to rob the rich and in a small way to distribute to the needy
But he was charitable after his own fashion
The great mass of human misery meant nothing to him
That was part of the everlasting order
He had no patience with the organized charities and the professional charity mongers
Nor on the other hand was what he gave a conscience dole
He owed no man and restitution was unthinkable
What he gave was a largess a free spontaneous gift and it was for those about him
He never contributed to an earthquake fund in Japan nor to an openair fund in New York City
Instead he financed Jones the elevator boy for a year that he might write a book
When he learned that the wife of his waiter at the St Francis was suffering from tuberculosis he sent her to Arizona and later when her case was declared hopeless he sent the husband too to be with her to the end
Likewise he bought a string of horsehair bridles from a convict in a Western penitentiary who spread the good news until it seemed to Daylight that half the convicts in that institution were making bridles for him
He bought them all paying from twenty to fifty dollars each for them
They were beautiful and honest things and he decorated all the available wallspace of his bedroom with them
The grim Yukon life had failed to make Daylight hard
It required civilization to produce this result
In the fierce savage game he now played his habitual geniality imperceptibly slipped away from him as did his lazy Western drawl
As his speech became sharp and nervous so did his mental processes
In the swift rush of the game he found less and less time to spend on being merely goodnatured
The change marked his face itself
The lines grew sterner
Less often appeared the playful curl of his lips the smile in the wrinkling corners of his eyes
The eyes themselves black and flashing like an Indians betrayed glints of cruelty and brutal consciousness of power
His tremendous vitality remained and radiated from all his being but it was vitality under the new aspect of the mantrampling manconqueror
His battles with elemental nature had been in a way impersonal his present battles were wholly with the males of his species and the hardships of the trail the river and the frost marred him far less than the bitter keenness of the struggle with his fellows
He still had recrudescence of geniality but they were largely periodical and forced and they were usually due to the cocktails he took prior to mealtime
In the North he had drunk deeply and at irregular intervals but now his drinking became systematic and disciplined
It was an unconscious development but it was based upon physical and mental condition
The cocktails served as an inhibition
Without reasoning or thinking about it the strain of the office which was essentially due to the daring and audacity of his ventures required check or cessation and he found through the weeks and months that the cocktails supplied this very thing
They constituted a stone wall
He never drank during the morning nor in office hours but the instant he left the office he proceeded to rear this wall of alcoholic inhibition athwart his consciousness
The office became immediately a closed affair
It ceased to exist
In the afternoon after lunch it lived again for one or two hours when leaving it he rebuilt the wall of inhibition
Of course there were exceptions to this and such was the rigor of his discipline that if he had a dinner or a conference before him in which in a business way he encountered enemies or allies and planned or prosecuted campaigns he abstained from drinking
But the instant the business was settled his everlasting call went out for a Martini and for a doubleMartini at that served in a long glass so as not to excite comment
CHAPTER VI Into Daylights life came Dede Mason
She came rather imperceptibly
He had accepted her impersonally along with the office furnishing the office boy Morrison the chief confidential and only clerk and all the rest of the accessories of a supermans gambling place of business
Had he been asked any time during the first months she was in his employ he would have been unable to tell the color of her eyes
From the fact that she was a demiblonde there resided dimly in his subconsciousness a conception that she was a brunette
Likewise he had an idea that she was not thin while there was an absence in his mind of any idea that she was fat
As to how she dressed he had no ideas at all
He had no trained eye in such matters nor was he interested
He took it for granted in the lack of any impression to the contrary that she was dressed some how
He knew her as Miss Mason and that was all though he was aware that as a stenographer she seemed quick and accurate
This impression however was quite vague for he had had no experience with other stenographers and naturally believed that they were all quick and accurate
One morning signing up letters he came upon an I shall
Glancing quickly over the page for similar constructions he found a number of I wills
The I shall was alone
It stood out conspicuously
He pressed the callbell twice and a moment later Dede Mason entered
Did I say that Miss Mason
he asked extending the letter to her and pointing out the criminal phrase
A shade of annoyance crossed her face
She stood convicted
My mistake she said
I am sorry
But its not a mistake you know she added quickly
How do you make that out
challenged Daylight
It sure dont sound right in my way of thinking
She had reached the door by this time and now turned the offending letter in her hand
Its right just the same
But that would make all those I wills wrong then he argued
It does was her audacious answer
Shall I change them
I shall be over to look that affair up on Monday
Daylight repeated the sentence from the letter aloud
He did it with a grave serious air listening intently to the sound of his own voice
He shook his head
It dont sound right Miss Mason
It just dont sound right
Why nobody writes to me that way
They all say I willeducated men too some of them
Aint that so
Yes she acknowledged and passed out to her machine to make the correction
It chanced that day that among the several men with whom he sat at luncheon was a young Englishman a mining engineer
Had it happened any other time it would have passed unnoticed but fresh from the tilt with his stenographer Daylight was struck immediately by the Englishmans I shall
Several times in the course of the meal the phrase was repeated and Daylight was certain there was no mistake about it
After luncheon he cornered Macintosh one of the members whom he knew to have been a college man because of his football reputation
Look here Bunny Daylight demanded which is right I shall be over to look that affair up on Monday or I will be over to look that affair up on Monday
The exfootball captain debated painfully for a minute
Blessed if I know he confessed
Which way do I say it
Oh I will of course
Then the other is right depend upon it
I always was rotten on grammar
On the way back to the office Daylight dropped into a bookstore and bought a grammar and for a solid hour his feet up on the desk he toiled through its pages
Knock off my head with little apples if the girl aint right he communed aloud at the end of the session
For the first time it struck him that there was something about his stenographer
He had accepted her up to then as a female creature and a bit of office furnishing
But now having demonstrated that she knew more grammar than did business men and college graduates she became an individual
She seemed to stand out in his consciousness as conspicuously as the I shall had stood out on the typed page and he began to take notice
He managed to watch her leaving that afternoon and he was aware for the first time that she was wellformed and that her manner of dress was satisfying
He knew none of the details of womens dress and he saw none of the details of her neat shirtwaist and wellcut tailor suit
He saw only the effect in a general sketchy way
She looked right
This was in the absence of anything wrong or out of the way
Shes a trim little goodlooker was his verdict when the outer office door closed on her
The next morning dictating he concluded that he liked the way she did her hair though for the life of him he could have given no description of it
The impression was pleasing that was all
She sat between him and the window and he noted that her hair was light brown with hints of golden bronze
A pale sun shining in touched the golden bronze into smouldering fires that were very pleasing to behold
Funny he thought that he had never observed this phenomenon before
In the midst of the letter he came to the construction which had caused the trouble the day before
He remembered his wrestle with the grammar and dictated
I shall meet you halfway this proposition Miss Mason gave a quick look up at him
The action was purely involuntary and in fact had been half a startle of surprise
The next instant her eyes had dropped again and she sat waiting to go on with the dictation
But in that moment of her glance Daylight had noted that her eyes were gray
He was later to learn that at times there were golden lights in those same gray eyes but he had seen enough as it was to surprise him for he became suddenly aware that he had always taken her for a brunette with brown eyes as a matter of course
You were right after all he confessed with a sheepish grin that sat incongruously on his stern Indianlike features
Again he was rewarded by an upward glance and an acknowledging smile and this time he verified the fact that her eyes were gray
But it dont sound right just the same he complained
At this she laughed outright
I beg your pardon she hastened to make amends and then spoiled it by adding but you are so funny
Daylight began to feel a slight awkwardness and the sun would persist in setting her hair asmouldering
I didnt mean to be funny he said
That was why I laughed
But it is right and perfectly good grammar
All right he sighedI shall meet you halfway in this propositiongot that
And the dictation went on
He discovered that in the intervals when she had nothing to do she read books and magazines or worked on some sort of feminine fancy work
Passing her desk once he picked up a volume of Kiplings poems and glanced bepuzzled through the pages
You like reading Miss Mason
he said laying the book down
Oh yes was her answer very much
Another time it was a book of Wells The Wheels of Change
Whats it all about
Daylight asked
Oh its just a novel a lovestory
She stopped but he still stood waiting and she felt it incumbent to go on
Its about a little Cockney drapers assistant who takes a vacation on his bicycle and falls in with a young girl very much above him
Her mother is a popular writer and all that
And the situation is very curious and sad too and tragic
Would you care to read it
Does he get her
Daylight demanded
No thats the point of it
He wasnt And he doesnt get her and youve read all them pages hundreds of them to find that out
Daylight muttered in amazement
Miss Mason was nettled as well as amused
But you read the mining and financial news by the hour she retorted
But I sure get something out of that
Its business and its different
I get money out of it
What do you get out of books
Points of view new ideas life
Not worth a cent cash
But lifes worth more than cash she argued
Oh well he said with easy masculine tolerance so long as you enjoy it
Thats what counts I suppose and theres no accounting for taste
Despite his own superior point of view he had an idea that she knew a lot and he experienced a fleeting feeling like that of a barbarian face to face with the evidence of some tremendous culture
To Daylight culture was a worthless thing and yet somehow he was vaguely troubled by a sense that there was more in culture than he imagined
Again on her desk in passing he noticed a book with which he was familiar
This time he did not stop for he had recognized the cover
It was a magazine correspondents book on the Klondike and he knew that he and his photograph figured in it and he knew also of a certain sensational chapter concerned with a womans suicide and with one Too much Daylight
After that he did not talk with her again about books
He imagined what erroneous conclusions she had drawn from that particular chapter and it stung him the more in that they were undeserved
Of all unlikely things to have the reputation of being a ladykillerhe Burning Daylightand to have a woman kill herself out of love for him
He felt that he was a most unfortunate man and wondered by what luck that one book of all the thousands of books should have fallen into his stenographers hands
For some days afterward he had an uncomfortable sensation of guiltiness whenever he was in Miss Masons presence and once he was positive that he caught her looking at him with a curious intent gaze as if studying what manner of man he was
He pumped Morrison the clerk who had first to vent his personal grievance against Miss Mason before he could tell what little he knew of her
She comes from Siskiyou County
Shes very nice to work with in the office of course but shes rather stuck on herself exclusive you know
How do you make that out
Daylight queried
Well she thinks too much of herself to associate with those she works with in the office here for instance
She wont have anything to do with a fellow you see
Ive asked her out repeatedly to the theatre and the chutes and such things
But nothing doing
Says she likes plenty of sleep and cant stay up late and has to go all the way to Berkeleythats where she lives
This phase of the report gave Daylight a distinct satisfaction
She was a bit above the ordinary and no doubt about it
But Morrisons next words carried a hurt
But thats all hot air
Shes running with the University boys thats what shes doing
She needs lots of sleep and cant go to the theatre with me but she can dance all hours with them
Ive heard it pretty straight that she goes to all their hops and such things
Rather stylish and hightoned for a stenographer Id say
And she keeps a horse too
She rides astride all over those hills out there
I saw her one Sunday myself
Oh shes a highflyer and I wonder how she does it
Sixtyfive a month dont go far
Then she has a sick brother too
Live with her people
Daylight asked
No hasnt got any
They were well to do Ive heard
They must have been or that brother of hers couldnt have gone to the University of California
Her father had a big cattleranch but he got to fooling with mines or something and went broke before he died
Her mother died long before that
Her brother must cost a lot of money
He was a husky once played football was great on hunting and being out in the mountains and such things
He got his accident breaking horses and then rheumatism or something got into him
One leg is shorter than the other and withered up some
He has to walk on crutches
I saw her out with him oncecrossing the ferry
The doctors have been experimenting on him for years and hes in the French Hospital now I think
All of which sidelights on Miss Mason went to increase Daylights interest in her
Yet much as he desired he failed to get acquainted with her
He had thoughts of asking her to luncheon but his was the innate chivalry of the frontiersman and the thoughts never came to anything
He knew a selfrespecting squaredealing man was not supposed to take his stenographer to luncheon
Such things did happen he knew for he heard the chaffing gossip of the club but he did not think much of such men and felt sorry for the girls
He had a strange notion that a man had less rights over those he employed than over mere acquaintances or strangers
Thus had Miss Mason not been his employee he was confident that he would have had her to luncheon or the theatre in no time
But he felt that it was an imposition for an employer because he bought the time of an employee in working hours to presume in any way upon any of the rest of that employees time
To do so was to act like a bully
The situation was unfair
It was taking advantage of the fact that the employee was dependent on one for a livelihood
The employee might permit the imposition through fear of angering the employer and not through any personal inclination at all
In his own case he felt that such an imposition would be peculiarly obnoxious for had she not read that cursed Klondike correspondents book
A pretty idea she must have of him a girl that was too hightoned to have anything to do with a goodlooking gentlemanly fellow like Morrison
Also and down under all his other reasons Daylight was timid
The only thing he had ever been afraid of in his life was woman and he had been afraid all his life
Nor was that timidity to be put easily to flight now that he felt the first glimmering need and desire for woman
The specter of the apronstring still haunted him and helped him to find excuses for getting on no forwarder with Dede Mason
CHAPTER VII Not being favored by chance in getting acquainted with Dede Mason Daylights interest in her slowly waned
This was but natural for he was plunged deep in hazardous operations and the fascinations of the game and the magnitude of it accounted for all the energy that even his magnificent organism could generate
Such was his absorption that the pretty stenographer slowly and imperceptibly faded from the forefront of his consciousness
Thus the first faint spur in the best sense of his need for woman ceased to prod
So far as Dede Mason was concerned he possessed no more than a complacent feeling of satisfaction in that he had a very nice stenographer
And completely to put the quietus on any last lingering hopes he might have had of her he was in the thick of his spectacular and intensely bitter fight with the Coastwise Steam Navigation Company and the Hawaiian Nicaraguan and PacificMexican SteamshipCompany
He stirred up a bigger muss than he had anticipated and even he was astounded at the wide ramifications of the struggle and at the unexpected and incongruous interests that were drawn into it
Every newspaper in San Francisco turned upon him
It was true one or two of them had first intimated that they were open to subsidization but Daylights judgment was that the situation did not warrant such expenditure
Up to this time the press had been amusingly tolerant and goodnaturedly sensational about him but now he was to learn what virulent scrupulousness an antagonized press was capable of
Every episode of his life was resurrected to serve as foundations for malicious fabrications
Daylight was frankly amazed at the new interpretation put upon all he had accomplished and the deeds he had done
From an Alaskan hero he was metamorphosed into an Alaskan bully liar desperado and all around bad Man
Not content with this lies upon lies out of whole cloth were manufactured about him
He never replied though once he went to the extent of disburdening his mind to half a dozen reporters
Do your damnedest he told them
Burning Daylights bucked bigger things than your dirty lying sheets
And I dont blame you boys that is not much
You cant help it
Youve got to live
Theres a mighty lot of women in this world that make their living in similar fashion to yours because theyre not able to do anything better
Somebodys got to do the dirty work and it might as well be you
Youre paid for it and you aint got the backbone to rustle cleaner jobs
The socialist press of the city jubilantly exploited this utterance scattering it broadcast over San Francisco in tens of thousands of paper dodgers
And the journalists stung to the quick retaliated with the only means in their powerprinters ink abuse
The attack became bitterer than ever
The whole affair sank to the deeper deeps of rancor and savageness
The poor woman who had killed herself was dragged out of her grave and paraded on thousands of reams of paper as a martyr and a victim to Daylights ferocious brutality
Staid statistical articles were published proving that he had made his start by robbing poor miners of their claims and that the capstone to his fortune had been put in place by his treacherous violation of faith with the Guggenhammers in the deal on Ophir
And there were editorials written in which he was called an enemy of society possessed of the manners and culture of a caveman a fomenter of wasteful business troubles the destroyer of the citys prosperity in commerce and trade an anarchist of dire menace and one editorial gravely recommended that hanging would be a lesson to him and his ilk and concluded with the fervent hope that some day his big motorcar would smash up and smash him with it
He was like a big bear raiding a beehive and regardless of the stings he obstinately persisted in pawing for the honey
He gritted his teeth and struck back
Beginning with a raid on two steamship companies it developed into a pitched battle with a city a state and a continental coastline
Very well they wanted fight and they would get it
It was what he wanted and he felt justified in having come down from the Klondike for here he was gambling at a bigger table than ever the Yukon had supplied
Allied with him on a splendid salary with princely pickings thrown in was a lawyer Larry Hegan a young Irishman with a reputation to make and whose peculiar genius had been unrecognized until Daylight picked up with him
Hegan had Celtic imagination and daring and to such degree that Daylights cooler head was necessary as a check on his wilder visions
Hegans was a Napoleonic legal mind without balance and it was just this balance that Daylight supplied
Alone the Irishman was doomed to failure but directed by Daylight he was on the highroad to fortune and recognition
Also he was possessed of no more personal or civic conscience than Napoleon
It was Hegan who guided Daylight through the intricacies of modern politics labor organization and commercial and corporation law
It was Hegan prolific of resource and suggestion who opened Daylights eyes to undreamed possibilities in twentiethcentury warfare and it was Daylight rejecting accepting and elaborating who planned the campaigns and prosecuted them
With the Pacific coast from Peugeot Sound to Panama buzzing and humming and with San Francisco furiously about his ears the two big steamship companies had all the appearance of winning
It looked as if Burning Daylight was being beaten slowly to his knees
And then he struckat the steamship companies at San Francisco at the whole Pacific coast
It was not much of a blow at first
A Christian Endeavor convention being held in San Francisco a row was started by Express Drivers Union No
927 over the handling of a small heap of baggage at the Ferry Building
A few heads were broken a score of arrests made and the baggage was delivered
No one would have guessed that behind this petty wrangle was the fine Irish hand of Hegan made potent by the Klondike gold of Burning Daylight
It was an insignificant affair at bestor so it seemed
But the Teamsters Union took up the quarrel backed by the whole Water Front Federation
Step by step the strike became involved
A refusal of cooks and waiters to serve scab teamsters or teamsters employers brought out the cooks and waiters
The butchers and meatcutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
The combined Employers Associations put up a solid front and found facing them the 40000 organized laborers of San Francisco
The restaurant bakers and the bakery wagon drivers struck followed by the milkers milk drivers and chicken pickers
The building trades asserted its position in unambiguous terms and all San Francisco was in turmoil
But still it was only San Francisco
Hegans intrigues were masterly and Daylights campaign steadily developed
The powerful fighting organization known as the Pacific Slope Seamans Union refused to work vessels the cargoes of which were to be handled by scab longshoremen and freighthandlers
The union presented its ultimatum and then called a strike
This had been Daylights objective all the time
Every incoming coastwise vessel was boarded by the union officials and its crew sent ashore
And with the Seamen went the firemen the engineers and the sea cooks and waiters
Daily the number of idle steamers increased
It was impossible to get scab crews for the men of the Seamans Union were fighters trained in the hard school of the sea and when they went out it meant blood and death to scabs
This phase of the strike spread up and down the entire Pacific coast until all the ports were filled with idle ships and sea transportation was at a standstill
The days and weeks dragged out and the strike held
The Coastwise Steam Navigation Company and the Hawaiian Nicaraguan and PacificMexican Steamship Company were tied up completely
The expenses of combating the strike were tremendous and they were earning nothing while daily the situation went from bad to worse until peace at any price became the cry
And still there was no peace until Daylight and his allies played out their hand raked in the winnings and allowed a goodly portion of a continent to resume business
It was noted in following years that several leaders of workmen built themselves houses and blocks of renting flats and took trips to the old countries while more immediately other leaders and dark horses came to political preferment and the control of the municipal government and the municipal moneys
In fact San Franciscos bossridden condition was due in greater degree to Daylights widespreading battle than even San Francisco ever dreamed
For the part he had played the details of which were practically all rumor and guesswork quickly leaked out and in consequence he became a muchexecrated and wellhated man
Nor had Daylight himself dreamed that his raid on the steamship companies would have grown to such colossal proportions
But he had got what he was after
He had played an exciting hand and won beating the steamship companies down into the dust and mercilessly robbing the stockholders by perfectly legal methods before he let go
Of course in addition to the large sums of money he had paid over his allies had rewarded themselves by gobbling the advantages which later enabled them to loot the city
His alliance with a gang of cutthroats had brought about a lot of cutthroating
But his conscience suffered no twinges
He remembered what he had once heard an old preacher utter namely that they who rose by the sword perished by the sword
One took his chances when he played with cutting throats and his Daylights throat was still intact
That was it
And he had won
It was all gamble and war between the strong men
The fools did not count
They were always getting hurt and that they always had been getting hurt was the conclusion he drew from what little he knew of history
San Francisco had wanted war and he had given it war
It was the game
All the big fellows did the same and they did much worse too
Dont talk to me about morality and civic duty he replied to a persistent interviewer
If you quit your job tomorrow and went to work on another paper you would write just what you were told to write
Its morality and civic duty now with you on the new job it would be backing up a thieving railroad with morality and civic duty I suppose
Your price my son is just about thirty per week
Thats what you sell for
But your paper would sell for a bit more
Pay its price today and it would shift its present rotten policy to some other rotten policy but it would never let up on morality and civic duty
And all because a sucker is born every minute
So long as the people stand for it theyll get it good and plenty my son
And the shareholders and business interests might as well shut up squawking about how much theyve been hurt
You never hear ary squeal out of them when theyve got the other fellow down and are gouging him
This is the time THEY got gouged and thats all there is to it
Talk about mollycoddles
Son those same fellows would steal crusts from starving men and pull gold fillings from the mouths of corpses yep and squawk like Sam Scratch if some blamed corpse hit back
Theyre all tarred with the same brush little and big
Look at your Sugar Trustwith all its millions stealing water like a common thief from New York City and shortweighing the government on its phoney scales
Morality and civic duty
Son forget it
CHAPTER VIII Daylights coming to civilization had not improved him
True he wore better clothes had learned slightly better manners and spoke better English
As a gambler and a mantrampler he had developed remarkable efficiency
Also he had become used to a higher standard of living and he had whetted his wits to razor sharpness in the fierce complicated struggle of fighting males
But he had hardened and at the expense of his oldtime wholesouled geniality
Of the essential refinements of civilization he knew nothing
He did not know they existed
He had become cynical bitter and brutal
Power had its effect on him that it had on all men
Suspicious of the big exploiters despising the fools of the exploited herd he had faith only in himself
This led to an undue and erroneous exaltation of his ego while kindly consideration of othersnay even simple respectwas destroyed until naught was left for him but to worship at the shrine of self
Physically he was not the man of iron muscles who had come down out of the Arctic
He did not exercise sufficiently ate more than was good for him and drank altogether too much
His muscles were getting flabby and his tailor called attention to his increasing waistband
In fact Daylight was developing a definite paunch
This physical deterioration was manifest likewise in his face
The lean Indian visage was suffering a city change
The slight hollows in the cheeks under the high cheekbones had filled out
The beginning of puffsacks under the eyes was faintly visible
The girth of the neck had increased and the first crease and fold of a double chin were becoming plainly discernible
The old effect of asceticism bred of terrific hardships and toil had vanished the features had become broader and heavier betraying all the stigmata of the life he lived advertising the mans selfindulgence harshness and brutality
Even his human affiliations were descending
Playing a lone hand contemptuous of most of the men with whom he played lacking in sympathy or understanding of them and certainly independent of them he found little in common with those to be encountered say at the AltaPacific
In point of fact when the battle with the steamship companies was at its height and his raid was inflicting incalculable damage on all business interests he had been asked to resign from the AltaPacific
The idea had been rather to his liking and he had found new quarters in clubs like the Riverside organized and practically maintained by the city bosses
He found that he really liked such men better
They were more primitive and simple and they did not put on airs
They were honest buccaneers frankly in the game for what they could get out of it on the surface more raw and savage but at least not glossed over with oily or graceful hypocrisy
The AltaPacific had suggested that his resignation be kept a private matter and then had privily informed the newspapers
The latter had made great capital out of the forced resignation but Daylight had grinned and silently gone his way though registering a black mark against more than one club member who was destined to feel in the days to come the crushing weight of the Klondikers financial paw
The stormcentre of a combined newspaper attack lasting for months Daylights character had been torn to shreds
There was no fact in his history that had not been distorted into a criminality or a vice
This public making of him over into an iniquitous monster had pretty well crushed any lingering hope he had of getting acquainted with Dede Mason
He felt that there was no chance for her ever to look kindly on a man of his caliber and beyond increasing her salary to seventyfive dollars a month he proceeded gradually to forget about her
The increase was made known to her through Morrison and later she thanked Daylight and that was the end of it
One weekend feeling heavy and depressed and tired of the city and its ways he obeyed the impulse of a whim that was later to play an important part in his life
The desire to get out of the city for a whiff of country air and for a change of scene was the cause
Yet to himself he made the excuse of going to Glen Ellen for the purpose of inspecting the brickyard with which Holdsworthy had goldbricked him
He spent the night in the little country hotel and on Sunday morning astride a saddlehorse rented from the Glen Ellen butcher rode out of the village
The brickyard was close at hand on the flat beside the Sonoma Creek
The kilns were visible among the trees when he glanced to the left and caught sight of a cluster of wooded knolls half a mile away perched on the rolling slopes of Sonoma Mountain
The mountain itself wooded towered behind
The trees on the knolls seemed to beckon to him
The dry earlysummer air shot through with sunshine was wine to him
Unconsciously he drank it in deep breaths
The prospect of the brickyard was uninviting
He was jaded with all things business and the wooded knolls were calling to him
A horse was between his legsa good horse he decided one that sent him back to the cayuses he had ridden during his eastern Oregon boyhood
He had been somewhat of a rider in those early days and the champ of bit and creak of saddleleather sounded good to him now
Resolving to have his fun first and to look over the brickyard afterward he rode on up the hill prospecting for a way across country to get to the knolls
He left the country road at the first gate he came to and cantered through a hayfield
The grain was waisthigh on either side the wagon road and he sniffed the warm aroma of it with delighted nostrils
Larks flew up before him and from everywhere came mellow notes
From the appearance of the road it was patent that it had been used for hauling clay to the now idle brickyard
Salving his conscience with the idea that this was part of the inspection he rode on to the claypita huge scar in a hillside
But he did not linger long swinging off again to the left and leaving the road
Not a farmhouse was in sight and the change from the city crowding was essentially satisfying
He rode now through open woods across little flowerscattered glades till he came upon a spring
Flat on the ground he drank deeply of the clear water and looking about him felt with a shock the beauty of the world
It came to him like a discovery he had never realized it before he concluded and also he had forgotten much
One could not sit in at high finance and keep track of such things
As he drank in the air the scene and the distant song of larks he felt like a pokerplayer rising from a nightlong table and coming forth from the pent atmosphere to taste the freshness of the morn
At the base of the knolls he encountered a tumbledown stakeandrider fence
From the look of it he judged it must be forty years old at leastthe work of some first pioneer who had taken up the land when the days of gold had ended
The woods were very thick here yet fairly clear of underbrush so that while the blue sky was screened by the arched branches he was able to ride beneath
He now found himself in a nook of several acres where the oak and manzanita and madrono gave way to clusters of stately redwoods
Against the foot of a steepsloped knoll he came upon a magnificent group of redwoods that seemed to have gathered about a tiny gurgling spring
He halted his horse for beside the spring uprose a wild California lily
It was a wonderful flower growing there in the cathedral nave of lofty trees
At least eight feet in height its stem rose straight and slender green and bare for twothirds its length and then burst into a shower of snowwhite waxen bells
There were hundreds of these blossoms all from the one stem delicately poised and ethereally frail
Daylight had never seen anything like it
Slowly his gaze wandered from it to all that was about him
He took off his hat with almost a vague religious feeling
This was different
No room for contempt and evil here
This was clean and fresh and beautifulsomething he could respect
It was like a church
The atmosphere was one of holy calm
Here man felt the prompting of nobler things
Much of this and more was in Daylights heart as he looked about him
But it was not a concept of his mind
He merely felt it without thinking about it at all
On the steep incline above the spring grew tiny maidenhair ferns while higher up were larger ferns and brakes
Great mosscovered trunks of fallen trees lay here and there slowly sinking back and merging into the level of the forest mould
Beyond in a slightly clearer space wild grape and honeysuckle swung in green riot from gnarled old oak trees
A gray Douglas squirrel crept out on a branch and watched him
From somewhere came the distant knocking of a woodpecker
This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place
Quiet woods noises belonged there and made the solitude complete
The tiny bubbling ripple of the spring and the gray flash of treesquirrel were as yardsticks with which to measure the silence and motionless repose
Might be a million miles from anywhere Daylight whispered to himself
But ever his gaze returned to the wonderful lily beside the bubbling spring
He tethered the horse and wandered on foot among the knolls
Their tops were crowned with centuryold spruce trees and their sides clothed with oaks and madronos and native holly
But to the perfect redwoods belonged the small but deep canon that threaded its way among the knolls
Here he found no passage out for his horse and he returned to the lily beside the spring
On foot tripping stumbling leading the animal he forced his way up the hillside
And ever the ferns carpeted the way of his feet ever the forest climbed with him and arched overhead and ever the clean joy and sweetness stole in upon his senses
On the crest he came through an amazing thicket of velvettrunked young madronos and emerged on an open hillside that led down into a tiny valley
The sunshine was at first dazzling in its brightness and he paused and rested for he was panting from the exertion
Not of old had he known shortness of breath such as this and muscles that so easily tired at a stiff climb
A tiny stream ran down the tiny valley through a tiny meadow that was carpeted kneehigh with grass and blue and white nemophila
The hillside was covered with Mariposa lilies and wild hyacinth down through which his horse dropped slowly with circumspect feet and reluctant gait
Crossing the stream Daylight followed a faint cattle trail over a low rocky hill and through a winewooded forest of manzanita and emerged upon another tiny valley down which filtered another springfed meadowbordered streamlet
A jackrabbit bounded from a bush under his horses nose leaped the stream and vanished up the opposite hillside of scruboak
Daylight watched it admiringly as he rode on to the head of the meadow
Here he startled up a manypronged buck that seemed to soar across the meadow and to soar over the stakeandrider fence and still soaring disappeared in a friendly copse beyond
Daylights delight was unbounded
It seemed to him that he had never been so happy
His old woods training was aroused and he was keenly interested in everything in the moss on the trees and branches in the bunches of mistletoe hanging in the oaks in the nest of a woodrat in the watercress growing in the sheltered eddies of the little stream in the butterflies drifting through the rifted sunshine and shadow in the blue jays that flashed in splashes of gorgeous color across the forest aisles in the tiny birds like wrens that hopped among the bushes and imitated certain minor quailcalls and in the crimsoncrested woodpecker that ceased its knocking and cocked its head on one side to survey him
Crossing the stream he struck faint vestiges of a woodroad used evidently a generation back when the meadow had been cleared of its oaks
He found a hawks nest on the lightningshattered tipmost top of a sixfoot redwood
And to complete it all his horse stumbled upon several large broods of halfgrown quail and the air was filled with the thrum of their flight
He halted and watched the young ones petrifying and disappearing on the ground before his eyes and listening to the anxious calls of the old ones hidden in the thickets
It sure beats country places and bungalows at Menlo Park he communed aloud and if ever I get the hankering for country life its me for this every time
The old woodroad led him to a clearing where a dozen acres of grapes grew on winered soil
A cowpath more trees and thickets and he dropped down a hillside to the southeast exposure
Here poised above a big forested canon and looking out upon Sonoma Valley was a small farmhouse
With its barn and outhouses it snuggled into a nook in the hillside which protected it from west and north
It was the erosion from this hillside he judged that had formed the little level stretch of vegetable garden
The soil was fat and black and there was water in plenty for he saw several faucets running wide open
Forgotten was the brickyard
Nobody was at home but Daylight dismounted and ranged the vegetable garden eating strawberries and green peas inspecting the old adobe barn and the rusty plough and harrow and rolling and smoking cigarettes while he watched the antics of several broods of young chickens and the mother hens
A foottrail that led down the wall of the big canyon invited him and he proceeded to follow it
A waterpipe usually above ground paralleled the trail which he concluded led upstream to the bed of the creek
The wall of the canon was several hundred feet from top to bottom and magnificent were the untouched trees that the place was plunged in perpetual shade
He measured with his eye spruces five and six feet in diameter and redwoods even larger
One such he passed a twister that was at least ten or eleven feet through
The trail led straight to a small dam where was the intake for the pipe that watered the vegetable garden
Here beside the stream were alders and laurel trees and he walked through fernbrakes higher than his head
Velvety moss was everywhere out of which grew maidenhair and goldback ferns
Save for the dam it was a virgin wild
No ax had invaded and the trees died only of old age and stress of winter storm
The huge trunks of those that had fallen lay mosscovered slowly resolving back into the soil from which they sprang
Some had lain so long that they were quite gone though their faint outlines level with the mould could still be seen
Others bridged the stream and from beneath the bulk of one monster half a dozen younger trees overthrown and crushed by the fall growing out along the ground still lived and prospered their roots bathed by the stream their upshooting branches catching the sunlight through the gap that had been made in the forest roof
Back at the farmhouse Daylight mounted and rode on away from the ranch and into the wilder canons and steeper steeps beyond
Nothing could satisfy his holiday spirit now but the ascent of Sonoma Mountain
And here on the crest three hours afterward he emerged tired and sweaty garments torn and face and hands scratched but with sparkling eyes and an unwonted zestfulness of expression
He felt the illicit pleasure of a schoolboy playing truant
The big gambling table of San Francisco seemed very far away
But there was more than illicit pleasure in his mood
It was as though he were going through a sort of cleansing bath
No room here for all the sordidness meanness and viciousness that filled the dirty pool of city existence
Without pondering in detail upon the matter at all his sensations were of purification and uplift
Had he been asked to state how he felt he would merely have said that he was having a good time for he was unaware in his selfconsciousness of the potent charm of nature that was percolating through his cityrotted body and brainpotent in that he came of an abysmal past of wilderness dwellers while he was himself coated with but the thinnest rind of crowded civilization
There were no houses in the summit of Sonoma Mountain and all alone under the azure California sky he reined in on the southern edge of the peak
He saw open pasture country intersected with wooded canons descending to the south and west from his feet crease on crease and roll on roll from lower level to lower level to the floor of Petaluma Valley flat as a billiardtable a cardboard affair all patches and squares of geometrical regularity where the fat freeholds were farmed
Beyond to the west rose range on range of mountains cuddling purple mists of atmosphere in their valleys and still beyond over the last range of all he saw the silver sheen of the Pacific
Swinging his horse he surveyed the west and north from Santa Rosa to St Helena and on to the east across Sonoma to the chaparralcovered range that shut off the view of Napa Valley
Here part way up the eastern wall of Sonoma Valley in range of a line intersecting the little village of Glen Ellen he made out a scar upon a hillside
His first thought was that it was the dump of a mine tunnel but remembering that he was not in goldbearing country he dismissed the scar from his mind and continued the circle of his survey to the southeast where across the waters of San Pablo Bay he could see sharp and distant the twin peaks of Mount Diablo
To the south was Mount Tamalpais and yes he was right fifty miles away where the draughty winds of the Pacific blew in the Golden Gate the smoke of San Francisco made a lowlying haze against the sky
I aint seen so much country all at once in many a day he thought aloud
He was loath to depart and it was not for an hour that he was able to tear himself away and take the descent of the mountain
Working out a new route just for the fun of it late afternoon was upon him when he arrived back at the wooded knolls
Here on the top of one of them his keen eyes caught a glimpse of a shade of green sharply differentiated from any he had seen all day
Studying it for a minute he concluded that it was composed of three cypress trees and he knew that nothing else than the hand of man could have planted them there
Impelled by curiosity purely boyish he made up his mind to investigate
So densely wooded was the knoll and so steep that he had to dismount and go up on foot at times even on hands and knees struggling hard to force a way through the thicker underbrush
He came out abruptly upon the cypresses
They were enclosed in a small square of ancient fence the pickets he could plainly see had been hewn and sharpened by hand
Inside were the mounds of two childrens graves
Two wooden headboards likewise handhewn told the state Little David born 1855 died 1859 and Little Roy born 1853 died 1860
The poor little kids Daylight muttered
The graves showed signs of recent care
Withered bouquets of wild flowers were on the mounds and the lettering on the headboards was freshly painted
Guided by these clews Daylight cast about for a trail and found one leading down the side opposite to his ascent
Circling the base of the knoll he picked up with his horse and rode on to the farmhouse
Smoke was rising from the chimney and he was quickly in conversation with a nervous slender young man who he learned was only a tenant on the ranch
How large was it
A matter of one hundred and eighty acres though it seemed much larger
This was because it was so irregularly shaped
Yes it included the claypit and all the knolls and its boundary that ran along the big canon was over a mile long
You see the young man said it was so rough and broken that when they began to farm this country the farmers bought in the good land to the edge of it
Thats why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
Oh yes he and his wife managed to scratch a living without working too hard
They didnt have to pay much rent
Hillard the owner depended on the income from the claypit
Hillard was well off and had big ranches and vineyards down on the flat of the valley
The brickyard paid ten cents a cubic yard for the clay
As for the rest of the ranch the land was good in patches where it was cleared like the vegetable garden and the vineyard but the rest of it was too much upanddown
Youre not a farmer Daylight said
The young man laughed and shook his head
No Im a telegraph operator
But the wife and I decided to take a two years vacation and here we are But the times about up
Im going back into the office this fall after I get the grapes off
Yes there were about eleven acres in the vineyardwine grapes
The price was usually good
He grew most of what they ate
If he owned the place hed clear a patch of land on the sidehill above the vineyard and plant a small home orchard
The soil was good
There was plenty of pasturage all over the ranch and there were several cleared patches amounting to about fifteen acres in all where he grew as much mountain hay as could be found
It sold for three to five dollars more a ton than the rankstalked valley hay
Daylight listened there came to him a sudden envy of this young fellow living right in the midst of all this which Daylight had travelled through the last few hours
What in thunder are you going back to the telegraph office for
he demanded
The young man smiled with a certain wistfulness
Because we cant get ahead here he hesitated an instant and because there are added expenses coming
The rent small as it is counts and besides Im not strong enough to effectually farm the place
If I owned it or if I were a real husky like you Id ask nothing better
Nor would the wife
Again the wistful smile hovered on his face
You see were country born and after bucking with cities for a few years we kind of feel we like the country best
Weve planned to get ahead though and then some day well buy a patch of land and stay with it
The graves of the children
Yes he had relettered them and hoed the weeds out
It had become the custom
Whoever lived on the ranch did that
For years the story ran the father and mother had returned each summer to the graves
But there had come a time when they came no more and then old Hillard started the custom
The scar across the valley
An old mine
It had never paid
The men had worked on it off and on for years for the indications had been good
But that was years and years ago
No paying mine had ever been struck in the valley though there had been no end of prospectholes put down and there had been a sort of rush there thirty years back
A fraillooking young woman came to the door to call the young man to supper
Daylights first thought was that city living had not agreed with her
And then he noted the slight tan and healthy glow that seemed added to her face and he decided that the country was the place for her
Declining an invitation to supper he rode on for Glen Ellen sitting slackkneed in the saddle and softly humming forgotten songs
He dropped down the rough winding road through covered pasture with here and there thickets of manzanita and vistas of open glades
He listened greedily to the quail calling and laughed outright once in sheer joy at a tiny chipmunk that fled scolding up a bank slipping on the crumbly surface and falling down then dashing across the road under his horses nose and still scolding scrabbling up a protecting oak
Daylight could not persuade himself to keep to the travelled roads that day and another cut across country to Glen Ellen brought him upon a canon that so blocked his way that he was glad to follow a friendly cowpath
This led him to a small frame cabin
The doors and windows were open and a cat was nursing a litter of kittens in the doorway but no one seemed at home
He descended the trail that evidently crossed the canon
Part way down he met an old man coming up through the sunset
In his hand he carried a pail of foamy milk
He wore no hat and in his face framed with snowwhite hair and beard was the ruddy glow and content of the passing summer day
Daylight thought that he had never seen so contentedlooking a being
How old are you daddy
he queried
Eightyfour was the reply
Yes sirree eightyfourand spryer than most
You must a taken good care of yourself Daylight suggested
I dont know about that
I aint loafed none
I walked across the Plains with an oxteam and fit Injuns in 51 and I was a family man then with seven youngsters
I reckon I was as old then as you are now or pretty nigh on to it
Dont you find it lonely here
The old man shifted the pail of milk and reflected
That all depends he said oracularly
I aint never been lonely except when the old wife died
Some fellers are lonely in a crowd and Im one of them
Thats the only time Im lonely is when I go to Frisco
But I dont go no more thank you most to death
This is good enough for me
Ive ben right here in this valley since 54one of the first settlers after the Spaniards
Daylight started his horse saying Well good night daddy
Stick with it
You got all the young bloods skinned and I guess youve sure buried a mighty sight of them
The old man chuckled and Daylight rode on singularly at peace with himself and all the world
It seemed that the old contentment of trail and camp he had known on the Yukon had come back to him
He could not shake from his eyes the picture of the old pioneer coming up the trail through the sunset light
He was certainly going some for eightyfour
The thought of following his example entered Daylights mind but the big game of San Francisco vetoed the idea
Well anyway he decided when I get old and quit the game Ill settle down in a place something like this and the city can go to hell
CHAPTER IX Instead of returning to the city on Monday Daylight rented the butchers horse for another day and crossed the bed of the valley to its eastern hills to look at the mine
It was dryer and rockier here than where he had been the day before and the ascending slopes supported mainly chaparral scrubby and dense and impossible to penetrate on horseback
But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth
The mine was an abandoned affair but he enjoyed the halfhours scramble around
He had had experience in quartzmining before he went to Alaska and he enjoyed the recrudescence of his old wisdom in such matters
The story was simple to him good prospects that warranted the starting of the tunnel into the sidehill the three months work and the getting short of money the layoff while the men went away and got jobs then the return and a new stretch of work with the pay ever luring and ever receding into the mountain until after years of hope the men had given up and vanished
Most likely they were dead by now Daylight thought as he turned in the saddle and looked back across the canyon at the ancient dump and dark mouth of the tunnel
As on the previous day just for the joy of it he followed cattletrails at haphazard and worked his way up toward the summits
Coming out on a wagon road that led upward he followed it for several miles emerging in a small mountainencircled valley where half a dozen poor ranchers farmed the winegrapes on the steep slopes
Beyond the road pitched upward
Dense chaparral covered the exposed hillsides but in the creases of the canons huge spruce trees grew and wild oats and flowers
Half an hour later sheltering under the summits themselves he came out on a clearing
Here and there in irregular patches where the steep and the soil favored wine grapes were growing
Daylight could see that it had been a stiff struggle and that wild nature showed fresh signs of winningchaparral that had invaded the clearings patches and parts of patches of vineyard unpruned grassgrown and abandoned and everywhere old stakeandrider fences vainly striving to remain intact
Here at a small farmhouse surrounded by large outbuildings the road ended
Beyond the chaparral blocked the way
He came upon an old woman forking manure in the barnyard and reined in by the fence
Hello mother was his greeting aint you got any menfolk around to do that for you
She leaned on her pitchfork hitched her skirt in at the waist and regarded him cheerfully
He saw that her toilworn weatherexposed hands were like a mans callused largeknuckled and gnarled and that her stockingless feet were thrust into heavy mans brogans
Nary a man she answered
And where be you from and all the way up here
Wont you stop and hitch and have a glass of wine
Striding clumsily but efficiently like a laboringman she led him into the largest building where Daylight saw a handpress and all the paraphernalia on a small scale for the making of wine
It was too far and too bad a road to haul the grapes to the valley wineries she explained and so they were compelled to do it themselves
They he learned were she and her daughter the latter a widow of fortyodd
It had been easier before the grandson died and before he went away to fight savages in the Philippines
He had died out there in battle
Daylight drank a full tumbler of excellent Riesling talked a few minutes and accounted for a second tumbler
Yes they just managed not to starve
Her husband and she had taken up this government land in 57 and cleared it and farmed it ever since until he died when she had carried it on
It actually didnt pay for the toil but what were they to do
There was the wine trust and wine was down
That Riesling
She delivered it to the railroad down in the valley for twentytwo cents a gallon
And it was a long haul
It took a day for the round trip
Her daughter was gone now with a load
Daylight knew that in the hotels Riesling not quite so good even was charged for at from a dollar and a half to two dollars a quart
And she got twentytwo cents a gallon
That was the game
She was one of the stupid lowly she and her people before herthe ones that did the work drove their oxen across the Plains cleared and broke the virgin land toiled all days and all hours paid their taxes and sent their sons and grandsons out to fight and die for the flag that gave them such ample protection that they were able to sell their wine for twentytwo cents
The same wine was served to him at the St Francis for two dollars a quart or eight dollars a short gallon
That was it
Between her and her handpress on the mountain clearing and him ordering his wine in the hotel was a difference of seven dollars and seventyeight cents
A clique of sleek men in the city got between her and him to just about that amount
And besides them there was a horde of others that took their whack
They called it railroading high finance banking wholesaling real estate and such things but the point was that they got it while she got what was lefttwentytwo cents
Oh well a sucker was born every minute he sighed to himself and nobody was to blame it was all a game and only a few could win but it was damned hard on the suckers
How old are you mother
he asked
Seventynine come next January
Worked pretty hard I suppose
Sense I was seven
I was bound out in Michigan state until I was womangrown
Then I married and I reckon the work got harder and harder
When are you going to take a rest
She looked at him as though she chose to think his question facetious and did not reply
Do you believe in God
She nodded her head
Then you get it all back he assured her but in his heart he was wondering about God that allowed so many suckers to be born and that did not break up the gambling game by which they were robbed from the cradle to the grave
How much of that Riesling you got
She ran her eyes over the casks and calculated
Just short of eight hundred gallons
He wondered what he could do with all of it and speculated as to whom he could give it away
What would you do if you got a dollar a gallon for it
he asked
Drop dead I suppose
No speaking seriously
Get me some false teeth shingle the house and buy a new wagon
The roads mighty hard on wagons
And after that
Buy me a coffin
Well theyre yours mother coffin and all
She looked her incredulity
No I mean it
And theres fifty to bind the bargain
Never mind the receipt
Its the rich ones that need watching their memories being so infernal short you know
Heres my address
Youve got to deliver it to the railroad
And now show me the way out of here
I want to get up to the top
On through the chaparral he went following faint cattle
trails and working slowly upward till he came out on the divide and gazed down into Napa Valley and back across to Sonoma Mountain A sweet land he muttered an almighty sweet land
Circling around to the right and dropping down along the cattletrails he quested for another way back to Sonoma Valley but the cattletrails seemed to fade out and the chaparral to grow thicker with a deliberate viciousness and even when he won through in places the canon and small feeders were too precipitous for his horse and turned him back
But there was no irritation about it
He enjoyed it all for he was back at his old game of bucking nature
Late in the afternoon he broke through and followed a welldefined trail down a dry canon
Here he got a fresh thrill
He had heard the baying of the hound some minutes before and suddenly across the bare face of the hill above him he saw a large buck in flight
And not far behind came the deerhound a magnificent animal
Daylight sat tense in his saddle and watched until they disappeared his breath just a trifle shorter as if he too were in the chase his nostrils distended and in his bones the old hunting ache and memories of the days before he came to live in cities
The dry canon gave place to one with a slender ribbon of running water
The trail ran into a woodroad and the woodroad emerged across a small flat upon a slightly travelled county road
There were no farms in this immediate section and no houses
The soil was meagre the bedrock either close to the surface or constituting the surface itself
Manzanita and scruboak however flourished and walled the road on either side with a jungle growth
And out a runway through this growth a man suddenly scuttled in a way that reminded Daylight of a rabbit
He was a little man in patched overalls bareheaded with a cotton shirt open at the throat and down the chest
The sun was ruddybrown in his face and by it his sandy hair was bleached on the ends to peroxide blond
He signed to Daylight to halt and held up a letter
If youre going to town Id be obliged if you mail this
I sure will
Daylight put it into his coat pocket
Do you live hereabouts stranger
But the little man did not answer
He was gazing at Daylight in a surprised and steadfast fashion
I know you the little man announced
Youre Elam HarnishBurning Daylight the papers call you
Am I right
Daylight nodded
But what under the sun are you doing here in the chaparral
Daylight grinned as he answered Drumming up trade for a free rural delivery route
Well Im glad I wrote that letter this afternoon the little man went on or else Id have missed seeing you
Ive seen your photo in the papers many a time and Ive a good memory for faces
I recognized you at once
My names Ferguson
Do you live hereabouts
Daylight repeated his query
Oh yes
Ive got a little shack back here in the bush a hundred yards and a pretty spring and a few fruit trees and berry bushes
Come in and take a look
And that spring is a dandy
You never tasted water like it
Come in and try it
Walking and leading his horse Daylight followed the quickstepping eager little man through the green tunnel and emerged abruptly upon the clearing if clearing it might be called where wild nature and mans earthscratching were inextricably blended
It was a tiny nook in the hills protected by the steep walls of a canon mouth
Here were several large oaks evidencing a richer soil
The erosion of ages from the hillside had slowly formed this deposit of fat earth
Under the oaks almost buried in them stood a rough unpainted cabin the wide verandah of which with chairs and hammocks advertised an outof doors bedchamber
Daylights keen eyes took in every thing
The clearing was irregular following the patches of the best soil and every fruit tree and berry bush and even each vegetable plant had the water personally conducted to it
The tiny irrigation channels were every where and along some of them the water was running
Ferguson looked eagerly into his visitors face for signs of approbation
What do you think of it eh
Handreared and manicured every blessed tree Daylight laughed but the joy and satisfaction that shone in his eyes contented the little man
Why dye know I know every one of those trees as if they were sons of mine
I planted them nursed them fed them and brought them up
Come on and peep at the spring
Its sure a hummer was Daylights verdict after due inspection and sampling as they turned back for the house
The interior was a surprise
The cooking being done in the small leanto kitchen the whole cabin formed a large living room
A great table in the middle was comfortably littered with books and magazines
All the available wall space from floor to ceiling was occupied by filled bookshelves
It seemed to Daylight that he had never seen so many books assembled in one place
Skins of wildcat coon and deer lay about on the pineboard floor
Shot them myself and tanned them too Ferguson proudly asserted
The crowning feature of the room was a huge fireplace of rough stones and boulders
Built it myself Ferguson proclaimed and by God she drew
Never a wisp of smoke anywhere save in the pointed channel and that during the big southeasters
Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man
Why was he hiding away here in the chaparral he and his books
He was nobodys fool anybody could see that
Then why
The whole affair had a tinge of adventure and Daylight accepted an invitation to supper half prepared to find his host a rawfruitandnuteater or some similar sort of health faddest
At table while eating rice and jackrabbit curry the latter shot by Ferguson they talked it over and Daylight found the little man had no food views
He ate whatever he liked and all he wanted avoiding only such combinations that experience had taught him disagreed with his digestion
Next Daylight surmised that he might be touched with religion but quest about as he would in a conversation covering the most divergent topics he could find no hint of queerness or unusualness
So it was when between them they had washed and wiped the dishes and put them away and had settled down to a comfortable smoke that Daylight put his question
Look here Ferguson
Ever since we got together Ive been casting about to find out whats wrong with you to locate a screw loose somewhere but Ill be danged if Ive succeeded
What are you doing here anyway
What made you come here
What were you doing for a living before you came here
Go ahead and elucidate yourself
Ferguson frankly showed his pleasure at the questions
First of all he began the doctors wound up by losing all hope for me
Gave me a few months at best and that after a course in sanatoriums and a trip to Europe and another to Hawaii
They tried electricity and forced feeding and fasting
I was a graduate of about everything in the curriculum
They kept me poor with their bills while I went from bad to worse
The trouble with me was two fold first I was a born weakling and next I was living unnaturallytoo much work and responsibility and strain
I was managing editor of the TimesTribune Daylight gasped mentally for the TimesTribune was the biggest and most influential paper in San Francisco and always had been so 
and I wasnt strong enough for the strain
Of course my body went back on me and my mind too for that matter
It had to be bolstered up with whiskey which wasnt good for it any more than was the living in clubs and hotels good for my stomach and the rest of me
That was what ailed me I was living all wrong
He shrugged his shoulders and drew at his pipe
When the doctors gave me up I wound up my affairs and gave the doctors up
That was fifteen years ago
Id been hunting through here when I was a boy on vacations from college and when I was all down and out it seemed a yearning came to me to go back to the country
So I quit quit everything absolutely and came to live in the Valley of the Moonthats the Indian name you know for Sonoma Valley
I lived in the leanto the first year then I built the cabin and sent for my books
I never knew what happiness was before nor health
Look at me now and dare to tell me that I look fortyseven
I wouldnt give a day over forty Daylight confessed
Yet the day I came here I looked nearer sixty and that was fifteen years ago
They talked along and Daylight looked at the world from new angles
Here was a man neither bitter nor cynical who laughed at the citydwellers and called them lunatics a man who did not care for money and in whom the lust for power had long since died
As for the friendship of the citydwellers his host spoke in no uncertain terms
What did they do all the chaps I knew the chaps in the clubs with whom Id been cheek by jowl for heaven knows how long
I was not beholden to them for anything and when I slipped out there was not one of them to drop me a line and say How are you old man
Anything I can do for you
For several weeks it was Whats become of Ferguson
After that I became a reminiscence and a memory
Yet every last one of them knew I had nothing but my salary and that Id always lived a lap ahead of it
But what do you do now
was Daylights query
You must need cash to buy clothes and magazines
A weeks work or a months work now and again ploughing in the winter or picking grapes in the fall and theres always odd jobs with the farmers through the summer
I dont need much so I dont have to work much
Most of my time I spend fooling around the place
I could do hack work for the magazines and newspapers but I prefer the ploughing and the grape picking
Just look at me and you can see why
Im hard as rocks
And I like the work
But I tell you a chaps got to break in to it
Its a great thing when hes learned to pick grapes a whole long day and come home at the end of it with that tired happy feeling instead of being in a state of physical collapse
That fireplacethose big stonesI was soft then a little anemic alcoholic degenerate with the spunk of a rabbit and about one per cent as much stamina and some of those big stones nearly broke my back and my heart
But I persevered and used my body in the way Nature intended it should be usednot bending over a desk and swilling whiskey and well here I am a better man for it and theres the fireplace fine and dandy eh
And now tell me about the Klondike and how you turned San Francisco upside down with that last raid of yours
Youre a bonny fighter you know and you touch my imagination though my cooler reason tells me that you are a lunatic like the rest
The lust for power
Its a dreadful affliction
Why didnt you stay in your Klondike
Or why dont you clear out and live a natural life for instance like mine
You see I can ask questions too
Now you talk and let me listen for a while
It was not until ten oclock that Daylight parted from Ferguson
As he rode along through the starlight the idea came to him of buying the ranch on the other side of the valley
There was no thought in his mind of ever intending to live on it
His game was in San Francisco
But he liked the ranch and as soon as he got back to the office he would open up negotiations with Hillard
Besides the ranch included the claypit and it would give him the whiphand over Holdsworthy if he ever tried to cut up any didoes
CHAPTER X The time passed and Daylight played on at the game
But the game had entered upon a new phase
The lust for power in the mere gambling and winning was metamorphosing into the lust for power in order to revenge
There were many men in San Francisco against whom he had registered black marks and now and again with one of his lightning strokes he erased such a mark
He asked no quarter he gave no quarter
Men feared and hated him and no one loved him except Larry Hegan his lawyer who would have laid down his life for him
But he was the only man with whom Daylight was really intimate though he was on terms of friendliest camaraderie with the rough and unprincipled following of the bosses who ruled the Riverside Club
On the other hand San Franciscos attitude toward Daylight had undergone a change
While he with his slashing buccaneer methods was a distinct menace to the more orthodox financial gamblers he was nevertheless so grave a menace that they were glad enough to leave him alone
He had already taught them the excellence of letting a sleeping dog lie
Many of the men who knew that they were in danger of his big bearpaw when it reached out for the honey vats even made efforts to placate him to get on the friendly side of him
The AltaPacific approached him confidentially with an offer of reinstatement which he promptly declined
He was after a number of men in that club and whenever opportunity offered he reached out for them and mangled them
Even the newspapers with one or two blackmailing exceptions ceased abusing him and became respectful
In short he was looked upon as a baldfaced grizzly from the Arctic wilds to whom it was considered expedient to give the trail
At the time he raided the steamship companies they had yapped at him and worried him the whole pack of them only to have him whirl around and whip them in the fiercest pitched battle San Francisco had ever known
Not easily forgotten was the Pacific Slope Seamans strike and the giving over of the municipal government to the labor bosses and grafters
The destruction of Charles Klinkner and the California and Altamont Trust Company had been a warning
But it was an isolated case they had been confident in strength in numbersuntil he taught them better
Daylight still engaged in daring speculations as for instance at the impending outbreak of the JapaneseRussian War when in the face of the experience and power of the shipping gamblers he reached out and clutched practically a monopoly of available steamercharters
There was scarcely a battered tramp on the Seven Seas that was not his on time charter
As usual his position was Youve got to come and see me which they did and to use another of his phrases they paid through the nose for the privilege
And all his venturing and fighting had now but one motive
Some day as he confided to Hegan when hed made a sufficient stake he was going back to New York and knock the spots out of Messrs Dowsett Letton and Guggenhammer
Hed show them what an allaround general buzzsaw he was and what a mistake theyd made ever to monkey with him
But he never lost his head and he knew that he was not yet strong enough to go into deathgrapples with those three early enemies
In the meantime the black marks against them remained for a future easement day
Dede Mason was still in the office
He had made no more overtures discussed no more books and no more grammar
He had no active interest in her and she was to him a pleasant memory of what had never happened a joy which by his essential nature he was barred from ever knowing
Yet while his interest had gone to sleep and his energy was consumed in the endless battles he waged he knew every trick of the light on her hair every quick denote mannerism of movement every line of her figure as expounded by her tailormade gowns
Several times six months or so apart he had increased her salary until now she was receiving ninety dollars a month
Beyond this he dared not go though he had got around it by making the work easier
This he had accomplished after her return from a vacation by retaining her substitute as an assistant
Also he had changed his office suite so that now the two girls had a room by themselves
His eye had become quite critical wherever Dede Mason was concerned
He had long since noted her pride of carriage
It was unobtrusive yet it was there
He decided from the way she carried it that she deemed her body a thing to be proud of to be cared for as a beautiful and valued possession
In this and in the way she carried her clothes he compared her with her assistant with the stenographers he encountered in other offices with the women he saw on the sidewalks
Shes sure well put up he communed with himself and she sure knows how to dress and carry it off without being stuck on herself and without laying it on thick
The more he saw of her and the more he thought he knew of her the more unapproachable did she seem to him
But since he had no intention of approaching her this was anything but an unsatisfactory fact
He was glad he had her in his office and hoped shed stay and that was about all
Daylight did not improve with the passing years
The life was not good for him
He was growing stout and soft and there was unwonted flabbiness in his muscles
The more he drank cocktails the more he was compelled to drink in order to get the desired result the inhibitions that eased him down from the concert pitch of his operations
And with this went wine too at meals and the long drinks after dinner of Scotch and soda at the Riverside
Then too his body suffered from lack of exercise and from lack of decent human associations his moral fibres were weakening
Never a man to hide anything some of his escapades became public such as speeding and of joyrides in his big red motorcar down to San Jose with companions distinctly sportyincidents that were narrated as good fun and comically in the newspapers
Nor was there anything to save him
Religion had passed him by
A long time dead was his epitome of that phase of speculation
He was not interested in humanity
According to his roughhewn sociology it was all a gamble
God was a whimsical abstract mad thing called Luck
As to how one happened to be bornwhether a sucker or a robberwas a gamble to begin with Luck dealt out the cards and the little babies picked up the hands allotted them
Protest was vain
Those were their cards and they had to play them willynilly hunchbacked or straight backed crippled or cleanlimbed addlepated or clear headed
There was no fairness in it
The cards most picked up put them into the sucker class the cards of a few enabled them to become robbers
The playing of the cards was lifethe crowd of players society
The table was the earth and the earth in lumps and chunks from loaves of bread to big red motorcars was the stake
And in the end lucky and unlucky they were all a long time dead
It was hard on the stupid lowly for they were coppered to lose from the start but the more he saw of the others the apparent winners the less it seemed to him that they had anything to brag about
They too were a long time dead and their living did not amount to much
It was a wild animal fight the strong trampled the weak and the strong he had already discoveredmen like Dowsett and Letton and Guggenhammerwere not necessarily the best
He remembered his miner comrades of the Arctic
They were the stupid lowly they did the hard work and were robbed of the fruit of their toil just as was the old woman making wine in the Sonoma hills and yet they had finer qualities of truth and loyalty and squaredealing than did the men who robbed them
The winners seemed to be the crooked ones the unfaithful ones the wicked ones
And even they had no say in the matter
They played the cards that were given them and Luck the monstrous madgod thing the owner of the whole shebang looked on and grinned
It was he who stacked the universal carddeck of existence
There was no justice in the deal
The little men that came the little pulpy babies were not even asked if they wanted to try a flutter at the game
They had no choice
Luck jerked them into life slammed them up against the jostling table and told them Now play damn you play
And they did their best poor little devils
The play of some led to steam yachts and mansions of others to the asylum or the paupers ward
Some played the one same card over and over and made wine all their days in the chaparral hoping at the end to pull down a set of false teeth and a coffin
Others quit the game early having drawn cards that called for violent death or famine in the Barrens or loathsome and lingering disease
The hands of some called for kingship and irresponsible and numerated power other hands called for ambition for wealth in untold sums for disgrace and shame or for women and wine
As for himself he had drawn a lucky hand though he could not see all the cards
Somebody or something might get him yet
The mad god Luck might be tricking him along to some such end
An unfortunate set of circumstances and in a months time the robber gang might be wardancing around his financial carcass
This very day a streetcar might run him down or a sign fall from a building and smash in his skull
Or there was disease ever rampant one of Lucks grimmest whims
Who could say
Tomorrow or some other day a ptomaine bug or some other of a thousand bugs might jump out upon him and drag him down
There was Doctor Bascom Lee Bascom who had stood beside him a week ago and talked and argued a picture of magnificent youth and strength and health
And in three days he was deadpneumonia rheumatism of the heart and heaven knew what elseat the end screaming in agony that could be heard a block away
That had been terrible
It was a fresh raw stroke in Daylights consciousness
And when would his own turn come
Who could say
In the meantime there was nothing to do but play the cards he could see in his hand and they were BATTLE REVENGE AND COCKTAILS
And Luck sat over all and grinned
CHAPTER XI One Sunday late in the afternoon found Daylight across the bay in the Piedmont hills back of Oakland
As usual he was in a big motorcar though not his own the guest of Swiftwater Bill Lucks own darling who had come down to spend the cleanup of the seventh fortune wrung from the frozen Arctic gravel
A notorious spender his latest pile was already on the fair road to follow the previous six
He it was in the first year of Dawson who had cracked an ocean of champagne at fifty dollars a quart who with the bottom of his goldsack in sight had cornered the eggmarket at twentyfour dollars per dozen to the tune of one hundred and ten dozen in order to pique the ladylove who had jilted him and he it was paying like a prince for speed who had chartered special trains and broken all records between San Francisco and New York
And here he was once more the luckpup of hell as Daylight called him throwing his latest fortune away with the same oldtime facility
It was a merry party and they had made a merry day of it circling the bay from San Francisco around by San Jose and up to Oakland having been thrice arrested for speeding the third time however on the Haywards stretch running away with their captor
Fearing that a telephone message to arrest them had been flashed ahead they had turned into the backroad through the hills and now rushing in upon Oakland by a new route were boisterously discussing what disposition they should make of the constable
Well come out at Blair Park in ten minutes one of the men announced
Look here Swiftwater theres a crossroads right ahead with lots of gates but itll take us backcountry clear into Berkeley
Then we can come back into Oakland from the other side sneak across on the ferry and send the machine back around tonight with the chauffeur
But Swiftwater Bill failed to see why he should not go into Oakland by way of Blair Park and so decided
The next moment flying around a bend the backroad they were not going to take appeared
Inside the gate leaning out from her saddle and just closing it was a young woman on a chestnut sorrel
With his first glimpse Daylight felt there was something strangely familiar about her
The next moment straightening up in the saddle with a movement he could not fail to identify she put the horse into a gallop riding away with her back toward them
It was Dede Masonhe remembered what Morrison had told him about her keeping a riding horse and he was glad she had not seen him in this riotous company
Swiftwater Bill stood up clinging with one hand to the back of the front seat and waving the other to attract her attention
His lips were pursed for the piercing whistle for which he was famous and which Daylight knew of old when Daylight with a hook of his leg and a yank on the shoulder slammed the startled Bill down into his seat
You mmmust know the lady Swiftwater Bill spluttered
I sure do Daylight answered so shut up
Well I congratulate your good taste Daylight
Shes a peach and she rides like one too
Intervening trees at that moment shut her from view and Swiftwater Bill plunged into the problem of disposing of their constable while Daylight leaning back with closed eyes was still seeing Dede Mason gallop off down the country road
Swiftwater Bill was right
She certainly could ride
And sitting astride her seat was perfect
Good for Dede
That was an added point her having the courage to ride in the only natural and logical manner
Her head as screwed on right that was one thing sure
On Monday morning coming in for dictation he looked at her with new interest though he gave no sign of it and the stereotyped business passed off in the stereotyped way
But the following Sunday found him on a horse himself across the bay and riding through the Piedmont hills
He made a long day of it but no glimpse did he catch of Dede Mason though he even took the backroad of many gates and rode on into Berkeley
Here along the lines of multitudinous houses up one street and down another he wondered which of them might be occupied by her
Morrison had said long ago that she lived in Berkeley and she had been headed that way in the late afternoon of the previous Sundayevidently returning home
It had been a fruitless day so far as she was concerned and yet not entirely fruitless for he had enjoyed the open air and the horse under him to such purpose that on Monday his instructions were out to the dealers to look for the best chestnut sorrel that money could buy
At odd times during the week he examined numbers of chestnut sorrels tried several and was unsatisfied
It was not till Saturday that he came upon Bob
Daylight knew him for what he wanted the moment he laid eyes on him
A large horse for a riding animal he was none too large for a big man like Daylight
In splendid condition Bobs coat in the sunlight was a flame of fire his arched neck a jeweled conflagration
Hes a sure winner was Daylights comment but the dealer was not so sanguine
He was selling the horse on commission and its owner had insisted on Bobs true charactor being given
The dealer gave it
Not what youd call a real vicious horse but a dangerous one
Full of vinegar and allround cussedness but without malice
Just as soon kill you as not but in a playful sort of way you understand without meaning to at all
Personally I wouldnt think of riding him
But hes a stayer
Look at them lungs
And look at them legs
Not a blemish
Hes never been hurt or worked
Nobody ever succeeded in taking it out of him
Mountain horse too trailbroke and all that being raised in rough country
Surefooted as a goat so long as he dont get it into his head to cut up
Dont shy
Aint really afraid but makes believe
Dont buck but rears
Got to ride him with a martingale
Has a bad trick of whirling around without cause Its his idea of a joke on his rider
Its all just how he feels One day hell ride along peaceable and pleasant for twenty miles
Next day before you get started hes wellnigh unmanageable
Knows automobiles so he can lay down alongside of one and sleep or eat hay out of it
Hell let nineteen go by without batting an eye and mebbe the twentieth just because hes feeling frisky hell cut up over like a range cayuse
Generally speaking too lively for a gentleman and too unexpected
Present owner nicknamed him Judas Iscariot and refuses to sell without the buyer knowing all about him first
There thats about all I know except look at that mane and tail
Ever see anything like it
Hair as fine as a babys
The dealer was right
Daylight examined the mane and found it finer than any horses hair he had ever seen
Also its color was unusual in that it was almost auburn
While he ran his fingers through it Bob turned his head and playfully nuzzled Daylights shoulder Saddle him up and Ill try him he told the dealer
I wonder if hes used to spurs
No English saddle mind
Give me a good Mexican and a curb bitnot too severe seeing as he likes to rear
Daylight superintended the preparations adjusting the curb strap and the stirrup length and doing the cinching
He shook his head at the martingale but yielded to the dealers advice and allowed it to go on
And Bob beyond spirited restlessness and a few playful attempts gave no trouble
Nor in the hours ride that followed save for some permissible curveting and prancing did he misbehave
Daylight was delighted the purchase was immediately made and Bob with riding gear and personal equipment was despatched across the bay forthwith to take up his quarters in the stables of the Oakland Riding Academy
The next day being Sunday Daylight was away early crossing on the ferry and taking with him Wolf the leader of his sled team the one dog which he had selected to bring with him when he left Alaska
Quest as he would through the Piedmont hills and along the manygated backroad to Berkeley Daylight saw nothing of Dede Mason and her chestnut sorrel
But he had little time for disappointment for his own chestnut sorrel kept him busy
Bob proved a handful of impishness and contrariety and he tried out his rider as much as his rider tried him out
All of Daylights horse knowledge and horse sense was called into play while Bob in turn worked every trick in his lexicon
Discovering that his martingale had more slack in it than usual he proceeded to give an exhibition of rearing and hindleg walking
After ten hopeless minutes of it Daylight slipped off and tightened the martingale whereupon Bob gave an exhibition of angelic goodness
He fooled Daylight completely
At the end of half an hour of goodness Daylight lured into confidence was riding along at a walk and rolling a cigarette with slack knees and relaxed seat the reins lying on the animals neck
Bob whirled abruptly and with lightning swiftness pivoting on his hind legs his fore legs just lifted clear of the ground
Daylight found himself with his right foot out of the stirrup and his arms around the animals neck and Bob took advantage of the situation to bolt down the road
With a hope that he should not encounter Dede Mason at that moment Daylight regained his seat and checked in the horse
Arrived back at the same spot Bob whirled again
This time Daylight kept his seat but beyond a futile rein across the neck did nothing to prevent the evolution
He noted that Bob whirled to the right and resolved to keep him straightened out by a spur on the left
But so abrupt and swift was the whirl that warning and accomplishment were practically simultaneous
Well Bob he addressed the animal at the same time wiping the sweat from his own eyes Im free to confess that youre sure the blamedest allfired quickest creature I ever saw
I guess the way to fix you is to keep the spur just atouchingah
you brute
For the moment the spur touched him his left hind leg had reached forward in a kick that struck the stirrup a smart blow
Several times out of curiosity Daylight attempted the spur and each time Bobs hoof landed the stirrup
Then Daylight following the horses example of the unexpected suddenly drove both spurs into him and reached him underneath with the quirt
You aint never had a real licking before he muttered as Bob thus rudely jerked out of the circle of his own impish mental processes shot ahead
Half a dozen times spurs and quirt bit into him and then Daylight settled down to enjoy the mad magnificent gallop
No longer punished at the end of a half mile Bob eased down into a fast canter
Wolf toiling in the rear was catching up and everything was going nicely
Ill give you a few pointers on this whirling game my boy Daylight was saying to him when Bob whirled
He did it on a gallop breaking the gallop off short by fore legs stiffly planted
Daylight fetched up against his steeds neck with clasped arms and at the same instant with fore feet clear of the ground Bob whirled around
Only an excellent rider could have escaped being unhorsed and as it was Daylight was nastily near to it
By the time he recovered his seat Bob was in full career bolting the way he had come and making Wolf sidejump to the bushes
All right darn you
Daylight grunted driving in spurs and quirt again and again
Backtrack you want to go and backtrack you sure will go till youre dead sick of it
When after a time Bob attempted to ease down the mad pace spurs and quirt went into him again with undiminished vim and put him to renewed effort
And when at last Daylight decided that the horse had had enough he turned him around abruptly and put him into a gentle canter on the forward track
After a time he reined him in to a stop to see if he were breathing painfully
Standing for a minute Bob turned his head and nuzzled his riders stirrup in a roguish impatient way as much as to intimate that it was time they were going on
Well Ill be plumb gosh darned
was Daylights comment
No illwill no grudge no nothingand after that lambasting
Youre sure a hummer Bob
Once again Daylight was lulled into fancied security
For an hour Bob was all that could be desired of a spirited mount when and as usual without warning he took to whirling and bolting
Daylight put a stop to this with spurs and quirt running him several punishing miles in the direction of his bolt
But when he turned him around and started forward Bob proceeded to feign fright at trees cows bushes Wolf his own shadowin short at every ridiculously conceivable object
At such times Wolf lay down in the shade and looked on while Daylight wrestled it out
So the day passed
Among other things Bob developed a trick of making believe to whirl and not whirling
This was as exasperating as the real thing for each time Daylight was fooled into tightening his leg grip and into a general muscular tensing of all his body
And then after a few makebelieve attempts Bob actually did whirl and caught Daylight napping again and landed him in the old position with clasped arms around the neck
And to the end of the day Bob continued to be up to one trick or another after passing a dozen automobiles on the way into Oakland suddenly electing to go mad with fright at a most ordinary little runabout
And just before he arrived back at the stable he capped the day with a combined whirling and rearing that broke the martingale and enabled him to gain a perpendicular position on his hind legs
At this juncture a rotten stirrup leather parted and Daylight was all but unhorsed
But he had taken a liking to the animal and repented not of his bargain
He realized that Bob was not vicious nor mean the trouble being that he was bursting with high spirits and was endowed with more than the average horses intelligence
It was the spirits and the intelligence combined with inordinate roguishness that made him what he was
What was required to control him was a strong hand with tempered sternness and yet with the requisite touch of brutal dominance
Its you or me Bob Daylight told him more than once that day
And to the stableman that night My but aint he a looker
Ever see anything like him
Best piece of horseflesh I ever straddled and Ive seen a few in my time
And to Bob who had turned his head and was up to his playful nuzzling Goodby you little bit of all right
See you again next Sunday AM and just you bring along your whole basket of tricks you old sonofagun
CHAPTER XII Throughout the week Daylight found himself almost as much interested in Bob as in Dede and not being in the thick of any big deals he was probably more interested in both of them than in the business game
Bobs trick of whirling was of especial moment to him
How to overcome itthat was the thing
Suppose he did meet with Dede out in the hills and suppose by some lucky stroke of fate he should manage to be riding alongside of her then that whirl of Bobs would be most disconcerting and embarrassing
He was not particularly anxious for her to see him thrown forward on Bobs neck
On the other hand suddenly to leave her and go dashing down the backtrack plying quirt and spurs wouldnt do either
What was wanted was a method wherewith to prevent that lightning whirl
He must stop the animal before it got around
The reins would not do this
Neither would the spurs
Remained the quirt
But how to accomplish it
Absentminded moments were many that week when sitting in his office chair in fancy he was astride the wonderful chestnut sorrel and trying to prevent an anticipated whirl
One such moment toward the end of the week occurred in the middle of a conference with Hegan
Hegan elaborating a new and dazzling legal vision became aware that Daylight was not listening
His eyes had gone lacklustre and he too was seeing with inner vision
Got it he cried suddenly
Hegan congratulate me
Its as simple as rolling off a log
All Ive got to do is hit him on the nose and hit him hard
Then he explained to the startled Hegan and became a good listener again though he could not refrain now and again from making audible chuckles of satisfaction and delight
That was the scheme
Bob always whirled to the right
Very well
He would double the quirt in his hand and the instant of the whirl that doubled quirt would rap Bob on the nose
The horse didnt live after it had once learned the lesson that would whirl in the face of the doubled quirt
More keenly than ever during that week in the office did Daylight realize that he had no social nor even human contacts with Dede
The situation was such that he could not ask her the simple question whether or not she was going riding next Sunday
It was a hardship of a new sort this being the employer of a pretty girl
He looked at her often when the routine work of the day was going on the question he could not ask her tickling at the founts of speechWas she going riding next Sunday
And as he looked he wondered how old she was and what love passages she had had must have had with those college whippersnappers with whom according to Morrison she herded and danced
His mind was very full of her those six days between the Sundays and one thing he came to know thoroughly well he wanted her
And so much did he want her that his old timidity of the apronstring was put to rout
He who had run away from women most of his life had now grown so courageous as to pursue
Some Sunday sooner or later he would meet her outside the office somewhere in the hills and then if they did not get acquainted it would be because she did not care to get acquainted
Thus he found another card in the hand the mad god had dealt him
How important that card was to become he did not dream yet he decided that it was a pretty good card
In turn he doubted
Maybe it was a trick of Luck to bring calamity and disaster upon him
Suppose Dede wouldnt have him and suppose he went on loving her more and more harder and harder
All his old generalized terrors of love revived
He remembered the disastrous love affairs of men and women he had known in the past
There was Bertha Doolittle old Doolittles daughter who had been madly in love with Dartworthy the rich Bonanza fraction owner and Dartworthy in turn not loving Bertha at all but madly loving Colonel Walthstones wife and eloping down the Yukon with her and Colonel Walthstone himself madly loving his own wife and lighting out in pursuit of the fleeing couple
And what had been the outcome
Certainly Berthas love had been unfortunate and tragic and so had the love of the other three
Down below Minook Colonel Walthstone and Dartworthy had fought it out
Dartworthy had been killed
A bullet through the Colonels lungs had so weakened him that he died of pneumonia the following spring
And the Colonels wife had no one left alive on earth to love
And then there was Freda drowning herself in the running mushice because of some man on the other side of the world and hating him Daylight because he had happened along and pulled her out of the mushice and back to life
And the Virgin
The old memories frightened him
If this lovegerm gripped him good and hard and if Dede wouldnt have him it might be almost as bad as being gouged out of all he had by Dowsett Letton and Guggenhammer
Had his nascent desire for Dede been less he might well have been frightened out of all thought of her
As it was he found consolation in the thought that some love affairs did come out right
And for all he knew maybe Luck had stacked the cards for him to win
Some men were born lucky lived lucky all their days and died lucky
Perhaps too he was such a man a born luckpup who could not lose
Sunday came and Bob out in the Piedmont hills behaved like an angel
His goodness at times was of the spirited prancing order but otherwise he was a lamb
Daylight with doubled quirt ready in his right hand ached for a whirl just one whirl which Bob with an excellence of conduct that was tantalizing refused to perform
But no Dede did Daylight encounter
He vainly circled about among the hill roads and in the afternoon took the steep grade over the divide of the second range and dropped into Maraga Valley
Just after passing the foot of the descent he heard the hoof beats of a cantering horse
It was from ahead and coming toward him
What if it were Dede
He turned Bob around and started to return at a walk
If it were Dede he was born to luck he decided for the meeting couldnt have occurred under better circumstances
Here they were both going in the same direction and the canter would bring her up to him just where the stiff grade would compel a walk
There would be nothing else for her to do than ride with him to the top of the divide and once there the equally stiff descent on the other side would compel more walking
The canter came nearer but he faced straight ahead until he heard the horse behind check to a walk
Then he glanced over his shoulder
It was Dede
The recognition was quick and with her accompanied by surprise
What more natural thing than that partly turning his horse he should wait till she caught up with him and that when abreast they should continue abreast on up the grade
He could have sighed with relief
The thing was accomplished and so easily
Greetings had been exchanged here they were side by side and going in the same direction with miles and miles ahead of them
He noted that her eye was first for the horse and next for him
Oh what a beauty she had cried at sight of Bob
From the shining light in her eyes and the face filled with delight he would scarcely have believed that it belonged to a young woman he had known in the office the young woman with the controlled subdued office face I didnt know you rode was one of her first remarks
I imagined you were wedded to gettherequick machines
Ive just taken it up lately was his answer
Beginning to get stout you know and had to take it off somehow
She gave a quick sidewise glance that embraced him from head to heel including seat and saddle and said But youve ridden before
She certainly had an eye for horses and things connected with horses was his thought as he replied Not for many years
But I used to think I was a regular ripsnorter when I was a youngster up in Eastern Oregon sneaking away from camp to ride with the cattle and break cayuses and that sort of thing
Thus and to his great relief were they launched on a topic of mutual interest
He told her about Bobs tricks and of the whirl and his scheme to overcome it and she agreed that horses had to be handled with a certain rational severity no matter how much one loved them
There was her Mab which she had for eight years and which she had had break of stallkicking
The process had been painful for Mab but it had cured her
Youve ridden a lot Daylight said
I really cant remember the first time I was on a horse she told him
I was born on a ranch you know and they couldnt keep me away from the horses
I must have been born with the love for them
I had my first pony all my own when I was six
When I was eight I knew what it was to be all day in the saddle along with Daddy
By the time I was eleven he was taking me on my first deer hunts
Id be lost without a horse
I hate indoors and without Mab here I suppose Id have been sick and dead long ago
You like the country
he queried at the same moment catching his first glimpse of a light in her eyes other than gray
As much as I detest the city she answered
But a woman cant earn a living in the country
So I make the best of italong with Mab
And thereat she told him more of her ranch life in the days before her father died
And Daylight was hugely pleased with himself
They were getting acquainted
The conversation had not lagged in the full half hour they had been together
We come pretty close from the same part of the country he said
I was raised in Eastern Oregon and thats none so far from Siskiyou
The next moment he could have bitten out his tongue for her quick question was How did you know I came from Siskiyou
Im sure I never mentioned it
I dont know he floundered temporarily
I heard somewhere that you were from thereabouts
Wolf sliding up at that moment sleekfooted and like a shadow caused her horse to shy and passed the awkwardness off for they talked Alaskan dogs until the conversation drifted back to horses
And horses it was all up the grade and down the other side
When she talked he listened and followed her and yet all the while he was following his own thoughts and impressions as well
It was a nervy thing for her to do this riding astride and he didnt know after all whether he liked it or not
His ideas of women were prone to be oldfashioned they were the ones he had imbibed in the earlyday frontier life of his youth when no woman was seen on anything but a sidesaddle
He had grown up to the tacit fiction that women on horseback were not bipeds
It came to him with a shock this sight of her so manlike in her saddle
But he had to confess that the sight looked good to him just Two other immediate things about her struck him
First there were the golden spots in her eyes
Queer that he had never noticed them before
Perhaps the light in the office had not been right and perhaps they came and went
No they were glows of colora sort of diffused golden light
Nor was it golden either but it was nearer that than any color he knew
It certainly was not any shade of yellow
A lovers thoughts are ever colored and it is to be doubted if any one else in the world would have called Dedes eyes golden
But Daylights mood verged on the tender and melting and he preferred to think of them as golden and therefore they were golden
And then she was so natural
He had been prepared to find her a most difficult young woman to get acquainted with
Yet here it was proving so simple
There was nothing highfalutin about her company mannersit was by this homely phrase that he differentiated this Dede on horseback from the Dede with the office manners whom he had always known
And yet while he was delighted with the smoothness with which everything was going and with the fact that they had found plenty to talk about he was aware of an irk under it all
After all this talk was empty and idle
He was a man of action and he wanted her Dede Mason the woman he wanted her to love him and to be loved by him and he wanted all this glorious consummation then and there
Used to forcing issues used to gripping men and things and bending them to his will he felt now the same compulsive prod of mastery
He wanted to tell her that he loved her and that there was nothing else for her to do but marry him
And yet he did not obey the prod
Women were fluttery creatures and here mere mastery would prove a bungle
He remembered all his hunting guile the long patience of shooting meat in famine when a hit or a miss meant life or death
Truly though this girl did not yet mean quite that nevertheless she meant much to himmore now than ever as he rode beside her glancing at her as often as he dared she in her corduroy ridinghabit so bravely manlike yet so essentially and revealingly woman smiling laughing talking her eyes sparkling the flush of a day of sun and summer breeze warm in her cheeks
CHAPTER XIII Another Sunday man and horse and dog roved the Piedmont hills
And again Daylight and Dede rode together
But this time her surprise at meeting him was tinctured with suspicion or rather her surprise was of another order
The previous Sunday had been quite accidental but his appearing a second time among her favorite haunts hinted of more than the fortuitous
Daylight was made to feel that she suspected him and he remembering that he had seen a big rock quarry near Blair Park stated offhand that he was thinking of buying it
His onetime investment in a brickyard had put the idea into his headan idea that he decided was a good one for it enabled him to suggest that she ride along with him to inspect the quarry
So several hours he spent in her company in which she was much the same girl as before natural unaffected lighthearted smiling and laughing a good fellow talking horses with unflagging enthusiasm making friends with the crustytempered Wolf and expressing the desire to ride Bob whom she declared she was more in love with than ever
At this last Daylight demurred
Bob was full of dangerous tricks and he wouldnt trust any one on him except his worst enemy
You think because Im a girl that I dont know anything about horses she flashed back
But Ive been thrown off and bucked off enough not to be overconfident
And Im not a fool
I wouldnt get on a bucking horse
Ive learned better
And Im not afraid of any other kind
And you say yourself that Bob doesnt buck
But youve never seen him cutting up didoes Daylight But you must remember Ive seen a few others and Ive been on several of them myself
I brought Mab here to electric cars locomotives and automobiles
She was a raw range colt when she came to me
Broken to saddle that was all
Besides I wont hurt your horse
Against his better judgment Daylight gave in and on an unfrequented stretch of road changed saddles and bridles
Remember hes greased lightning he warned as he helped her to mount
She nodded while Bob pricked up his ears to the knowledge that he had a strange rider on his back
The fun came quickly enoughtoo quickly for Dede who found herself against Bobs neck as he pivoted around and bolted the other way
Daylight followed on her horse and watched
He saw her check the animal quickly to a standstill and immediately with rein across neck and a decisive prod of the left spur whirl him back the way he had come and almost as swiftly
Get ready to give him the quirt on the nose Daylight called
But too quickly for her Bob whirled again though this time by a severe effort she saved herself from the undignified position against his neck
His bolt was more determined but she pulled him into a prancing walk and turned him roughly back with her spurred heel
There was nothing feminine in the way she handled him her method was imperative and masculine
Had this not been so Daylight would have expected her to say she had had enough
But that little preliminary exhibition had taught him something of Dedes quality
And if it had not a glance at her gray eyes just perceptibly angry with herself and at her firmset mouth would have told him the same thing
Daylight did not suggest anything while he hung almost gleefully upon her actions in anticipation of what the fractious Bob was going to get
And Bob got it on his next whirl or attempt rather for he was no more than halfway around when the quirt met him smack on his tender nose
There and then in his bewilderment surprise and pain his fore feet just skimming above the road dropped down
Great
Daylight applauded
A couple more will fix him
Hes too smart not to know when hes beaten
Again Bob tried
But this time he was barely quarter around when the doubled quirt on his nose compelled him to drop his fore feet to the road
Then with neither rein nor spur but by the mere threat of the quirt she straightened him out
Dede looked triumphantly at Daylight
Let me give him a run
she asked
Daylight nodded and she shot down the road
He watched her out of sight around the bend and watched till she came into sight returning
She certainly could sit her horse was his thought and she was a sure enough hummer
God she was the wife for a man
Made most of them look pretty slim
And to think of her hammering all week at a typewriter
That was no place for her
She should be a mans wife taking it easy with silks and satins and diamonds his frontier notion of what befitted a wife beloved and dogs and horses and such thingsAnd well see Mr
Burning Daylight what you and me can do about it he murmured to himself
and aloud to her Youll do Miss Mason youll do
Theres nothing too good in horseflesh you dont deserve a woman who can ride like that
No stay with him and well jog along to the quarry
He chuckled
Say he actually gave just the least mite of a groan that last time you fetched him
Did you hear it
And did you see the way he dropped his feet to the roadjust like hed struck a stone wall
And hes got savvee enough to know from now on that that same stone wall will be always there ready for him to lam into
When he parted from her that afternoon at the gate of the road that led to Berkeley he drew off to the edge of the intervening clump of trees where unobserved he watched her out of sight
Then turning to ride back into Oakland a thought came to him that made him grin ruefully as he muttered And now its up to me to make good and buy that blamed quarry
Nothing less than that can give me an excuse for snooping around these hills
But the quarry was doomed to pass out of his plans for a time for on the following Sunday he rode alone
No Dede on a chestnut sorrel came across the backroad from Berkeley that day nor the day a week later
Daylight was beside himself with impatience and apprehension though in the office he contained himself
He noted no change in her and strove to let none show in himself
The same old monotonous routine went on though now it was irritating and maddening
Daylight found a big quarrel on his hands with a world that wouldnt let a man behave toward his stenographer after the way of all men and women
What was the good of owning millions anyway
he demanded one day of the deskcalendar as she passed out after receiving his dictation
As the third week drew to a close and another desolate Sunday confronted him Daylight resolved to speak office or no office
And as was his nature he went simply and directly to the point She had finished her work with him and was gathering her note pad and pencils together to depart when he said Oh one thing more Miss Mason and I hope you wont mind my being frank and straight out
Youve struck me right along as a sensibleminded girl and I dont think youll take offence at what Im going to say
You know how long youve been in the officeits years now several of them anyway and you know Ive always been straight and aboveboard with you
Ive never what you callpresumed
Because you were in my office Ive tried to be more careful than ifif you wasnt in my officeyou understand
But just the same it dont make me any the less human
Im a lonely sort of a fellowdont take that as a bid for kindness
What I mean by it is to try and tell you just how much those two rides with you have meant
And now I hope you wont mind my just asking why you havent been out riding the last two Sundays
He came to a stop and waited feeling very warm and awkward the perspiration starting in tiny beads on his forehead
She did not speak immediately and he stepped across the room and raised the window higher
I have been riding she answered in other directions
But why
He failed somehow to complete the question
Go ahead and be frank with me he urged
Just as frank as I am with you
Why didnt you ride in the Piedmont hills
I hunted for you everywhere
And that is just why
She smiled and looked him straight in the eyes for a moment then dropped her own
Surely you understand Mr
Harnish
He shook his head glumly
I do and I dont
I aint used to city ways by a long shot
Theres things one mustnt do which I dont mind as long as I dont want to do them
But when you do
she asked quickly
Then I do them
His lips had drawn firmly with this affirmation of will but the next instant he was amending the statement That is I mostly do
But what gets me is the things you mustnt do when theyre not wrong and they wont hurt anybodythis riding for instance
She played nervously with a pencil for a time as if debating her reply while he waited patiently
This riding she began its not what they call the right thing
I leave it to you
You know the world
You are Mr Harnish the millionaire Gambler he broke in harshly She nodded acceptance of his term and went on
And Im a stenographer in your office Youre a thousand times better than me he attempted to interpolate but was in turn interrupted
It isnt a question of such things
Its a simple and fairly common situation that must be considered
I work for you
And it isnt what you or I might think but what other persons will think
And you dont need to be told any more about that
You know yourself
Her cool matteroffact speech belied heror so Daylight thought looking at her perturbed feminineness at the rounded lines of her figure the breast that deeply rose and fell and at the color that was now excited in her cheeks
Im sorry I frightened you out of your favorite stamping ground he said rather aimlessly
You didnt frighten me she retorted with a touch of fire
Im not a silly seminary girl
Ive taken care of myself for a long time now and Ive done it without being frightened
We were together two Sundays and Im sure I wasnt frightened of Bob or you
It isnt that
I have no fears of taking care of myself but the world insists on taking care of one as well
Thats the trouble
Its what the world would have to say about me and my employer meeting regularly and riding in the hills on Sundays
Its funny but its so
I could ride with one of the clerks without remark but with youno
But the world dont know and dont need to know he cried
Which makes it worse in a way feeling guilty of nothing and yet sneaking around backroads with all the feeling of doing something wrong
It would be finer and braver for me publicly To go to lunch with me on a weekday Daylight said divining the drift of her uncompleted argument
She nodded
I didnt have that quite in mind but it will do
Id prefer doing the brazen thing and having everybody know it to doing the furtive thing and being found out
Not that Im asking to be invited to lunch she added with a smile but Im sure you understand my position
Then why not ride open and aboveboard with me in the hills
he urged
She shook her head with what he imagined was just the faintest hint of regret and he went suddenly and almost maddeningly hungry for her
Look here Miss Mason I know you dont like this talking over of things in the office
Neither do I
Its part of the whole thing I guess a man aint supposed to talk anything but business with his stenographer
Will you ride with me next Sunday and we can talk it over thoroughly then and reach some sort of a conclusion
Out in the hills is the place where you can talk something besides business
I guess youve seen enough of me to know Im pretty square
II do honor and respect you and and all that and I  He was beginning to flounder and the hand that rested on the desk blotter was visibly trembling
He strove to pull himself together
I just want to harder than anything ever in my life before
III cant explain myself but I do thats all
Will youJust next Sunday
Tomorrow
Nor did he dream that her low acquiescence was due as much as anything else to the beads of sweat on his forehead his trembling hand and his all tooevident general distress
CHAPTER XIV Of course theres no way of telling what anybody wants from what they say
Daylight rubbed Bobs rebellious ear with his quirt and pondered with dissatisfaction the words he had just uttered
They did not say what he had meant them to say
What Im driving at is that you say flatfooted that you wont meet me again and you give your reasons but how am I to know they are your real reasons
Mebbe you just dont want to get acquainted with me and wont say so for fear of hurting my feelings
Dont you see
Im the last man in the world to shove in where Im not wanted
And if I thought you didnt care a whoop to see anything more of me why Id clear out so blamed quick you couldnt see me for smoke
Dede smiled at him in acknowledgment of his words but rode on silently
And that smile he thought was the most sweetly wonderful smile he had ever seen
There was a difference in it he assured himself from any smile she had ever given him before
It was the smile of one who knew him just a little bit of one who was just the least mite acquainted with him
Of course he checked himself up the next moment it was unconscious on her part
It was sure to come in the intercourse of any two persons
Any stranger a business man a clerk anybody after a few casual meetings would show similar signs of friendliness
It was bound to happen but in her case it made more impression on him and besides it was such a sweet and wonderful smile
Other women he had known had never smiled like that he was sure of it
It had been a happy day
Daylight had met her on the backroad from Berkeley and they had had hours together
It was only now with the day drawing to a close and with them approaching the gate of the road to Berkeley that he had broached the important subject
She began her answer to his last contention and he listened gratefully
But suppose just suppose that the reasons I have given are the only onesthat there is no question of my not wanting to know you
Then Id go on urging like Sam Scratch he said quickly
Because you see Ive always noticed that folks that incline to anything are much more open to hearing the case stated
But if you did have that other reason up your sleeve if you didnt want to know me ifif well if you thought my feelings oughtnt to be hurt just because you had a good job with me Here his calm consideration of a possibility was swamped by the fear that it was an actuality and he lost the thread of his reasoning
Well anyway all you have to do is to say the word and Ill clear out
And with no hard feelings it would be just a case of bad luck for me
So be honest Miss Mason please and tell me if thats the reasonI almost got a hunch that it is
She glanced up at him her eyes abruptly and slightly moist half with hurt half with anger
Oh but that isnt fair she cried
You give me the choice of lying to you and hurting you in order to protect myself by getting rid of you or of throwing away my protection by telling you the truth for then you as you said yourself would stay and urge
Her cheeks were flushed her lips tremulous but she continued to look him frankly in the eyes
Daylight smiled grimly with satisfaction
Im real glad Miss Mason real glad for those words
But they wont serve you she went on hastily
They cant serve you
I refuse to let them
This is our last ride and here is the gate
Ranging her mare alongside she bent slid the catch and followed the opening gate
No please no she said as Daylight started to follow
Humbly acquiescent he pulled Bob back and the gate swung shut between them
But there was more to say and she did not ride on
Listen Miss Mason he said in a low voice that shook with sincerity I want to assure you of one thing
Im not just trying to fool around with you
I like you I want you and I was never more in earnest in my life
Theres nothing wrong in my intentions or anything like that
What I mean is strictly honorable But the expression of her face made him stop
She was angry and she was laughing at the same time
The last thing you should have said she cried
Its like aa matrimonial bureau intentions strictly honorable object matrimony
But its no more than I deserved
This is what I suppose you call urging like Sam Scratch
The tan had bleached out of Daylights skin since the time he came to live under city roofs so that the flush of blood showed readily as it crept up his neck past the collar and overspread his face
Nor in his exceeding discomfort did he dream that she was looking upon him at that moment with more kindness than at any time that day
It was not in her experience to behold big grownup men who blushed like boys and already she repented the sharpness into which she had been surprised
Now look here Miss Mason he began slowly and stumblingly at first but accelerating into a rapidity of utterance that was almost incoherent Im a rough sort of a man I know that and I know I dont know much of anything
Ive never had any training in nice things
Ive never made love before and Ive never been in love before eitherand I dont know how to go about it any more than a thundering idiot
What you want to do is get behind my tomfool words and get a feel of the man thats behind them
Thats me and I mean all right if I dont know how to go about it
Dede Mason had quick birdlike ways almost flitting from mood to mood and she was all contrition on the instant
Forgive me for laughing she said across the gate
It wasnt really laughter
I was surprised off my guard and hurt too
You see Mr Harnish Ive not been She paused in sudden fear of completing the thought into which her birdlike precipitancy had betrayed her
What you mean is that youve not been used to such sort of proposing Daylight said a sort of ontherun Howdy gladtomakeyouracquaintance wontyoubemine proposition
She nodded and broke into laughter in which he joined and which served to pass the awkwardness away
He gathered heart at this and went on in greater confidence with cooler head and tongue
There you see you prove my case
Youve had experience in such matters
I dont doubt youve had slathers of proposals
Well I havent and Im like a fish out of water
Besides this aint a proposal
Its a peculiar situation thats all and Im in a corner
Ive got enough plain horsesense to know a man aint supposed to argue marriage with a girl as a reason for getting acquainted with her
And right there was where I was in the hole
Number one I cant get acquainted with you in the office
Number two you say you wont see me out of the office to give me a chance
Number three your reason is that folks will talk because you work for me
Number four I just got to get acquainted with you and I just got to get you to see that I mean fair and all right
Number five there you are on one side the gate getting ready to go and me here on the other side the gate pretty desperate and bound to say something to make you reconsider
Number six I said it
And now and finally I just do want you to reconsider
And listening to him pleasuring in the sight of his earnest perturbed face and in the simple homely phrases that but emphasized his earnestness and marked the difference between him and the average run of men she had known she forgot to listen and lost herself in her own thoughts
The love of a strong man is ever a lure to a normal woman and never more strongly did Dede feel the lure than now looking across the closed gate at Burning Daylight
Not that she would ever dream of marrying himshe had a score of reasons against it but why not at least see more of him
He was certainly not repulsive to her
On the contrary she liked him had always liked him from the day she had first seen him and looked upon his lean Indian face and into his flashing Indian eyes
He was a figure of a man in more ways than his mere magnificent muscles
Besides Romance had gilded him this doughty roughhewn adventurer of the North this man of many deeds and many millions who had come down out of the Arctic to wrestle and fight so masterfully with the men of the South
Savage as a Red Indian gambler and profligate a man without morals whose vengeance was never glutted and who stamped on the faces of all who opposed himoh yes she knew all the hard names he had been called
Yet she was not afraid of him
There was more than that in the connotation of his name
Burning Daylight called up other things as well
They were there in the newspapers the magazines and the books on the Klondike
When all was said Burning Daylight had a mighty connotationone to touch any womans imagination as it touched hers the gate between them listening to the wistful and impassioned simplicity of his speech
Dede was after all a woman with a womans sexvanity and it was this vanity that was pleased by the fact that such a man turned in his need to her
And there was more that passed through her mindsensations of tiredness and loneliness trampling squadrons and shadowy armies of vague feelings and vaguer prompting and deeper and dimmer whisperings and echoings the flutterings of forgotten generations crystallized into being and fluttering anew and always undreamed and unguessed subtle and potent the spirit and essence of life that under a thousand deceits and masks forever makes for life
It was a strong temptation just to ride with this man in the hills
It would be that only and nothing more for she was firmly convinced that his way of life could never be her way
On the other hand she was vexed by none of the ordinary feminine fears and timidities
That she could take care of herself under any and all circumstances she never doubted
Then why not
It was such a little thing after all
She led an ordinary humdrum life at best
She ate and slept and worked and that was about all
As if in review her anchorite existence passed before her six days of the week spent in the office and in journeying back and forth on the ferry the hours stolen before bedtime for snatches of song at the piano for doing her own special laundering for sewing and mending and casting up of meagre accounts the two evenings a week of social diversion she permitted herself the other stolen hours and Saturday afternoons spent with her brother at the hospital and the seventh day Sunday her day of solace on Mabs back out among the blessed hills
But it was lonely this solitary riding
Nobody of her acquaintance rode
Several girls at the University had been persuaded into trying it but after a Sunday or two on hired livery hacks they had lost interest
There was Madeline who bought her own horse and rode enthusiastically for several months only to get married and go away to live in Southern California
After years of it one did get tired of this eternal riding alone
He was such a boy this big giant of a millionaire who had half the rich men of San Francisco afraid of him
Such a boy
She had never imagined this side of his nature
How do folks get married
he was saying
Why number one they meet number two like each others looks number three get acquainted and number four get married or not according to how they like each other after getting acquainted
But how in thunder were to have a chance to find out whether we like each other enough is beyond my savvee unless we make that chance ourselves
Id come to see you call on you only I know youre just rooming or boarding and that wont do
Suddenly with a change of mood the situation appeared to Dede ridiculously absurd
She felt a desire to laughnot angrily not hysterically but just jolly
It was so funny
Herself the stenographer he the notorious and powerful gambling millionaire and the gate between them across which poured his argument of people getting acquainted and married
Also it was an impossible situation
On the face of it she could not go on with it
This program of furtive meetings in the hills would have to discontinue
There would never be another meeting
And if denied this he tried to woo her in the office she would be compelled to lose a very good position and that would be an end of the episode
It was not nice to contemplate but the world of men especially in the cities she had not found particularly nice
She had not worked for her living for years without losing a great many of her illusions
We wont do any sneaking or hiding around about it Daylight was explaining
Well ride around as bold if you please and if anybody sees us why let them
If they talkwell so long as our consciences are straight we neednt worry
Say the word and Bob will have on his back the happiest man alive
She shook her head pulled in the mare who was impatient to be off for home and glanced significantly at the lengthening shadows
Its getting late now anyway Daylight hurried on and weve settled nothing after all
Just one more Sunday anywaythats not asking muchto settle it in
Weve had all day she said
But we started to talk it over too late
Well tackle it earlier next time
This is a big serious proposition with me I can tell you
Say next Sunday
Are men ever fair
she asked
You know thoroughly well that by next Sunday you mean many Sundays
Then let it be many Sundays he cried recklessly while she thought that she had never seen him looking handsomer
Say the word
Only say the word
Next Sunday at the quarry She gathered the reins into her hand preliminary to starting
Good night she said and Yes he whispered with just the faintest touch of impressiveness
Yes she said her voice low but distinct
At the same moment she put the mare into a canter and went down the road without a backward glance intent on an analysis of her own feelings
With her mind made up to say noand to the last instant she had been so resolvedher lips nevertheless had said yes
Or at least it seemed the lips
She had not intended to consent
Then why had she
Her first surprise and bewilderment at so wholly unpremeditated an act gave way to consternation as she considered its consequences
She knew that Burning Daylight was not a man to be trifled with that under his simplicity and boyishness he was essentially a dominant male creature and that she had pledged herself to a future of inevitable stress and storm
And again she demanded of herself why she had said yes at the very moment when it had been farthest from her intention
CHAPTER XV Life at the office went on much the way it had always gone
Never by word or look did they acknowledge that the situation was in any wise different from what it had always been
Each Sunday saw the arrangement made for the following Sundays ride nor was this ever referred to in the office
Daylight was fastidiously chivalrous on this point
He did not want to lose her from the office
The sight of her at her work was to him an undiminishing joy
Nor did he abuse this by lingering over dictation or by devising extra work that would detain her longer before his eyes
But over and beyond such sheer selfishness of conduct was his love of fair play
He scorned to utilize the accidental advantages of the situation
Somewhere within him was a higher appeasement of love than mere possession
He wanted to be loved for himself with a fair field for both sides
On the other hand had he been the most artful of schemers he could not have pursued a wiser policy
Birdlike in her love of individual freedom the last woman in the world to be bullied in her affections she keenly appreciated the niceness of his attitude
She did this consciously but deeper than all consciousness and intangible as gossamer were the effects of this
All unrealizable save for some supreme moment did the web of Daylights personality creep out and around her
Filament by filament these secret and undreamable bonds were being established
They it was that could have given the cue to her saying yes when she had meant to say no
And in some such fashion in some future crisis of greater moment might she not in violation of all dictates of sober judgment give another unintentional consent
Among other good things resulting from his growing intimacy with Dede was Daylights not caring to drink so much as formerly
There was a lessening in desire for alcohol of which even he at last became aware
In a way she herself was the needed inhibition
The thought of her was like a cocktail
Or at any rate she substituted for a certain percentage of cocktails
From the strain of his unnatural city existence and of his intense gambling operations he had drifted on to the cocktail route
A wall must forever be built to give him easement from the high pitch and Dede became a part of this wall
Her personality her laughter the intonations of her voice the impossible golden glow of her eyes the light on her hair her form her dress her actions on horseback her merest physical mannerismsall pictured over and over in his mind and dwelt upon served to take the place of many a cocktail or long Scotch and soda
In spite of their high resolve there was a very measurable degree of the furtive in their meetings
In essence these meetings were stolen
They did not ride out brazenly together in the face of the world
On the contrary they met always unobserved she riding across the manygated backroad from Berkeley to meet him halfway
Nor did they ride on any save unfrequented roads preferring to cross the second range of hills and travel among a churchgoing farmer folk who would scarcely have recognized even Daylight from his newspaper photographs
He found Dede a good horsewomangood not merely in riding but in endurance
There were days when they covered sixty seventy and even eighty miles nor did Dede ever claim any day too long noranother strong recommendation to Daylightdid the hardest day ever the slightest chafe of the chestnut sorrels back
A sure enough hummer was Daylights stereotyped but ever enthusiastic verdict to himself
They learned much of each other on these long uninterrupted rides
They had nothing much to talk about but themselves and while she received a liberal education concerning Arctic travel and goldmining he in turn touch by touch painted an ever clearer portrait of her
She amplified the ranch life of her girlhood prattling on about horses and dogs and persons and things until it was as if he saw the whole process of her growth and her becoming
All this he was able to trace on through the period of her fathers failure and death when she had been compelled to leave the university and go into office work
The brother too she spoke of and of her long struggle to have him cured and of her now fading hopes
Daylight decided that it was easier to come to an understanding of her than he had anticipated though he was always aware that behind and under all he knew of her was the mysterious and baffling woman and sex
There he was humble enough to confess to himself was a chartless shoreless sea about which he knew nothing and which he must nevertheless somehow navigate
His lifelong fear of woman had originated out of nonunderstanding and had also prevented him from reaching any understanding
Dede on horseback Dede gathering poppies on a summer hillside Dede taking down dictation in her swift shorthand strokesall this was comprehensible to him
But he did not know the Dede who so quickly changed from mood to mood the Dede who refused steadfastly to ride with him and then suddenly consented the Dede in whose eyes the golden glow forever waxed and waned and whispered hints and messages that were not for his ears
In all such things he saw the glimmering profundities of sex acknowledged their lure and accepted them as incomprehensible
There was another side of her too of which he was consciously ignorant
She knew the books was possessed of that mysterious and awful thing called culture
And yet what continually surprised him was that this culture was never obtruded on their intercourse
She did not talk books nor art nor similar folderols
Homely minded as he was himself he found her almost equally homely minded
She liked the simple and the outofdoors the horses and the hills the sunlight and the flowers
He found himself in a partly new flora to which she was the guide pointing out to him all the varieties of the oaks making him acquainted with the madrono and the manzanita teaching him the names habits and habitats of unending series of wild flowers shrubs and ferns
Her keen woods eye was another delight to him
It had been trained in the open and little escaped it
One day as a test they strove to see which could discover the greater number of birds nests
And he who had always prided himself on his own acutely trained observation found himself hard put to keep his score ahead
At the end of the day he was but three nests in the lead one of which she challenged stoutly and of which even he confessed serious doubt
He complimented her and told her that her success must be due to the fact that she was a bird herself with all a birds keen vision and quickflashing ways
The more he knew her the more he became convinced of this birdlike quality in her
That was why she liked to ride he argued
It was the nearest approach to flying
A field of poppies a glen of ferns a row of poplars on a country lane the tawny brown of a hillside the shaft of sunlight on a distant peakall such were provocative of quick joys which seemed to him like so many outbursts of song
Her joys were in little things and she seemed always singing
Even in sterner things it was the same
When she rode Bob and fought with that magnificent brute for mastery the qualities of an eagle were uppermost in her
These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him
He joyed in her joy his eyes as excitedly fixed on her as bears were fixed on the object of her attention
Also through her he came to a closer discernment and keener appreciation of nature
She showed him colors in the landscape that he would never have dreamed were there
He had known only the primary colors
All colors of red were red
Black was black and brown was just plain brown until it became yellow when it was no longer brown
Purple he had always imagined was red something like blood until she taught him better
Once they rode out on a high hill brow where windblown poppies blazed about their horses knees and she was in an ecstasy over the lines of the many distances
Seven she counted and he who had gazed on landscapes all his life for the first time learned what a distance was
After that and always he looked upon the face of nature with a more seeing eye learning a delight of his own in surveying the serried ranks of the upstanding ranges and in slow contemplation of the purple summer mists that haunted the languid creases of the distant hills
But through it all ran the golden thread of love
At first he had been content just to ride with Dede and to be on comradely terms with her but the desire and the need for her increased
The more he knew of her the higher was his appraisal
Had she been reserved and haughty with him or been merely a giggling simpering creature of a woman it would have been different
Instead she amazed him with her simplicity and wholesomeness with her great store of comradeliness
This latter was the unexpected
He had never looked upon woman in that way
Woman the toy woman the harpy woman the necessary wife and mother of the races offspringall this had been his expectation and understanding of woman
But woman the comrade and playfellow and joyfellowthis was what Dede had surprised him in
And the more she became worth while the more ardently his love burned unconsciously shading his voice with caresses and with equal unconsciousness flaring up signal fires in his eyes
Nor was she blind to it yet like many women before her she thought to play with the pretty fire and escape the consequent conflagration
Winter will soon be coming on she said regretfully and with provocation one day and then there wont be any more riding
But I must see you in the winter just the same he cried hastily
She shook her head
We have been very happy and all that she said looking at him with steady frankness
I remember your foolish argument for getting acquainted too but it wont lead to anything it cant
I know myself too well to be mistaken
Her face was serious even solicitous with desire not to hurt and her eyes were unwavering but in them was the light golden and glowingthe abyss of sex into which he was now unafraid to gaze
Ive been pretty good he declared
I leave it to you if I havent
Its been pretty hard too I can tell you
You just think it over
Not once have I said a word about love to you and me loving you all the time
Thats going some for a man thats used to having his own way
Im somewhat of a rusher when it comes to travelling
I reckon Id rush God Almighty if it came to a race over the ice
And yet I didnt rush you
I guess this fact is an indication of how much I do love you
Of course I want you to marry me
Have I said a word about it though
Nary a chirp nary a flutter
Ive been quiet and good though its almost made me sick at times this keeping quiet
I havent asked you to marry me
Im not asking you now
Oh not but what you satisfy me
I sure know youre the wife for me
But how about myself 
Do you know me well enough know your own mind
He shrugged his shoulders
I dont know and I aint going to take chances on it now
Youve got to know for sure whether you think you could get along with me or not and Im playing a slow conservative game
I aint agoing to lose for overlooking my hand
This was lovemaking of a sort beyond Dedes experience
Nor had she ever heard of anything like it
Furthermore its lack of ardor carried with it a shock which she could overcome only by remembering the way his hand had trembled in the past and by remembering the passion she had seen that very day and every day in his eyes or heard in his voice
Then too she recollected what he had said to her weeks before Maybe you dont know what patience is he had said and thereat told her of shooting squirrels with a big rifle the time he and Elijah Davis had starved on the Stewart River
So you see he urged just for a square deal weve got to see some more of each other this winter
Most likely your mind aint made up yet But it is she interrupted
I wouldnt dare permit myself to care for you
Happiness for me would not lie that way
I like you Mr Harnish and all that but it can never be more than that
Its because you dont like my way of living he charged thinking in his own mind of the sensational joyrides and general profligacy with which the newspapers had credited himthinking this and wondering whether or not in maiden modesty she would disclaim knowledge of it
To his surprise her answer was flat and uncompromising
No I dont
I know Ive been brash on some of those rides that got into the papers he began his defense and that Ive been travelling with a lively crowd
I dont mean that she said though I know about it too and cant say that I like it
But it is your life in general your business
There are women in the world who could marry a man like you and be happy but I couldnt
And the more I cared for such a man the more unhappy I should be
You see my unhappiness in turn would tend to make him unhappy
I should make a mistake and he would make an equal mistake though his would not be so hard on him because he would still have his business
Business
Daylight gasped
Whats wrong with my business
I play fair and square
Theres nothing under hand about it which cant be said of most businesses whether of the big corporations or of the cheating lying little cornergrocerymen
I play the straight rules of the game and I dont have to lie or cheat or break my word
Dede hailed with relief the change in the conversation and at the same time the opportunity to speak her mind
In ancient Greece she began pedantically a man was judged a good citizen who built houses planted trees She did not complete the quotation but drew the conclusion hurriedly
How many houses have you built
How many trees have you planted
He shook his head noncommittally for he had not grasped the drift of the argument
Well she went on two winters ago you cornered coal Just locally he grinned reminiscently just locally
And I took advantage of the car shortage and the strike in British Columbia
But you didnt dig any of that coal yourself
Yet you forced it up four dollars a ton and made a lot of money
That was your business
You made the poor people pay more for their coal
You played fair as you said but you put your hands down into all their pockets and took their money away from them
I know
I burn a grate fire in my sittingroom at Berkeley
And instead of eleven dollars a ton for Rock Wells I paid fifteen dollars that winter
You robbed me of four dollars
I could stand it
But there were thousands of the very poor who could not stand it
You might call it legal gambling but to me it was downright robbery
Daylight was not abashed
This was no revelation to him
He remembered the old woman who made wine in the Sonoma hills and the millions like her who were made to be robbed
Now look here Miss Mason youve got me there slightly I grant
But youve seen me in business a long time now and you know I dont make a practice of raiding the poor people
I go after the big fellows
Theyre my meat
They rob the poor and I rob them
That coal deal was an accident
I wasnt after the poor people in that but after the big fellows and I got them too
The poor people happened to get in the way and got hurt that was all
Dont you see he went on the whole game is a gamble
Everybody gambles in one way or another
The farmer gambles against the weather and the market on his crops
So does the United States Steel Corporation
The business of lots of men is straight robbery of the poor people
But Ive never made that my business
You know that
Ive always gone after the robbers
I missed my point she admitted
Wait a minute
And for a space they rode in silence
I see it more clearly than I can state it but its something like this
There is legitimate work and theres work thatwell that isnt legitimate
The farmer works the soil and produces grain
Hes making something that is good for humanity
He actually in a way creates something the grain that will fill the mouths of the hungry
And then the railroads and marketriggers and the rest proceed to rob him of that same grainDaylight broke in Dede smiled and held up her hand
Wait a minute
Youll make me lose my point
It doesnt hurt if they rob him of all of it so that he starves to death
The point is that the wheat he grew is still in the world
It exists
Dont you see
The farmer created something say ten tons of wheat and those ten tons exist
The railroads haul the wheat to market to the mouths that will eat it
This also is legitimate
Its like some one bringing you a glass of water or taking a cinder out of your eye
Something has been done in a way been created just like the wheat
But the railroads rob like Sam Scratch Daylight objected
Then the work they do is partly legitimate and partly not
Now we come to you
You dont create anything
Nothing new exists when youre done with your business
Just like the coal
You didnt dig it
You didnt haul it to market
You didnt deliver it
Dont you see
thats what I meant by planting the trees and building the houses
You havent planted one tree nor built a single house
I never guessed there was a woman in the world who could talk business like that he murmured admiringly
And youve got me on that point
But theres a lot to be said on my side just the same
Now you listen to me
Im going to talk under three heads
Number one We live a short time the best of us and were a long time dead
Life is a big gambling game
Some are born lucky and some are born unlucky
Everybody sits in at the table and everybody tries to rob everybody else
Most of them get robbed
Theyre born suckers
Fellow like me comes along and sizes up the proposition
Ive got two choices
I can herd with the suckers or I can herd with the robbers
As a sucker I win nothing
Even the crusts of bread are snatched out of my mouth by the robbers
I work hard all my days and die working
And I aint never had a flutter
Ive had nothing but work work work
They talk about the dignity of labor
I tell you there aint no dignity in that sort of labor
My other choice is to herd with the robbers and I herd with them
I play that choice wide open to win
I get the automobiles and the porterhouse steaks and the soft beds
Number two There aint much difference between playing halfway robber like the railroad hauling that farmers wheat to market and playing all robber and robbing the robbers like I do
And besides halfway robbery is too slow a game for me to sit in
You dont win quick enough for me
But what do you want to win for
Dede demanded
You have millions and millions already
You cant ride in more than one automobile at a time sleep in more than one bed at a time
Number three answers that he said and here it is Men and things are so made that they have different likes
A rabbit likes a vegetarian diet
A lynx likes meat
Ducks swim chickens are scairt of water
One man collects postage stamps another man collects butterflies
This man goes in for paintings that man goes in for yachts and some other fellow for hunting big game
One man thinks horseracing is It with a big I and another man finds the biggest satisfaction in actresses
They cant help these likes
They have them and what are they going to do about it
Now I like gambling
I like to play the game
I want to play it big and play it quick
Im just made that way
And I play it
But why cant you do good with all your money
Daylight laughed
Doing good with your money
Its like slapping God in the face as much as to tell him that he dont know how to run his world and that youll be much obliged if hell stand out of the way and give you a chance
Thinking about God doesnt keep me sitting up nights so Ive got another way of looking at it
Aint it funny to go around with brass knuckles and a big club breaking folks heads and taking their money away from them until Ive got a pile and then repenting of my ways going around and bandaging up the heads the other robbers are breaking
I leave it to you
Thats what doing good with money amounts to
Every once in a while some robber turns softhearted and takes to driving an ambulance
Thats what Carnegie did
He smashed heads in pitched battles at Homestead regular wholesale headbreaker he was held up the suckers for a few hundred million and now he goes around dribbling it back to them
funny
I leave it to you
He rolled a cigarette and watched her half curiously half amusedly
His replies and harsh generalizations of a harsh school were disconcerting and she came back to her earlier position
I cant argue with you and you know that
No matter how right a woman is men have such a way about them well what they say sounds most convincing and yet the woman is still certain they are wrong
But there is one thingthe creative joy
Call it gambling if you will but just the same it seems to me more satisfying to create something make something than just to roll dice out of a dicebox all day long
Why sometimes for exercise or when Ive got to pay fifteen dollars for coal I curry Mab and give her a whole half hours brushing
And when I see her coat clean and shining and satiny I feel a satisfaction in what Ive done
So it must be with the man who builds a house or plants a tree
He can look at it
He made it
Its his handiwork
Even if somebody like you comes along and takes his tree away from him still it is there and still did he make it
You cant rob him of that Mr Harnish with all your millions
Its the creative joy and its a higher joy than mere gambling
Havent you ever made things yourselfa log cabin up in the Yukon or a canoe or raft or something
And dont you remember how satisfied you were how good you felt while you were doing it and after you had it done
While she spoke his memory was busy with the associations she recalled
He saw the deserted flat on the river bank by the Klondike and he saw the log cabins and warehouses spring up and all the log structures he had built and his sawmills working night and day on three shifts
Why doggone it Miss Mason youre rightin a way
Ive built hundreds of houses up there and I remember I was proud and glad to see them go up
Im proud now when I remember them
And there was Ophirthe most Godforsaken moosepasture of a creek you ever laid eyes on
I made that into the big Ophir
Why I ran the water in there from the Rinkabilly eighty miles away
They all said I couldnt but I did it and I did it by myself
The dam and the flume cost me four million
But you should have seen that Ophirpower plants electric lights and hundreds of men on the payroll working night and day
I guess I do get an inkling of what you mean by making a thing
I made Ophir and by God she was a sure hummerI beg your pardon
I didnt mean to cuss
But that Ophir I sure am proud of her now just as the last time I laid eyes on her
And you won something there that was more than mere money Dede encouraged
Now do you know what I would do if I had lots of money and simply had to go on playing at business
Take all the southerly and westerly slopes of these bare hills
Id buy them in and plant eucalyptus on them
Id do it for the joy of doing it anyway but suppose I had that gambling twist in me which you talk about why Id do it just the same and make money out of the trees
And theres my other point again
Instead of raising the price of coal without adding an ounce of coal to the market supply Id be making thousands and thousands of cords of firewoodmaking something where nothing was before
And everybody who ever crossed on the ferries would look up at these forested hills and be made glad
Who was made glad by your adding four dollars a ton to Rock Wells
It was Daylights turn to be silent for a time while she waited an answer
Would you rather I did things like that
he asked at last
It would be better for the world and better for you she answered noncommittally
CHAPTER XVI All week every one in the office knew that something new and big was afoot in Daylights mind
Beyond some deals of no importance he had not been interested in anything for several months
But now he went about in an almost unbroken brown study made unexpected and lengthy trips across the bay to Oakland or sat at his desk silent and motionless for hours
He seemed particularly happy with what occupied his mind
At times men came in and conferred with himand with new faces and differing in type from those that usually came to see him
On Sunday Dede learned all about it
Ive been thinking a lot of our talk he began and Ive got an idea Id like to give it a flutter
And Ive got a proposition to make your hair stand up
Its what you call legitimate and at the same time its the goshdangdest gamble a man ever went into
How about planting minutes wholesale and making two minutes grow where one minute grew before
Oh yes and planting a few trees toosay several million of them
You remember the quarry I made believe I was looking at
Well Im going to buy it
Im going to buy these hills too clear from here around to Berkeley and down the other way to San Leandro
I own a lot of them already for that matter
But mum is the word
Ill be buying a long time to come before anything much is guessed about it and I dont want the market to jump up out of sight
You see that hill over there
Its my hill running clear down its slopes through Piedmont and halfway along those rolling hills into Oakland
And its nothing to all the things Im going to buy
He paused triumphantly
And all to make two minutes grow where one grew before
Dede queried at the same time laughing heartily at his affectation of mystery
He stared at her fascinated
She had such a frank boyish way of throwing her head back when she laughed
And her teeth were an unending delight to him
Not small yet regular and firm without a blemish he considered then the healthiest whitest prettiest teeth he had ever seen
And for months he had been comparing them with the teeth of every woman he met
It was not until her laughter was over that he was able to continue
The ferry system between Oakland and San Francisco is the worst onehorse concern in the United States
You cross on it every day six days in the week
Thats say twentyfive days a month or three hundred a year
Now long does it take you one way
Forty minutes if youre lucky
Im going to put you across in twenty minutes
If that aint making two minutes grow where one grew before knock off my head with little apples
Ill save you twenty minutes each way
Thats forty minutes a day times three hundred equals twelve thousand minutes a year just for you just for one person
Lets see thats two hundred whole hours
Suppose I save two hundred hours a year for thousands of other folksthats farming some aint it
Dede could only nod breathlessly
She had caught the contagion of his enthusiasm though she had no clew as to how this great timesaving was to be accomplished
Come on he said
Lets ride up that hill and when I get you out on top where you can see something Ill talk sense
A small footpath dropped down to the dry bed of the canon which they crossed before they began the climb
The slope was steep and covered with matted brush and bushes through which the horses slipped and lunged
Bob growing disgusted turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab
The mare was thrust sidewise into the denser bush where she nearly fell
Recovering she flung her weight against Bob
Both riders legs were caught in the consequent squeeze and as Bob plunged ahead down hill Dede was nearly scraped off
Daylight threw his horse on to its haunches and at the same time dragged Dede back into the saddle
Showers of twigs and leaves fell upon them and predicament followed predicament until they emerged on the hilltop the worse for wear but happy and excited
Here no trees obstructed the view
The particular hill on which they were outjutted from the regular line of the range so that the sweep of their vision extended over threequarters of the circle
Below on the flat land bordering the bay lay Oakland and across the bay was San Francisco
Between the two cities they could see the white ferryboats on the water
Around to their right was Berkeley and to their left the scattered villages between Oakland and San Leandro
Directly in the foreground was Piedmont with its desultory dwellings and patches of farming land and from Piedmont the land rolled down in successive waves upon Oakland
Look at it said Daylight extending his arm in a sweeping gesture
A hundred thousand people there and no reason there shouldnt be half a million
Theres the chance to make five people grow where one grows now
Heres the scheme in a nutshell
Why dont more people live in Oakland
No good service with San Francisco and besides Oakland is asleep
Its a whole lot better place to live in than San Francisco
Now suppose I buy in all the street railways of Oakland Berkeley Alameda San Leandro and the restbring them under one head with a competent management
Suppose I cut the time to San Francisco onehalf by building a big pier out there almost to Goat Island and establishing a ferry system with modern uptodate boats
Why folks will want to live over on this side
Very good
Theyll need land on which to build
So first I buy up the land
But the lands cheap now
Why
Because its in the country no electric roads no quick communication nobody guessing that the electric roads are coming
Ill build the roads
That will make the land jump up
Then Ill sell the land as fast as the folks will want to buy because of the improved ferry system and transportation facilities
You see I give the value to the land by building the roads
Then I sell the land and get that value back and after that theres the roads all carrying folks back and forth and earning big money
Cant lose
And theres all sorts of millions in it
Im going to get my hands on some of that water front and the tidelands
Take between where Im going to build my pier and the old pier
Its shallow water
I can fill and dredge and put in a system of docks that will handle hundreds of ships
San Franciscos water front is congested
No more room for ships
With hundreds of ships loading and unloading on this side right into the freight cars of three big railroads factories will start up over here instead of crossing to San Francisco
That means factory sites
That means me buying in the factory sites before anybody guesses the cat is going to jump much less which way
Factories mean tens of thousands of workingmen and their families
That means more houses and more land and that means me for Ill be there to sell them the land
And tens of thousands of families means tens of thousands of nickels every day for my electric cars
The growing population will mean more stores more banks more everything
And thatll mean me for Ill be right there with business property as well as home property
What do you think of it
Therefore she could answer he was off again his minds eye filled with this new city of his dream which he builded on the Alameda hills by the gateway to the Orient
Do you knowIve been looking it upthe Firth Of Clyde where all the steel ships are built isnt half as wide as Oakland Creek down there where all those old hulks lie
Why aint it a Firth of Clyde
Because the Oakland City Council spends its time debating about prunes and raisins
What is needed is somebody to see things and after that organization
Thats me
I didnt make Ophir for nothing
And once things begin to hum outside capital will pour in
All I do is start it going
Gentlemen I say heres all the natural advantages for a great metropolis
God Almighty put them advantages here and he put me here to see them
Do you want to land your tea and silk from Asia and ship it straight East
Heres the docks for your steamers and heres the railroads
Do you want factories from which you can ship direct by land or water
Heres the site and heres the modern uptodate city with the latest improvements for yourselves and your workmen to live in
Then theres the water
Ill come pretty close to owning the watershed
Why not the waterworks too
Theres two water companies in Oakland now fighting like cats and dogs and both about broke
What a metropolis needs is a good water system
They cant give it
Theyre stickinthemuds
Ill gobble them up and deliver the right article to the city
Theres money there toomoney everywhere
Everything works in with everything else
Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
Its people that are behind the value
The bigger the crowd that herds in one place the more valuable is the real estate
And this is the very place for a crowd to herd
Look at it
Just look at it
You could never find a finer site for a great city
All it needs is the herd and Ill stampede a couple of hundred thousand people in here ins two years
And whats more it wont be one of these wild cat land booms
It will be legitimate
Twenty years for now therell be a million people on this side the bay
Another thing is hotels
There isnt a decent one in the town
Ill build a couple of uptodate ones thatll make them sit up and take notice
I wont care if they dont pay for years
Their effect will more than give me my money back out of the other holdings
And oh yes Im going to plant eucalyptus millions of them on these hills
But how are you going to do it
Dede asked
You havent enough money for all that youve planned
Ive thirty million and if I need more I can borrow on the land and other things
Interest on mortgages wont anywhere near eat up the increase in land values and Ill be selling land right along
In the weeks that followed Daylight was a busy man
He spent most of his time in Oakland rarely coming to the office
He planned to move the office to Oakland but as he told Dede the secret preliminary campaign of buying had to be put through first
Sunday by Sunday now from this hilltop and now from that they looked down upon the city and its farming suburbs and he pointed out to her his latest acquisitions
At first it was patches and sections of land here and there but as the weeks passed it was the unowned portions that became rare until at last they stood as islands surrounded by Daylights land
It meant quick work on a colossal scale for Oakland and the adjacent country was not slow to feel the tremendous buying
But Daylight had the ready cash and it had always been his policy to strike quickly
Before the others could get the warning of the boom he quietly accomplished many things
At the same time that his agents were purchasing corner lots and entire blocks in the heart of the business section and the waste lands for factory sites Day was rushing franchises through the city council capturing the two exhausted water companies and the eight or nine independent street railways and getting his grip on the Oakland Creek and the bay tidelands for his dock system
The tidelands had been in litigation for years and he took the bull by the hornsbuying out the private owners and at the same time leasing from the city fathers
By the time that Oakland was aroused by this unprecedented activity in every direction and was questioning excitedly the meaning of it Daylight secretly bought the chief Republican newspaper and the chief Democratic organ and moved boldly into his new offices
Of necessity they were on a large scale occupying four floors of the only modern office building in the townthe only building that wouldnt have to be torn down later on as Daylight put it
There was department after department a score of them and hundreds of clerks and stenographers
As he told Dede Ive got more companies than you can shake a stick at
Theres the Alameda  Contra Costa Land Syndicate the Consolidated Street Railways the Yerba Buena Ferry Company the United Water Company the Piedmont Realty Company the Fairview and Portola Hotel Company and half a dozen more that Ive got to refer to a notebook to remember
Theres the Piedmont Laundry Farm and Redwood Consolidated Quarries
Starting in with our quarry I just kept agoing till I got them all
And theres the shipbuilding company I aint got a name for yet
Seeing as I had to have ferryboats I decided to build them myself
Theyll be done by the time the pier is ready for them
Phew
It all sure beats poker
And Ive had the fun of gouging the robber gangs as well
The water company bunches are squealing yet
I sure got them where the hair was short
They were just about all in when I came along and finished them off
But why do you hate them so
Dede asked
Because theyre such cowardly skunks
But you play the same game they do
Yes but not in the same way
Daylight regarded her thoughtfully
When I say cowardly skunks I mean just thatcowardly skunks
They set up for a lot of gamblers and there aint one in a thousand of them thats got the nerve to be a gambler
Theyre fourflushers if you know what that means
Theyre a lot of little cottontail rabbits making believe theyre big ripsnorting timber wolves
They set out to everlastingly eat up some proposition but at the first sign of trouble they turn tail and stampede for the brush
Look how it works
When the big fellows wanted to unload Little Copper they sent Jakey Fallow into the New York Stock Exchange to yell out Ill buy all or any part of Little Copper at fifty five Little Copper being at fiftyfour
And in thirty minutes them cottontails financiers some folks call thembid up Little Copper to sixty
And an hour after that stampeding for the brush they were throwing Little Copper overboard at fortyfive and even forty
Theyre catspaws for the big fellows
Almost as fast as they rob the suckers the big fellows come along and hold them up
Or else the big fellows use them in order to rob each other
Thats the way the Chattanooga Coal and Iron Company was swallowed up by the trust in the last panic
The trust made that panic
It had to break a couple of big banking companies and squeeze half a dozen big fellows too and it did it by stampeding the cottontails
The cottontails did the rest all right and the trust gathered in Chattanooga Coal and Iron
Why any man with nerve and savvee can start them cottontails jumping for the brush
I dont exactly hate them myself but I havent any regard for chickenhearted fourflushers
CHAPTER XVII For months Daylight was buried in work
The outlay was terrific and there was nothing coming in
Beyond a general rise in land values Oakland had not acknowledged his irruption on the financial scene
The city was waiting for him to show what he was going to do and he lost no time about it
The best skilled brains on the market were hired by him for the different branches of the work
Initial mistakes he had no patience with and he was determined to start right as when he engaged Wilkinson almost doubling his big salary and brought him out from Chicago to take charge of the street railway organization
Night and day the road gangs toiled on the streets
And night and day the piledrivers hammered the big piles down into the mud of San Francisco Bay
The pier was to be three miles long and the Berkeley hills were denuded of whole groves of mature eucalyptus for the piling
At the same time that his electric roads were building out through the hills the hayfields were being surveyed and broken up into city squares with here and there according to best modern methods winding boulevards and strips of park
Broad streets well graded were made with sewers and waterpipes ready laid and macadamized from his own quarries
Cement sidewalks were also laid so that all the purchaser had to do was to select his lot and architect and start building
The quick service of Daylights new electric roads into Oakland made this big district immediately accessible and long before the ferry system was in operation hundreds of residences were going up
The profit on this land was enormous
In a day his onslaught of wealth had turned open farming country into one of the best residential districts of the city
But this money that flowed in upon him was immediately poured back into his other investments
The need for electric cars was so great that he installed his own shops for building them
And even on the rising land market he continued to buy choice factory sites and building properties
On the advice of Wilkinson practically every electric road already in operation was rebuilt
The light old fashioned rails were torn out and replaced by the heaviest that were manufactured
Corner lots on the sharp turns of narrow streets were bought and ruthlessly presented to the city in order to make wide curves for his tracks and high speed for his cars
Then too there were the mainline feeders for his ferry system tapping every portion of Oakland Alameda and Berkeley and running fast expresses to the pier end
The same largescale methods were employed in the water system
Service of the best was needed if his huge land investment was to succeed
Oakland had to be made into a worthwhile city and that was what he intended to do
In addition to his big hotels he built amusement parks for the common people and art galleries and clubhouse country inns for the more finicky classes
Even before there was any increase in population a marked increase in streetrailway traffic took place
There was nothing fanciful about his schemes
They were sound investments
What Oakland wants is a first glass theatre he said and after vainly trying to interest local capital he started the building of the theatre himself for he alone had vision for the two hundred thousand new people that were coming to the town
But no matter what pressure was on Daylight his Sundays he reserved for his riding in the hills
It was not the winter weather however that brought these rides with Dede to an end
One Saturday afternoon in the office she told him not to expect to meet her next day and when he pressed for an explanation Ive sold Mab
Daylight was speechless for the moment
Her act meant one of so many serious things that he couldnt classify it
It smacked almost of treachery
She might have met with financial disaster
It might be her way of letting him know she had seen enough of him
Or Whats the matter
he managed to ask
I couldnt afford to keep her with hay fortyfive dollars a ton Dede answered
Was that your only reason
he demanded looking at her steadily for he remembered her once telling him how she had brought the mare through one winter five years before when hay had gone as high as sixty dollars a ton
No
My brothers expenses have been higher as well and I was driven to the conclusion that since I could not afford both Id better let the mare go and keep the brother
Daylight felt inexpressibly saddened
He was suddenly aware of a great emptiness
What would a Sunday be without Dede
And Sundays without end without her
He drummed perplexedly on the desk with his fingers
Who bought her
he asked
Dedes eyes flashed in the way long since familiar to him when she was angry
Dont you dare buy her back for me she cried
And dont deny that that was what you had in mind
I wont deny it
It was my idea to a tee
But I wouldnt have done it without asking you first and seeing how you feel about it I wont even ask you
But you thought a heap of that mare and its pretty hard on you to lose her
Im sure sorry
And Im sorry too that you wont be riding with me tomorrow
Ill be plumb lost
I wont know what to do with myself
Neither shall I Dede confessed mournfully except that I shall be able to catch up with my sewing
But I havent any sewing
Daylights tone was whimsically plaintive but secretly he was delighted with her confession of loneliness
It was almost worth the loss of the mare to get that out of her
At any rate he meant something to her
He was not utterly unliked
I wish you would reconsider Miss Mason he said softly
Not alone for the mares sake but for my sake
Money dont cut any ice in this
For me to buy that mare wouldnt mean as it does to most men to send a bouquet of flowers or a box of candy to a young lady
And Ive never sent you flowers or candy
He observed the warning flash of her eyes and hurried on to escape refusal
Ill tell you what well do
Suppose I buy the mare and own her myself and lend her to you when you want to ride
Theres nothing wrong in that
Anybody borrows a horse from anybody you know
Agin he saw refusal and headed her off
Lots of men take women buggyriding
Theres nothing wrong in that
And the man always furnishes the horse and buggy
Well now whats the difference between my taking you buggyriding and furnishing the horse and buggy and taking you horsebackriding and furnishing the horses
She shook her head and declined to answer at the same time looking at the door as if to intimate that it was time for this unbusinesslike conversation to end
He made one more effort
Do you know Miss Mason I havent a friend in the world outside you
I mean a real friend man or woman the kind you chum with you know and that youre glad to be with and sorry to be away from
Hegan is the nearest man I get to and hes a million miles away from me
Outside business we dont hitch
Hes got a big library of books and some crazy kind of culture and he spends all his off times reading things in French and German and other outlandish lingoeswhen he aint writing plays and poetry
Theres nobody I feel chummy with except you and you know how little weve chummedonce a week if it didnt rain on Sunday
Ive grown kind of to depend on you
Youre a sort ofofof A sort of habit she said with a smile
Thats about it
And that mare and you astride of her coming along the road under the trees or through the sunshinewhy with both you and the mare missing there wont be anything worth waiting through the week for
If youd just let me buy her back No no I tell you no
Dede rose impatiently but her eyes were moist with the memory of her pet
Please dont mention her to me again
If you think it was easy to part with her you are mistaken
But Ive seen the last of her and I want to forget her
Daylight made no answer and the door closed behind him
Half an hour later he was conferring with Jones the erstwhile elevator boy and rabid proletarian whom Daylight long before had grubstaked to literature for a year
The resulting novel had been a failure
Editors and publishers would not look at it and now Daylight was using the disgruntled author in a little private secret service system he had been compelled to establish for himself
Jones who affected to be surprised at nothing after his crushing experience with railroad freight rates on firweood and charcoal betrayed no surprise now when the task was given to him to locate the purchaser of a certain sorrel mare
How high shall I pay for her
he asked
Any price
Youve got to get her thats the point
Drive a sharp bargain so as not to excite suspicion but her
Then you deliver her to that address up in Sonoma County
The mans the caretaker on a little ranch I have there
Tell him hes to take whacking good care of her
And after that forget all about it
Dont tell me the name of the man you buy her from
Dont tell me anything about it except that youve got her and delivered her
Savvee
But the week had not passed when Daylight noted the flash in Dedes eyes that boded trouble
Somethings gone wrongwhat is it
he asked boldly
Mab she said
The man who bought her has sold her already
If I thought you had anything to do with it I dont even know who you sold her to was Daylights answer
And whats more Im not bothering my head about her
She was your mare and its none of my business what you did with her
You havent got her thats sure and worse luck
And now while were on touchy subjects Im going to open another one with you
And you neednt get touchy about it for its not really your business at all
She waited in the pause that followed eyeing him almost suspiciously
Its about that brother of yours
He needs more than you can do for him
Selling that mare of yours wont send him to Germany
And thats what his own doctors say he needsthat crack German specialist who rips a mans bones and muscles into pulp and then molds them all over again
Well I want to send him to Germany and give that crack a flutter thats all
If it were only possible she said half breathlessly and wholly without anger
Only it isnt and you know it isnt
I cant accept money from you Hold on now he interrupted
Wouldnt you accept a drink of water from one of the Twelve Apostles if you was dying of thirst
Or would you be afraid of his evil intentionsshe made a gesture of dissent or of folks might say about it
But thats different she began
Now look here Miss Mason
Youve got to get some foolish notions out of your head
This money notion is one of the funniest things Ive seen
Suppose you was falling over a cliff wouldnt it be all right for me to reach out and hold you by the arm
Sure it would
But suppose you ended another sort of helpinstead of the strength of arm the strength of my pocket
That would be all and thats what they all say
But why do they say it
Because the robber gangs want all the suckers to be honest and respect money
If the suckers werent honest and didnt respect money where would the robbers be
Dont you see
The robbers dont deal in armholds they deal in dollars
Therefore armholds are just common and ordinary while dollars are sacredso sacred that you didnt let me lend you a hand with a few
Or heres another way he continued spurred on by her mute protest
Its all right for me to give the strength of my arm when youre falling over a cliff
But if I take that same strength of arm and use it at pickandshovel work for a day and earn two dollars you wont have anything to do with the two dollars
Yet its the same old strength of arm in a new form thats all
Besides in this proposition it wont be a claim on you
It aint even a loan to you
Its an armhold Im giving your brotherjust the same sort of armhold as if he was falling over a cliff
And a nice one you are to come running out and yell Stop
at me and let your brother go on over the cliff
What he needs to save his legs is that crack in Germany and thats the armhold Im offering
Wish you could see my rooms
Walls all decorated with horsehair bridlesscores of themhundreds of them
Theyre no use to me and they cost like Sam Scratch
But theres a lot of convicts making them and I go on buying
Why Ive spent more money in a single night on whiskey than would get the best specialists and pay all the expenses of a dozen cases like your brothers
And remember youve got nothing to do with this
If your brother wants to look on it as a loan all right
Its up to him and youve got to stand out of the way while I pull him back from that cliff
Still Dede refused and Daylights argument took a more painful turn
I can only guess that youre standing in your brothers way on account of some mistaken idea in your head that this is my idea of courting
Well it aint
You might as well think Im courting all those convicts I buy bridles from
I havent asked you to marry me and if I do I wont come trying to buy you into consenting
And there wont be anything underhand when I come aasking
Dedes face was flushed and angry
If you knew how ridiculous you are youd stop she blurted out
You can make me more uncomfortable than any man I ever knew
Every little while you give me to understand that you havent asked me to marry you yet
Im not waiting to be asked and I warned you from the first that you had no chance
And yet you hold it over my head that some time some day youre going to ask me to marry you
Go ahead and ask me now and get your answer and get it over and done with
He looked at her in honest and pondering admiration
I want you so bad Miss Mason that I dont dast to ask you now he said with such whimsicality and earnestness as to make her throw her head back in a frank boyish laugh
Besides as I told you Im green at it
I never went acourting before and I dont want to make any mistakes
But youre making them all the time she cried impulsively
No man ever courted a woman by holding a threatened proposal over her head like a club
I wont do it any more he said humbly
And anyway were off the argument
My straight talk a minute ago still holds
Youre standing in your brothers way
No matter what notions youve got in your head youve got to get out of the way and give him a chance
Will you let me go and see him and talk it over with him
Ill make it a hard and fast business proposition
Ill stake him to get well thats all and charge him interest
She visibly hesitated
And just remember one thing Miss Mason its HIS leg not yours
Still she refrained from giving her answer and Daylight went on strengthening his position
And remember I go over to see him alone
Hes a man and I can deal with him better without womenfolks around
Ill go over tomorrow afternoon
CHAPTER XVIII Daylight had been wholly truthful when he told Dede that he had no real friends
On speaking terms with thousands on fellowship and drinking terms with hundreds he was a lonely man
He failed to find the one man or group of several men with whom he could be really intimate
Cities did not make for comradeship as did the Alaskan trail
Besides the types of men were different
Scornful and contemptuous of business men on the one hand on the other his relations with the San Francisco bosses had been more an alliance of expediency than anything else
He had felt more of kinship for the franker brutality of the bosses and their captains but they had failed to claim any deep respect
They were too prone to crookedness
Bonds were better than mens word in this modern world and one had to look carefully to the bonds
In the old Yukon days it had been different
Bonds didnt go
A man said he had so much and even in a poker game his appeasement was accepted
Larry Hegan who rose ably to the largest demands of Daylights operations and who had few illusions and less hypocrisy might have proved a chum had it not been for his temperamental twist
Strange genius that he was a Napoleon of the law with a power of visioning that far exceeded Daylights he had nothing in common with Daylight outside the office
He spent his time with books a thing Daylight could not abide
Also he devoted himself to the endless writing of plays which never got beyond manuscript form and though Daylight only sensed the secret taint of it was a confirmed but temperate eater of hasheesh
Hegan lived all his life cloistered with books in a world of agitation
With the outofdoor world he had no understanding nor tolerance
In food and drink he was abstemious as a monk while exercise was a thing abhorrent
Daylights friendships in lieu of anything closer were drinking friendships and roistering friendships
And with the passing of the Sunday rides with Dede he fell back more and more upon these for diversion
The cocktail wall of inhibition he reared more assiduously than ever
The big red motorcar was out more frequently now while a stable hand was hired to give Bob exercise
In his early San Francisco days there had been intervals of easement between his deals but in this present biggest deal of all the strain was unremitting
Not in a month or two or three could his huge land investment be carried to a successful consummation
And so complete and widereaching was it that complications and knotty situations constantly arose
Every day brought its problems and when he had solved them in his masterful way he left the office in his big car almost sighing with relief at anticipation of the approaching double Martini
Rarely was he made tipsy
His constitution was too strong for that
Instead he was that direst of all drinkers the steady drinker deliberate and controlled who averaged a far higher quantity of alcohol than the irregular and violent drinker
For six weeks hardrunning he had seen nothing of Dede except in the office and there he resolutely refrained from making approaches
But by the seventh Sunday his hunger for her overmastered him
It was a stormy day
A heavy southeast gale was blowing and squall after squall of rain and wind swept over the city
He could not take his mind off of her and a persistent picture came to him of her sitting by a window and sewing feminine fripperies of some sort
When the time came for his first preluncheon cocktail to be served to him in his rooms he did not take it
Filled with a daring determination he glanced at his note book for Dedes telephone number and called for the switch
At first it was her landladys daughter who was raised but in a minute he heard the voice he had been hungry to hear
I just wanted to tell you that Im coming out to see you he said
I didnt want to break in on you without warning that was all
Has something happened
came her voice
Ill tell you when I get there he evaded
He left the red car two blocks away and arrived on foot at the pretty threestoried shingled Berkeley house
For an instant only he was aware of an inward hesitancy but the next moment he rang the bell
He knew that what he was doing was in direct violation of her wishes and that he was setting her a difficult task to receive as a Sunday caller the multimillionaire and notorious Elam Harnish of newspaper fame
On the other hand the one thing he did not expect of her was what he would have termed silly female capers
And in this he was not disappointed
She came herself to the door to receive him and shake hands with him
He hung his mackintosh and hat on the rack in the comfortable square hall and turned to her for direction
They are busy in there she said indicating the parlor from which came the boisterous voices of young people and through the open door of which he could see several college youths
So you will have to come into my rooms
She led the way through the door opening out of the hall to the right and once inside he stood awkwardly rooted to the floor gazing about him and at her and all the time trying not to gaze
In his perturbation he failed to hear and see her invitation to a seat
So these were her quarters
the intimacy of it and her making no fuss about it was startling but it was no more than he would have expected of her
It was almost two rooms in one the one he was in evidently the sittingroom and the one he could see into the bedroom
Beyond an oaken dressingtable with an orderly litter of combs and brushes and dainty feminine knickknacks there was no sign of its being used as a bedroom
The broad couch with a cover of old rose and banked high with cushions he decided must be the bed but it was farthest from any experience of a civilized bed he had ever had
Not that he saw much of detail in that awkward moment of standing
His general impression was one of warmth and comfort and beauty
There were no carpets and on the hardwood floor he caught a glimpse of several wolf and coyote skins
What captured and perceptibly held his eye for a moment was a Crouched Venus that stood on a Steinway upright against a background of mountainlion skin on the wall
But it was Dede herself that smote most sharply upon sense and perception
He had always cherished the idea that she was very much a womanthe lines of her figure her hair her eyes her voice and birdlike laughing ways had all contributed to this but here in her own rooms clad in some flowing clinging gown the emphasis of sex was startling
He had been accustomed to her only in trim tailor suits and shirtwaists or in riding costume of velvet corduroy and he was not prepared for this new revelation
She seemed so much softer so much more pliant and tender and lissome
She was a part of this atmosphere of quietude and beauty
She fitted into it just as she had fitted in with the sober office furnishings
Wont you sit down
she repeated
He felt like an animal long denied food
His hunger for her welled up in him and he proceeded to wolf the dainty morsel before him
Here was no patience no diplomacy
The straightest direct way was none too quick for him and had he known it the least unsuccessful way he could have chosen
Look here he said in a voice that shook with passion theres one thing I wont do and thats propose to you in the office
Thats why Im here
Dede Mason I want you
I just want you
While he spoke he advanced upon her his black eyes burning with bright fire his aroused blood swarthy in his cheek
So precipitate was he that she had barely time to cry out her involuntary alarm and to step back at the same time catching one of his hands as he attempted to gather her into his arms
In contrast to him the blood had suddenly left her cheeks
The hand that had warded his off and that still held it was trembling
She relaxed her fingers and his arm dropped to his side
She wanted to say something do something to pass on from the awkwardness of the situation but no intelligent thought nor action came into her mind
She was aware only of a desire to laugh
This impulse was party hysterical and partly spontaneous humorthe latter growing from instant to instant
Amazing as the affair was the ridiculous side of it was not veiled to her
She felt like one who had suffered the terror of the onslaught of a murderous footpad only to find out that it was an innocent pedestrian asking the time
Daylight was the quicker to achieve action
Oh I know Im a sure enough fool he said
II guess Ill sit down
Dont be scairt Miss Mason
Im not real dangerous
Im not afraid she answered with a smile slipping down herself into a chair beside which on the floor stood a sewingbasket from which Daylight noted some white fluffy thing of lace and muslin overflowed
Again she smiled
Though I confess you did startle me for the moment
Its funny Daylight sighed almost with regret here I am strong enough to bend you around and tie knots in you
Here I am used to having my will with man and beast and anything
And here I am sitting in this chair as weak and helpless as a little lamb
You sure take the starch out of me
Dede vainly cudgeled her brains in quest of a reply to these remarks
Instead her thought dwelt insistently upon the significance of his stepping aside in the middle of a violent proposal in order to make irrelevant remarks
What struck her was the mans certitude
So little did he doubt that he would have her that he could afford to pause and generalize upon love and the effects of love
She noted his hand unconsciously slipping in the familiar way into the side coat pocket where she knew he carried his tobacco and brown papers
You may smoke if you want to she said
He withdrew his hand with a jerk as if something in the pocket had stung him
No I wasnt thinking of smoking
I was thinking of you
Whats a man to do when he wants a woman but ask her to marry him
Thats all that Im doing
I cant do it in style
I know that
But I can use straight English and thats good enough for me
I sure want you mighty bad Miss Mason
Youre in my mind most all the time now
And what I want to know iswell do you want me
Thats all
II wish you hadnt asked she said softly
Mebbe its best you should know a few things before you give me an answer he went on ignoring the fact that the answer had already been given
I never went after a woman before in my life all reports to the contrary not withstanding
The stuff you read about me in the papers and books about me being a ladykiller is all wrong
Theres not an iota of truth in it
I guess Ive done more than my share of cardplaying and whiskeydrinking but women Ive let alone
There was a woman that killed herself but I didnt know she wanted me that bad or else Id have married hernot for love but to keep her from killing herself
She was the best of the boiling but I never gave her any encouragement
Im telling you all this because youve read about it and I want you to get it straight from me
Ladykiller 
he snorted
Why Miss Mason I dont mind telling you that Ive sure been scairt of women all my life
Youre the first one Ive not been afraid of
Thats the strange thing about it
I just plumb worship you and yet Im not afraid of you
Mebbe its because youre different from the women I know
Youve never chased me
Ladykiller
Why Ive been running away from ladies ever since I can remember and I guess all that saved me was that I was strong in the wind and that I never fell down and broke a leg or anything
I didnt ever want to get married until after I met you and until a long time after I met you
I cottoned to you from the start but I never thought it would get as bad as marriage
Why I cant get to sleep nights thinking of you and wanting you
He came to a stop and waited
She had taken the lace and muslin from the basket possibly to settle her nerves and wits and was sewing upon it
As she was not looking at him he devoured her with his eyes
He noted the firm efficient handshands that could control a horse like Bob that could run a typewriter almost as fast as a man could talk that could sew on dainty garments and that doubtlessly could play on the piano over there in the corner
Another ultrafeminine detail he noticedher slippers
They were small and bronze
He had never imagined she had such a small foot
Street shoes and riding boots were all that he had ever seen on her feet and they had given no advertisement of this
The bronze slippers fascinated him and to them his eyes repeatedly turned
A knock came at the door which she answered
Daylight could not help hearing the conversation
She was wanted at the telephone
Tell him to call up again in ten minutes he heard her say and the masculine pronoun caused in him a flashing twinge of jealousy
Well he decided whoever it was Burning Daylight would give him a run for his money
The marvel to him was that a girl like Dede hadnt been married long since
She came back smiling to him and resumed her sewing
His eyes wandered from the efficient hands to the bronze slippers and back again and he swore to himself that there were mighty few stenographers like her in existence
That was because she must have come of pretty good stock and had a pretty good raising
Nothing else could explain these rooms of hers and the clothes she wore and the way she wore them
Those ten minutes are flying he suggested
I cant marry you she said
You dont love me
She shook her head
Do you like methe littlest bit
This time she nodded at the same time allowing the smile of amusement to play on her lips
But it was amusement without contempt
The humorous side of a situation rarely appealed in vain to her
Well thats something to go on he announced
Youve got to make a start to get started
I just liked you at first and look what its grown into
You recollect you said you didnt like my way of life
Well Ive changed it a heap
I aint gambling like I used to
Ive gone into what you called the legitimate making two minutes grow where one grew before three hundred thousand folks where only a hundred thousand grew before
And this time next year therell be two million eucalyptus growing on the hills
Say do you like me more than the littlest bit
She raised her eyes from her work and looked at him as she answered I like you a great deal but He waited a moment for her to complete the sentence failing which he went on himself
I havent an exaggerated opinion of myself so I know I aint bragging when I say Ill make a pretty good husband
Youd find I was no hand at nagging and faultfinding
I can guess what it must be for a woman like you to be independent
Well youd be independent as my wife
No strings on you
You could follow your own sweet will and nothing would be too good for you
Id give you everything your heart desired Except yourself she interrupted suddenly almost sharply
Daylights astonishment was momentary
I dont know about that
Id be straight and square and live true
I dont hanker after divided affections
I dont mean that she said
Instead of giving yourself to your wife you would give yourself to the three hundred thousand people of Oakland to your street railways and ferryroutes to the two million trees on the hills to everything businessandand to all that that means
Id see that I didnt he declared stoutly
Id be yours to command
You think so but it would turn out differently
She suddenly became nervous
We must stop this talk
It is too much like attempting to drive a bargain
How much will you give
Ill give so much
I want more and all that
I like you but not enough to marry you and Ill never like you enough to marry you
How do you know that
he demanded
Because I like you less and less
Daylight sat dumfounded
The hurt showed itself plainly in his face
Oh you dont understand she cried wildly beginning to lose selfcontrolIts not that way I mean
I do like you the more Ive known you the more Ive liked you
And at the same time the more Ive known you the less would I care to marry you
This enigmatic utterance completed Daylights perplexity
Dont you see
she hurried on
I could have far easier married the Elam Harnish fresh from Klondike when I first laid eyes on him long ago than marry you sitting before me now
He shook his head slowly
Thats one too many for me
The more you know and like a man the less you want to marry him
Familiarity breeds contemptI guess thats what you mean
No no she cried but before she could continue a knock came on the door
The ten minutes is up Daylight said
His eyes quick with observation like an Indians darted about the room while she was out
The impression of warmth and comfort and beauty predominated though he was unable to analyze it while the simplicity delighted himexpensive simplicity he decided and most of it leftovers from the time her father went broke and died
He had never before appreciated a plain hardwood floor with a couple of wolfskins it sure beat all the carpets in creation
He stared solemnly at a bookcase containing acCouple of hundred books
There was mystery
He could not understand what people found so much to write about
Writing things and reading things were not the same as doing things and himself primarily a man of action doing things was alone comprehensible
His gaze passed on from the Crouched Venus to a little teatable with all its fragile and exquisite accessories and to a shining copper kettle and copper chafingdish
Chafing dishes were not unknown to him and he wondered if she concocted suppers on this one for some of those University young men he had heard whispers about
One or two watercolors on the wall made him conjecture that she had painted them herself
There were photographs of horses and of old masters and the trailing purple of a Burial of Christ held him for a time
But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano
To his homely frontiertrained mind it seemed curious that a nice young woman should have such a bold if not sinful object on display in her own room
But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith
Since it was Dede it must be eminently all right
Evidently such things went along with culture
Larry Hegan had similar casts and photographs in his bookcluttered quarters
But then Larry Hegan was different
There was that hint of unhealth about him that Daylight invariably sensed in his presence while Dede on the contrary seemed always so robustly wholesome radiating an atmosphere compounded of the sun and wind and dust of the open road
And yet if such a clean healthy woman as she went in for naked women crouching on her piano it must be all right
Dede made it all right
She could come pretty close to making anything all right
Besides he didnt understand culture anyway
She reentered the room and as she crossed it to her chair he admired the way she walked while the bronze slippers were maddening
Id like to ask you several questions he began immediately Are you thinking of marrying somebody
She laughed merrily and shook her head
Do you like anybody else more than you like methat man at the phone just now for instance
There isnt anybody else
I dont know anybody I like well enough to marry
For that matter I dont think I am a marrying woman
Office work seems to spoil one for that
Daylight ran his eyes over her from her face to the tip of a bronze slipper in a way that made the color mantle in her cheeks
At the same time he shook his head sceptically
It strikes me that youre the most marryingest woman that ever made a man sit up and take notice
And now another question
You see Ive just got to locate the lay of the land
Is there anybody you like as much as you like me
But Dede had herself well in hand
Thats unfair she said
And if you stop and consider you will find that you are doing the very thing you disclaimednamely nagging
I refuse to answer any more of your questions
Let us talk about other things
How is Bob
Half an hour later whirling along through the rain on Telegraph Avenue toward Oakland Daylight smoked one of his brownpaper cigarettes and reviewed what had taken place
It was not at all bad was his summing up though there was much about it that was baffling
There was that liking him the more she knew him and at the same time wanting to marry him less
That was a puzzler
But the fact that she had refused him carried with it a certain elation
In refusing him she had refused his thirty million dollars
That was going some for a ninety dollaramonth stenographer who had known better ties
She wasnt after money that was patent
Every woman he had encountered had seemed willing to swallow him down for the sake of his money
Why he had doubled his fortune made fifteen millions since the day she first came to work for him and behold any willingness to marry him she might have possessed had diminished as his money had increased
Gosh
he muttered
If I clean up a hundred million on this land deal she wont even be on speaking terms with me
But he could not smile the thing away
It remained to baffle him that enigmatic statement of hers that she could more easily have married the Elam Harnish fresh from the Klondike than the present Elam Harnish
Well he concluded the thing to do was for him to become more like that oldtime Daylight who had come down out of the North to try his luck at the bigger game
But that was impossible
He could not set back the flight of time
Wishing wouldnt do it and there was no other way
He might as well wish himself a boy again
Another satisfaction he cuddled to himself from their interview
He had heard of stenographers before who refused their employers and who invariably quit their positions immediately afterward
But Dede had not even hinted at such a thing
No matter how baffling she was there was no nonsensical silliness about her
She was level headed
But also he had been levelheaded and was partly responsible for this
He hadnt taken advantage of her in the office
True he had twice overstepped the bounds but he had not followed it up and made a practice of it
She knew she could trust him
But in spite of all this he was confident that most young women would have been silly enough to resign a position with a man they had turned down
And besides after he had put it to her in the right light she had not been silly over his sending her brother to Germany
Gee
he concluded as the car drew up before his hotel
If Id only known it as I do now Id have popped the question the first day she came to work
According to her sayso that would have been the proper moment
She likes me more and more and the more she likes me the less shed care to marry me
Now what do youbthink of that
She sure must be fooling
CHAPTER XIX Once again on a rainy Sunday weeks afterward Daylight proposed to Dede
As on the first time he restrained himself until his hunger for her overwhelmed him and swept him away in his red automobile to Berkeley
He left the machine several blocks away and proceeded to the house on foot
But Dede was out the landladys daughter told him and added on second thought that she was out walking in the hills
Furthermore the young lady directed him where Dedes walk was most likely to extend
Daylight obeyed the girls instructions and soon the street he followed passed the last house and itself ceased where began the first steep slopes of the open hills
The air was damp with the oncoming of rain for the storm had not yet burst though the rising wind proclaimed its imminence
As far as he could see there was no sign of Dede on the smooth grassy hills
To the right dipping down into a hollow and rising again was a large fullgrown eucalyptus grove
Here all was noise and movement the lofty slender trunked trees swaying back and forth in the wind and clashing their branches together
In the squalls above all the minor noises of creaking and groaning arose a deep thrumming note as of a mighty harp
Knowing Dede as he did Daylight was confident that he would find her somewhere in this grove where the storm effects were so pronounced
And find her he did across the hollow and on the exposed crest of the opposing slope where the gale smote its fiercest blows
There was something monotonous though not tiresome about the way Daylight proposed
Guiltless of diplomacy subterfuge he was as direct and gusty as the gale itself
had time neither for greeting nor apology
Its the same old thing he said
I want you and Ive come for you
Youve just got to have me Dede for the more I think about it the more certain I am that youve got a Sneaking liking for me thats something more than just Ordinary liking
And you dont dast say that it isnt now dast you
He had shaken hands with her at the moment he began speaking and he had continued to hold her hand
Now when she did not answer she felt a light but firmly insistent pressure as of his drawing her to him
Involuntarily she halfyielded to him her desire for the moment stronger than her will
Then suddenly she drew herself away though permitting her hand still to remain in his
You sure aint afraid of me
he asked with quick compunction
No
She smiled woefully
Not of you but of myself
You havent taken my dare he urged under this encouragement
Please please she begged
We can never marry so dont let us discuss it
Then I copper your bet to lose
He was almost gay now for success was coming faster than his fondest imagining
She liked him without a doubt and without a doubt she liked him well enough to let him hold her hand well enough to be not repelled by the nearness of him
She shook her head
No it is impossible
You would lose your bet
For the first time a dark suspicion crossed Daylights minda clew that explained everything
Say you aint been let in for some one of these secret marriages have you
The consternation in his voice and on his face was too much for her and her laugh rang out merry and spontaneous as a burst of joy from the throat of a bird
Daylight knew his answer and vexed with himself decided that action was more efficient than speech
So he stepped between her and the wind and drew her so that she stood close in the shelter of him
An unusually stiff squall blew about them and thrummed overhead in the treetops and both paused to listen
A shower of flying leaves enveloped them and hard on the heel of the wind came driving drops of rain
He looked down on her and on her hair windblown about her face and because of her closeness to him and of a fresher and more poignant realization of what she meant to him he trembled so that she was aware of it in the hand that held hers
She suddenly leaned against him bowing her head until it rested lightly upon his breast
And so they stood while another squall with flying leaves and scattered drops of rain rattled past
With equal suddenness she lifted her head and looked at him
Do you know she said I prayed last night about you
I prayed that you would fail that you would lose everything everything
Daylight stared his amazement at this cryptic utterance
That sure beats me
I always said I got out of my depth with women and youve got me out of my depth now
Why you want me to lose everything seeing as you like me I never said so
You didnt dast say you didnt
So as I was saying liking me why youd want me to go broke is clean beyond my simple understanding
Its right in line with that other puzzler of yours the moreyoulikemethelessyouwanttomarryme one
Well youve just got to explain thats all
His arms went around her and held her closely and this time she did not resist
Her head was bowed and he had not see her face yet he had a premonition that she was crying
He had learned the virtue of silence and he waited her will in the matter
Things had come to such a pass that she was bound to tell him something now
Of that he was confident
I am not romantic she began again looking at him as he spoke
It might be better for me if I were
Then I could make a fool of myself and be unhappy for the rest of my life
But my abominable common sense prevents
And that doesnt make me a bit happier either
Im still out of my depth and swimming feeble Daylight said after waiting vainly for her to go on
Youve got to show me and you aint shown me yet
Your common sense and praying that Id go broke is all up in the air to me
Little woman I just love you mighty hard and I want you to marry me
Thats straight and simple and right off the bat
Will you marry me
She shook her head slowly and then as she talked seemed to grow angry sadly angry and Daylight knew that this anger was against him
Then let me explain and just as straight and simply as you have asked
She paused as if casting about for a beginning
You are honest and straightforward
Do you want me to be honest and straightforward as a woman is not supposed to beto tell you things that will hurt youto make confessions that ought to shame me
to behave in what many men would think was an unwomanly manner
The arm around her shoulder pressed encouragement but he did not speak
I would dearly like to marry you but I am afraid
I am proud and humble at the same time that a man like you should care for me
But you have too much money
Theres where my abominable common sense steps in
Even if we did marry you could never be my manmy lover and my husband
You would be your moneys man
I know I am a foolish woman but I want my man for myself
You would not be free for me
Your money possesses you taking your time your thoughts your energy ever thing bidding you go here and go there do this and do that
Dont you see
Perhaps its pure silliness but I feel that I can love much give muchgive all and in return though I dont want all I want muchand I want much more than your money would permit you to give me
And your money destroys you it makes you less and less nice
I am not ashamed to say that I love you because I shall never marry you
And I loved you much when I did not know you at all when you first came down from Alaska and I first went into the office
You were my hero
You were the Burning Daylight of the golddiggings the daring traveler and miner
And you looked it
I dont see how any woman could have looked at you without loving youthen
But you dont look it now
Please please forgive me for hurting you
You wanted straight talk and I am giving it to you
All these last years you have been living unnaturally
You a man of the open have been cooping yourself up in the cities with all that that means
You are not the same man at all and your money is destroying you
You are becoming something different something not so healthy not so clean not so nice
Your money and your way of life are doing it
You know it
You havent the same body now that you had then
You are putting on flesh and it is not healthy flesh
You are kind and genial with me I know but you are not kind and genial to all the world as you were then
You have become harsh and cruel
And I know
Remember I have studied you six days a week month after month year after year and I know more about the most insignificant parts of you than you know of all of me
The cruelty is not only in your heart and thoughts but it is there in face
It has put its lines there
I have watched them come and grow
Your money and the life it compels you to lead have done all this
You are being brutalized and degraded
And this process can only go on and on until you are hopelessly destroyed He attempted to interrupt but she stopped him herself breathless and her voice trembling
No no let me finish utterly
I have done nothing but think think think all these months ever since you came riding with me and now that I have begun to speak I am going to speak all that I have in me
I do love you but I cannot marry you and destroy love
You are growing into a thing that I must in the end despise
You cant help it
More than you can possibly love me do you love this business game
This businessand its all perfectly useless so far as you are concernedclaims all of you
I sometimes think it would be easier to share you equitably with another woman than to share you with this business
I might have half of you at any rate
But this business would claim not half of you but ninetenths of you or ninetynine hundredths
Remember the meaning of marriage to me is not to get a mans money to spend
I want the man
You say you want ME
And suppose I consented but gave you only onehundredth part of me
Suppose there was something else in my life that took the other ninetynine parts and furthermore that ruined my figure that put pouches under my eyes and crowsfeet in the corners that made me unbeautiful to look upon and that made my spirit unbeautiful
Would you be satisfied with that onehundredth part of me
Yet that is all you are offering me of yourself
Do you wonder that I wont marry youthat I cant
Daylight waited to see if she were quite done and she went on again
It isnt that I am selfish
After all love is giving not receiving
But I see so clearly that all my giving could not do you any good
You are like a sick man
You dont play business like other men
You play it heart and and all of you
No matter what you believed and intended a wife would be only a brief diversion
There is that magnificent Bob eating his head off in the stable
You would buy me a beautiful mansion and leave me in it to yawn my head off or cry my eyes out because of my helplessness and inability to save you
This disease of business would be corroding you and marring you all the time
You play it as you have played everything else as in Alaska you played the life of the trail
Nobody could be permitted to travel as fast and as far as you to work as hard or endure as much
You hold back nothing you put all youve got into whatever you are doing
Limit is the sky he grunted grim affirmation
But if you would only play the loverhusband that way Her voice faltered and stopped and a blush showed in her wet cheeks as her eyes fell before his
And now I wont say another word she added
Ive delivered a whole sermon
She rested now frankly and fairly in the shelter of his arms and both were oblivious to the gale that rushed past them in quicker and stronger blasts
The big downpour of rain had not yet come but the mistlike squalls were more frequent
Daylight was openly perplexed and he was still perplexed when he began to speak
Im stumped
Im up a tree
Im clean flabbergasted Miss Masonor Dede because I love to call you that name
Im free to confess theres a mighty big heap in what you say
As I understand it your conclusion is that youd marry me if I hadnt a cent and if I wasnt getting fat
No no Im not joking
I acknowledge the corn and thats just my way of boiling the matter down and summing it up
If I hadnt a cent and if I was living a healthy life with all the time in the world to love you and be your husband instead of being awash to my back teeth in business and all the restwhy youd marry me
Thats all as clear as print and youre correcter than I ever guessed before
Youve sure opened my eyes a few
But Im stuck
What can I do
My business has sure roped thrown and branded me
Im tied hand and foot and I cant get up and meander over green pastures
Im like the man that got the bear by the tail
I cant let go and I want you and Ive got to let go to get you
I dont know what to do but somethings sure got to happenI cant lose you
I just cant
And Im not going to
Why youre running business a close second right now
Business never kept me awake nights
Youve left me no argument
I know Im not the same man that came from Alaska
I couldnt hit the trail with the dogs as I did in them days
Im soft in my muscles and my minds gone hard
I used to respect men
I despise them now
You see I spent all my life in the open and I reckon Im an openair man
Why Ive got the prettiest little ranch you ever laid eyes on up in Glen Ellen
Thats where I got stuck for that brickyard
You recollect handling the correspondence
I only laid eyes on the ranch that one time and I so fell in love with it that I bought it there and then
I just rode around the hills and was happy as a kid out of school
Id be a better man living in the country
The city doesnt make me better
Youre plumb right there
I know it
But suppose your prayer should be answered and Id go clean broke and have to work for days wages
She did not answer though all the body of her seemed to urge consent
Suppose I had nothing left but that little ranch and was satisfied to grow a few chickens and scratch a living somehow would you marry me then Dede
Why wed be together all the time
she cried
But Id have to be out ploughing once in a while he warned or driving to town to get the grub
But there wouldnt be the office at any rate and no man to see and men to see without end
But it is all foolish and impossible and well have to be starting back now if were to escape the rain
Then was the moment among the trees where they began the descent of the hill that Daylight might have drawn her closely to him and kissed her once
But he was too perplexed with the new thoughts she had put into his head to take advantage of the situation
He merely caught her by the arm and helped her over the rougher footing
Its darn pretty country up there at Glen Ellen he said meditatively
I wish you could see it
At the edge of the grove he suggested that it might be better for them to part there
Its your neighborhood and folks is liable to talk
But she insisted that he accompany her as far as the house
I cant ask you in she said extending her hand at the foot of the steps
The wind was humming wildly in sharply recurrent gusts but still the rain held off
Do you know he said taking it by and large its the happiest day of my life
He took off his hat and the wind rippled and twisted his black hair as he went on solemnly And Im sure grateful to God or whoever or whatever is responsible for your being on this earth
For you do like me heaps
Its been my joy to hear you say so today
Its He left the thought arrested and his face assumed the familiar whimsical expression as he murmured Dede Dede weve just got to get married
Its the only way and trust to luck for its coming out all right
But the tears were threatening to rise in her eyes again as she shook her head and turned and went up the steps
CHAPTER XX When the ferry system began to run and the time between Oakland and San Francisco was demonstrated to be cut in half the tide of Daylights terrific expenditure started to turn
Not that it really did turn for he promptly went into further investments
Thousands of lots in his residence tracts were sold and thousands of homes were being built
Factory sites also were selling and business properties in the heart of Oakland
All this tended to a steady appreciation in value of Daylights huge holdings
But as of old he had his hunch and was riding it
Already he had begun borrowing from the banks
The magnificent profits he made on the land he sold were turned into more land into more development and instead of paying off old loans he contracted new ones
As he had pyramided in Dawson City he now pyramided in Oakland but he did it with the knowledge that it was a stable enterprise rather than a risky placermining boom
In a small way other men were following his lead buying and selling land and profiting by the improvement work he was doing
But this was to be expected and the small fortunes they were making at his expense did not irritate him
There was an exception however
One Simon Dolliver with money to go in with and with cunning and courage to back it up bade fair to become a several times millionaire at Daylights expense
Dolliver too pyramided playing quickly and accurately and keeping his money turning over and over
More than once Daylight found him in the way as he himself had got in the way of the Guggenhammers when they first set their eyes on Ophir Creek
Work on Daylights dock system went on apace yet was one of those enterprises that consumed money dreadfully and that could not be accomplished as quickly as a ferry system
The engineering difficulties were great the dredging and filling a cyclopean task
The mere item of piling was anything but small
A good average pile by the time it was delivered on the ground cost a twentydollar gold piece and these piles were used in unending thousands
All accessible groves of mature eucalyptus were used and as well great rafts of pine piles were towed down the coast from Peugeot Sound
Not content with manufacturing the electricity for his street railways in the oldfashioned way in powerhouses Daylight organized the Sierra and Salvador Power Company
This immediately assumed large proportions
Crossing the San Joaquin Valley on the way from the mountains and plunging through the Contra Costa hills there were many towns and even a robust city that could be supplied with power also with light and it became a street and houselighting project as well
As soon as the purchase of power sites in the Sierras was rushed through the survey parties were out and building operations begun
And so it went
There were a thousand maws into which he poured unceasing streams of money
But it was all so sound and legitimate that Daylight born gambler that he was and with his clear wide vision could not play softly and safely
It was a big opportunity and to him there was only one way to play it and that was the big way
Nor did his one confidential adviser Larry Hegan aid him to caution
On the contrary it was Daylight who was compelled to veto the wilder visions of that able hasheesh dreamer
Not only did Daylight borrow heavily from the banks and trust companies but on several of his corporations he was compelled to issue stock
He did this grudgingly however and retained most of his big enterprises of his own
Among the companies in which he reluctantly allowed the investing public to join were the Golden Gate Dock Company and Recreation Parks Company the United Water Company the Uncial Shipbuilding Company and the Sierra and Salvador Power Company
Nevertheless between himself and Hegan he retained the controlling share in each of these enterprises
His affair with Dede Mason only seemed to languish
While delaying to grapple with the strange problem it presented his desire for her continued to grow
In his gambling simile his conclusion was that Luck had dealt him the most remarkable card in the deck and that for years he had overlooked it
Love was the card and it beat them all
Love was the king card of trumps the fifth ace the joker in a game of tenderfoot poker
It was the card of cards and play it he would to the limit when the opening came
He could not see that opening yet
The present game would have to play to some sort of a conclusion first
Yet he could not shake from his brain and vision the warm recollection of those bronze slippers that clinging gown and all the feminine softness and pliancy of Dede in her pretty Berkeley rooms
Once again on a rainy Sunday he telephoned that he was coming
And as has happened ever since man first looked upon woman and called her good again he played the blind force of male compulsion against the womans secret weakness to yield
Not that it was Daylights way abjectly to beg and entreat
On the contrary he was masterful in whatever he did but he had a trick of whimsical wheedling that Dede found harder to resist than the pleas of a suppliant lover
It was not a happy scene in its outcome for Dede in the throes of her own desire desperate with weakness and at the same time with her better judgment hating her weakness cried out You urge me to try a chance to marry you now and trust to luck for it to come out right
And life is a gamble say
Very well let us gamble
Take a coin and toss it in the air
If it comes heads Ill marry you
If it doesnt you are forever to leave me alone and never mention marriage again
A fire of mingled love and the passion of gambling came into Daylights eyes
Involuntarily his hand started for his pocket for the coin
Then it stopped and the light in his eyes was troubled
Go on she ordered sharply
Dont delay or I may change my mind and you will lose the chance
Little woman
His similes were humorous but there was no humor in their meaning
His thought was as solemn as his voice
Little woman Id gamble all the way from Creation to the Day of Judgment Id gamble a golden harp against another mans halo Id toss for pennies on the front steps of the New Jerusalem or set up a faro layout just outside the Pearly Gates but Ill be everlastingly damned if Ill gamble on love
Loves too big to me to take a chance on
Loves got to be a sure thing and between you and me it is a sure thing
If the odds was a hundred to one on my winning this flip just the same nary a flip
In the spring of the year the Great Panic came on
The first warning was when the banks began calling in their unprotected loans
Daylight promptly paid the first several of his personal notes that were presented then he divined that these demands but indicated the way the wind was going to blow and that one of those terrific financial storms he had heard about was soon to sweep over the United States
How terrific this particular storm was to be he did not anticipate
Nevertheless he took every precaution in his power and had no anxiety about his weathering it out
Money grew tighter
Beginning with the crash of several of the greatest Eastern banking houses the tightness spread until every bank in the country was calling in its credits
Daylight was caught and caught because of the fact that for the first time he had been playing the legitimate business game
In the old days such a panic with the accompanying extreme shrinkage of values would have been a golden harvest time for him
As it was he watched the gamblers who had ridden the wave of prosperity and made preparation for the slump getting out from under and safely scurrying to cover or proceeding to reap a double harvest
Nothing remained for him but to stand fast and hold up
He saw the situation clearly
When the banks demanded that he pay his loans he knew that the banks were in sore need of the money
But he was in sorer need
And he knew that the banks did not want his collateral which they held
It would do them no good
In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell
His collateral was good all of it eminently sound and worth while yet it was worthless at such a moment when the one unceasing cry was money money money
Finding him obdurate the banks demanded more collateral and as the money pinch tightened they asked for two and even three times as much as had been originally accepted
Sometimes Daylight yielded to these demands but more often not and always battling fiercely
He fought as with clay behind a crumbling wall
All portions of the wall were menaced and he went around constantly strengthening the weakest parts with clay
This clay was money and was applied a sop here and a sop there as fast as it was needed but only when it was directly needed
The strength of his position lay in the Yerba Buena Ferry Company the Consolidated Street Railways and the United Water Company
Though people were no longer buying residence lots and factory and business sites they were compelled to ride on his cars and ferryboats and to consume his water
When all the financial world was clamoring for money and perishing through lack of it the first of each month many thousands of dollars poured into his coffers from the waterrates and each day ten thousand dollars in dime and nickels came in from his street railways and ferries
Cash was what was wanted and had he had the use of all this steady river of cash all would have been well with him
As it was he had to fight continually for a portion of it
Improvement work ceased and only absolutely essential repairs were made
His fiercest fight was with the operating expenses and this was a fight that never ended
There was never any letup in his turning the thumbscrews of extended credit and economy
From the big wholesale suppliers down through the salary list to office stationery and postage stamps he kept the thumbscrews turning
When his superintendents and heads of departments performed prodigies of cutting down he patted them on the back and demanded more
When they threw down their hands in despair he showed them how more could be accomplished
You are getting eight thousand dollars a year he told Matthewson
Its better pay than you ever got in your life before
Your fortune is in the same sack with mine
Youve got to stand for some of the strain and risk
Youve got personal credit in this town
Use it
Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest
Savvee
Youre drawing down something like six hundred and sixty dollars a month
I want that cash
From now on stand everybody off and draw down a hundred
Ill pay you interest on the rest till this blows over
Two weeks later with the payroll before them it was Matthewson whos this bookkeeper Rogers
Your nephew
I thought so
Hes pulling down eightyfive a month
Afterthis let him draw thirtyfive
The forty can ride with me at interest
Impossible 
Matthewson cried
He cant make ends meet on his salary as it is and he has a wife and two kids Daylight was upon him with a mighty oath
Cant
Impossible
What in hell do you think Im running
A home for feebleminded
Feeding and dressing and wiping the little noses of a lot of idiots that cant take care of themselves
Not on your life
Im hustling and nows the time that everybody that works for me has got to hustle
I want no fairweather birds holding down my office chairs or anything else
This is nasty weather damn nasty weather and theyve got to buck into it just like me
There are ten thousand men out of work in Oakland right now and sixty thousand more in San Francisco
Your nephew and everybody else on your payroll can do as I say right now or quit
Savvee
If any of them get stuck you go around yourself and guarantee their credit with the butchers and grocers
And you trim down that payroll accordingly
Ive been carrying a few thousand folks thatll have to carry themselves for a while now thats all
You say this filters got to be replaced he told his chief of the waterworks
Well see about it
Let the people of Oakland drink mud for a change
Itll teach them to appreciate good water
Stop work at once
Get those men off the payroll
Cancel all orders for material
The contractors will sue
Let em sue and be damned
Well be busted highern a kite or on easy street before they can get judgment
And to Wilkinson Take off that owl boat
Let the public roar and come home early to its wife
And theres that last car that connects with the 1245 boat at Twentysecond and Hastings
Cut it out
I cant run it for two or three passengers
Let them take an earlier boat home or walk
This is no time for philanthropy
And you might as well take off a few more cars in the rush hours
Let the straphangers pay
Its the straphangers thatll keep us from going under
And to another chief who broke down under the excessive strain of retrenchment You say I cant do that and cant do this
Ill just show you a few of the latest patterns in the canandcant line
Youll be compelled to resign
All right if you think so I never saw the man yet that I was hard up for
And when any man thinks I cant get along without him I just show him the latest pattern in that line of goods and give him his walkingpapers
And so he fought and drove and bullied and even wheedled his way along
It was fight fight fight and no letup from the first thing in the morning till nightfall
His private office saw throngs every day
All men came to see him or were ordered to come
Now it was an optimistic opinion on the panic a funny story a serious business talk or a straight takeitorleaveit blow from the shoulder
And there was nobody to relieve him
It was a case of drive drive drive and he alone could do the driving
And this went on day after day while the whole business world rocked around him and house after house crashed to the ground
Its all right old man he told Hegan every morning and it was the same cheerful word that he passed out all day long except at such times when he was in the thick of fighting to have his will with persons and things
Eight oclock saw him at his desk each morning
By ten oclock it was into the machine and away for a round of the banks
And usually in the machine with him was the ten thousand and more dollars that had been earned by his ferries and railways the day before
This was for the weakest spot in the financial dike
And with one bank president after another similar scenes were enacted
They were paralyzed with fear and first of all he played his role of the big vital optimist
Times were improving
Of course they were
The signs were already in the air
All that anybody had to do was to sit tight a little longer and hold on
That was all
Money was already more active in the East
Look at the trading on Wall Street of the last twentyfour hours
That was the straw that showed the wind
Hadnt Ryan said so and so
and wasnt it reported that Morgan was preparing to do this and that
As for himself werent the streetrailway earnings increasing steadily
In spite of the panic more and more people were coming to Oakland right along
Movements were already beginning in real estate
He was dickering even then to sell over a thousand of his suburban acres
Of course it was at a sacrifice but it would ease the strain on all of them and bolster up the fainthearted
That was the troublethe fainthearts
Had there been no fainthearts there would have been no panic
There was that Eastern syndicate negotiating with him now to take the majority of the stock in the Sierra and Salvador Power Company off his hands
That showed confidence that better times were at hand
And if it was not cheery discourse but prayer and entreaty or show down and fight on the part of the banks Daylight had to counter in kind
If they could bully he could bully
If the favor he asked were refused it became the thing he demanded
And when it came down to raw and naked fighting with the last veil of sentiment or illusion torn off he could take their breaths away
But he knew also how and when to give in
When he saw the wall shaking and crumbling irretrievably at a particular place he patched it up with sops of cash from his three cashearning companies
If the banks went he went too
It was a case of their having to hold out
If they smashed and all the collateral they held of his was thrown on the chaotic market it would be the end
And so it was as the time passed that on occasion his red motorcar carried in addition to the daily cash the most giltedged securities he possessed namely the Ferry Company United Water and Consolidated Railways
But he did this reluctantly fighting inch by inch
As he told the president of the Merchants San Antonio who made the plea of carrying so many others Theyre small fry
Let them smash
Im the king pin here
Youve got more money to make out of me than them
Of course youre carrying too much and youve got to choose thats all
Its root hog or die for you or them
Im too strong to smash
You could only embarrass me and get yourself tangled up
Your way out is to let the small fry go and Ill lend you a hand to do it
And it was Daylight also in this time of financial anarchy who sized up Simon Dollivers affairs and lent the hand that sent that rival down in utter failure
The Golden Gate National was the keystone of Dollivers strength and to the president of that institution Daylight said Here Ive been lending you a hand and you now in the last ditch with Dolliver riding on you and me all the time
It dont go
You hear me it dont go
Dolliver couldnt cough up eleven dollars to save you
Let him get off and walk and Ill tell you what Ill do
Ill give you the railway nickels for four daysthats forty thousand cash
And on the sixth of the month you can count on twenty thousand more from the Water Company
He shrugged his shoulders
Take it or leave it
Thems my terms
Its dog eat dog and I aint overlooking any meat thats floating around Daylight proclaimed that afternoon to Hegan and Simon Dolliver went the way of the unfortunate in the Great Panic who were caught with plenty of paper and no money
Daylights shifts and devices were amazing
Nothing however large or small passed his keen sight unobserved
The strain he was under was terrific
He no longer ate lunch
The days were too short and his noon hours and his office were as crowded as at any other time
By the end of the day he was exhausted and as never before he sought relief behind his wall of alcoholic inhibition
Straight to his hotel he was driven and straight to his rooms he went where immediately was mixed for him the first of a series of double Martinis
By dinner his brain was well clouded and the panic forgotten
By bedtime with the assistance of Scotch whiskey he was fullnot violently nor uproariously full nor stupefied but merely well under the influence of a pleasant and mild anesthetic
Next morning he awoke with parched lips and mouth and with sensations of heaviness in his head which quickly passed away
By eight oclock he was at his desk buckled down to the fight by ten oclock on his personal round of the banks and after that without a moments cessation till nightfall he was handling the knotty tangles of industry finance and human nature that crowded upon him
And with nightfall it was back to the hotel the double Martinis and the Scotch and this was his program day after day until the days ran into weeks
CHAPTER XXI Though Daylight appeared among his fellows hearty voiced inexhaustible spilling over with energy and vitality deep down he was a very weary man
And sometime under the liquor drug snatches of wisdom came to him far more lucidity than in his sober moments as for instance one night when he sat on the edge of the bed with one shoe in his hand and meditated on Dedes aphorism to the effect that he could not sleep in more than one bed at a time
Still holding the shoe he looked at the array of horsehair bridles on the walls
Then carrying the shoe he got up and solemnly counted them journeying into the two adjoining rooms to complete the tale
Then he came back to the bed and gravely addressed his shoe The little womans right
Only one bed at a time
One hundred and forty hair bridles and nothing doing with ary one of them
One bridle at a time
I cant ride one horse at a time
Poor old Bob
Id better be sending you out to pasture
Thirty million dollars and a hundred million or nothing in sight and what have I got to show for it
Theres lots of things money cant buy
It cant buy the little woman
It cant buy capacity
Whats the good of thirty millions when I aint got room for more than a quart of cocktails a day
If I had a hundredquartcocktail thirst itd be different
But one quartone measly little quart
Here I am a thirty times over millionaire slaving harder every day than any dozen men that work for me and all I get is two meals that dont taste good one bed a quart of Martini and a hundred and forty hair bridles to look at on the wall
He stared around at the array disconsolately
Mr Shoe Im sizzled
Good night
Far worse than the controlled steady drinker is the solitary drinker and it was this that Daylight was developing into
He rarely drank sociably any more but in his own room by himself
Returning weary from each days unremitting effort he drugged himself to sleep knowing that on the morrow he would rise up with a dry and burning mouth and repeat the program
But the country did not recover with its wonted elasticity
Money did not become freer though the casual reader of Daylights newspapers as well as of all the other owned and subsidised newspapers in the country could only have concluded that the money tightness was over and that the panic was past history
All public utterances were cheery and optimistic but privately many of the utters were in desperate straits
The scenes enacted in the privacy of Daylights office and of the meetings of his boards of directors would have given the lie to the editorials in his newspapers as for instance when he addressed the big stockholders in the Sierra and Salvador Power Company the United Water Company and the several other stock companies Youve got to dig
Youve got a good thing but youll have to sacrifice in order to hold on
There aint no use spouting hard times explanations
Dont I know the hard times is on
Aint that what youre here for
As I said before youve got to dig
I run the majority stock and its come to a case of assess
Its that or smash
If ever I start going you wont know what struck you Ill smash that hard
The small fry can let go but you big ones cant
This ship wont sink as long as you stay with her
But if you start to leave her down youll sure go before you can get to shore
This assessment has got to be met thats all
The big wholesale supply houses the caterers for his hotels and all the crowd that incessantly demanded to be paid had their hot halfhours with him
He summoned them to his office and displayed his latest patterns of can and cant and will and wont
By God youve got to carry me
he told them
If you think this is a pleasant little game of parlor whist and that you can quit and go home whenever you want youre plumb wrong
Look here Watkins you remarked five minutes ago that you wouldnt stand for it
Now let me tell you a few
Youre going to stand for it and keep on standins for it
Youre going to continue supplying me and taking my paper until the pinch is over
How youre going to do it is your trouble not mine
You remember what I did to Klinkner and the Altamont Trust Company
I know the inside of your business better than you do yourself and if you try to drop me Ill smash you
Even if Id be going to smash myself Id find a minute to turn on you and bring you down with me
Its sink or swim for all of us and I reckon youll find it to your interest to keep me on top the puddle
Perhaps his bitterest fight was with the stockholders of the United Water Company for it was practically the whole of the gross earnings of this company that he voted to lend to himself and used to bolster up his wide battle front
Yet he never pushed his arbitrary rule too far
Compelling sacrifice from the men whose fortunes were tied up with his nevertheless when any one of them was driven to the wall and was in dire need Daylight was there to help him back into the line
Only a strong man could have saved so complicated a situation in such time of stress and Daylight was that man
He turned and twisted schemed and devised bludgeoned and bullied the weaker ones kept the fainthearted in the fight and had no mercy on the deserter
And in the end when early summer was on everything began to mend
Came a day when Daylight did the unprecedented
He left the office an hour earlier than usual and for the reason that for the first time since the panic there was not an item of work waiting to be done
He dropped into Hegans private office before leaving for a chat and as he stood up to go he said Hegan were all hunkadory
Were pulling out of the financial pawnshop in fine shape and well get out without leaving one unredeemed pledge behind
The worst is over and the end is in sight
Just a tight rein for a couple more weeks just a bit of a pinch or a flurry or so now and then and we can let go and spit on our hands
For once he varied his program
Instead of going directly to his hotel he started on a round of the bars and cafes drinking a cocktail here and a cocktail there and two or three when he encountered men he knew
It was after an hour or so of this that he dropped into the bar of the Parthenon for one last drink before going to dinner
By this time all his being was pleasantly warmed by the alcohol and he was in the most genial and best of spirits
At the corner of the bar several young men were up to the old trick of resting their elbows and attempting to force each others hands down
One broadshouldered young giant never removed his elbow but put down every hand that came against him
Daylight was interested
Its Slosson the barkeeper told him in answer to his query
Hes the heavyhammer thrower at the UC
Broke all records this year and the worlds record on top of it
Hes a husky all right all right
Daylight nodded and went over to him placing his own arm in opposition
Id like to go you a flutter son on that proposition he said
The young man laughed and locked hands with him and to Daylights astonishment it was his own hand that was forced down on the bar Hold on he muttered
Just one more flutter
I reckon I wasnt just ready that time
Again the hands locked
It happened quickly
The offensive attack of Daylights muscles slipped instantly into defense and resisting vainly his hand was forced over and down
Daylight was dazed
It had been no trick
The skill was equal or if anything the superior skill had been his
Strength sheer strength had done it
He called for the drinks and still dazed and pondering held up his own arm and looked at it as at some new strange thing
He did not know this arm
It certainly was not the arm he had carried around with him all the years
The old arm
Why it would have been play to turn down that young huskys
But this armhe continued to look at it with such dubious perplexity as to bring a roar of laughter from the young men
This laughter aroused him
He joined in it at first and then his face slowly grew grave
He leaned toward the hammerthrower
Son he said let me whisper a secret
Get out of here and quit drinking before you begin
The young fellow flushed angrily but Daylight held steadily on
You listen to your dad and let him say a few
Im a young man myself only I aint
Let me tell you several years ago for me to turn your hand down would have been like committing assault and battery on a kindergarten
Slosson looked his incredulity while the others grinned and clustered around Daylight encouragingly
Son I aint given to preaching
This is the first time I ever come to the penitent form and you put me there yourselfhard
Ive seen a few in my time and I aint fastidious so as you can notice it
But let me tell you right not that Im worth the devil alone knows how many millions and that Id sure give it all right here on the bar to turn down your hand
Which means Id give the whole shooting match just to be back where I was before I quit sleeping under the stars and come into the hencoops of cities to drink cocktails and lift up my feet and ride
Son thats thats the matter with me and thats the way I feel about it
The game aint worth the candle
You just take care of yourself and roll my advice over once in a while
Good night
He turned and lurched out of the place the moral effect of his utterance largely spoiled by the fact that he was so patently full while he uttered it
Still in a daze Daylight made to his hotel accomplished his dinner and prepared for bed
The damned young whippersnapper
he muttered
Put my hand down easy as you please
My hand
He held up the offending member and regarded it with stupid wonder
The hand that had never been beaten
The hand that had made the Circle City giants wince
And a kid from college with a laugh on his face had put it downtwice
Dede was right
He was not the same man
The situation would bear more serious looking into than he had ever given it
But this was not the time
In the morning after a good sleep he would give it consideration
CHAPTER XXII Daylight awoke with the familiar parched mouth and lips and throat took a long drink of water from the pitcher beside his bed and gathered up the train of thought where he had left it the night before
He reviewed the easement of the financial strain
Things were mending at last
While the going was still rough the greatest dangers were already past
As he had told Hegan a tight rein and careful playing were all that was needed now
Flurries and dangers were bound to come but not so grave as the ones they had already weathered
He had been hit hard but he was coming through without broken bones which was more than Simon Dolliver and many another could say
And not one of his business friends had been ruined
He had compelled them to stay in line to save himself and they had been saved as well
His mind moved on to the incident at the corner of the bar of the Parthenon when the young athlete had turned his hand down
He was no longer stunned by the event but he was shocked and grieved as only a strong man can be at this passing of his strength
And the issue was too clear for him to dodge even with himself
He knew why his hand had gone down
Not because he was an old man
He was just in the first flush of his prime and by rights it was the hand of the hammerthrower which should have gone down
Daylight knew that he had taken liberties with himself
He had always looked upon this strength of his as permanent and here for years it had been steadily oozing from him
As he had diagnosed it he had come in from under the stars to roost in the coops of cities
He had almost forgotten how to walk
He had lifted up his feet and been ridden around in automobiles cabs and carriages and electric cars
He had not exercised and he had dryrotted his muscles with alcohol
And was it worth it
What did all his money mean after all
Dede was right
It could buy him no more than one bed at a time and at the same time it made him the abjectest of slaves
It tied him fast
He was tied by it right now
Even if he so desired he could not lie abed this very day
His money called him
The office whistle would soon blow and he must answer it
The early sunshine was streaming through his windowa fine day for a ride in the hills on Bob with Dede beside him on her Mab
Yet all his millions could not buy him this one day
One of those flurries might come along and he had to be on the spot to meet it
Thirty millions
And they were powerless to persuade Dede to ride on MabMab whom he had bought and who was unused and growing fat on pasture
What were thirty millions when they could not buy a man a ride with the girl he loved
Thirty millionsthat made him come here and go there that rode upon him like so many millstones that destroyed him while they grew that put their foot down and prevented him from winning this girl who worked for ninety dollars a month
Which was better
he asked himself
All this was Dedes own thought
It was what she had meant when she prayed he would go broke
He held up his offending right arm
It wasnt the same old arm
Of course she could not love that arm and that body as she had loved the strong clean arm and body of years before
He didnt like that arm and body himself
A young whippersnapper had been able to take liberties with it
It had gone back on him
He sat up suddenly
No by God he had gone back on it
He had gone back on himself
He had gone back on Dede
She was right a thousand times right and she had sense enough to know it sense enough to refuse to marry a money slave with a whiskeyrotted carcass
He got out of bed and looked at himself in the long mirror on the wardrobe door
He wasnt pretty
The oldtime lean cheeks were gone
These were heavy seeming to hang down by their own weight
He looked for the lines of cruelty Dede had spoken of and he found them and he found the harshness in the eyes as well the eyes that were muddy now after all the cocktails of the night before and of the months and years before
He looked at the clearly defined pouches that showed under his eyes and theyve shocked him
He rolled up the sleeve of his pajamas
No wonder the hammerthrower had put his hand down
Those werent muscles
A rising tide of fat had submerged them
He stripped off the pajama coat
Again he was shocked this time but the bulk of his body
It wasnt pretty
The lean stomach had become a paunch
The ridged muscles of chest and shoulders and abdomen had broken down into rolls of flesh
He sat down on the bed and through his mind drifted pictures of his youthful excellence of the hardships he had endured over other men of the Indians and dogs he had run off their legs in the heartbreaking days and nights on the Alaskan trail of the feats of strength that had made him king over a husky race of frontiersmen
And this was age
Then there drifted across the field of vision of his minds eye the old man he had encountered at Glen Ellen corning up the hillside through the fires of sunset whiteheaded and whitebearded eightyfour in his hand the pail of foaming milk and in his face all the warm glow and content of the passing summer day
That had been age
Yes siree eightyfour and spryer than most he could hear the old man say
And I aint loafed none
I walked across the Plains with an oxteam and fit Injuns in 51 and I was a family man then with seven youngsters
Next he remembered the old woman of the chaparral pressing grapes in her mountain clearing and Ferguson the little man who had scuttled into the road like a rabbit the onetime managing editor of a great newspaper who was content to live in the chaparral along with his spring of mountain water and his handreared and manicured fruit trees
Ferguson had solved a problem
A weakling and an alcoholic he had run away from the doctors and the chickencoop of a city and soaked up health like a thirsty sponge
Well Daylight pondered if a sick man whom the doctors had given up could develop into a healthy farm laborer what couldnt a merely stout man like himself do under similar circumstances
He caught a vision of his body with all its youthful excellence returned and thought of Dede and sat down suddenly on the bed startled by the greatness of the idea that had come to him
He did not sit long
His mind working in its customary way like a steel trap canvassed the idea in all its bearings
It was bigbigger than anything he had faced before
And he faced it squarely picked it up in his two hands and turned it over and around and looked at it
The simplicity of it delighted him
He chuckled over it reached his decision and began to dress
Midway in the dressing he stopped in order to use the telephone
Dede was the first he called up
Dont come to the office this morning he said
Im coming out to see you for a moment
He called up others
He ordered his motorcar
To Jones he gave instructions for the forwarding of Bob and Wolf to Glen Ellen
Hegan he surprised by asking him to look up the deed of the Glen Ellen ranch and make out a new one in Dede Masons name
Who
Hegan demanded
Dede Mason Daylight replied imperturbably the phone must be indistinct this morning
Dede Mas on Got it
Half an hour later he was flying out to Berkeley
And for the first time the big red car halted directly before the house
Dede offered to receive him in the parlor but he shook his head and nodded toward her rooms
In there he said
No other place would suit
As the door closed his arms went out and around her
Then he stood with his hands on her shoulders and looking down into her face
Dede if I tell you flat and straight that Im going up to live on that ranch at Glen Ellen that I aint taking a cent with me that Im going to scratch for every bite I eat and that I aint going to play ary a card at the business game again will you come along with me
She gave a glad little cry and he nestled her in closely
But the next moment she had thrust herself out from him to the old position at arms length
II dont understand she said breathlessly
And you aint answered my proposition though I guess no answer is necessary
Were just going to get married right away and start
Ive sent Bob and Wolf along already
When will you be ready
Dede could not forbear to smile
My what a hurricane of a man it is
Im quite blown away
And you havent explained a word to me
Daylight smiled responsively
Look here Dede this is what cardsharps call a showdown
No more philandering and frills and longdistance sparring between you and me
Were just going to talk straight out in meetingthe truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
Now you answer some questions for me and then Ill answer yours
He paused
Well Ive got only one question after all Do you love me enough to marry me
But she began
No buts he broke in sharply
This is a showdown
When I say marry I mean what I told you at first that wed go up and live on the ranch
Do you love me enough for that
She looked at him for a moment then her lids dropped and all of her seemed to advertise consent
Come on then lets start
The muscles of his legs tensed involuntarily as if he were about to lead her to the door
My autos waiting outside
Theres nothing to delay excepting getting on your hat
He bent over her
I reckon its allowable he said as he kissed her
It was a long embrace and she was the first to speak
You havent answered my questions
How is this possible
How can you leave your business
Has anything happened
No nothings happened yet but its going to blame quick
Ive taken your preaching to heart and Ive come to the penitent form
You are my Lord God and Im sure going to serve you
The rest can go to thunder
You were sure right
Ive been the slave to my money and since I cant serve two masters Im letting the money slide
Id sooner have you than all the money in the world thats all
Again he held her closely in his arms
And Ive sure got you Dede
Ive sure got you
And I want to tell you a few more
Ive taken my last drink
Youre marrying a whiskeysoak but your husband wont be that
Hes going to grow into another man so quick you wont know him
A couple of months from now up there in Glen Ellen youll wake up some morning and find youve got a perfect stranger in the house with you and youll have to get introduced to him all over again
Youll say Im Mrs Harnish who are you
And Ill say Im Elam Harnishs younger brother
Ive just arrived from Alaska to attend the funeral
What funeral
youll say
And Ill say Why the funeral of that goodfornothing gambling whiskeydrinking Burning Daylightthe man that died of fatty degeneration of the heart from sitting in night and day at the business game Yes maam Ill say hes sure a gone coon but Ive come to take his place and make you happy
And now maam if youll allow me Ill just meander down to the pasture and milk the cow while youre getting breakfast
Again he caught her hand and made as if to start with her for the door
When she resisted he bent and kissed her again and again
Im sure hungry for you little woman he murmured You make thirty millions look like thirty cents
Do sit down and be sensible she urged her cheeks flushed the golden light in her eyes burning more golden than he had ever seen it before
But Daylight was bent on having his way and when he sat down it was with her beside him and his arm around her
Yes maam Ill say Burning Daylight was a pretty good cuss but its better that hes gone
He quit rolling up in his rabbitskins and sleeping in the snow and went to living in a chickencoop
He lifted up his legs and quit walking and working and took to existing on Martini cocktails and Scotch whiskey
He thought he loved you maam and he did his best but he loved his cocktails more and he loved his money more and himself more and most everything else more than he did you
And then Ill say Maam you just run your eyes over me and see how different I am
I aint got a cocktail thirst and all the money I got is a dollar and forty cents and Ive got to buy a new ax the last one being plumb wore out and I can love you just about eleven times as much as your first husband did
You see maam he went all to fat
And there aint ary ounce of fat on me
And Ill roll up my sleeve and show you and say Mrs
Harnish after having experience with being married to that old fat moneybags do youall mind marrying a slim young fellow like me
And youll just wipe a tear away for poor old Daylight and kind of lean toward me with a willing expression in your eye and then Ill blush maybe some being a young fellow and put my arm around you like that and thenwhy then Ill up and marry my brothers widow and go out and do the chores while shes cooking a bite to eat
But you havent answered my questions she reproached him as she emerged rosy and radiant from the embrace that had accompanied the culmination of his narrative
Now just what do you want to know
he asked
I want to know how all this is possible
How you are able to leave your business at a time like this
What you meant by saying that something was going to happen quickly
I She hesitated and blushed
I answered your question you know
Lets go and get married he urged all the whimsicality of his utterance duplicated in his eyes
You know Ive got to make way for that husky young brother of mine and I aint got long to live
She made an impatient moue and he continued seriously
You see its like this Dede
Ive been working like forty horses ever since this blamed panic set in and all the time some of those ideas youd given me were getting ready to sprout
Well they sprouted this morning thats all
I started to get up expecting to go to the office as usual
But I didnt go to the office
All that sprouting took place there and then
The sun was shining in the window and I knew it was a fine day in the hills
And I knew I wanted to ride in the hills with you just about thirty million times more than I wanted to go to the office
And I knew all the time it was impossible
And why
Because of the office
The office wouldnt let me
All my money reared right up on its hind legs and got in the way and wouldnt let me
Its a way that blamed money has of getting in the way
You know that yourself
And then I made up my mind that I was to the dividing of the ways
One way led to the office
The other way led to Berkeley
And I took the Berkeley road
Im never going to set foot in the office again
Thats all gone finished over and done with and Im letting it slide clean to smash and then some
My minds set on this
You see Ive got religion and its sure the oldtime religion its love and you and its older than the oldest religion in the world
Its IT thats what it isIT with a capital IT She looked at him with a sudden startled expression
You mean
she began
I mean just that
Im wiping the slate clean
Im letting it all go to smash
When them thirty million dollars stood up to my face and said I couldnt go out with you in the hills today I knew the time had come for me to put my foot down
And Im putting it down
Ive got you and my strength to work for you and that little ranch in Sonoma
Thats all I want and thats all Im going to save out along with Bob and Wolf a suit case and a hundred and forty hair bridles
All the rest goes and good riddance
Its that much junk
But Dede was insistent
Then thisthis tremendous loss is all unnecessary
she asked
Just what I havent been telling you
It IS necessary
If that money thinks it can stand up right to my face and say I cant go riding with you No no be serious Dede broke in
I dont mean that and you know it
What I want to know is from a standpoint of business is this failure necessary
He shook his head
You bet it isnt necessary
Thats the point of it
Im not letting go of it because Im licked to a standstill by the panic and have got to let go
Im firing it out when Ive licked the panic and am winning hands down
That just shows how little I think of it
Its you that counts little woman and I make my play accordingly
But she drew away from his sheltering arms
You are mad Elam
Call me that again he murmured ecstatically
Its sure sweeter than the chink of millions
All this she ignored
Its madness
You dont know what you are doing Oh yes I do he assured her
Im winning the dearest wish of my heart
Why your little finger is worth more Do be sensible for a moment
I was never more sensible in my lie
I know what I want and Im going to get it
I want you and the open air
I want to get my foot off the pavingstones and my ear away from the telephone
I want a little ranchhouse in one of the prettiest bits of country God ever made and I want to do the chores around that ranchhousemilk cows and chop wood and curry horses and plough the ground and all the rest of it and I want you there in the ranchhouse with me
Im plumb tired of everything else and clean wore out
And Im sure the luckiest man alive for Ive got what money cant buy
Ive got you and thirty millions couldnt buy you nor three thousand millions nor thirty cents A knock at the door interrupted him and he was left to stare delightedly at the Crouched Venus and on around the room at Dedes dainty possessions while she answered the telephone
It is Mr Hegan she said on returning
He is holding the line
He says it is important
Daylight shook his head and smiled
Please tell Mr Hegan to hang up
Im done with the office and I dont want to hear anything about anything
A minute later she was back again
He refuses to hang up
He told me to tell you that Unwin is in the office now waiting to see you and Harrison too
Mr Hegan said that Grimshaw and Hodgkins are in trouble
That it looks as if they are going to break
And he said something about protection
It was startling information
Both Unwin and Harrison represented big banking corporations and Daylight knew that if the house of Grimshaw and Hodgkins went it would precipitate a number of failures and start a flurry of serious dimensions
But Daylight smiled and shook his head and mimicked the stereotyped office tone of voice as he said Miss Mason you will kindly tell Mr Hegan that there is nothing doing and to hang up
But you cant do this she pleaded
Watch me he grimly answered
Elam
Say it again he cried
Say it again and a dozen Grimshaws and Hodgkins can smash
He caught her by the hand and drew her to him
You let Hegan hang on to that line till hes tired
We cant be wasting a second on him on a day like this
Hes only in love with books and things but Ive got a real live woman in my arms thats loving me all the time shes kicking over the traces
CHAPTER XXIII But I know something of the fight you have been making Dede contended
If you stop now all the work you have done everything will be destroyed
You have no right to do it
You cant do it
Daylight was obdurate
He shook his head and smiled tantalizingly
Nothing will be destroyed Dede nothing
You dont understand this business game
Its done on paper
Dont you see
Wheres the gold I dug out of Klondike
Why its in twentydollar gold pieces in gold watches in wedding rings
No matter what happens to me the twentydollar pieces the watches and the wedding rings remain
Suppose I died right now
It wouldnt affect the gold one iota
Its sure the same with this present situation
All I stand for is paper
Ive got the paper for thousands of acres of land
All right
Burn up the paper and burn me along with it
The land remains dont it
The rain falls on it the seeds sprout in it the trees grow out of it the houses stand on it the electric cars run over it
Its paper that business is run on
I lose my paper or I lose my life its all the same it wont alter one grain of sand in all that land or twist one blade of grass around sideways
Nothing is going to be lostnot one pile out of the docks not one railroad spike not one ounce of steam out of the gauge of a ferryboat
The cars will go on running whether I hold the paper or somebody else holds it
The tide has set toward Oakland
People are beginning to pour in
Were selling building lots again
There is no stopping that tide
No matter what happens to me or the paper them three hundred thousand folks are coming in the same
And therell be cars to carry them around and houses to hold them and good water for them to drink and electricity to give them light and all the rest
By this time Hegan had arrived in an automobile
The honk of it came in through the open window and they saw it stop alongside the big red machine
In the car were Unwin and Harrison while Jones sat with the chauffeur Ill see Hegan Daylight told Dede
Theres no need for the rest
They can wait in the machine
Is he drunk
Hegan whispered to Dede at the door
She shook her head and showed him in
Good morning Larry was Daylights greeting
Sit down and rest your feet
You sure seem to be in a flutter
I am the little Irishman snapped back
Grimshaw and Hodgkins are going to smash if something isnt done quick
Why didnt you come to the office
What are you going to do about it
Nothing Daylight drawled lazily
Except let them smash I guess But Ive had no dealings with Grimshaw and Hodgkins
I dont owe them anything
Besides Im going to smash myself
Look here Larry you know me
You know when I make up my mind I mean it
Well Ive sure made up my mind
Im tired of the whole game
Im letting go of it as fast as I can and a smash is the quickest way to let go
Hegan stared at his chief then passed his horrorstricken gaze on to Dede who nodded in sympathy
So let her smash Larry Daylight went on
All youve got to do is to protect yourself and all our friends
Now you listen to me while I tell you what to do
Everything is in good shape to do it
Nobody must get hurt
Everybody that stood by me must come through without damage
All the back wages and salaries must be paid pronto
All the money Ive switched away from the water company the street cars and the ferries must be switched back
And you wont get hurt yourself none
Every company you got stock in will come through You are crazy Daylight
the little lawyer cried out
This is all babbling lunacy
What is the matter with you
You havent been eating a drug or something
I sure have
Daylight smiled reply
And Im now coughing it up
Im sick of living in a city and playing businessIm going off to the sunshine and the country and the green grass
And Dede here is going with me
So youve got the chance to be the first to congratulate me
Congratulate thethe devil 
Hegan spluttered
Im not going to stand for this sort of foolishness
Oh yes you are because if you dont therell be a bigger smash and some folks will most likely get hurt
Youre worth a million or more yourself now and if you listen to me you come through with a whole skin
I want to get hurt and get hurt to the limit
Thats what Im looking for and theres no man or bunch of men can get between me and what Im looking for
Savvee Hegan
Savvee
What have you done to him
Hegan snarled at Dede
Hold on there Larry
For the first time Daylights voice was sharp while all the old lines of cruelty in his face stood forth
Miss Mason is going to be my wife and while I dont mind your talking to her all you want youve got to use a different tone of voice or youll be heading for a hospital which will sure be an unexpected sort of smash
And let me tell you one other thing
Thisall is my doing
She says Im crazy too
Hegan shook his head in speechless sadness and continued to stare
Therell be temporary receiverships of course Daylight advised but they wont bother none or last long
What you must do immediately is to save everybodythe men that have been letting their wages ride with me all the creditors and all the concerns that have stood by
Theres the wad of land that New Jersey crowd has been dickering for
Theyll take all of a couple of thousand acres and will close now if you give them half a chance
That Fairmount section is the cream of it and theyll dig up as high as a thousand dollars an acre for a part of it
Thatll help out some
That fivehundred acre tract beyond youll be lucky if they pay two hundred an acre
Dede who had been scarcely listening seemed abruptly to make up her mind and stepped forward where she confronted the two men
Her face was pale but set with determination so that Daylight looking at it was reminded of the day when she first rode Bob
Wait she said
I want to say something
Elam if you do this insane thing I wont marry you
I refuse to marry you
Hegan in spite of his misery gave her a quick grateful look
Ill take my chance on that Daylight began
Wait
she again interrupted
And if you dont do this thing I will marry you
Let me get this proposition clear
Daylight spoke with exasperating slowness and deliberation
As I understand it if I keep right on at the business game youll sure marry me
Youll marry me if I keep on working my head off and drinking Martinis
After each question he paused while she nodded an affirmation
And youll marry me right away
Yes
Today
Now
Yes
He pondered for a moment
No little woman I wont do it
It wont work and you know it yourself
I want youall of you and to get it Ill have to give you all of myself and therell be darn little of myself left over to give if I stay with the business game
Why Dede with you on the ranch with me Im sure of youand of myself
Im sure of you anyway
You can talk will or wont all you want but youre sure going to marry me just the same
And now Larry youd better be going
Ill be at the hotel in a little while and since Im not going a step into the office again bring all papers to sign and the rest over to my rooms
And you can get me on the phone there any time
This smash is going through
Savvee
Im quit and done
He stood up as a sign for Hegan to go
The latter was plainly stunned
He also rose to his feet but stood looking helplessly around
Sheer downright absolute insanity he muttered
Daylight put his hand on the others shoulder
Buck up Larry
Youre always talking about the wonders of human nature and here I am giving you another sample of it and you aint appreciating it
Im a bigger dreamer than you are thats all and Im sure dreaming whats coming true
Its the biggest best dream I ever had and Im going after it to get it By losing all youve got Hegan exploded at him
Sureby losing all Ive got that I dont want
But Im hanging on to them hundred and forty hair bridles just the same
Now youd better hustle out to Unwin and Harrison and get on down town
Ill be at the hotel and you can call me up any time
He turned to Dede as soon as Hegan was gone and took her by the hand
And now little woman you neednt come to the office any more
Consider yourself discharged
And remember I was your employer so youve got to come to me for recommendation and if youre not real good I wont give you one
In the meantime you just rest up and think about what things you want to pack because well just about have to set up housekeeping on your stuffleastways the front part of the house
But Elam I wont I wont
If you do this mad thing I never will marry you
She attempted to take her hand away but he closed on it with a protecting fatherly clasp
Will you be straight and honest
All right here goes
Which would you sooner haveme and the money or me and the ranch
But she began
No buts
Me and the money
She did not answer
Me and the ranch
Still she did not answer and still he was undisturbed
You see I know your answer Dede and theres nothing more to say
Heres where you and I quit and hit the high places for Sonoma
You make up your mind what you want to pack and Ill have some men out here in a couple of days to do it for you
It will be about the last work anybody else ever does for us
You and I will do the unpacking and the arranging ourselves
She made a last attempt
Elam wont you be reasonable
There is time to reconsider
I can telephone down and catch Mr Hegan as soon as he reaches the office Why Im the only reasonable man in the bunch right now he rejoined
Look at meas calm as you please and as happy as a king while theyre fluttering around like a lot of cranky hens whose heads are liable to be cut off
Id cry if I thought it would do any good she threatened
In which case I reckon Id have to hold you in my arms some more and sort of soothe you down he threatened back
And now Im going to go
Its too bad you got rid of Mab
You could have sent her up to the ranch
But see youve got a mare to ride of some sort or other
As he stood at the top of the steps leaving she said You neednt send those men
There will be no packing because I am not going to marry you
Im not a bit scared he answered and went down the steps
CHAPTER XXIV Three days later Daylight rode to Berkeley in his red car
It was for the last time for on the morrow the big machine passed into anothers possession
It had been a strenuous three days for his smash had been the biggest the panic had precipitated in California
The papers had been filled with it and a great cry of indignation had gone up from the very men who later found that Daylight had fully protected their interests
It was these facts coming slowly to light that gave rise to the widely repeated charge that Daylight had gone insane
It was the unanimous conviction among business men that no sane man could possibly behave in such fashion
On the other hand neither his prolonged steady drinking nor his affair with Dede became public so the only conclusion attainable was that the wild financier from Alaska had gone lunatic
And Daylight had grinned and confirmed the suspicion by refusing to see the reporters
He halted the automobile before Dedes door and met her with his same rushing tactics enclosing her in his arms before a word could be uttered
Not until afterward when she had recovered herself from him and got him seated did he begin to speak
Ive done it he announced
Youve seen the newspapers of course
Im plumb cleaned out and Ive just called around to find out what day you feel like starting for Glen Ellen
Itll have to be soon for its real expensive living in Oakland these days
My board at the hotel is only paid to the end of the week and I cant afford to stay after that
And beginning with tomorrow Ive got to use the street cars and they sure eat up the nickels
He paused and waited and looked at her
Indecision and trouble showed on her face
Then the smile he knew so well began to grow on her lips and in her eyes until she threw back her head and laughed in the old forthright boyish way
When are those men coming to pack for me
she asked
And again she laughed and simulated a vain attempt to escape his bearlike arms
Dear Elam she whispered dear Elam
And of herself for the first time she kissed him
She ran her hand caressingly through his hair
Your eyes are all gold right now he said
I can look in them and tell just how much you love me
They have been all gold for you Elam for a long time
I think on our little ranch they will always be all gold
Your hair has gold in it too a sort of fiery gold
He turned her face suddenly and held it between his hands and looked long into her eyes
And your eyes were full of gold only the other day when you said you wouldnt marry me
She nodded and laughed
You would have your will she confessed
But I couldnt be a party to such madness
All that money was yours not mine
But I was loving you all the time Elam for the great big boy you are breaking the thirtymillion toy with which you had grown tired of playing
And when I said no I knew all the time it was yes
And I am sure that my eyes were golden all the time
I had only one fear and that was that you would fail to lose everything
Because dear I knew I should marry you anyway and I did so want just you and the ranch and Bob and Wolf and those horsehair bridles
Shall I tell you a secret
As soon as you left I telephoned the man to whom I sold Mab
She hid her face against his breast for an instant and then looked at him again gladly radiant
You see Elam in spite of what my lips said my mind was made up then
II simply had to marry you
But I was praying you would succeed in losing everything
And so I tried to find what had become of Mab
But the man had sold her and did not know what had become of her
You see I wanted to ride with you over the Glen Ellen hills on Mab and you on Bob just as I had ridden with you through the Piedmont hills
The disclosure of Mabs whereabouts trembled on Daylights lips but he forbore
Ill promise you a mare that youll like just as much as Mab he said
But Dede shook her head and on that one point refused to be comforted
Now Ive got an idea Daylight said hastening to get the conversation on less perilous ground
Were running away from cities and you have no kith nor kin so it dont seem exactly right that we should start off by getting married in a city
So heres the idea Ill run up to the ranch and get things in shape around the house and give the caretaker his walkingpapers
You follow me in a couple of days coming on the morning train
Ill have the preacher fixed and waiting
And heres another idea
You bring your riding togs in a suit case
And as soon as the ceremonys over you can go to the hotel and change
Then out you come and you find me waiting with a couple of horses and well ride over the landscape so as you can see the prettiest parts of the ranch the first thing
And shes sure pretty that ranch
And now that its settled Ill be waiting for you at the morning train day after tomorrow
Dede blushed as she spoke
You are such a hurricane
Well maam he drawled I sure hate to burn daylight
And you and I have burned a heap of daylight
Weve been scandalously extravagant
We might have been married years ago
Two days later Daylight stood waiting outside the little Glen Ellen hotel
The ceremony was over and he had left Dede to go inside and change into her ridinghabit while he brought the horses
He held them now Bob and Mab and in the shadow of the wateringtrough Wolf lay and looked on
Already two days of ardent California sun had touched with new fires the ancient bronze in Daylights face
But warmer still was the glow that came into his cheeks and burned in his eyes as he saw Dede coming out the door ridingwhip in hand clad in the familiar corduroy skirt and leggings of the old Piedmont days
There was warmth and glow in her own face as she answered his gaze and glanced on past him to the horses
Then she saw Mab
But her gaze leaped back to the man
Oh Elam
she breathed
It was almost a prayer but a prayer that included a thousand meanings Daylight strove to feign sheepishness but his heart was singing too wild a song for mere playfulness
All things had been in the naming of his namereproach refined away by gratitude and all compounded of joy and love
She stepped forward and caressed the mare and again turned and looked at the man and breathed Oh Elam 
And all that was in her voice was in her eyes and in them Daylight glimpsed a profundity deeper and wider than any speech or thoughtthe whole vast inarticulate mystery and wonder of sex and love
Again he strove for playfulness of speech but it was too great a moment for even love fractiousness to enter in
Neither spoke
She gathered the reins and bending Daylight received her foot in his hand
She sprang as he lifted and gained the saddle
The next moment he was mounted and beside her and with Wolf sliding along ahead in his typical wolftrot they went up the hill that led out of towntwo lovers on two chestnut sorrel steeds riding out and away to honeymoon through the warm summer day
Daylight felt himself drunken as with wine
He was at the topmost pinnacle of life
Higher than this no man could climb nor had ever climbed
It was his day of days his lovetime and his matingtime and all crowned by this virginal possession of a mate who had said Oh Elam as she had said it and looked at him out of her soul as she had looked
They cleared the crest of the hill and he watched the joy mount in her face as she gazed on the sweet fresh land
He pointed out the group of heavily wooded knolls across the rolling stretches of ripe grain
Theyre ours he said
And theyre only a sample of the ranch
Wait till you see the big canon
There are coons down there and back here on the Sonoma there are mink
And deer why that mountains sure thick with them and I reckon we can scare up a mountainlion if we want to real hard
And say theres a little meadowwell I aint going to tell you another word
You wait and see for yourself
They turned in at the gate where the road to the claypit crossed the fields and both sniffed with delight as the warm aroma of the ripe hay rose in their nostrils
As on his first visit the larks were uttering their rich notes and fluttering up before the horses until the woods and the flowerscattered glades were reached when the larks gave way to blue jays and woodpeckers
Were on our land now he said as they left the hayfield behind
It runs right across country over the roughest parts
Just you wait and see
As on the first day he turned aside from the claypit and worked through the woods to the left passing the first spring and jumping the horses over the ruined remnants of the stakeandrider fence
From here on Dede was in an unending ecstasy
By the spring that gurgled among the redwoods grew another great wild lily bearing on its slender stalk the prodigious outburst of white waxen bells
This time he did not dismount but led the way to the deep canon where the stream had cut a passage among the knolls
He had been at work here and a steep and slippery horse trail now crossed the creek so they rode up beyond through the somber redwood twilight and farther on through a tangled wood of oak and madrono
They came to a small clearing of several acres where the grain stood waist high
Ours Daylight said
She bent in her saddle plucked a stalk of the ripe grain and nibbled it between her teeth
Sweet mountain hay she cried
The kind Mab likes
And throughout the ride she continued to utter cries and ejaculations of surprise and delight
And you never told me all this
she reproached him as they looked across the little clearing and over the descending slopes of woods to the great curving sweep of Sonoma Valley
Come he said and they turned and went back through the forest shade crossed the stream and came to the lily by the spring
Here also where the way led up the tangle of the steep hill he had cut a rough horse trail
As they forced their way up the zigzags they caught glimpses out and down through the sea of foliage
Yet always were their farthest glimpses stopped by the closing vistas of green and yet always as they climbed did the forest roof arch overhead with only here and there rifts that permitted shattered shafts of sunlight to penetrate
And all about them were ferns a score of varieties from the tiny goldbacks and maidenhair to huge brakes six and eight feet tall
Below them as they mounted they glimpsed great gnarled trunks and branches of ancient trees and above them were similar great gnarled branches
Dede stopped her horse and sighed with the beauty of it all
It is as if we are swimmers she said rising out of a deep pool of green tranquillity
Up above is the sky and the sun but this is a pool and we are fathoms deep
They started their horses but a dogtooth violet shouldering amongst the maidenhair caught her eye and made her rein in again
They cleared the crest and emerged from the pool as if into another world for now they were in the thicket of velvettrunked young madronos and looking down the open sunwashed hillside across the nodding grasses to the drifts of blue and white nemophilae that carpeted the tiny meadow on either side the tiny stream
Dede clapped her hands
Its sure prettier than office furniture Daylight remarked
It sure is she answered
And Daylight who knew his weakness in the use of the particular word sure knew that she had repeated it deliberately and with love
They crossed the stream and took the cattle track over the low rocky hill and through the scrub forest of manzanita till they emerged on the next tiny valley with its meadowbordered streamlet
If we dont run into some quail pretty soon Ill be surprised some Daylight said
And as the words left his lips there was a wild series of explosive thrumming as the old quail arose from all about Wolf while the young ones scuttled for safety and disappeared miraculously before the spectators very eyes
He showed her the hawks nest he had found in the lightningshattered top of the redwood and she discovered a woodrats nest which he had not seen before
Next they took the old woodroad and came out on the dozen acres of clearing where the wine grapes grew in the winecolored volcanic soil
Then they followed the cowpath through more woods and thickets and scattered glades and dropped down the hillside to where the farmhouse poised on the lip of the big canon came into view only when they were right upon it
Dede stood on the wide porch that ran the length of the house while Daylight tied the horses
To Dede it was very quiet
It was the dry warm breathless calm of California midday
All the world seemed dozing
From somewhere pigeons were cooing lazily
With a deep sigh of satisfaction Wolf who had drunk his fill at all the streams along the way dropped down in the cool shadow of the porch
She heard the footsteps of Daylight returning and caught her breath with a quick intake
He took her hand in his and as he turned the doorknob felt her hesitate
Then he put his arm around her the door swung open and together they passed in
CHAPTER XXV Many persons themselves citybred and cityreared have fled to the soil and succeeded in winning great happiness
In such cases they have succeeded only by going through a process of savage disillusionment
But with Dede and Daylight it was different
They had both been born on the soil and they knew its naked simplicities and rawer ways
They were like two persons after far wandering who had merely come home again
There was less of the unexpected in their dealings with nature while theirs was all the delight of reminiscence
What might appear sordid and squalid to the fastidiously reared was to them eminently wholesome and natural
The commerce of nature was to them no unknown and untried trade
They made fewer mistakes
They already knew and it was a joy to remember what they had forgotten
And another thing they learned was that it was easier for one who has gorged at the fleshpots to content himself with the meagerness of a crust than for one who has known only the crust
Not that their life was meagre
It was that they found keener delights and deeper satisfactions in little things
Daylight who had played the game in its biggest and most fantastic aspects found that here on the slopes of Sonoma Mountain it was still the same old game
Man had still work to perform forces to combat obstacles to overcome
When he experimented in a small way at raising a few pigeons for market he found no less zest in calculating in squabs than formerly when he had calculated in millions
Achievement was no less achievement while the process of it seemed more rational and received the sanction of his reason
The domestic cat that had gone wild and that preyed on his pigeons he found by the comparative standard to be of no less paramount menace than a Charles Klinkner in the field of finance trying to raid him for several millions
The hawks and weasels and coons were so many Dowsetts Lettons and Guggenhammers that struck at him secretly
The sea of wild vegetation that tossed its surf against the boundaries of all his clearings and that sometimes crept in and flooded in a single week was no mean enemy to contend with and subdue
His fatsoiled vegetablegarden in the nook of hills that failed of its best was a problem of engrossing importance and when he had solved it by putting in draintile the joy of the achievement was ever with him
He never worked in it and found the soil unpacked and tractable without experiencing the thrill of accomplishment
There was the matter of the plumbing
He was enabled to purchase the materials through a lucky sale of a number of his hair bridles
The work he did himself though more than once he was forced to call in Dede to hold tight with a pipewrench
And in the end when the bathtub and the stationary tubs were installed and in working order he could scarcely tear himself away from the contemplation of what his hands had wrought
The first evening missing him Dede sought and found him lamp in hand staring with silent glee at the tubs
He rubbed his hand over their smooth wooden lips and laughed aloud and was as shamefaced as any boy when she caught him thus secretly exulting in his own prowess
It was this adventure in woodworking and plumbing that brought about the building of the little workshop where he slowly gathered a collection of loved tools
And he who in the old days out of his millions could purchase immediately whatever he might desire learned the new joy of the possession that follows upon rigid economy and desire long delayed
He waited three months before daring the extravagance of a Yankee screwdriver and his glee in the marvelous little mechanism was so keen that Dede conceived forthright a great idea
For six months she saved her eggmoney which was hers by right of allotment and on his birthday presented him with a turninglathe of wonderful simplicity and multifarious efficiencies
And their mutual delight in the tool which was his was only equalled by their delight in Mabs first foal which was Dedes special private property
It was not until the second summer that Daylight built the huge fireplace that outrivalled Fergusons across the valley
For all these things took time and Dede and Daylight were not in a hurry
Theirs was not the mistake of the average citydweller who flees in ultramodern innocence to the soil
They did not essay too much
Neither did they have a mortgage to clear nor did they desire wealth
They wanted little in the way of food and they had no rent to pay
So they planned unambiguously reserving their lives for each other and for the compensations of countrydwelling from which the average countrydweller is barred
From Fergusons example too they profited much
Here was a man who asked for but the plainest fare who ministered to his own simple needs with his own hands who worked out as a laborer only when he needed money to buy books and magazines and who saw to it that the major portion of his waking time was for enjoyment
He loved to loaf long afternoons in the shade with his books or to be up with the dawn and away over the hills
On occasion he accompanied Dede and Daylight on deer hunts through the wild canons and over the rugged steeps of Hood Mountain though more often Dede and Daylight were out alone
This riding was one of their chief joys
Every wrinkle and crease in the hills they explored and they came to know every secret spring and hidden dell in the whole surrounding wall of the valley
They learned all the trails and cowpaths but nothing delighted them more than to essay the roughest and most impossible rides where they were glad to crouch and crawl along the narrowest deerruns Bob and Mab struggling and forcing their way along behind
Back from their rides they brought the seeds and bulbs of wild flowers to plant in favoring nooks on the ranch
Along the foot trail which led down the side of the big canon to the intake of the waterpipe they established their fernery
It was not a formal affair and the ferns were left to themselves
Dede and Daylight merely introduced new ones from time to time changing them from one wild habitat to another
It was the same with the wild lilac which Daylight had sent to him from Mendocino County
It became part of the wildness of the ranch and after being helped for a season was left to its own devices
they used to gather the seeds of the California poppy and scatter them over their own acres so that the orangecolored blossoms spangled the fields of mountain hay and prospered in flaming drifts in the fence corners and along the edges of the clearings
Dede who had a fondness for cattails established a fringe of them along the meadow stream where they were left to fight it out with the watercress
And when the latter was threatened with extinction Daylight developed one of the shaded springs into his watercress garden and declared war upon any invading cattail
On her wedding day Dede had discovered a long dogtooth violet by the zigzag trail above the redwood spring and here she continued to plant more and more
The open hillside above the tiny meadow became a colony of Mariposa lilies
This was due mainly to her efforts while Daylight who rode with a shorthandled ax on his saddlebow cleared the little manzanita wood on the rocky hill of all its dead and dying and overcrowded weaklings
They did not labor at these tasks
Nor were they tasks
Merely in passing they paused from time to time and lent a hand to nature
These flowers and shrubs grew of themselves and their presence was no violation of the natural environment
The man and the woman made no effort to introduce a flower or shrub that did not of its own right belong
Nor did they protect them from their enemies
The horses and the colts and the cows and the calves ran at pasture among them or over them and flower or shrub had to take its chance
But the beasts were not noticeably destructive for they were few in number and the ranch was large
On the other hand Daylight could have taken in fully a dozen horses to pasture which would have earned him a dollar and a half per head per month
But this he refused to do because of the devastation such close pasturing would produce
Ferguson came over to celebrate the housewarming that followed the achievement of the great stone fireplace
Daylight had ridden across the valley more than once to confer with him about the undertaking and he was the only other present at the sacred function of lighting the first fire
By removing a partition Daylight had thrown two rooms into one and this was the big livingroom where Dedes treasures were placedher books and paintings and photographs her piano the Crouched Venus the chafingdish and all its glittering accessories
Already in addition to her own wildanimal skins were those of deer and coyote and one mountainlion which Daylight had killed
The tanning he had done himself slowly and laboriously in frontier fashion
He handed the match to Dede who struck it and lighted the fire
The crisp manzanita wood crackled as the flames leaped up and assailed the dry bark of the larger logs
Then she leaned in the shelter of her husbands arm and the three stood and looked in breathless suspense
When Ferguson gave judgment it was with beaming face and extended hand
She draws
By crickey she draws he cried
He shook Daylights hand ecstatically and Daylight shook his with equal fervor and bending kissed Dede on the lips
They were as exultant over the success of their simple handiwork as any great captain at astonishing victory
In Fergusons eyes was actually a suspicious moisture while the woman pressed even more closely against the man whose achievement it was
He caught her up suddenly in his arms and whirled her away to the piano crying out Come on Dede
The Gloria
The Gloria
And while the flames in the fireplace that worked the triumphant strains of the Twelfth Mass rolled forth
CHAPTER XXVI Daylight had made no assertion of total abstinence though he had not taken a drink for months after the day he resolved to let his business go to smash
Soon he proved himself strong enough to dare to take a drink without taking a second
On the other hand with his coming to live in the country had passed all desire and need for drink
He felt no yearning for it and even forgot that it existed
Yet he refused to be afraid of it and in town on occasion when invited by the storekeeper would reply All right son
If my taking a drink will make you happy here goes
Whiskey for mine
But such a drink began no desire for a second
It made no impression
He was too profoundly strong to be affected by a thimbleful
As he had prophesied to Dede Burning Daylight the city financier had died a quick death on the ranch and his younger brother the Daylight from Alaska had taken his place
The threatened inundation of fat had subsided and all his oldtime Indian leanness and of muscle had returned
So likewise did the old slight hollows in his cheeks come back
For him they indicated the pink of physical condition
He became the acknowledged strong man of Sonoma Valley the heaviest lifter and hardest winded among a husky race of farmer folk
And once a year he celebrated his birthday in the oldfashioned frontier way challenging all the valley to come up the hill to the ranch and be put on its back
And a fair portion of the valley responded brought the womenfolk and children along and picnicked for the day
At first when in need of ready cash he had followed Fergusons example of working at days labor but he was not long in gravitating to a form of work that was more stimulating and more satisfying and that allowed him even more time for Dede and the ranch and the perpetual riding through the hills
Having been challenged by the blacksmith in a spirit of banter to attempt the breaking of a certain incorrigible colt he succeeded so signally as to earn quite a reputation as a horsebreaker
And soon he was able to earn whatever money he desired at this to him agreeable work
A sugar king whose breeding farm and training stables were at Caliente three miles away sent for him in time of need and before the year was out offered him the management of the stables
But Daylight smiled and shook his head
Furthermore he refused to undertake the breaking of as many animals as were offered
Im sure not going to die from overwork he assured Dede and he accepted such work only when he had to have money
Later he fenced off a small run in the pasture where from time to time he took in a limited number of incorrigibles
Weve got the ranch and each other he told his wife and Id sooner ride with you to Hood Mountain any day than earn forty dollars
You cant buy sunsets and loving wives and cool spring water and such folderols with forty dollars and forty million dollars cant buy back for me one day that I didnt ride with you to Hood Mountain
His life was eminently wholesome and natural
Early to bed he slept like an infant and was up with the dawn
Always with something to do and with a thousand little things that enticed but did not clamor he was himself never overdone
Nevertheless there were times when both he and Dede were not above confessing tiredness at bedtime after seventy or eighty miles in the saddle
Sometimes when he had accumulated a little money and when the season favored they would mount their horses with saddlebags behind and ride away over the wall of the valley and down into the other valleys
When night fell they put up at the first convenient farm or village and on the morrow they would ride on without definite plan merely continuing to ride on day after day until their money gave out and they were compelled to return
On such trips they would be gone anywhere from a week to ten days or two weeks and once they managed a three weeks trip
They even planned ambitiously some day when they were disgracefully prosperous to ride all the way up to Daylights boyhood home in Eastern Oregon stopping on the way at Dedes girlhood home in Siskiyou
And all the joys of anticipation were theirs a thousand times as they contemplated the detailed delights of this grand adventure
One day stopping to mail a letter at the Glen Ellen post office they were hailed by the blacksmith
Say Daylight he said a young fellow named Slosson sends you his regards
He came through in an auto on the way to Santa Rosa
He wanted to know if you didnt live hereabouts but the crowd with him was in a hurry
So he sent you his regards and said to tell you hed taken your advice and was still going on breaking his own record
Daylight had long since told Dede of the incident
Slosson
he meditated Slosson
That must be the hammerthrower
He put my hand down twice the young scamp
He turned suddenly to Dede
Say its only twelve miles to Santa Rosa and the horses are fresh
She divined what was in his mind of which his twinkling eyes and sheepish boyish grin gave sufficient advertisement and she smiled and nodded acquiescence
Well cut across by Bennett Valley he said
Its nearer that way
There was little difficulty once in Santa Rosa of finding Slosson
He and his party had registered at the Oberlin Hotel and Daylight encountered the young hammerthrower himself in the office
Look here son Daylight announced as soon as he had introduced Dede Ive come to go you another flutter at that hand game
Heres a likely place
Slosson smiled and accepted
The two men faced each other the elbows of their right arms on the counter the hands clasped
Slossons hand quickly forced backward and down
Youre the first man that ever succeeded in doing it he said
Lets try it again
Sure Daylight answered
And dont forget son that youre the first man that put mine down
Thats why I lit out after you today
Again they clasped hands and again Slossons hand went down
He was a broadshouldered heavymuscled young giant at least half a head taller than Daylight and he frankly expressed his chagrin and asked for a third trial
This time he steeled himself to the effort and for a moment the issue was in doubt
With flushed face and set teeth he met the others strength till his crackling muscles failed him
The air exploded sharply from his tensed lungs as he relaxed in surrender and the hand dropped limply down
Youre too many for me he confessed
I only hope youll keep out of the hammerthrowing game
Daylight laughed and shook his head
We might compromise and each stay in his own class
You stick to hammerthrowing and Ill go on turning down hands
But Slosson refused to accept defeat
Say he called out as Daylight and Dede astride their horses were preparing to depart
Saydo you mind if I look you up next year
Id like to tackle you again
Sure son
Youre welcome to a flutter any time
Though I give you fair warning that youll have to go some
Youll have to train up for Im ploughing and chopping wood and breaking colts these days
Now and again on the way home Dede could hear her big boyhusband chuckling gleefully
As they halted their horses on the top of the divide out of Bennett Valley in order to watch the sunset he ranged alongside and slipped his arm around her waist
Little woman he said youre sure responsible for it all
And I leave it to you if all the money in creation is worth as much as one arm like that when its got a sweet little woman like this to go around
For of all his delights in the new life Dede was his greatest
As he explained to her more than once he had been afraid of love all his life only in the end to come to find it the greatest thing in the world
Not alone were the two well mated but in coming to live on the ranch they had selected the best soil in which their love would prosper
In spite of her books and music there was in her a wholesome simplicity and love of the open and natural while Daylight in every fiber of him was essentially an openair man
Of one thing in Dede Daylight never got over marveling about and that was her efficient handsthe hands that he had first seen taking down flying shorthand notes and ticking away at the typewriter the hands that were firm to hold a magnificent brute like Bob that wonderfully flashed over the keys of the piano that were unhesitant in household tasks and that were twin miracles to caress and to run rippling fingers through his hair
But Daylight was not unduly uxorious
He lived his mans life just as she lived her womans life
There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed
But the whole was entwined and woven into a fabric of mutual interest and consideration
He was as deeply interested in her cooking and her music as she was in his agricultural adventures in the vegetable garden
And he who resolutely declined to die of overwork saw to it that she should likewise escape so dire a risk
In this connection using his mans judgment and putting his mans foot down he refused to allow her to be burdened with the entertaining of guests
For guests they had especially in the warm long summers and usually they were her friends from the city who were put to camp in tents which they cared for themselves and where like true campers they had also to cook for themselves
Perhaps only in California where everybody knows camp life would such a program have been possible
But Daylights steadfast contention was that his wife should not become cook waitress and chambermaid because she did not happen to possess a household of servants
On the other hand chafingdish suppers in the big livingroom for their camping guests were a common happening at which times Daylight allotted them their chores and saw that they were performed
For one who stopped only for the night it was different
Likewise it was different with her brother back from Germany and again able to sit a horse
On his vacations he became the third in the family and to him was given the building of the fires the sweeping and the washing of the dishes
Daylight devoted himself to the lightening of Dedes labors and it was her brother who incited him to utilize the splendid waterpower of the ranch that was running to waste
It required Daylights breaking of extra horses to pay for the materials and the brother devoted a three weeks vacation to assisting and together they installed a Pelting wheel
Besides sawing wood and turning his lathe and grindstone Daylight connected the power with the churn but his great triumph was when he put his arm around Dedes waist and led her out to inspect a washingmachine run by the Pelton wheel which really worked and really washed clothes
Dede and Ferguson between them after a patient struggle taught Daylight poetry so that in the end he might have been often seen sitting slack in the saddle and dropping down the mountain trails through the sunflecked woods chanting aloud Kiplings Tomlinson or when sharpening his ax singing into the whirling grindstone Henleys Song of the Sword
Not that he ever became consummately literary in the way his two teachers were
Beyond Fra Lippo Lippi and Caliban and Setebos he found nothing in Browning while George Meredith was ever his despair
It was of his own initiative however that he invested in a violin and practised so assiduously that in time he and Dede beguiled many a happy hour playing together after night had fallen
So all went well with this wellmated pair
Time never dragged
There were always new wonderful mornings and still cool twilights at the end of day and ever a thousand interests claimed him and his interests were shared by her
More thoroughly than he knew had he come to a comprehension of the relativity of things
In this new game he played he found in little things all the intensities of gratification and desire that he had found in the frenzied big things when he was a power and rocked half a continent with the fury of the blows he struck
With head and hand at risk of life and limb to bit and break a wild colt and win it to the service of man was to him no less great an achievement
And this new table on which he played the game was clean
Neither lying nor cheating nor hypocrisy was here
The other game had made for decay and death while this new one made for clean strength and life
And so he was content with Dede at his side to watch the procession of the days and seasons from the farmhouse perched on the canonlip to ride through crisp frosty mornings or under burning summer suns and to shelter in the big room where blazed the logs in the fireplace he had built while outside the world shuddered and struggled in the stormclasp of a southeaster
Once only Dede asked him if he ever regretted and his answer was to crush her in his arms and smother her lips with his
His answer a minute later took speech
Little woman even if you did cost thirty millions you are sure the cheapest necessity of life I ever indulged in
And then he added Yes I do have one regret and a monstrous big one too
Id sure like to have the winning of you all over again
Id like to go sneaking around the Piedmont hills looking for you
Id like to meander into those rooms of yours at Berkeley for the first time
And theres no use talking Im plumb soaking with regret that I cant put my arms around you again that time you leaned your head on my breast and cried in the wind and rain
CHAPTER XXVII But there came the day one year in early April when Dede sat in an easy chair on the porch sewing on certain small garments while Daylight read aloud to her
It was in the afternoon and a bright sun was shining down on a world of new green
Along the irrigation channels of the vegetable garden streams of water were flowing and now and again Daylight broke off from his reading to run out and change the flow of water
Also he was teasingly interested in the certain small garments on which Dede worked while she was radiantly happy over them though at times when his tender fun was too insistent she was rosily confused or affectionately resentful
From where they sat they could look out over the world
Like the curve of a skirting blade the Valley of the Moon stretched before them dotted with farmhouses and varied by pasturelands hayfields and vineyards
Beyond rose the wall of the valley every crease and wrinkle of which Dede and Daylight knew and at one place where the sun struck squarely the white dump of the abandoned mine burned like a jewel
In the foreground in the paddock by the barn was Mab full of pretty anxieties for the early spring foal that staggered about her on tottery legs
The air shimmered with heat and altogether it was a lazy basking day
Quail whistled to their young from the thicketed hillside behind the house
there was a gentle cooing of pigeons and from the green depths of the big canon arose the sobbing wood note of a mourning dove
Once there was a warning chorus from the foraging hens and a wild rush for cover as a hawk high in the blue cast its drifting shadow along the ground
It was this perhaps that aroused old hunting memories in Wolf
At any rate Dede and Daylight became aware of excitement in the paddock and saw harmlessly reenacted a grim old tragedy of the Younger World
Curiously eager velvetfooted and silent as a ghost sliding and gliding and crouching the dog that was mere domesticated wolf stalked the enticing bit of young life that Mab had brought so recently into the world
And the mare her own ancient instincts aroused and quivering circled ever between the foal and this menace of the wild young days when all her ancestry had known fear of him and his hunting brethren
Once she whirled and tried to kick him but usually she strove to strike him with her forehoofs or rushed upon him with open mouth and ears laid back in an effort to crunch his backbone between her teeth
And the wolfdog with ears flattened down and crouching would slide silkily away only to circle up to the foal from the other side and give cause to the mare for new alarm
Then Daylight urged on by Dedes solicitude uttered a low threatening cry and Wolf drooping and sagging in all the body of him in token of his instant return to mans allegiance slunk off behind the barn
It was a few minutes later that Daylight breaking off from his reading to change the streams of irrigation found that the water had ceased flowing
He shouldered a pick and shovel took a hammer and a pipewrench from the toolhouse and returned to Dede on the porch
I reckon Ill have to go down and dig the pipe out he told her
Its that slide thats threatened all winter
I guess shes come down at last
Dont you read ahead now he warned as he passed around the house and took the trail that led down the wall of the canon
Halfway down the trail he came upon the slide
It was a small affair only a few tons of earth and crumbling rock but starting from fifty feet above it had struck the water pipe with force sufficient to break it at a connection
Before proceeding to work he glanced up the path of the slide and he glanced with the eye of the earthtrained miner
And he saw what made his eyes startle and cease for the moment from questing farther
Hello he communed aloud look whos here
His glance moved on up the steep broken surface and across it from side to side
Here and there in places small twisted manzanitas were rooted precariously but in the main save for weeds and grass that portion of the canon was bare
There were signs of a surface that had shifted often as the rains poured a flow of rich eroded soil from above over the lip of the canon
A true fissure vein or I never saw one he proclaimed softly
And as the old hunting instincts had aroused that day in the wolfdog so in him recrudesced all the old hot desire of goldhunting
Dropping the hammer and pipewrench but retaining pick and shovel he climbed up the slide to where a vague line of outputting but mostly soilcovered rock could be seen
It was all but indiscernible but his practised eye had sketched the hidden formation which it signified
Here and there along this wall of the vein he attacked the crumbling rock with the pick and shoveled the encumbering soil away
Several times he examined this rock
So soft was some of it that he could break it in his fingers
Shifting a dozen feet higher up he again attacked with pick and shovel
And this time when he rubbed the soil from a chunk of rock and looked he straightened up suddenly gasping with delight
And then like a deer at a drinking pool in fear of its enemies he flung a quick glance around to see if any eye were gazing upon him
He grinned at his own foolishness and returned to his examination of the chunk
A slant of sunlight fell on it and it was all aglitter with tiny specks of unmistakable free gold
From the grass roots down he muttered in an awestricken voice as he swung his pick into the yielding surface
He seemed to undergo a transformation
No quart of cocktails had ever put such a flame in his cheeks nor such a fire in his eyes
As he worked he was caught up in the old passion that had ruled most of his life
A frenzy seized him that markedly increased from moment to moment
He worked like a madman till he panted from his exertions and the sweat dripped from his face to the ground
He quested across the face of the slide to the opposite wall of the vein and back again
And midway he dug down through the red volcanic earth that had washed from the disintegrating hill above until he uncovered quartz rotten quartz that broke and crumbled in his hands and showed to be alive with free gold
Sometimes he started small slides of earth that covered up his work and compelled him to dig again
Once he was swept fifty feet down the canonside but he floundered and scrambled up again without pausing for breath
He hit upon quartz that was so rotten that it was almost like clay and here the gold was richer than ever
It was a veritable treasure chamber
For a hundred feet up and down he traced the walls of the vein
He even climbed over the canonlip to look along the brow of the hill for signs of the outcrop
But that could wait and he hurried back to his find
He toiled on in the same mad haste until exhaustion and an intolerable ache in his back compelled him to pause
He straightened up with even a richer piece of goldladen quartz
Stooping the sweat from his forehead had fallen to the ground
It now ran into his eyes blinding him
He wiped it from him with the back of his hand and returned to a scrutiny of the gold
It would run thirty thousand to the ton fifty thousand anything  he knew that
And as he gazed upon the yellow lure and panted for air and wiped the sweat away his quick vision leaped and set to work
He saw the spurtrack that must run up from the valley and across the upland pastures and he ran the grades and built the bridge that would span the canon until it was real before his eyes
Across the canon was the place for the mill and there he erected it and he erected also the endless chain of buckets suspended from a cable and operated by gravity that would carry the ore across the canon to the quartzcrusher
Likewise the whole mine grew before him and beneath himtunnels shafts and galleries and hoisting plants
The blasts of the miners were in his ears and from across the canon he could hear the roar of the stamps
The hand that held the lump of quartz was trembling and there was a tired nervous palpitation apparently in the pit of his stomach
It came to him abruptly that what he wanted was a drinkwhiskey cocktails anything a drink
And even then with this new hot yearning for the alcohol upon him he heard faint and far drifting down the green abyss of the canon Dedes voice crying Here chick chick chick chick chick
Here chick chick chick
He was astounded at the lapse of time
She had left her sewing on the porch and was feeding the chickens preparatory to getting supper
The afternoon was gone
He could not conceive that he had been away that long
Again came the call Here chick chick chick chick chick
Here chick chick chick
It was the way she always calledfirst five and then three
He had long since noticed it
And from these thoughts of her arose other thoughts that caused a great fear slowly to grow in his face
For it seemed to him that he had almost lost her
Not once had he thought of her in those frenzied hours and for that much at least had she truly been lost to him
He dropped the piece of quartz slid down the slide and started up the trail running heavily
At the edge of the clearing he eased down and almost crept to a point of vantage whence he could peer out himself unseen
She was feeding the chickens tossing to them handfuls of grain and laughing at their antics
The sight of her seemed to relieve the panic fear into which he had been flung and he turned and ran back down the trail
Again he climbed the slide but this time he climbed higher carrying the pick and shovel with him
And again he toiled frenziedly but this time with a different purpose
He worked artfully loosing slide after slide of the red soil and sending it streaming down and covering up all he had uncovered hiding from the light of day the treasure he had discovered
He even went into the woods and scooped armfuls of last years fallen leaves which he scattered over the slide
But this he gave up as a vain task and he sent more slides of soil down upon the scene of his labor until no sign remained of the outjutting walls of the vein
Next he repaired the broken pipe gathered his tools together and started up the trail
He walked slowly feeling a great weariness as of a man who had passed through a frightful crisis
He put the tools away took a great drink of the water that again flowed through the pipes and sat down on the bench by the open kitchen door
Dede was inside preparing supper and the sound of her footsteps gave him a vast content
He breathed the balmy mountain air in great gulps like a diver freshrisen from the sea
And as he drank in the air he gazed with all his eyes at the clouds and sky and valley as if he were drinking in that too along with the air
Dede did not know he had come back and at times he turned his head and stole glances in at herat her efficient hands at the bronze of her brown hair that smouldered with fire when she crossed the path of sunshine that streamed through the window at the promise of her figure that shot through him a pang most strangely sweet and sweetly dear
He heard her approaching the door and kept his head turned resolutely toward the valley
And next he thrilled as he had always thrilled when he felt the caressing gentleness of her fingers through his hair
I didnt know you were back she said
Was it serious
Pretty bad that slide he answered still gazing away and thrilling to her touch
More serious than I reckoned
But Ive got the plan
Do you know what Im going to doIm going to plant eucalyptus all over it
Theyll hold it
Ill plant them thick as grass so that even a hungry rabbit cant squeeze between them and when they get their roots agoing nothing in creation will ever move that dirt again
Why is it as bad as that
He shook his head
Nothing exciting
But Id sure like to see any blamed old slide get the best of me thats all
Im going to seal that slide down so that itll stay there for a million years
And when the last trump sounds and Sonoma Mountain and all the other mountains pass into nothingness that old slide will be still astanding there held up by the roots
He passed his arm around her and pulled her down on his knees
Say little woman you sure miss a lot by living here on the ranchmusic and theatres and such things
Dont you ever have a hankering to drop it all and go back
So great was his anxiety that he dared not look at her and when she laughed and shook her head he was aware of a great relief
Also he noted the undiminished youth that rang through that same oldtime boyish laugh of hers
Say he said with sudden fierceness dont you go fooling around that slide until after I get the trees in and rooted
Its mighty dangerous and I sure cant afford to lose you now
He drew her lips to his and kissed her hungrily and passionately
What a lover
she said and pride in him and in her own womanhood was in her voice
Look at that Dede
He removed one encircling arm and swept it in a wide gesture over the valley and the mountains beyond
The Valley of the Moona good name a good name
Do you know when I look out over it all and think of you and of all it means it kind of makes me ache in the throat and I have things in my heart I cant find the words to say and I have a feeling that I can almost understand Browning and those other highflying poetfellows
Look at Hood Mountain there just where the suns striking
It was down in that crease that we found the spring
And that was the night you didnt milk the cows till ten oclock she laughed
And if you keep me here much longer supper wont be any earlier than it was that night
Both arose from the bench and Daylight caught up the milkpail from the nail by the door
He paused a moment longer to look out over the valley
Its sure grand he said
Its sure grand she echoed laughing joyously at him and with him and herself and all the world as she passed in through the door
And Daylight like the old man he once had met himself went down the hill through the fires of sunset with a milk pail on his arm
