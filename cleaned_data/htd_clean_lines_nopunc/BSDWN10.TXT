This etext was prepared with the use of Calera WordScan Plus 20 BUTTERED SIDE DOWN STORIES BY EDNA FERBER MARCH 1912 FOREWORD And so the story writers used to say they lived happily ever after
Ummmmaybe
After the glamour had worn off and the glass slippers were worn out did the Prince never find Cinderellas manner redolent of the kitchen hearth and was it never necessary that he remind her to be more careful of her fingernails and grammar
After Puss in Boots had won wealth and a wife for his young master did not that gentleman often fume with chagrin because the neighbors perhaps refused to call on the lady of the former poor millers son
It is a great risk to take with ones bookchildren
These stories make no such promises
They stop just short of the phrase of the old story writers and end truthfully thus And so they lived

WHERE THE CAR TURNS AT 18TH BUTTERED SIDE DOWN I THE FROG AND THE PUDDLE Any one who has ever written for the magazines nobody could devise a more sweeping opening it includes the iceman who does a humorous article on the subject of his troubles and the neglected wife next door who journalizes knows that a story the scene of which is not New York is merely junk
Take Fifth Avenue as a framework pad it out to five thousand words and there you have the ideal short story
Consequently I feel a certain timidity in confessing that I do not know Fifth Avenue from Hester Street when I see it because Ive never seen it
It has been said that from the latter to the former is a tenyear journey from which I have gathered that they lie some miles apart
As for Fortysecond Street of which musical comedians carol I know not if it be a fashionable shopping thoroughfare or a factory district
A confession of this kind is not only good for the soul but for the editor
It saves him the trouble of turning to page two
This is a story of Chicago which is a first cousin of New York although the two are not on chummy terms
It is a story of that part of Chicago which lies east of Dearborn Avenue and south of Division Street and which may be called the Nottingham curtain district
In the Nottingham curtain district every front parlor window is embellished with a Rooms With or Without Board sign
The curtains themselves have mellowed from their original departmentstorebasementwhite to a rich deep tone of Chicago smoke which has the notorious London variety beaten by several shades
Block after block the twostoryandbasement houses stretch all grimy and gritty and looking sadly down upon the five square feet of mangy grass forming the pitiful front yard of each
Now and then the monotonous line of front stoops is broken by an outjutting basement delicatessen shop
But not often
The Nottingham curtain district does not run heavily to delicacies
It is stronger on creamed cabbage and bread pudding
Up in the third floor back at Mis Bucks elegant rooms 250 and up a week
Gents preferred Gertie was brushing her hair for the night
One hundred strokes with a bristle brush
Anyone who reads the beauty column in the newspapers knows that
There was something heroic in the sight of Gertie brushing her hair one hundred strokes before going to bed at night
Only a woman could understand her doing it
Gertie clerked downtown on State Street in a gents glove department
A gents glove department requires careful dressing on the part of its clerks and the manager in selecting them is particular about choosing lookers with especial attention to figure hair and finger nails
Gertie was a looker
Providence had taken care of that
But you cannot leave your hair and finger nails to Providence
They demand coaxing with a bristle brush and an orangewood stick
Now clerking as Gertie would tell you is fierce on the feet
And when your feet are tired you are tired all over
Gerties feet were tired every night
About eightthirty she longed to peel off her clothes drop them in a heap on the floor and tumble unbrushed unwashed unmanicured into bed
She never did it
Things had been particularly trying tonight
After washing out three handkerchiefs and pasting them with practised hand over the mirror Gertie had taken off her shoes and discovered a hole the size of a silver quarter in the heel of her left stocking
Gertie had a countrybred horror of holey stockings
She darned the hole yawning her aching feet pressed against the smooth cool leg of the iron bed
That done she had had the colossal courage to wash her face slap cold cream on it and push back the cuticle around her nails
Seated huddled on the side of her thin little iron bed Gertie was brushing her hair bravely counting the strokes somewhere in her subconscious mind and thinking busily all the while of something else
Her brush rose fell swept downward rose fell rhythmically
Ninetysix ninetyseven ninetyeight ninety  Oh darn it
Whats the use
cried Gertie and hurled the brush across the room with a crack
She sat looking after it with wide staring eyes until the brush blurred in with the faded red roses on the carpet
When she found it doing that she got up wadded her hair viciously into a hard bun in the back instead of braiding it carefully as usual crossed the room it wasnt much of a trip picked up the brush and stood looking down at it her under lip caught between her teeth
That is the humiliating part of losing your temper and throwing things
You have to come down to picking them up anyway
Her lip still held prisoner Gertie tossed the brush on the bureau fastened her nightgown at the throat with a safety pin turned out the gas and crawled into bed
Perhaps the hard bun at the back of her head kept her awake
She lay there with her eyes wide open and sleepless staring into the darkness
At midnight the Kid Next Door came in whistling like one unused to boardinghouse rules
Gertie liked him for that
At the head of the stairs he stopped whistling and came softly into his own third floor back just next to Gerties
Gertie liked him for that too
The two rooms had been one in the fashionable days of the Nottingham curtain district long before the advent of Mis Buck
That thrifty lady on coming into possession had caused a flimsy partition to be run up slicing the room in twain and doubling its rental
Lying there Gertie could hear the Kid Next Door moving about getting ready for bed and humming Every Little Movement Has a Meaning of Its Own very lightly under his breath
He polished his shoes briskly and Gertie smiled there in the darkness of her own room in sympathy
Poor kid he had his beauty struggles too
Gertie had never seen the Kid Next Door although he had come four months ago
But she knew he wasnt a grouch because he alternately whistled and sang offkey tenor while dressing in the morning
She had also discovered that his bed must run along the same wall against which her bed was pushed
Gertie told herself that there was something almost immodest about being able to hear him breathing as he slept
He had tumbled into bed with a little grunt of weariness
Gertie lay there another hour staring into the darkness
Then she began to cry softly lying on her face with her head between her arms
The cold cream and the salt tears mingled and formed a slippery paste
Gertie wept on because she couldnt help it
The longer she wept the more difficult her sobs became until finally they bordered on the hysterical
They filled her lungs until they ached and reached her throat with a force that jerked her head back
Rapraprap
sounded sharply from the head of her bed
Gertie stopped sobbing and her heart stopped beating
She lay tense and still listening
Everyone knows that spooks rap three times at the head of ones bed
Its a regular highsign with them
Rapraprap
Gerties skin became gooseflesh and coldwater effects chased up and down her spine
Whats your trouble in there
demanded an unspooky voice so near that Gertie jumped
Sick
It was the Kid Next Door
Nno Im not sick faltered Gertie her mouth close to the wall
Just then a belated sob that had stopped halfway when the raps began hustled on to join its sisters
It took Gertie by surprise and brought prompt response from the other side of the wall
Ill bet I scared you green
I didnt mean to but on the square if youre feeling sick a little nip of brandy will set you up
Excuse my mentioning it girlie but Id do the same for my sister
I hate like sin to hear a woman suffer like that and anyway I dont know whether youre fourteen or forty so its perfectly respectable
Ill get the bottle and leave it outside your door
No you dont
answered Gertie in a hollow voice praying meanwhile that the woman in the room below might be sleeping
Im not sick honestly Im not
Im just as much obliged and Im dead sorry I woke you up with my blubbering
I started out with the soft pedal on but things got away from me
Can you hear me
Like a phonograph
Sure you couldnt use a sip of brandy where itd do the most good
Sure
Well then cut out the weeps and get your beauty sleep kid
He aint worth sobbing over anyway believe me
He
snorted Gertie indignantly
Youre cold
There never was anything in pegtops that could make me carry on like the heroine of the Elsie series
Lost your job
No such luck
Well then what in Sam Hill could make a woman Lonesome
snapped Gertie
And the floorwalker got fresh today
And I found two gray hairs tonight
And Id give my next weeks pay envelope to hear the double click that our front gate gives back home
Back home
echoed the Kid Next Door in a dangerously loud voice
Say I want to talk to you
If youll promise you wont get sore and think Im fresh Ill ask you a favor
Slip on a kimono and well sneak down to the front stoop and talk it over
Im as wide awake as a chorus girl and twice as hungry
Ive got two apples and a box of crackers
Are you on
Gertie snickered
It isnt done in our best sets but Im on
Ive got a can of sardines and an orange
Ill be ready in six minutes
She was too
She wiped off the cold cream and salt tears with a dry towel did her hair in a schoolgirl braid and tied it with a big bow and dressed herself in a black skirt and a baby blue dressing sacque
The Kid Next Door was waiting outside in the hall
His gray sweater covered a multitude of sartorial deficiencies
Gertie stared at him and he stared at Gertie in the sickly blue light of the boardinghouse hall and it took her onehalf of one second to discover that she liked his mouth and his eyes and the way his hair was mussed
Why youre only a kid
whispered the Kid Next Door in surprise
Gertie smothered a laugh
Youre not the first man thats been deceived by a pigtail braid and a baby blue waist
I could locate those two gray hairs for you with my eyes shut and my feet in a sack
Come on boy
These Robert W Chambers situations make me nervous
Many earnest young writers with a flow of adjectives and a passion for detail have attempted to describe the quiet of a great city at night when a few million people within it are sleeping or ought to be
They work in the clang of a distant owl car and the roar of an occasional L train and the hollow echo of the footsteps of the late passerby
They go elaborately into description and are strong on the brooding hush but the thing has never been done satisfactorily
Gertie sitting on the front stoop at two in the morning with her orange in one hand and the sardine can in the other put it this way If I was to hear a cricket chirp now Id screech
This isnt really quiet
Its like waiting for a cannon cracker to go off just before the fuse is burned down
The bang isnt there yet but you hear it a hundred times in your mind before it happens
My names Augustus G Eddy announced the Kid Next Door solemnly
Back home they always called me Gus
You peel that orange while I unroll the top of this sardine can
Im guilty of having interrupted you in the middle of what the girls call a good cry and I know youll have to get it out of your system some way
Take a bite of apple and then wade right in and tell me what youre doing in this burg if you dont like it
This thing ought to have slow music began Gertie
Its pathetic
I came to Chicago from Beloit Wisconsin because I thought that little town was a lonesome hole for a vivacious creature like me
Lonesome
Listen while I laugh a low mirthless laugh
I didnt know anything about the threeply doublebarreled extra heavy brand of lonesomeness that a big town like this can deal out
Talk about your desert wastes
Theyre sociable and snug compared to this
I know threefourths of the people in Beloit Wisconsin by their first names
Ive lived here six months and Im not on informal terms with anybody except Teddy the landladys dog and hes a trained ratandbookagent terrier and not inclined to overfriendliness
When I clerked at the Enterprise Store in Beloit the women used to come in and ask for something we didnt carry just for an excuse to copy the way the lace yoke effects were planned in my shirtwaists
You ought to see the way those same shirtwaist stack up here
Why boy the lingerie waists that the other girls in my department wear make my best handtucked effort look like a simple English country blouse
Theyre so dripping with Irish crochet and real Val and Cluny insertions that its a wonder the girls dont get stoopshouldered carrying em around
Hold on a minute commanded Gus
This thing is uncanny
Our cases dovetail like the deductions in a detective story
Kneel here at my feet little daughter and Ill tell you the story of my sad young life
Im no child of the city streets either
Say I came to this town because I thought there was a bigger field for me in Gents Furnishings
Joke what
But Gertie didnt smile
She gazed up at Gus and Gus gazed down at her and his fingers fiddled absently with the big bow at the end of her braid
And isnt there
asked Gertie sympathetically
Girlie I havent saved twelve dollars since I came
Im no tightwad and I dont believe in packing everything away into a white marble mausoleum but still a gink kind of whispers to himself that some day hell be furnishing up a kitchen pantry of his own
Oh
said Gertie
And let me mention in passing continued Gus winding the ribbon bow around his finger that in the last hour or so that whisper has been swelling to a shout
Oh
said Gertie again
You said it
But I couldnt buy a secondhand gas stove with what Ive saved in the last halfyear here
Back home they used to think I was a regular little village John Drew I was so dressy
But here I look like a yokel on circus day compared to the other fellows in the store
All they need is a field glass strung over their shoulder to make them look like a clothing ad in the back of a popular magazine
Say girlie youve got the prettiest hair Ive seen since I blew in here
Look at that braid
Thick as a rope
Thats no relation to the piles of jute that the Flossies here stack on their heads
And shines
Like satin
It ought to said Gertrude wearily
I brush it a hundred strokes every night
Sometimes Im so beat that I fall asleep with my brush in the air
The manager wont stand for any romping curls or hooksandeyes that dont connect
It keeps me so busy being beautiful and what the society writers call well groomed that I dont have time to sew the buttons on my underclothes
But dont you get some amusement in the evening
marveled Gus
What was the matter with you and the other girls in the store
Cant you hit it off
Me
No
I guess I was too woodsy for them
I went out with them a couple of times
I guess theyre nice girls all right but theyve got what you call a broader way of looking at things than I have
Living in a little town all your life makes you narrow
These girlsWell maybe Ill get educated up to their plane some day but No you dont
hissed Gus
Not if I can help it
But you cant replied Gertie sweetly
My aint this a grand night
Evenings like this I used to love to putter around the yard after supper sprinkling the grass and weeding the radishes
Im the greatest kid to fool around with a hose
And flowers
Say they just grow for me
You ought to have seen my pansies and nasturtiums last summer
The fingers of the Kid Next Door wandered until they found Gerties
They clasped them
This thing just points one way little one
Its just as plain as a path leading up to a cozy little threeroom flat up here on the North Side somewhere
See it
With me and you married and playing at housekeeping in a parlor and bedroom and kitchen
And both of us going down town to work in the morning just the same as we do now
Only not the same either
Wake up little boy said Gertie prying her fingers away from those other detaining ones
Id fit into a threeroom flat like a whale in a kitchen sink
Im going back to Beloit Wisconsin
Ive learned my lesson all right
Theres a fellow there waiting for me
I used to think he was too slow
But say hes got the nicest little painting and paperhanging business you ever saw and making money
Hes secretary of the K Ps back home
They give some swell little dances during the winter especially for the married members
In five years well own our home with a vegetable garden in the back
Im a little frog and its me for the puddle
Gus stood up slowly
Gertie felt a little pang of compunction when she saw what a boy he was
I dont know when Ive enjoyed a talk like this
Ive heard about these dawn teas but I never thought Id go to one she said
Goodnight girlie interrupted Gus abruptly
Its the dreamless couch for mine
Weve got a big sale on in tan and black seconds tomorrow
II THE MAN WHO CAME BACK There are two ways of doing battle against Disgrace
You may live it down or you may run away from it and hide
The first method is heartbreaking but sure
The second cannot be relied upon because of the uncomfortable way Disgrace has of turning up at your heels just when you think you have eluded her in the last town but one
Ted Terrill did not choose the first method
He had it thrust upon him
After Ted had served his term he came back home to visit his mothers grave intending to take the next train out
He wore none of the prison pallor that you read about in books because he had been shortstop on the penitentiary allstar baseball team and famed for the dexterity with which he could grab up redhot grounders
The storied lock step and the clipped hair effect also were missing
The superintendent of Teds prison had been one of the reform kind
You never would have picked Ted for a criminal
He had none of those interesting phrenological bumps and depressions that usually are shown to such frank advantage in the Bertillon photographs
Ted had been assistant cashier in the Citizens National Bank
In a mad moment he had attempted a little sleightofhand act in which certain Citizens National funds were to be transformed into certain glittering shares and back again so quickly that the examiners couldnt follow it with their eyes
But Ted was unaccustomed to these nowyouseeitandnowyoudont feats and his hand slipped
The trick dropped to the floor with an awful clatter
Ted had been a lovable young kid six feet high and blonde with a great reputation as a dresser
He had the first yellow plush hat in our town
It sat on his golden head like a halo
The women all liked Ted
Mrs Dankworth the dashing widow why will widows persist in being dashing
 said that he was the only man in our town who knew how to wear a dress suit
The men were forever slapping him on the back and asking him to have a little something
Teds good looks and his clever tongue and a certain charming Irish way he had with him caused him to be taken up by the smart set
Now if youve never lived in a small town you will be much amused at the idea of its boasting a smart set
Which proves your ignorance
The small town smart set is deadly serious about its smartness
It likes to take sixhour runs down to the city to fit a pair of shoes and hear Caruso
Its clothes are as well made and its scandals as crisp and its pace as hasty and its golf club as dull as the clothes and scandals and pace and golf club of its city cousins
The hasty pace killed Ted
He tried to keep step in a set of young folks whose fathers had made our town
And all the time his pocketbook was yelling Whoa
The young people ran largely to scarletupholstered touring cars and countryclub doings and house parties as small town younger generations are apt to
When Ted went to high school half the boys in his little clique spent their afterschool hours dashing up and down Main street in their big glittering cars sitting slumped down on the middle of their spines in front of the steering wheel their sleeves rolled up their hair combed a militant pompadour
One or the other of them always took Ted along
It is fearfully easy to develop a taste for that kind of thing
As he grew older the taste took root and became a habit
Ted came out after serving his term still handsome spite of all that storywriters may have taught to the contrary
But well make this concession to the old tradition
There was a difference
His radiant blondeur was dimmed in some intangible elusive way
Birdie Callahan who had worked in Teds mothers kitchen for years and who had gone back to her old job at the Haley House after her mistresss death put it sadly thus He was always th hansome divil
I used to look forward to ironin day just for the pleasure of pressin his fancy shirts for him
Im that partial to them swell blondes
But I dinnaw hes changed
Doin time has taken the edge off his hair an complexion
Not changed his color do yuh mind but dulled it like a gold ring or the like that has tarnished
Ted was seated in the smoker with a chip on his shoulder and a sick horror of encountering some one he knew in his heart when Jo Haley of the Haley House got on at Westport homeward bound
Jo Haley is the most eligible bachelor in our town and the slipperiest
He has made the Haley House a gem so that traveling men will cut half a dozen towns to Sunday there
If he should say Jump through this
to any girl in our town shed jump
Jo Haley strolled leisurely up the car aisle toward Ted
Ted saw him coming and sat very still waiting
Hello Ted
Hows Ted
said Jo Haley casually
And dropped into the adjoining seat without any more fuss
Ted wet his lips slightly and tried to say something
He had been a breezy talker
But the words would not come
Jo Haley made no effort to cover the situation with a rush of conversation
He did not seem to realize that there was any situation to cover
He champed the end of his cigar and handed one to Ted
Well youve taken your lickin kid
What you going to do now
The rawness of it made Ted wince
Oh I dont know he stammered
Ive a job half promised in Chicago
What doing
Ted laughed a short and ugly laugh
Driving a brewery auto truck
Jo Haley tossed his cigar dexterously to the opposite corner of his mouth and squinted thoughtfully along its bulging sides
Remember that Wenzel girl thats kept books for me for the last six years
Shes leaving in a couple of months to marry a New York guy that travels for ladies cloaks and suits
After she goes its nix with the lady bookkeepers for me
Not that Minnie isnt a good straight girl and honest but no girl can keep books with one eye on a column of figures and the other on a traveling man in a brown suit and a red necktie unless shes crosseyed and you bet Minnie aint
The jobs yours if you want it
Eighty a month to start on and board
Icant Jo
Thanks just the same
Im going to try to begin all over again somewhere else where nobody knows me
Oh yes said Jo
I knew a fellow that did that
After he came out he grew a beard and wore eyeglasses and changed his name
Had a quick crisp way of talkin and he cultivated a drawl and went west and started in business
Real estate I think
Anyway the second month he was there in walks a fool he used to know and bellows Why if it aint Bill
Hello Bill
I thought you was doing time yet
That was enough
Ted you can black your face and dye your hair and squint and some fine day sooner or later somebodyll come along and blab the whole thing
And say the older it gets the worse it sounds when it does come out
Stick around here where you grew up Ted
Ted clasped and unclasped his hands uncomfortably
I cant figure out why you should care how I finish
No reason answered Jo
Not a darned one
I wasnt ever in love with your ma like the guy on the stage and I never owed your pa a cent
So it aint a guilty conscience
I guess its just pure cussedness and a hankerin for a new investment
Im curious to know howll you turn out
Youve got the makins of what the newspapers call a Leading Citizen even if you did fall down once
If Id ever had time to get married which I never will have a firstclass hotel bein more worry and expense than a Pittsburg steel magnates whole harem Id have wanted somebody to do the same for my kid
That sounds slushy but its straight
I dont seem to know how to thank you began Ted a little husky as to voice
Call around tomorrow morning interrupted Jo Haley briskly and Minnie Wenzel will show you the ropes
You and her can work together for a couple of months
After then shes leaving to make her underwear and that
I should think shed have a bale of it by this time
Been embroidering them shimmy things and lunch cloths back of the desk when she thought I wasnt lookin for the last six months
Ted came down next morning at 8 AM with his nerve between his teeth and the chip still balanced lightly on his shoulder
Five minutes later Minnie Wenzel knocked it off
When Jo Haley introduced the two jocularly knowing that they had originally met in the First Reader room Miss Wenzel acknowledged the introduction icily by lifting her left eyebrow slightly and drawing down the corners of her mouth
Her air of hauteur was a triumph considering that she was handicapped by black sateen sleevelets
I wonder how one could best describe Miss Wenzel
There is one of her in every small town
Let me think business of hand on brow
Well she always paid eight dollars for her corsets when most girls in a similar position got theirs for fiftynine cents in the basement
Nature had been kind to her
The hair that had been a muddy brown in Minnies schoolgirl days it had touched with a magic redgold wand
Birdie Callahan always said that Minnie was working only to wear out her old clothes
After the introduction Miss Wenzel followed Jo Haley into the lobby
She took no pains to lower her voice
Well I must say Mr Haley youve got a fine nerve
If my gentleman friend was to hear of my working with an excon I wouldnt be surprised if hed break off the engagement
I should think youd have some respect for the feelings of a lady with a name to keep up and engaged to a swell fellow like Mr
Schwartz
Say listen m girl replied Jo Haley
The law dont cover all the tricks
But if stuffing an order was a criminal offense Ill bet your swell traveling man would be doing a life term
Ted worked that day with his teeth set so that his jaws ached next morning
Minnie Wenzel spoke to him only when necessary and then in terms of dollars and cents
When dinner time came she divested herself of the black sateen sleevelets wriggled from the shoulders down a la Patricia OBrien produced a chamois skin and disappeared in the direction of the washroom
Ted waited until the diningroom was almost deserted
Then he went in to dinner alone
Some one in white wearing an absurd little pocket handkerchief of an apron led him to a seat in a far corner of the big room
Ted did not lift his eyes higher than the snowy square of the apron
The Apron drew out a chair shoved it under Teds knees in the way Aprons have and thrust a printed menu at him
Roast beef medium said Ted without looking up
Bless your heart yuh aint changed a bit
I remember how yuh used to jaw when it was too well done said the Apron fondly
Teds head came up with a jerk
So yuh will cut yer old friends is it
grinned Birdie Callahan
If this wasnt a public diningroom maybe yuhd shake hands with a poor but proud workin girrul
Yer as good lookin a divil as ever Mister Ted
Teds hand shot out and grasped hers
Birdie
I could weep on your apron
I never was so glad to see any one in my life
Just to look at you makes me homesick
What in Sam Hill are you doing here
Waitin
After yer ma died seemed like I didnt care t work fer no other privit famly so I came back here on my old job
Ill bet Im the homeliest head waitress in captivity
Teds nervous fingers were pleating the tablecloth
His voice sank to a whisper
Birdie tell me the Gods truth
Did those three years cause her death
Niver
lied Birdie
I was with her to the end
It started with a cold on th chest
Have some French fried with yer beef Mr Teddy
Theyre illigent today
Birdie glided off to the kitchen
Authors are fond of the word glide
But you can take it literally this time
Birdie had a face that looked like a huge mistake but she walked like a panther and theyre said to be the last cry as gliders
She walked with her chin up and her hips firm
That comes from juggling trays
You have to walk like that to keep your nose out of the soup
After a while the walk becomes a habit
Any seasoned diningroom girl could give lessons in walking to the Delsarte teacher of an Eastern finishing school
From the day that Birdie Callahan served Ted with the roast beef medium and the elegant French fried she appointed herself monitor over his food and clothes and morals
I wish I could find words to describe his bitter loneliness
He did not seek companionship
The men although not directly avoiding him seemed somehow to have pressing business whenever they happened in his vicinity
The women ignored him
Mrs Dankworth still dashing and still widowed passed Ted one day and looked fixedly at a point one inch above his head
In a town like ours the Haley House is like a big hospitable clubhouse
The men drop in there the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night to hear the gossip and buy a cigar and jolly the girl at the cigar counter
Ted spoke to them when they spoke to him
He began to develop a certain grim line about the mouth
Jo Haley watched him from afar and the longer he watched the kinder and more speculative grew the look in his eyes
And slowly and surely there grew in the hearts of our townspeople a certain new respect and admiration for this boy who was fighting his fight
Ted got into the habit of taking his meals late so that Birdie Callahan could take the time to talk to him
Birdie he said one day when she brought his soup do you know that youre the only decent woman wholl talk to me
Do you know what I mean when I say that Id give the rest of my life if I could just put my head in my mothers lap and have her muss up my hair and call me foolish names
Birdie Callahan cleared her throat and said abruptly I was noticin yesterday your gray pants needs pressin bad
Bring em down tomorrow mornin and Ill give em th elegant crease in the laundry
So the first weeks went by and the two months of Miss Wenzels stay came to an end
Ted thanked his God and tried hard not to wish that she was a man so that he could punch her head
The day before the time appointed for her departure she was closeted with Jo Haley for a long long time
When finally she emerged a bellboy lounged up to Ted with a message
Wenzel says th Old Man wants t see you
S in his office
Say Mr Terrill do yuh think they can play today
Its pretty wet
Jo Haley was sunk in the depths of his big leather chair
He did not look up as Ted entered
Sit down he said
Ted sat down and waited puzzled
As a wizard at figures mused Jo Haley at last softly as though to himself Im a frost
A column of figures on paper makes my head swim
But I can carry a whole regiment of em in my head
I know every time the barkeeper draws one in the dark
Ive been watchin this thing for the last two weeks hopin youd quit and come and tell me
He turned suddenly and faced Ted
Ted old kid he said sadly whatnell made you do it again
Whats the joke
asked Ted
Now Ted remonstrated Jo Haley that way of talkin wont help matters none
As I said Im rotten at figures
But youre the first investment that ever turned out bad and let me tell you Ive handled some mighty bad smelling ones
Why kid if you had just come to me on the quiet and asked for the loan of a hundred or so why Whats the joke Jo
said Ted again slowly
This aint my notion of a joke came the terse answer
Were three hundred short
The last vestige of Ted Terrills oldtime radiance seemed to flicker and die leaving him ashen and old
Short
he repeated
Then My God
in a strangely colorless voiceMy God
He looked down at his fingers impersonally as though they belonged to some one else
Then his hand clutched Jo Haleys arm with the grip of fear
Jo
Jo
Thats the thing that has haunted me day and night till my nerves are raw
The fear of doing it again
Dont laugh at me will you
I used to lie awake nights going over that cursed business of the bankover and overtill the cold sweat would break out all over me
I used to figure it all out again step by step untilJo could a man steal and not know it
Could thinking of a thing like that drive a man crazy
Because if it couldif it couldthen I dont know said Jo Haley but it sounds darned fishy
He had a hand on Teds shaking shoulder and was looking into the white drawn face
I had great plans for you Ted
But Minnie Wenzels got it all down on slips of paper
I might as well call her in again and well have the whole blamed thing out
Minnie Wenzel came
In her hand were slips of paper and books with figures in them and Ted looked and saw things written in his own hand that should not have been there
And he covered his shamed face with his two hands and gave thanks that his mother was dead
There came three sharp raps at the office door
The tense figures within jumped nervously
Keep out
called Jo Haley whoever you are
Whereupon the door opened and Birdie Callahan breezed in
Get out Birdie Callahan roared Jo
Youre in the wrong pew
Birdie closed the door behind her composedly and came farther into the room
Pete th pasthry cook just tells me that Minnie Wenzel told th day clerk who told the barkeep who told th janitor who told th chef who told Pete that Minnie had caught Ted stealin some three hundred dollars
Ted took a quick step forward
Birdie for Heavens sake keep out of this
You cant make things any better
You may believe in me but Wheres the money
asked Birdie
Ted stared at her a moment his mouth open ludicrously
WhyIdontknow he articulated painfully
I never thought of that
Birdie snorted defiantly
I thought so
Dye know sociably I was visitin with my aunt Mis Mulcahy last evenin
There was a quick rustle of silks from Minnie Wenzels direction
Say look here began Jo Haley impatiently
Shut up Jo Haley
snapped Birdie
As I was sayin I was visitin with my aunt Mis Mulcahy
She does fancy washin an ironin for the swells
An Minnie Wenzel there bein none sweller hires her to do up her weddin linens
Such smears av hand embridery an Irish crochet she never see th likes Mis Mulcahy says and shes seen a lot
And as a special treat to the poor owld soul why Minnie Wenzel lets her see some av her weddin cloes
There never yet was a woman who cud resist showin her weddin things to every other woman she cud lay hands on
Well Mis Mulcahy she see that grand trewsow and she said she never saw th beat
Dresses
Well her going away suit alone comes to eighty dollars for its bein made by Molkowsky the little Polish tailor
An her weddin dress is satin do yuh mind
Oh it was a real treat for my aunt Mis Mulcahy
Birdie walked over to where Minnie Wenzel sat very white and still and pointed a stubby red finger in her face
Tis the grand manager ye are Miss Wenzel gettin satins an tailormades on yer salary
It takes a woman Minnie Wenzel to see through a womans thricks
Well Ill be dinged
exploded Jo Haley
Yuhd better be
retorted Birdie Callahan
Minnie Wenzel stood up her lip caught between her teeth
Am I to understand Jo Haley that you dare to accuse me of taking your filthy money instead of that miserable excon there who has done time
Thatll do Minnie said Jo Haley gently
Thats aplenty
Prove it went on Minnie and then looked as though she wished she hadnt
A business college edjication is a grand foine thing observed Birdie
Miss Wenzel is a graduate av wan
They teach you everything from drawin birds with tail feathers to plain and fancy penmanship
In fact they teach everything in the writin line except forgery an I aint so sure they havent got a coorse in that
I dont care whimpered Minnie Wenzel suddenly sinking in a limp heap on the floor
I had to do it
Im marrying a swell fellow and a girls got to have some clothes that dont look like a Bird Center dressmakers work
Hes got three sisters
I saw their pictures and theyre coming to the wedding
Theyre the kind that wear lownecked dresses in the evening and have their hair and nails done downtown
I havent got a thing but my looks
Could I go to New York dressed like a rube
On the square Jo I worked here six years and never took a sou
But things got away from me
The tailor wouldnt finish my suit unless I paid him fifty dollars down
I only took fifty at first intending to pay it back
Honest to goodness Jo I did
Cut it out said Jo Haley and get up
I was going to give you a check for your wedding though I hadnt counted on no three hundred
Well call it square
And I hope youll be happy but I dont gamble on it
Youll be goin through your mans pants pockets before youre married a year
You can take your hat and fade
Id like to know how Im ever going to square this thing with Ted and Birdie
An me standin here gassin while them fool girls in the dininroom cant set a table decent and dinner in less than ten minutes cried Birdie rushing off
Ted mumbled something unintelligible and was after her
Birdie
I want to talk to you
Say it quick then said Birdie over her shoulder
The doors open in three minnits
I cant tell you how grateful I am
This is no place to talk to you
Will you let me walk home with you tonight after your works done
Will I
said Birdie turning to face him
I will not
Th swell mob has shook you an a good thing it is
You was travelin with a bunch of racers when you was only built for medium speed
Now youre got your chance to a fresh start and dont you ever think Im going to be the one to let you spoil it by beginnin to walk out with a dininroom Lizzie like me
Dont say that Birdie Ted put in
Its the truth affirmed Birdie
Not that I aint a perfecly respectable girrul and ye know it
Im a good slob but folks would be tickled for the chance to say that you had nobody to go with but the likes av me
If I was to let you walk home with me tonight yuh might be askin to call next week
Inside half a year if yuh was lonesome enough yuhd ask me to marry yuh
And bgorra she said softly looking down at her unlovely red hands Im dead scared Id do it
Get back to work Ted Terrill and hold yer head up high and when yuh say your prayers tonight thank your lucky stars I aint a hussy
III WHAT SHE WORE Somewhere in your story you must pause to describe your heroines costume
It is a ticklish task
The average reader likes his heroine well dressed
He is not satisfied with knowing that she looked like a tall fair lily
He wants to be told that her gown was of green crepe with lace ruffles that swirled at her feet
Writers used to go so far as to name the dressmaker and it was a poor kind of a heroine who didnt wear a red velvet by Worth
But that has been largely abandoned in these days of commissions
Still when the heroine goes out on the terrace to spoon after dinner a quaint old English custom for the origin of which see any novel by the Duchess page 179 the average reader wants to know what sort of a filmy wrap she snatches up on the way out
He demands a description with as many illustrations as the publisher will stand for of what she wore from the bedroom to the street with full stops for the ribbons on her robe de nuit and the buckles on her ballroom slippers
Half the poor creatures one sees flattening their noses against the shop windows are authors getting a line on the advance fashions
Suppose a careless writer were to dress his heroine in a fullplaited skirt only to find when his story is published four months later that fullplaited skirts have been relegated to the dim past
I started to read a story once
It was a good one
There was in it not a single allusion to brandyandsoda or divorce or the stock market
The dialogue crackled
The hero talked like a live man
It was a shipboard story and the heroine was charming so long as she wore her heavy ulster
But along toward evening she blossomed forth in a yellow gown with a scarlet poinsettia at her throat
I quit her cold
Nobody ever wore a scarlet poinsettia or if they did they couldnt wear it on a yellow gown
Or if they did wear it with a yellow gown they didnt wear it at the throat
Scarlet poinsettias arent worn anyhow
To this day I dont know whether the heroine married the hero or jumped overboard
You see one cant be too careful about clothing ones heroine
I hesitate to describe Sophy Epsteins dress
You wont like it
In the first place it was cut too low front and back for a shoe clerk in a downtown loft
It was a black dress nearprincess in style very tight as to fit very short as to skirt very sleazy as to material
It showed all the delicate curves of Sophys underfed girlish body and Sophy didnt care a bit
Its most objectionable feature was at the throat
Collarless gowns were in vogue
Sophys daring shears had gone a snip or two farther
They had cut a startlingly generous V To say that the dress was elbowsleeved is superfluous
I have said that Sophy clerked in a downtown loft
Sophy sold sample shoes at twofifty a pair and from where you were standing you thought they looked just like the shoes that were sold in the regular shops for six
When Sophy sat on one of the low benches at the feet of some customer tugging away at a refractory shoe for a wouldbe small foot her shameless little gown exposed more than it should have
But few of Sophys customers were shocked
They were mainly chorus girls and ladies of doubtful complexion in search of cheap and ultra footgear andto use a health termhardened by exposure
Have I told you how pretty she was
She was so pretty that you immediately forgave her the indecency of her pitiful little gown
She was pretty in a daringly demure fashion like a wicked little Puritan or a povertystricken Cleo de Merode with her smooth brown hair parted in the middle drawn severely down over her ears framing the lovely oval of her face and ending in a simple coil at the neck
Some serpents wisdom had told Sophy to eschew puffs
But I think her prettiness could have triumphed even over those
If Sophys boss had been any other sort of man he would have informed Sophy sternly that black princess effects cut low were not au fait in the shoeclerk world
But Sophys boss had a rhombic nose and no instep and the tail of his name had been amputated
He didnt care how Sophy wore her dresses so long as she sold shoes
Once the boss had kissed Sophynot on the mouth but just where her shabby gown formed its charming but immodest V Sophy had slapped him of course
But the slap had not set the thing right in her mind
She could not forget it
It had made her uncomfortable in much the same way as we are wildly ill at ease when we dream of walking naked in a crowded street
At odd moments during the day Sophy had found herself rubbing the spot furiously with her unlovely handkerchief and shivering a little
She had never told the other girls about that kiss
Sothere you have Sophy and her costume
You may take her or leave her
I purposely placed these defects in costuming right at the beginning of the story so that there should be no false pretenses
One more detail
About Sophys throat was a slender neargold chain from which was suspended a cheap and glittering La Valliere
Sophy had not intended it as a sop to the conventions
It was an offering on the shrine of Fashion and represented many lunchless days
At eleven oclock one August morning Louie came to Chicago from Oskaloosa Iowa
There was no hay in his hair
The comic papers have long insisted that the country boy on his first visit to the city is known by his greased boots and his highwater pants
Dont you believe them
The smalltown boy is as fastidious about the height of his heels and the stripe of his shift and the roll of his hatbrim as are his city brothers
He peruses the slangily worded ads of the classy clothes tailors and when scarlet cravats are worn the smalltown boy is not more than two weeks late in acquiring one that glows like a headlight
Louie found a roominghouse shoved his suitcase under the bed changed his collar washed his hands in the gritty water of the wash bowl and started out to look for a job
Louie was twentyone
For the last four years he had been employed in the best shoe store at home and he knew shoe leather from the factory to the ash barrel
It was almost a religion with him
Curiosity which plays leads in so many life dramas led Louie to the rotunda of the tallest building
It was built on the hollow center plan with a sheer drop from the twentysomethingth to the main floor
Louie stationed himself in the center of the mosaic floor took off his hat bent backward almost double and gazed his mouth wide open
When he brought his muscles slowly back into normal position he tried hard not to look impressed
He glanced about sheepishly to see if any one was laughing at him and his eye encountered the electriclighted glass display case of the shoe company upstairs
The case was filled with pink satin slippers and cunning velvet boots and the newest thing in bronze street shoes
Louie took the next elevator up
The shoe display had made him feel as though some one from home had slapped him on the back
The God of the Jobless was with him
The boss had fired two boys the day before
Oskaloosa
grinned the boss derisively
Do they wear shoes there
What do you know about shoes huh boy
Louie told him
The boss shuffled the papers on his desk and chewed his cigar and tried not to show his surprise
Louie quite innocently was teaching the boss things about the shoe business
When Louie had finishedWell I try you anyhow the boss grunted grudgingly
I give you soandso much
He named a wage that would have been ridiculous if it had not been so pathetic
All right sir answered Louie promptly like the boys in the Alger series
The cost of living problem had never bothered Louie in Oskaloosa
The boss hid a pleased smile
Miss Epstein
he bellowed step this way
Miss Epstein kindly show this here young man so he gets a line on the stock
He is from Oskaloosa Ioway
Look out she dont sell you a gold brick Louie
But Louie was not listening
He was gazing at the V in Sophy Epsteins dress with all his scandalized Oskaloosa Iowa eyes
Louie was no mollycoddle
But he had been in great demand as usher at the Young Mens Sunday Evening Club service at the Congregational church and in his town there had been no Sophy Epsteins in tootight princess dresses cut into a careless V But Sophy was a city productI was about to say pure and simple but I will notwise bold young old underfed overworked and triumphantly pretty
Howdo
cooed Sophy in her best baby tones
Louies disapproving eyes jumped from the objectionable V in Sophys dress to the lure of Sophys face and their expression underwent a lightning change
There was no disapproving Sophys face no matter how long one had dwelt in Oskaloosa
I wont bite you said Sophy
Im never vicious on Tuesdays
Well start here with the misses an childrens and work over to the other side
Whereupon Louie was introduced into the intricacies of the sample shoe business
He kept his eyes resolutely away from the V and learned many things
He learned how shoes that look like six dollar values may be sold for twofifty
He looked on in wideeyed horror while Sophy fitted a No
5 C shoe on a 6 B foot and assured the wearer that it looked like a madetoorder boot
He picked up a pair of dull kid shoes and looked at them
His leatherwise eyes saw much and I think he would have taken his hat off the hook and his offended business principles out of the shop forever if Sophy had not completed her purchase and strolled over to him at the psychological moment
She smiled up at him impudently
Well Pink Cheeks she said how do you like our little settlement by the lake huh
These shoes arent worth twofifty said Louie indignation in his voice
Well sure replied Sophy
I know it
What do you think this is
A charity bazaar
But back home began Louie hotly
Ferget it kid said Sophy
This is a big town but it aint got no room for backhomers
Dont sour on one job till youve got another nailed
Youll find yourself cuddling down on a park bench if you do
Say are you honestly from Oskaloosa
I certainly am answered Louie with pride
My goodness
ejaculated Sophy
I never believed there was no such place
Dont brag about it to the other fellows
What time do you go out for lunch
asked Louie
Whats it to you
with the accent on the to
When I want to know a thing I generally ask explained Louie gently
Sophy looked at hima long keen knowing look
Youll learn she observed thoughtfully
Louie did learn
He learned so much in that first week that when Sunday came it seemed as though aeons had passed over his head
He learned that the crime of murder was as nothing compared to the crime of allowing a customer to depart shoeless he learned that the lunch hour was invented for the purpose of making dates that no one had ever heard of Oskaloosa Iowa that seven dollars a week does not leave much margin for laundry and general reck lessness that a madonna face above a Vcut gown is apt to distract ones attention from shoes that a hundreddollar nest egg is as effective in Chicago as a pine stick would be in propping up a stone wall and that all the other men clerks called Sophy sweetheart
Some of his newly acquired knowledge brought pain as knowledge is apt to do
He saw that State Street was crowded with Sophys during the noon hour girls with lovely faces under pitifully absurd hats
Girls who aped the fashions of the dazzling creatures they saw stepping from limousines
Girls who starved body and soul in order to possess a set of false curls or a pair of black satin shoes with motheropearl buttons
Girls whose minds were bounded on the north by the nickel theatres on the east by I sez to him on the south by the gorgeous shop windows and on the west by He sez t me
Oh I cant tell you how much Louie learned in that first week while his eyes were getting accustomed to the shifting jostling pushing giggling walking talking throng
The city is justly famed as a hot house of forced knowledge
One thing Louie could not learn
He could not bring himself to accept the V in Sophys dress
Louies mother had been one of the oldfashioned kind who wore a blueandwhite checked gingham apron from 6 AM to 2 PM when she took it off to go downtown and help the ladies of the church at the cake sale in the empty window of the gas companys office only to don it again when she fried the potatoes for supper
Among other things she had taught Louie to wipe his feet before coming in to respect and help women and to change his socks often
After a month of Chicago Louie forgot the first lesson had more difficulty than I can tell you in reverencing a woman who only said Aw dont get fresh now
when the other men put their arms about her and adhered to the third only after a struggle in which he had to do a small private washing in his own washbowl in the evening
Sophy called him a stiff
His gravely courteous treatment of her made her vaguely uncomfortable
She was past mistress in the art of parrying insults and banter but she had no reply ready for Louies boyish air of deference
It angered her for some unreasonable womanreason
There came a day when the Vcut dress brought them to open battle
I think Sophy had appeared that morning minus the chain and La Valliere
Frail and cheap as it was it had been the only barrier that separated Sophy from frank shamelessness
Louies outraged sense of propriety asserted itself
Sophy he stammered during a quiet halfhour Ill call for you and take you to the nickel show tonight if youll promise not to wear that dress
What makes you wear that kind of a getup anyway
Dress
queried Sophy looking down at the shiny front breadth of her frock
Why
Dont you like it
Like it
No
blurted Louie
Dont yuh rully
Deah me
Deah me
If Id only knew that this morning
As a genral thing I wear white duck complete down t work but Im savin my last two clean suits fr gawlf
Louie ran an uncomfortable finger around the edge of his collar but he stood his ground
Ititshows yourneck so he objected miserably
Sophy opened her great eyes wide
Well supposin it does
she inquired coolly
Its a perfectly good neck aint it
Louie his face very red took the plunge
I dont know
I guess so
But Sophy itlooks sosoyou know what I mean
I hate to see the way the fellows rubber at you
Why dont you wear those plain shirtwaist things with high collars like my mother wears back home
Sophys teeth came together with a click
She laughed a short cruel little laugh
Say Pink Cheeks did yuh ever do a washin from seven to twelve after you got home from work in the evenin
Its great
Specially when youre living in a sixbyten room with all the modern inconveniences includin no water except on the third floor down
Simple
Say a child could work it
All you got to do when you get home so tired your back teeth ache is to haul your water an soak your clothes an then rub em till your hands peel and rinse em an boil em and blue em an starch em
See
Just like that
Nothin to it kid
Nothin to it
Louie had been twisting his fingers nervously
Now his hands shut themselves into fists
He looked straight into Sophys angry eyes
I do know what it is he said quite simply
Theres been a lot written and said about womens struggle with clothes
I wonder why theyve never said anything about the way a man has to fight to keep up the thing they call appearances
God knows its pathetic enough to think of a girl like you bending over a tubful of clothes
But when a man has to do it its a tragedy
Thats so agreed Sophy
When a girl gets shabby and her clothes begin t look tacky she can take a gore or so out of her skirt where its the most wore and catch it in at the bottom and call it a hobble
An when her waist gets too soiled she can cover up the front of it with a jabot an if her face is pretty enough she can carry it off that way
But when a man is seedy hes seedy
He cant sew no ruffles on his pants
I ran short last week continued Louie
That is shorter than usual
I hadnt the fifty cents to give to the woman
You ought to see her
A little grayfaced thing with wisps of hair and no chest to speak of and one of those mashedlooking black hats
Nobody could have the nerve to ask her to wait for her money
So I did my own washing
I havent learned to wear soiled clothes yet
I laughed fit to bust while I was doing it
ButIll bet my mother dreamed of me that night
The way they do you know when somethings gone wrong
Sophy perched on the third rung of the sliding ladder was gazing at him
Her lips were parted slightly and her cheeks were very pink
On her face was a new strange look as of something half forgotten
It was as though the spirit of Sophyasshemighthavebeen were inhabiting her soul for a brief moment
At Louies next words the look was gone
Cant you sew somethinga lace yokeor whatever you call emin that dress
he persisted
Aw fade
jeered Sophy
When a girls only got one dress its got to have some tong to it
Maybe this gown would cause a wave of indignation in Oskaloosa Iowa but it dont even make a ripple on State Street
It takes more than an aggravated Dutch neck to make a fellow look at a girl these days
In a town like this a girls got to make a showin some way
Im my own stage manager
They look at my dress first an grin
See
An then they look at my face
Im like the girl in the story
Muh face is muh fortune
Its earned me many a square meal an lemme tell you Pink Cheeks eatin square meals is one of my favorite pas times
Say looka here
bellowed the boss wrathfully
Just cut out this here Romeo and Juliet act will you
That there ladder aint for no balcony scene understand
Here you Louie you shinny up there and get down a pair of them brown satin pumps small size
Sophy continued to wear the black dress
The Vcut neck seemed more flaunting than ever
It was two weeks later that Louie came in from lunch his face radiant
He was fifteen minutes late but he listened to the bosss ravings with a smile
You grin like somebody handed you a tencase note commented Sophy with a womans curiosity
I guess you must of met some rube from home when you was out t lunch
Better than that
Who do you think I bumped right into in the elevator going down
Well Brothah Bones mimicked Sophy who did you meet in the elevator going down
I met a man named Ames
He used to travel for a big Boston shoe house and he made our town every few months
We got to be good friends
I took him home for Sunday dinner once and he said it was the best dinner hed had in months
You know how tired those traveling men get of hotel grub
Cut out the description and get down to action snapped Sophy
Well he knew me right away
And he made me go out to lunch with him
A real lunch starting with soup
Gee
It went big
He asked me what I was doing
I told him I was working here and he opened his eyes and then he laughed and said How did you get into that joint
Then he took me down to a swell little shoe shop on State Street and it turned out that he owns it
He introduced me all around and Im going there to work next week
And wages
Why say its almost a salary
A fellow can hold his head up in a place like that
When you leavin
asked Sophy slowly
Monday
Gee
it seems a year away
Sophy was late Saturday morning
When she came in hurriedly her cheeks were scarlet and her eyes glowed
She took off her hat and coat and fell to straightening boxes and putting out stock without looking up
She took no part in the talk and jest that was going on among the other clerks
One of the men in search of the missing mate to the shoe in his hand came over to her greeting her carelessly
Then he stared
Well what do you know about this
he called out to the others and laughed coarsely Look stop listen
Little Sophy Bright Eyes here has pulled down the shades
Louie turned quickly
The immodest V of Sophys gown was filled with a black lace yoke that came up to the very lobes of her little pink ears
She had got some scraps of lace fromWhere do they get those bits of rusty black
From some basement bargain counter perhaps raked over during the lunch hour
There were nine pieces in the front and seven in the back
She had sat up half the night putting them together so that when completed they looked like one if you didnt come too close
There is a certain strain of Indian patience and ingenuity in women that no man has ever been able to understand
Louie looked up and saw
His eyes met Sophys
In his there crept a certain exultant gleam as of one who had fought for something great and won
Sophy saw the look
The shy questioning in her eyes was replaced by a spark of defiance
She tossed her head and turned to the man who had called attention to her costume
Whos loony now
she jeered
I always put in a yoke when it gets along toward fall
My lungs is delicate
And anyway I see by the papers yesterday that collarless gowns is slightly passay fr winter
IV A BUSH LEAGUE HERO This is not a baseball story
The grandstand does not rise as one man and shout itself hoarse with joy
There isnt a threebagger in the entire three thousand words and nobody is carried home on the shoulders of the crowd
For that sort of thing you need not squander fifteen cents on your favorite magazine
The modest sum of one cent will make you the possessor of a Pink Un
There you will find the seasons games handled in masterly fashion by a sixbestseller artist an expert mathematician and an originalslang humorist
No mere short story dub may hope to compete with these
In the old days before the gentry of the ring had learned the wisdom of investing their winnings in solids instead of liquids this used to be a favorite conundrum When is a prizefighter not a prizefighter
Chorus When he is tending bar
I rise to ask you Brothah Fan when is a ball player not a ball player
Above the storm of facetious replies I shout the answer When hes a shoe clerk
Any man who can look handsome in a dirty baseball suit is an Adonis
There is something about the baggy pants and the Micawbershaped collar and the skullfitting cap and the foot or so of tan or blue or pink undershirt sleeve sticking out at the arms that just naturally kills a mans best points
Then too a baseball suit requires so much in the matter of leg
Therefore when I say that Rudie Schlachweiler was a dream even in his baseball uniform with a dirty brown streak right up the side of his pants where he had slid for base you may know that the girls camped on the grounds during the season
During the summer months our ball park is to us what the Grand Prix is to Paris or Ascot is to London
What care we that Evers gets seven thousand a year or is it a month
 or that Chicagos new Southside ball park seats thirtyfive thousand or is it million
Of what interest are such meager items compared with the knowledge that Pug Coulan who plays short goes with Undine Meyers the girl up there in the eighth row with the pink dress and the red roses on her hat
When Pug snatches a high one out of the firmament we yell with delight and even as we yell we turn sideways to look up and see how Undine is taking it
Undines shining eyes are fixed on Pug and he knows it stoops to brush the dust off his dirtbegrimed baseball pants takes an attitude of careless grace and misses the next play
Our grandstand seats almost two thousand counting the boxes
But only the snobs and the girls with new hats sit in the boxes
Box seats are comfortable it is true and they cost only an additional ten cents but we have come to consider them undemocratic and unworthy of true fans
Mrs Freddy Van Dyne who spends her winters in Egypt and her summers at the ball park comes out to the game every afternoon in her automobile but she never occupies a box seat so why should we
She perches up in the grandstand with the rest of the enthusiasts and when Kelly puts one over she stands up and clinches her fists and waves her arms and shouts with the best of em
She has even been known to cry Good eye
Good eye
when things were at fever heat
The only really blase individual in the ball park is Willie Grimes who peddles icecream cones
For that matter I once saw Willie turn a languid head to pipe in his thin voice Give em a dark one Dutch
Give em a dark one
Well that will do for the firsh dash of local color
Now for the story
Ivy Keller came home June nineteenth from Miss Shonts select school for young ladies
By June twentyfirst she was bored limp
You could hardly see the plaits of her white tailored shirtwaist for fraternity pins and secret society emblems and her bedroom was ablaze with college banners and pennants to such an extent that the maid gave notice every Thursdaywhich was upstairs cleaning day
For two weeks after her return Ivy spent most of her time writing letters and waiting for them and reading the classics on the front porch dressed in a middy blouse and a blue skirt with her hair done in a curly Greek effect like the girls on the covers of the Ladies Magazine
She posed against the canvas bosom of the porch chair with one foot under her the other swinging free showing a tempting thing in beaded slipper silk stocking and what the story writers call slim ankle
On the second Saturday after her return her father came home for dinner at noon found her deep in Volume Two of Les Miserables
Whew
This is a scorcher
he exclaimed and dropped down on a wicker chair next to Ivy
Ivy looked at her father with languid interest and smiled a daughterly smile
Ivys father was an insurance man alderman of his ward president of the Civic Improvement club member of five lodges and an habitual delegate
It generally was he who introduced distinguished guests who spoke at the opera house on Decoration Day
He called Mrs Keller Mother and he wasnt above noticing the fit of a gown on a pretty feminine figure
He thought Ivy was an expurgated edition of Lillian Russell Madame De Stael and Mrs Pankburst
Arent you feeling well Ivy
he asked
Looking a little pale
Its the heat I suppose
Gosh
Something smells good
Run in and tell Mother Im here
Ivy kept one slender finger between the leaves of her book
Im perfectly well she replied
That must be beefsteak and onions
Ugh
And she shuddered and went indoors
Dad Keller looked after her thoughtfully
Then he went in washed his hands and sat down at table with Ivy and her mother
Just a sliver for me said Ivy and no onions
Her father put down his knife and fork cleared his throat and spake thus You get on your hat and meet me at the 245 interurban
Youre going to the ball game with me
Ball game
repeated Ivy
I
But Id Yes you do interrupted her father
Youve been moping around here looking a cross between Saint Cecilia and Little Eva long enough
I dont care if you dont know a spitball from a fadeaway when you see it
Youll be out in the air all afternoon and therell be some excitement
All the girls go
Youll like it
Theyre playing Marshalltown
Ivy went looking the sacrificial lamb
Five minutes after the game was called she pointed one tapering white finger in the direction of the pitchers mound
Whos that
she asked
Pitcher explained Papa Keller laconically
Then patiently He throws the ball
Oh said Ivy
What did you say his name was
I didnt say
But its Rudie Schlachweiler
The boys call him Dutch
Kind of a pet Dutch is
Rudie Schlachweiler
murmured Ivy dreamily
What a strong name
Want some peanuts
inquired her father
Does one eat peanuts at a ball game
It aint hardly legal if you dont Pa Keller assured her
Two sacks said Ivy
Papa why do they call it a diamond and what are those brown bags at the corners and what does it count if you hit the ball and why do they rub their hands in the dust and thenerspit on them and what salary does a pitcher get and why does the redhaired man on the other side dance around like that between the second and third brown bag and doesnt a pitcher do anything but pitch and wh
Youre on said papa
After that Ivy didnt miss a game during all the time that the team played in the home town
She went without a new hat and didnt care whether Jean Valjean got away with the goods or not and forgot whether you played third hand high or low in bridge
She even became chummy with Undine Meyers who wasnt her kind of a girl at all
Undine was thin in a voluptuous kind of way if such a paradox can be and she had red lips and a roving eye and she ran around downtown without a hat more than was strictly necessary
But Undine and Ivy had two subjects in common
They were baseball and love
It is queer how the limelight will make heroes of us all
Now Pug Coulan who was redhaired and had shoulders like an ox and arms that hung down to his knees like those of an orangoutang slaughtered beeves at the Chicago stockyards in winter
In the summer he slaughtered hearts
He wore mustard colored shirts that matched his hair and his baseball stockings generally had a rip in them somewhere but when he was on the diamond we were almost ashamed to look at Undine so wholly did her heart shine in her eyes
Now well have just another dash or two of local color
In a small town the chances for hero worship are few
If it werent for the traveling men our girls wouldnt know whether stripes or checks were the thing in gents suitings
When the baseball season opened the girls swarmed on it
Those that didnt understand baseball pretended they did
When the team was out of town our form of greeting was changed from Goodmorning
or Howdydo
to Whats the score
Every night the results of the games throughout the league were posted up on the blackboard in front of Schlagers hardware store and to see the way in which the crowd stood around it and streamed across the street toward it youd have thought they were giving away gas stoves and hammock couches
Going home in the street car after the game the girls used to gaze adoringly at the dirty faces of their sweatbegrimed heroes and then theyd rush home have supper change their dresses do their hair and rush downtown past the Parker Hotel to mail their letters
The baseball boys boarded over at the Griggs House which is thirdclass but they used their toothpicks and held the postmortem of the days game out in front of the Parker Hotel which is our leading hostelry
The postoffice receipts record for our town was broken during the months of June July and August
Mrs Freddy Van Dyne started the trouble by having the team over to dinner Pug Coulan and all
After all why not
No foreign and impecunious princes penetrate as far inland as our town
They get only as far as New York or Newport where they are gobbled up by manymoneyed matrons
If Mrs Freddy Van Dyne found the supply of available lions limited why should she not try to content herself with a jackal or so
Ivy was asked
Until then she had contented herself with gazing at her hero
She had become such a hardened baseball fan that she followed the game with a score card accurately jotting down every play and keeping her watch open on her knee
She sat next to Rudie at dinner
Before she had nibbled her second salted almond Ivy Keller and Rudie Schlachweiler understood each other
Rudie illustrated certain plays by drawing lines on the tablecloth with his knife and Ivy gazed wideeyed and allowed her soup to grow cold
The first night that Rudie called Pa Keller thought it a great joke
He sat out on the porch with Rudie and Ivy and talked baseball and got up to show Rudie how he could have got the goat of that Keokuk catcher if only he had tried one of his famous openfaced throws
Rudie looked politely interested and laughed in all the right places
But Ivy didnt need to pretend
Rudie Schlachweiler spelled baseball to her
She did not think of her caller as a goodlooking young man in a blue serge suit and a white shirtwaist
Even as he sat there she saw him as a blonde god standing on the pitchers mound with the scars of battle on his baseball pants his left foot placed in front of him at right angles with his right foot his gaze fixed on first base in a cunning effort to deceive the man at bat in that favorite attitude of pitchers just before they get ready to swing their left leg and hist one over
The second time that Rudie called Ma Keller said Ivy I dont like that ball player coming here to see you
The neighborsll talk
The third time Rudie called Pa Keller said Whats that guy doing here again
The fourth time Rudie called Pa Keller and Ma Keller said in unison This thing has got to stop
But it didnt
It had had too good a start
For the rest of the season Ivy met her knight of the sphere around the corner
Theirs was a walking courtship
They used to roam up as far as the State road and down as far as the river and Rudie would fain have talked of love but Ivy talked of baseball
Darling Rudie would murmur pressing Ivys arm closer when did you first begin to care
Why I liked the very first game I saw when Dad I mean when did you first begin to care for me
Oh
When you put three men out in that game with Marshalltown when the teams were tied in the eighth inning
Remember
Say Rudie dear what was the matter with your arm today
You let three men walk and Albias weakest hitter got a home run out of you
Oh forget baseball for a minute Ivy
Lets talk about something else
Lets talk aboutus
Us
Well youre baseball arent you
retorted Ivy
And if you are I am
Did you notice the way that Ottumwa man pitched yesterday
He didnt do any acting for the grandstand
He didnt reach up above his head and wrap his right shoulder with his left toe and swing his arm three times and then throw seven inches outside the plate
He just took the ball in his hand looked at it curiously for a moment and fired itzinglike that over the plate
Id get that ball if I were you
Isnt this a grand night
murmured Rudie
But they didnt have a hitter in the bunch went on Ivy
And not a man in the team could run
Thats why theyre tailenders
Just the same that man on the mound was a wizard and if he had one decent player to give him some support Well the thing came to a climax
One evening two weeks before the close of the season Ivy put on her hat and announced that she was going downtown to mail her letters
Mail your letters in the daytime growled Papa Keller
I didnt have time today answered Ivy
It was a thirteen inning game and it lasted until six oclock
It was then that Papa Keller banged the heavy fist of decision down on the library table
This things got to stop
he thundered
I wont have any girl of mine running the streets with a ball player understand
Now you quit seeing this seventyfivedollarsamonth bush leaguer or leave this house
I mean it
All right said Ivy with a whitehot calm
Ill leave
I can make the grandest kind of angelfood with marshmallow icing and you know yourself my fudges cant be equaled
Hell be playing in the major leagues in three years
Why just yesterday there was a strange man at the gamea city man you could tell by his hatband and the way his clothes were cut
He stayed through the whole game and never took his eyes off Rudie
I just know he was a scout for the Cubs
Probably a hardware drummer or a fellow that Schlachweiler owes money to
Ivy began to pin on her hat
A scared look leaped into Papa Kellers eyes
He looked a little old too and drawn at that minute
He stretched forth a rather tremulous hand
Ivygirl he said
What
snapped Ivy
Your old fathers just talking for your own good
Youre breaking your mas heart
You and me have been good pals havent we
Yes said Ivy grudgingly and without looking up
Well now look here
Ive got a proposition to make to you
The seasons over in two more weeks
The last week they play out of town
Then the boysll come back for a week or so just to hang around town and try to get used to the idea of leaving us
Then theyll scatter to take up their winter jobscutting ice most of em he added grimly
Mr Schlachweiler is employed in a large establishment in Slatersville Ohio said Ivy with dignity
He regards baseball as his profession and he cannot do anything that would affect his pitching arm
Pa Keller put on the tremolo stop and brought a misty look into his eyes
Ivy youll do one last thing for your old father wont you
Maybe answered Ivy coolly
Dont make that fellow any promises
Now wait a minute
Let me get through
I wont put any crimp in your plans
I wont speak to Schlachweiler
Promise you wont do anything rash until the ball seasons over
Then well wait just one month see
Till along about November
Then if you feel like you want to see him But how Hold on
You mustnt write to him or see him or let him write to you during that time see
Then if you feel the way you do now Ill take you to Slatersville to see him
Now thats fair aint it
Only dont let him know youre coming
 Mmmyes said Ivy
Shake hands on it
She did
Then she left the room with a rush headed in the direction of her own bedroom
Pa Keller treated himself to a prodigious wink and went out to the vegetable garden in search of Mother
The team went out on the road lost five games won two and came home in fourth place
For a week they lounged around the Parker Hotel and held up the street corners downtown took many farewell drinks then slowly by ones and twos they left for the packing houses freight depots and gents furnishing stores from whence they came
October came in with a blaze of sumac and oak leaves
Ivy stayed home and learned to make veal loaf and apple pies
The worry lines around Pa Kellers face began to deepen
Ivy said that she didnt believe that she cared to go back to Miss Shonts select school for young ladies
October thirtyfirst came
Well take the eightfifteen tomorrow said her father to Ivy
All right said Ivy
Do you know where he works
asked he
No answered Ivy
Thatll be all right
I took the trouble to look him up last August
The short November afternoon was drawing to its close as our best talent would put it when Ivy and her father walked along the streets of Slatersville
I cant tell you what streets because I dont know
Pa Keller brought up before a narrow little shoe shop
Here we are he said and ushered Ivy in
A short stout proprietary figure approached them smiling a mercantile smile
What can I do for you
he inquired
Ivys eyes searched the shop for a tall goldenhaired form in a soiled baseball suit
Wed like to see a gentleman named SchlachweilerRudolph Schlachweiler said Pa Keller
Anything very special
inquired the proprietor
Hesrather busy just now
Wouldnt anybody else do
Of course if No growled Keller
The boss turned
Hi
Schlachweiler
he bawled toward the rear of the dim little shop
Yessir answered a muffled voice
Front
yelled the boss and withdrew to a safe listening distance
A vaguely troubled look lurked in the depths of Ivys eyes
From behind the partition of the rear of the shop emerged a tall figure
It was none other than our hero
He was in his shirt sleeves and he struggled into his coat as he came forward wiping his mouth with the back of his hand hurriedly and swallowing
I have said that the shop was dim
Ivy and her father stood at one side their backs to the light
Rudie came forward rubbing his hands together in the manner of clerks
Something in shoes
he politely inquired
Then he saw
IvyahMiss Keller
he exclaimed
Then awkwardly Well howdo Mr Keller
I certainly am glad to see you both
Hows the old town
What are you doing in Slatersville
WhyIvy began Pa Keller blunderingly
But Ivy clutched his arm with a warning hand
The vaguely troubled look in her eyes had become wildly so
Schlachweiler
shouted the voice of the boss
Customers
and he waved a hand in the direction of the fitting benches
All right sir answered Rudie
Just a minute
Dad had to come on business said Ivy hurriedly
And he brought me with him
ImIm on my way to school in Cleveland you know
Awfully glad to have seen you again
We must go
That lady wants her shoes Im sure and your employer is glaring at us
Come dad
At the door she turned just in time to see Rudie removing the shoe from the pudgy foot of the fat lady customer
Well take a jump of six months
That brings us into the lap of April
Pa Keller looked up from his evening paper
Ivy home for the Easter vacation was at the piano
Ma Keller was sewing
Pa Keller cleared his throat
I see by the paper he announced that Schlachweilers been sold to Des Moines
Too bad we lost him
He was a great little pitcher but he played in bad luck
Whenever he was on the slab the boys seemed to give him poor support
Fudge
exclaimed Ivy continuing to play but turning a spirited face toward her father
What piffle
Whenever a player pitches rotten ball youll always hear him howling about the support he didnt get
Schlachweiler was a bum pitcher
Anybody could hit him with a willow wand on a windy day with the sun in his eyes
V THE KITCHEN SIDE OF THE DOOR The City was celebrating New Years Eve
Spelled thus with a capital C know it can mean but New York
In the Pink Fountain room of the Newest Hotel all those grand old forms and customs handed down to us for the occasion were being rigidly observed in all their original quaintness
The Van Dyked man who looked like a Russian Grand Duke he really was a chiropodist had drunk champagne out of the pink satin slipper of the lady who behaved like an actress she was forelady at Schmaus Wholesale Millinery eighth floor
The two respectable married ladies there in the corner had been kissed by each others husbands
The slim Puritanfaced woman in white with her black hair so demurely parted and coiled in a sleek knot had risen suddenly from her place and walked indolently to the edge of the plashing pink fountain in the center of the room had stood contemplating its shallows with a dreamy halfsmile on her lips and then had lifted her slim legs slowly and gracefully over its fernfringed basin and had waded into its chilling midst trailing her exquisite white satin and chiffon draperies after her and scaring the goldfish into fits
The loudest scream of approbation had come from the yellowhaired looselipped youth who had made the wager and lost it
The heavy blonde in the inevitable violet draperies showed signs of wanting to dance on the table
Her companiona structure made up of layer upon layer and fold upon fold of flabby tissueknew all the waiters by their right names and insisted on singing with the orchestra and beating time with a rye roll
The clatter of dishes was giving way to the clink of glasses
In the big bright kitchen back of the Pink Fountain room Miss Gussie Fink sat at her desk calm watchful insolenteyed a goddess sitting in judgment
On the pay roll of the Newest Hotel Miss Gussie Finks name appeared as kitchen checker but her regular job was goddessing
Her altar was a high desk in a corner of the busy kitchen and it was an altar of incense of burntofferings and of showbread
Inexorable as a goddess of the ancients was Miss Fink and ten times as difficult to appease
For this is the rule of the Newest Hotel that no waiter may carry his laden tray restaurantward until its contents have been viewed and duly checked by the eye and hand of Miss Gussie Fink or her assistants
Flat upon the table must go every tray off must go each silver dishcover lifted must be each napkin to disclose its treasure of steaming corn or hot rolls
Clouds of incense rose before Miss Gussie Fink and she sniffed it unmoved her eyes beneath level brows regarding savory broiler or cunning ice with equal indifference appraising alike lobster cocktail or onion soup traveling from blue points to brie
Things a la and things glace were all one to her
Gazing at food was Miss Gussie Finks occupation and just to see the way she regarded a boneless squab made you certain that she never ate
In spite of the Idontknowhowmany see ads New Years Eve diners for whom food was provided that night the big busy kitchen was the most orderly shining spotless place imaginable
But Miss Gussie Fink was the neatest most immaculate object in all that great clean room
There was that about her which suggested daisies in a field if you know what I mean
This may have been due to the fact that her eyes were brown while her hair was gold or it may have been something about the way her collars fitted high and tight and smooth or the way her close white sleeves came down to meet her pretty hands or the way her shining hair sprang from her forehead
Also the smooth creaminess of her clear skin may have had something to do with it
But privately I think it was due to the way she wore her shirtwaists
Miss Gussie Fink could wear a starched white shirtwaist under a closefitting winter coat remove the coat run her right forefinger along her collars edge and her left thumb along the back of her belt and disclose to the admiring world a blouse as unwrinkled and unsullied as though it had just come from her own skilful hands at the ironing board
Miss Gussie Fink was so innately flagrantly beautifully cleanlooking thatwell there must be a stop to this description
She was the kind of girl youd like to see behind the counter of your favorite delicatessen knowing that you need not shudder as her fingers touch your Sunday night supper slices of tongue and Swiss cheese and ham
No girl had ever dreamed of refusing to allow Gussie to borrow her chamois for a second
Tonight Miss Fink had come on at 10 PM which was just two hours later than usual
She knew that she was to work until 6 AM which may have accounted for the fact that she displayed very little of what the fans call ginger as she removed her hat and coat and hung them on the hook behind the desk
The prospect of that allnight eighthour stretch may have accounted for it I say
But privately and entre nous it didnt
For here you must know of Heiny
Heiny alas
now Henri
Until two weeks ago Henri had been Heiny and Miss Fink had been Kid
When Henri had been Heiny he had worked in the kitchen at many things but always with a loving eye on Miss Gussie Fink
Then one wild night there had been a waiters strikewages or hours or tips or all three
In the confusion that followed Heiny had been pressed into service and a chopped coat
He had fitted into both with unbelievable nicety proving that waiters are born not made
Those little tricks and foibles that are characteristic of the genus waiter seemed to envelop him as though a fairy garment had fallen upon his shoulders
The folded napkin under his left arm seemed to have been placed there by nature so perfectly did it fit into place
The ghostly tread the little whisking skip the halfsimper the deferential bend that had in it at the same time something of insolence all were there the very Yes miss and Very good sir rose automatically and correctly to his untrained lips
Cinderella rising resplendent from her ashstrewn hearth was not more completely transformed than Heiny in his role of Henri
And with the transformation Miss Gussie Fink had been left behind her desk disconsolate
Kitchens are as quick to seize upon these things and gossip about them as drawing rooms are
And because Miss Gussie Fink had always worn a little air of aloofness to all except Heiny the kitchen was the more eager to make the most of its morsel
Each turned it over under his tongueTony the Crook whom Miss Fink had scorned Francois the entree cook who often forgot he was married Miss Sweeney the barchecker who was jealous of Miss Finks complexion
Miss Fink heard and said nothing
She only knew that there would be no dear figure waiting for her when the nights work was done
For two weeks now she had put on her hat and coat and gone her way at one oclock alone
She discovered that to be taken home night after night under Heinys tender escort had taught her a ridiculous terror of the streets at night now that she was without protection
Always the short walk from the car to the flat where Miss Fink lived with her mother had been a glorious starlit all too brief moment
Now it was an endless and terrifying trial a thing of shivers and dread fraught with horror of passing the alley just back of Cassideys buffet
There had even been certain little halfserious halfjesting talks about the future into which there had entered the subject of a little delicatessen and restaurant in a desirable neighborhood with Heiny in the kitchen and a certain blonde neat whiteshirtwaisted person in charge of the desk and front shop
She and her mother had always gone through a little formula upon Miss Finks return from work
They never used it now
Gussies mother was a real motherthe kind that wakes up when you come home
That you Gussie
Ma Fink would call from the bedroom at the sound of the key in the lock
Its me ma
Heiny bring you home
Sure happily
Theres a bit of sausage left and some pie if Oh I aint hungry
We stopped at Joeys downtown and had a cup of coffee and a ham on rye
Did you remember to put out the milk bottle
For two weeks there had been none of that
Gussie had learned to creep silently into bed and her mother being a mother feigned sleep
Tonight at her desk Miss Gussie Fink seemed a shade cooler more selfcontained and daisylike than ever
From somewhere at the back of her head she could see that Heiny was avoiding her desk and was using the services of the checker at the other end of the room
And even as the poison of this was eating into her heart she was tapping her forefinger imperatively on the desk before her and saying to Tony the Crook Down on the table with that tray Tonyflat
This may be a busy little New Years Eve but you cant come any of your sleightofhand stuff on me
For Tony had a little trick of concealing a dollarandaquarter sirloin by the simple method of slapping the platter close to the underside of his tray and holding it there with long lean fingers outspread the entire bit of knavery being concealed in the folds of a flowing white napkin in the hand that balanced the tray
Into Tonys eyes there came a baleful gleam
His lean jaw jutted out threateningly
Youre the real Weissenheimer kid aint you
he sneered
Never mind
Ill get you at recess
Some day drawled Miss Fink checking the steak the housell get wise to your stuff and then youll have to go back to the coal wagon
I know so much about you its beginning to make me uncomfortable
I hate to carry around a burden of crime
Youre a sorehead because Heiny turned you down and now Move on there
snapped Miss Fink or Ill call the steward to settle you
Maybe hed be interested to know that youve been counting in the date and your waiters number and adding em in at the bottom of your check
Tony the Crook turned and skimmed away toward the diningroom but the taste of victory was bitter in Miss Finks mouth
Midnight struck
There came from the direction of the Pink Fountain Room a clamor and din which penetrated the thickness of the padded doors that separated the diningroom from the kitchen beyond
The sound rose and swelled above the blare of the orchestra
Chairs scraped on the marble floor as hundreds rose to their feet
The sound of clinking glasses became as the jangling of a hundred bells
There came the sharp spat of handclapping then cheers yells huzzas
Through the swinging doors at the end of the long passageway Miss Fink could catch glimpses of dazzling color of shimmering gowns of bare arms uplifted of flowers and plumes and jewels with the rosy light of the famed pink fountain casting a gracious glow over all
Once she saw a tall young fellow throw his arm about the shoulder of a glorious creature at the next table and though the door swung shut before she could see it Miss Fink knew that he had kissed her
There were no New Years greetings in the kitchen back of the Pink Fountain Room
It was the busiest moment in all that busy night
The heat of the ovens was so intense that it could be felt as far as Miss Finks remote corner
The swinging doors between diningroom and kitchen were never still
A steady stream of waiters made for the steam tables before which the whiteclad chefs stood ladling carving basting serving gave their orders received them stopped at the checkingdesk and sped diningroomward again
Tony the Crook was cursing at one of the little Polish vegetable girls who had not been quick enough about the garnishing of a salad and she was saying over and over again in her thick tongue Aw shod op yur mout
The thudthud of Miss Finks checkingstamp kept time to flying footsteps but even as her practised eye swept over the tray before her she saw the steward direct Henri toward her desk just as he was about to head in the direction of the minor checkingdesk
Beneath downcast lids she saw him coming
There was about Henri tonight a certain radiance a sort of electrical elasticity so nimble so tireless so exuberant was he
In the eyes of Miss Gussie Fink he looked heartbreakingly handsome in his waiters uniformhandsome distinguished remote and infinitely desirable
And just behind him revenge in his eye came Tony
The flat surface of the desk received Henris tray
Miss Fink regarded it with a cold and businesslike stare
Henri whipped his napkin from under his left arm and began to remove covers dexterously
Off came the first silver domeshaped top
Guinea hen said Henri
I seen her lookin at you when you served the little necks came from Tony as though continuing a conversation begun in some past moment of pause and shes some lovely doll believe me
Miss Fink scanned the guinea hen thoroughly but with a detached air and selected the proper stamp from the box at her elbow
Thump
On the broad pasteboard sheet before her appeared the figures 175 after Henris number
Think so
grinned Henri and removed another cover
One candied sweets
I bet some day well see you in the Sunday papers Heiny went on Tony with a piece about handsome waiter runnin away with beautiful sciety girl
Say youre too perfect even for a waiter
Thump
Thirty cents
Quit your kiddin said the flattered Henri
One endive French dressing
Thump
Next
said Miss Fink dispassionately yawned and smiled fleetingly at the entree cook who wasnt looking her way
Then as Tony slid his tray toward her Hows business Tony
Hm
How many twobit cigar bands have you slipped onto your own private collection of nickel straights and made a twentycent rakeoff
But there was a mist in the bright brown eyes as Tony the Crook turned away with his tray
In spite of the satisfaction of having had the last word Miss Fink knew in her heart that Tony had got her at recess as he had said he would
Things were slowing up for Miss Fink
The stream of hurrying waiters was turned in the direction of the kitchen bar now
From now on the eating would be light and the drinking heavy
Miss Fink with time hanging heavy found herself blinking down at the figures stamped on the pasteboard sheet before her and in spite of the blinking two marks that never were intended for a checkers report splashed down just over the 175 after Henris number
A lovely doll
And she had gazed at Heiny
Well that was to be expected
No woman could gaze unmoved upon Heiny
A lovely doll Hi Miss Fink
it was the stewards voice
We need you over in the bar to help Miss Sweeney check the drinks
Theyre coming too swift for her
The eating will be light from now on just a little something salty now and then
So Miss Fink dabbed covertly at her eyes and betook herself out of the atmosphere of roasting and broiling and frying and stewing away from the sight of great copper kettles and glowing coals and hissing pans into a little world fragrant with mint breathing of orange and lemon peel perfumed with pineapple redolent of cinnamon and clove reeking with things spirituous
Here the splutter of the broiler was replaced by the hiss of the siphon and the poppop of corks and the tinkle and clink of ice against glass
Hello dearie
cooed Miss Sweeney in greeting staring hard at the suspicious redness around Miss Finks eyelids
Aint you sweet to come over here in the headache department and help me out
Heres the wine list
Youll probly need it
Say who do you suppose invented New Years Eve
They must of had a imagination like a Greek bus boy
Im limp as a rag now and its only twothirty
Ive got a regular cramp in my wrist from checkin quarts
Say did you hear about Heinys crowd
No said Miss Fink evenly and began to study the first page of the wine list under the heading Champagnes of Noted Vintages
Well went on Miss Sweeneys little thin malicious voice hes fell in soft
Theres a table of three and theyre drinkin 1874 Imperial Crown at twelve dollars per like it was Waukesha ale
And every time they finish a bottle one of the guys pays for it with a brand new ten and a brand new five and tells Heiny to keep the change
Can you beat it
I hope said Miss Fink pleasantly that the supply of 1874 will hold out till morning
Id hate to see them have to come down to ten dollar wine
Here you Tony
Come back here
I may be a new hand in this department but Im not so green that you can put a gold label over on me as a yellow label
Notice that Im checking you another fifty cents
Aint he the grafter
laughed Miss Sweeney
She leaned toward Miss Fink and lowered her voice discreetly
Though Ill say this form
If you let him get away with it now an then hell split even with you
Hm
O well now dont get so high and mighty
The management expects it in this department
Thats why they pay starvation wages
An unusual note of color crept into Miss Gussie Finks smooth cheek
It deepened and glowed as Heiny darted around the corner and up to the bar
There was about him an air of suppressed excitement  suppressed because Heiny was too perfect a waiter to display emotion
Not another
chanted the bartenders in chorus
Yes answered Henri solemnly and waited while the wine cellar was made to relinquish another rare jewel
O you Heiny
called Miss Sweeney tell us what she looks like
If I had time Id take a peek myself
From what Tony says she must look something like Maxine Elliot only brighter
Henri turned
He saw Miss Fink
A curious little expression came into his eyesa Heiny look it might have been called as he regarded his erstwhile sweethearts unruffled attire and clear skin and steady eye and glossy hair
She was looking past him in that baffling maddening way that angry women have
Some of Henris poise seemed to desert him in that moment
He appeared a shade less debonair as he received the precious bottle from the wine mans hands
He made for Miss Finks desk and stood watching her while she checked his order
At the door he turned and looked over his shoulder at Miss Sweeney
Some time he said deliberately when theres no ladies around Ill tell you what I think she looks like
And the little glow of color in Miss Gussic Finks smooth cheek became a crimson flood that swept from brow to throat
Oh well snickered Miss Sweeney to hide her own discomfiture this is little Heinys first New Years Eve in the diningroom
Honest I blieve hes shocked
He dont realize that celebratin New Years Eve is like eatin oranges
You got to let go your dignity t really enjoy em
Three times more did Henri enter and demand a bottle of the famous vintage and each time he seemed a shade less buoyant
His elation diminished as his tips grew greater until as he drew up at the bar at six oclock he seemed wrapped in impenetrable gloom
Them hawgs sousin yet
shrilled Miss Sweeney
She and Miss Fink had climbed down from their high stools and were preparing to leave
Henri nodded drearily and disappeared in the direction of the Pink Fountain Room
Miss Fink walked back to her own desk in the corner near the diningroom door
She took her hat off the hook and stood regarding it thoughtfully
Then with a little air of decision she turned and walked swiftly down the passageway that separated diningroom from kitchen
Tillie the scrubwoman was down on her hands and knees in one corner of the passage
She was one of a small army of cleaners that had begun the work of clearing away the debris of the long nights revel
Miss Fink lifted her neat skirts high as she tiptoed through the little soapy pool that followed in the wake of Tillie the scrubwoman
She opened the swinging doors a cautious little crack and peered in
What she saw was not pretty
If the words sordid and bacchanalian had been part of Miss Finks vocabulary they would have risen to her lips then
The crowd had gone
The great room contained not more than half a dozen people
Confetti littered the floor
Here and there a napkin crushed and bedraggled into an unrecognizable ball lay under a table
From an overturned bottle the dregs were dripping drearily
The air was stale stifling poisonous
At a little table in the center of the room Henris three were still drinking
They were doing it in a dreadful and businesslike way
There were two men and one woman
The faces of all three were mahogany colored and expressionless
There was about them an awful sort of stillness
Something in the sight seemed to sicken Gussie Fink
It came to her that the wintry air outdoors must be gloriously sweet and cool and clean in contrast to this
She was about to turn away with a last look at Heiny yawning behind his hand when suddenly the woman rose unsteadily to her feet balancing herself with her finger tips on the table
She raised her head and stared across the room with dull unseeing eyes and licked her lips with her tongue
Then she turned and walked half a dozen paces screamed once with horrible shrillness and crashed to the floor
She lay there in a still crumpled heap the folds of her exquisite gown rippling to meet a little stale pool of wine that had splashed from some broken glass
Then this happened
Three people ran toward the woman on the floor and two people ran past her and out of the room
The two who ran away were the men with whom she had been drinking and they were not seen again
The three who ran toward her were Henri the waiter Miss Gussie Fink checker and Tillie the scrubwoman
Henri and Miss Fink reached her first
Tillie the scrubwoman was a close third
Miss Gussie Fink made as though to slip her arm under the poor bruised head but Henri caught her wrist fiercely for a waiter and pulled her to her feet almost roughly
You leave her alone Kid he commanded
Miss Gussie Fink stared indignation choking her utterance
And as she stared the fierce light in Henris eyes was replaced by the light of tenderness
Well tend to her said Henri she aint fit for you to touch
I wouldnt let you soil your hands on such truck
And while Gussie still stared he grasped the unconscious woman by the shoulders while another waiter grasped her ankles with Tillie the scrubwoman arranging her draperies pityingly around her and together they carried her out of the diningroom to a room beyond
Back in the kitchen Miss Gussie Fink was preparing to don her hat but she was experiencing some difficulty because of the way in which her fingers persisted in trembling
Her face was turned away from the swinging doors but she knew when Henri came in
He stood just behind her in silence
When she turned to face him she found Henri looking at her and as he looked all the Heiny in him came to the surface and shone in his eyes
He looked long and silently at Miss Gussie Finkat the sane simple wholesomeness of her at her clear brown eyes at her white forehead from which the shining hair sprang away in such a delicate line at her immaculately white shirtwaist and her smooth snugfitting collar that came up to the lobes of her little pink ears at her creamy skin at her trim belt
He looked as one who would rest his eyeseyes weary of gazing upon satins and jewels and rouge and carmine and white arms and bosoms
Gee Kid
You look good to me he said
Do IHeiny
whispered Miss Fink
Believe me
replied Heiny fervently
It was just a case of swelled head
Forget it will you
Say that gang in there tonightwhy say that gang I know interrupted Miss Fink
Going home
asked Heiny
Yes
Suppose we have a bite of something to eat first suggested Heiny
Miss Fink glanced round the great deserted kitchen
As she gazed a little expression of disgust wrinkled her pretty nosethe nose that perforce had sniffed the scent of so many rare and exquisite dishes
Sure she assented joyously but not here
Lets go around the corner to Joeys
I could get real chummy with a cup of good hot coffee and a ham on rye
He helped her on with her coat and if his hands rested a moment on her shoulders who was there to see it
A few sleepy waneyed waiters and Tillie the scrubwoman
Together they started toward the door
Tillie the scrubwoman had worked her wet way out of the passage and into the kitchen proper
She and her pail blocked their way
She was sopping up a soapy pool with an allencompassing gray scrubrag
Heiny and Gussie stopped a moment perforce to watch her
It was rather fascinating to see how that artful scrubrag craftily closed in upon the soapy pool until it engulfed it
Tillie sat back on her knees to wring out the watersoaked rag
There was something pleasing in the sight
Tillies blue calico was faded white in patches and at the knees it was dark with soapy water
Her shoes were turned up ludicrously at the toes as scrubwomens shoes always are
Tillies thin hair was wadded back into a moist knob at the back and skewered with a grayblack hairpin
From her parboiled shriveled fingers to her ruddy perspiring face there was nothing of grace or beauty about Tillie
And yet Heiny found something pleasing there
He could not have told you why so how can I unless to say that it was perhaps for much the same reason that we rejoice in the wholesome safe reassuring feel of the gray woolen blanket on our bed when we wake from a horrid dream
A Happy New Year to you said Heiny gravely and took his hand out of his pocket
Tillies moist right hand closed over something
She smiled so that one saw all her broken black teeth
The same t you said Tillie
The same t you
VI ONE OF THE OLD GIRLS All of those ladies who end their conversation with you by wearily suggesting that you go down to the basement to find what you seek do not receive a meager seven dollars a week as a reward for their efforts
Neither are they all obliged to climb five weary flights of stairs to reach the dismal little court room which is their home and there are several who need not walk thirtythree blocks to save carfare only to spend wretched evenings washing out handkerchiefs and stockings in the cracked little washbowl while one ear is cocked for the stealthy tread of the Lady Who Objects
The earnest compiler of working girls budgets would pass Effie Bauer hurriedly by
Effies budget bulged here and there with such pathetic items as handembroidered blouses thick club steaks and parquet tickets for Maude Adams
That you may visualize her at once I may say that Effie looked twentyfourfrom the rear all women do in these days of girlish simplicity in hats and tailormades her skirts never sagged her shirtwaists were marvels of plainness and fit and her switch had cost her sixteen dollars wholesale a lady friend in the business
Oh there was nothing tragic about Effie
She had a plump assured style a keen blue eye a gift of repartee and a way of doing her hair so that the gray at the sides scarcely showed at all
Also a knowledge of corsets that had placed her at the buying end of that important department at Spiegels
Effie knew to the minute when coral beads went out and pearl beads came in and just by looking at her blouses you could tell when Cluny died and Irish was born
Meeting Effie on the street you would have put her down as one of the many welldressed prosperouslooking women shoppersif you hadnt looked at her feet
Veteran clerks and policemen cannot disguise their feet
Effie Bauers reason for not marrying when a girl was the same as that of most of the capable wiseeyed goodlooking women one finds at the head of departments
She had not had a chance
If Effie had been as attractive at twenty as she was atthere we wont betray confidences
Still it is certain that if Effie had been as attractive when a young girl as she was when an old girl she never would have been an old girl and head of Spiegels corset department at a salary of something very comfortably over one hundred and twentyfive a month and commissions
Effie had improved with the years and ripened with experience
She knew her value
At twenty she had been pale anaemic and bony with a startledfaun manner and bad teeth
Years of saleswomanship had broadened her mentally and physically until she possessed a wide and varied knowledge of that great and diversified subject known as human nature
She knew human nature all the way from the fifty ninecent girdles to the twentyfivedollar madetoorders
And if the years had brought among other things a certain hardness about the jaw and a line or two at the corners of the eyes it was not surprising
You cant rub up against the sharp edges of this world and expect to come out without a scratch or so
So much for Effie
Enter the hero
Webster defines a hero in romance as the person who has the principal share in the transactions related
He says nothing which would debar a gentleman just because he may be a trifle bald and in the habit of combing his hair over the thin spot and he raises no objections to a matter of thickness and color in the region of the back of the neck
Therefore Gabe I
Marks qualifies
Gabe was the gentleman about whom Effie permitted herself to be guyed
He came to Chicago on business four times a year and he always took Effie to the theater and to supper afterward
On those occasions Effies gown wrap and hat were as correct in texture lines and paradise aigrettes as those of any of her nonworking sisters about her
On the morning following these excursions into Lobsterdom Effie would confide to her friend Miss Weinstein of the lingeries and neligees l was out with my friend Mr Marks last evening
We went to Rectors after the show
Oh well it takes a New Yorker to know how
Honestly I feel like a queen when I go out with him
Hm
Oh nothing like that girlie
I never could see that marriage thing
Just good friends
Gabe had been coming to Chicago four times a year for six years
Six times four are twentyfour
And one is twentyfive
Gabes last visit made the twentyfifth
Well Effie Gabe said when the evenings entertainment had reached the restaurant stage this is our twentyfifth anniversary
Its our silver wedding without the silver and the wedding
Well have a bottle of champagne
That makes it almost legal
And then suppose we finish up by having the wedding
The silver can be omitted
Effie had been humming with the orchestra holding a lobster claw in one hand and wielding the little twopronged fork with the other
She dropped claw fork and popular air to stare openmouthed at Gabe
Then a slow uncertain smile crept about her lips although her eyes were still unsmiling
Stop your joking Gabie she said
Some day youll say those things to the wrong lady and then youll have a breachofpromise suit on your hands
This aint no joke Effie Gabe had replied
Not with me it aint
As long as my mother selig lived I wouldnt ever marry a Goy
It would have broken her heart
I was a good son to her and good sons make good husbands they say
Well Effie you want to try it out
There was something almost solemn in Effies tone and expression
Gabie she said slowly youre the first man thats ever asked me to marry him
That goes double answered Gabe
Thanks said Effie
That makes it all the nicer
Then Gabes face was radiant
But Effie shook her head quickly
Youre just twenty years late she said
Late
expostulated Gabe
I aint no dead one yet
Effie pushed her plate away with a little air of decision folded her plump arms on the table and leaning forward looked Gabe I
Marks squarely in the eyes
Gabie she said gently Ill bet you havent got a hundred dollars in the bank But interrupted Gabe
Wait a minute
I know you boys on the road
Besides your diamond scarf pin and your ring and watch have you got a cent over your salary
Nix
You carry just about enough insurance to bury you dont you
Youre fifty years old if youre a minute Gabie and if I aint mistaken youd have a pretty hard time of it getting ten thousand dollars insurance after the doctors got through with you
Twentyfive years of pinochle and poker and the fat of the land havent added up any bumps in the old stocking under the mattress
Say looka here objected Gabe more redfaced than usual I didnt know was proposing to no Senatorial investigating committee
Say you talk about them foreign noblemen being mercenary
Why they aint in it with you girls today
A feller is got to propose to you with his bank book in one hand and a bunch of lifeinsurance policies in the other
Youre right I aint saved much
But Ma selig always had everything she wanted
Say when a man marries its different
He begins to save
There
said Effie quickly
Thats just it
Twenty years ago Id have been glad and willing to start like that saving and scrimping and loving a man and looking forward to the time when four figures showed up in the bank account where but three bloomed before
Ive got what they call the home instinct
Give me a yard or so of cretonne and a photo of my married sister down in Iowa and I can make even a boardinghouse inside bedroom look like a place where a human being could live
If I had been as wise at twenty as I am now Gabie I could have married any man I pleased
But I was what they call capable
And men arent marrying capable girls
They pick little yellowheaded blueeyed idiots that dont know a lamb stew from a soup bone when they see it
Well Mr Man didnt show up and I started in to clerk at six per
Im earning as much as you are now
More
Now dont misunderstand me Gabe
Im not throwing bouquets at myself
Im not that kind of a girl
But I could sell a style 743 Slimshape to the Venus de Milo herself
The Lord knows she needed one with those hips of hers
I worked my way up alone
Im used to it
I like the excitement down at the store
Im used to luxuries
I guess if I was a man Id be the kind thy call a good providerthe kind that opens wine every time theres half an excuse for it and when he dies his widow has to take in boarders
And Gabe after youve worn tai lored suits every year for a dozen years you cant go back to twentyfivedollar readymades and be happy
You could if you loved a man said Gabe stubbornly
The hard lines around the jaw and the experienced lines about the eyes seemed suddenly to stand out on Effies face
Loves young dream is all right
But youve reached the age when you let your cigar ash dribble down onto your vest
Now me Ive got a kimono nature but a straightfront job and its kept me young
Young
Ive got to be
Thats my stock in trade
You see Gabie were just twenty years late both of us
Theyre not going to boost your salary
These days theyre looking for kids on the roadlive wires with a lot of nerve and a quick comeback
They dont want oldtimers
Why say Gabie if I was to tell you what I spend in face powder and toilette water and hairpins alone youd think Id made a mistake and given you the butcher bill instead
And Im no professional beauty either
Only it takes money to look cleaned and pressed in this town
In the seclusion of the cafe corner Gabe laid one plump highly manicured hand on Effies smooth arm
You wouldnt need to stay young for me Effie
I like you just as you are with out the powder or the toilette water or the hairpins
His red goodnatured face had an expression upon it that was touchingly near patient resignation as he looked up into Effies sparkling countenance
You never looked so good to me as you do this minute old girl
And if the day comes when you get lonesomeor change your mindor Effie shook her head and started to draw on her long white gloves
I guess I havent refused you the way the dames in the novels do it
Maybe its because Ive had so little practice
But I want to say this Gabe
Thank God I dont have to die knowing that no man ever wanted me to be his wife
Honestly Im that grateful that Id marry you in a minute if I didnt like you so well
Ill be back in three months like always was all that Gabe said
I aint going to write
When I get here well just take in a show and the younger you look the better Ill like it
But on the occasion of Gabes spring trip he encountered a statuesque blonde person where Effie had been wont to reign
Misser Bauer out of town
The statue melted a trifle in the sunshine of Gabes ingratiating smile
Miss Bauers ill the statue informed him using a heavy Eastern accent
Anything I can do for you
Im taking her place
Whyahnot exactly no said Gabe
Just a temporary indisposition I suppose
Well you wouldnt hardly call it that seeing that shes been sick with typhoid for seven weeks
Typhoid
shouted Gabe
While Im not in the habit of asking gentlemen their names Id like to inquire if yours happens to be MarksGabe I
Marks
Sure said Gabe
Thats me
Miss Bauers nurse telephones down last week that if a gentleman named MarksGabe I
Marksdrops in and inquires for Miss Bauer Im to tell him that shes changed her mind
On the way from Spiegels corset department to the car Gabe stopped only for a bunch of violets
Effies apartment house reached he sent up his card the violets and a message that the gentleman was waiting
There came back a reply that sent Gabie up before the violets were relieved of their first layer of tissue paper
Effie was sitting in a deep chair by the window a flowered quilt bunched about her shoulders her feet in gray knitted bedroom slippers
She looked every minute of her age and she knew it and didnt care
The hand that she held out to Gabe was a limp white fleshless thing that seemed to bear no relation to the plump firm member that Gabe had pressed on so many previous occasions
Gabe stared at this pale wraith in a moment of alarm and dismay
Then Youre lookinggreat
he stammered
Great
Nobodyd believe youd been sick a minute
Guess youve just been stalling for a beauty rest what
Effie smiled a tired little smile and shook her head slowly
Youre a good kid Gabie to lie like that just to make me feel good
But my nurse left yesterday and I had my first real squint at myself in the mirror
She wouldnt let me look while she was here
After what I saw staring back at me from that glass a whole ballroom full of French courtiers whispering sweet nothings in my ear couldnt make me believe that I look like anything but a hunk of Roquefort green spots included
When I think of how my clothes wont fit it makes me shiver
Oh youll soon be back at the store as good as new
They fatten up something wonderful after typhoid
Why I had a friend Did you get my message
interrupted Effie
I was only talking to hide my nervousness said Gabe and started forward
But Effie waved him away
Sit down she said
Ive got something to say
She looked thoughtfully down at one shining finger nail
Her lower lip was caught between her teeth
When she looked up again her eyes were swimming in tears
Gabe started forward again
Again Effie waved him away
Its all right Gabie
I dont blubber as a rule
This fever leaves you as weak as a rag and ready to cry if any one says Boo
Ive been doing some highpressure thinking since nursie left
Had plenty of time to do it in sitting here by this window all day
My land
I never knew there was so much time
Theres been days when I havent talked to a soul except the nurse and the chambermaid
Lonesome
Say the amount of petting I could stand would surprise you
Of course my nurse was a perfectly good nurseat twentyfive per
But I was just a case to her
You cant expect a nurse to ooze sympathy over an old maid with the fever
I tell you I was dying to have some one say Shshsh
when there was a noise just to show they were interested
Whenever Id moan the nurse would come over and stick a thermometer in my mouth and write something down on a chart
The boys and girls at the store sent flowers
Theyd have done the same if Id died
When the fever broke I just used to lie there and dream not feeling anything in particular and not caring much whether it was day or night
Know what I mean
Gabie shook a sympathetic head
There was a little silence
Then Effie went on
I used to think I was pretty smart earning my own good living dressing as well as the next one and able to spend my vacation in Atlantic City if I wanted to
I didnt know I was missing anything
But while I was sick I got to wishing that there was somebody that belonged to me
Somebody to worry about me and to sit up nightssomebody that just naturally felt they had to come tiptoeing into my room every three or four minutes to see if I was sleeping or had enough covers on or wanted a drink or something
I got to thinking what it would have been like if I had a husband and ahome
Youll think Im daffy maybe
Gabie took Effies limp white hand in his and stroked it gently
Effies face was turned away from him toward the noisy street
I used to imagine how hed come home at six stamping his feet maybe and making a lot of noise the way men do
And then hed remember and come creaking up the steps and hed stick his head in at the door in the funny awkward pathetic way men have in a sick room
And hed say Hows the old girl tonight
Id better not come near you now puss because Ill bring the cold with me
Been lonesome for your old man
And Id say Oh I dont care how cold you are dear
The nurse is downstairs getting my supper ready
And then hed come tiptoeing over to my bed and stoop down and kiss me and his face would be all cold and rough and his mustache would be wet and hed smell outdoorsy and smoky the way husbands do when they come in
And Id reach up and pat his cheek and say You need a shave old man
I know it hed say rubbing his cheek up against mine
Hurry up and wash now
Supperll be ready
Where are the kids
hed ask
The house is as quiet as the grave
Hurry up and get well kid
Its darn lonesome without you at the table and the childrens manners are getting something awful and I never can find my shirts
Lordy I guess we wont celebrate when you get up
Cant you eat a little something nourishing for supperbeefsteak or a good plate of soup or something
Men are like that you know
So Id say then Run along you old goose
Youll be suggesting sauerkraut and wieners next
Dont you let Millie have any marmalade tonight
Shes got a spoiled stomach
And then hed pound off down the hall to wash up and Id shut my eyes and smile to myself and everything would be all right because he was home
There was a long silence
Effies eyes were closed
But two great tears stole out from beneath each lid and coursed their slow way down her thin cheeks
She did not raise her hand to wipe them away
Gabies other hand reached over and met the one that already clasped Effies
Effie he said in a voice that was as hoarse as it was gentle
Hm
said Effie
Will you marry me
I shouldnt wonder replied Effie opening her eyes
No dont kiss me
You might catch something
But say reach up and smooth my hair away from my forehead will you and call me a couple of fool names
I dont care how clumsy you are about it
I could stand an awful fuss being made over me without being spoiled any
Three weeks later Effie was back at the store
Her skirt didnt fit in the back and the little hollow places in her cheeks did not take the customary dash of rouge as well as when they had been plumper
She held a little impromptu reception that extended down as far as the lingeries and up as far as the rugs
The old sparkle came back to Effies eye
The old assurance and vigor seemed to return
By the time that Miss Weinstein of the French lingeries arrived breathless to greet her Effie was herself again
Well if youre not a sight for sore eyes dearie exclaimed Miss Weinstein
My goodness how grand and thin you are
Id be willing to take a course in typhoid myself if I thought I could lose twentyfive pounds
I havent a rag that fits me Effie announced proudly
Miss Weinstein lowered her voice discreetly
Dearie can you come down to my department for a minute
Were going to have a sale on imported lawnjerie blouses slightly soiled from nine to eleven tomorrow
Theres one you positively must see
Handembroidered Irish motifs and eyeleted from soup to nuts and only eightfifty
Ive got a fine chance of buying handmade waists no matter how slightly soiled Effie made answer with a doctor and nurses bill as long as your arm
Oh run along
scoffed Miss Weinstein
A person would think you had a husband to get a grouch every time you get reckless to the extent of a new waist
Youre your own boss
And you know your credits good
Honestly it would be a shame to let this chance slip
Youre not getting tight in your old age are you
Nno faltered Effie but Then come on urged Miss Weinstein energetically
And be thankful you havent got a man to raise the dickens when the bill comes in
Do you mean that
asked Effie slowly fixing Miss Weinstein with a thoughtful eye
Surest thing you know
Say girlie lets go over to Kleins for lunch this noon
They have pot roast with potato pfannkuchen on Tuesdays and we can split an order between us
Hold that waist till tomorrow will you
said Effie
Ive made an arrangement with afriend that might make new clothes impossible just now
But Im going to wire my party that the arrangement is all off
Ive changed my mind
I ought to get an answer tomorrow
Did you say it was a thirtysix
VII MAYMEYS FROM CUBA There is nothing new in this
It has all been done before
But tell me what is new
Does the aspiring and perspiring summer vaudeville artist flatter himself that his stuff is going big
Then does the stout man with the oystercolored eyelids in the first row left turn his bullet head on his fatcreased neck to remark huskily to his companion The hook for him
Rrrrotten
That last one was an old Webern Fields gag
They discarded it back in 91
Say the good ones is all dead anyhow
Take old Salvini now and Dan Rice
Them was actors
Come on out and have something
Does the shortstory writer felicitate himself upon having discovered a rare species in humanitys garden
The Blase Reader flips the pages between his fingers yawns stretches and remarks to his wife Thats a clean lift from Kiplingor is it Conan Doyle
Anyway Ive read something just like it before
Say kid guess what these magazine guys get for a full page ad
Nix
Thats just like a woman
Three thousand straight
Fact
To anticipate the delver into the past it may be stated that the plot of this one originally appeared in the Eternal Best Seller under the heading He Asked You For Bread and Ye Gave Him a Stone
There may be those who could not have traced my plagiarism to its source
Although the Book has had an unprecedentedly long run it is said to be less widely read than of yore
Even with this preparation I hesitate to confess that this is the story of a hungry girl in a big city
Well now wait a minute
Conceding that it has been done by every scribbler from tyro to best seller expert you will acknowledge that there is the possibility of a fresh viewpointtwistwhat is it the sporting editors call it
Oh yesslant
There is the possibility of getting a new slant on an old idea
That may serve to deflect the line of the deadly parallel
Just off State Street there is a fruiterer and importer who ought to be arrested for cruelty
His window is the most fascinating and the most heartless in Chicago
A line of openmouthed wideeyed gazers is always to be found before it
Despair wonder envy and rebellion smolder in the eyes of those gazers
No shop window show should be so diabolically set forth as to arouse such sensations in the breast of the beholder
It is a work of art that window a breeder of anarchism a destroyer of contentment a second feast of Tantalus
It boasts peaches dewy and golden when peaches have no right to be plethoric purple bunches of English hothouse grapes are there to taunt the tendollaraweek clerk whose sick wife should be in the hospital strawberries glow therein when shortcake is a last summers memory and forced cucumbers remind us that we are taking ours in the form of dill pickles
There is perhaps a choice head of cauliflower so exquisite in its ivory and green perfection as to be fit for a brides bouquet there are apples so flawless that if the garden of Eden grew any as perfect it is small wonder that Eve fell for them
There are fresh mushrooms and jumbo cocoanuts and green almonds costly things in beds of cotton nestle next to strange and marvelous things in tissue wrappings
Oh that window is no place for the hungry the dissatisfied or the man out of a job
When the air is filled with snow there is that in the sight of muskmelons which incites crime
Queerly enough the gazers before that window foot up the same year in and year out something after this fashion Item One anemic little milliners apprentice in coat and shoes that even her hat cant redeem
Item One sandyhaired grittycomplexioned man with a drooping ragged mustache a tin dinner bucket and lime on his boots
Item One thin mail carrier with an empty mail sack gaunt cheeks and an habitual droop to his left shoulder
Item One errand boy troubled with a chronic sniffle a shrill and piping whistle and a great deal of shuffling footwork
Item One negro wearing a spotted tan topcoat frayed trousers and no collar
His eyes seem all whites as he gazes
Enough of the window
But bear it in mind while we turn to Jennie
Jennies real name was Janet and she was Scotch
Canny
Not necessarily or why should she have been hungry and out of a job in January
Jennie stood in the row before the window and stared
The longer she stared the sharper grew the lines that fright and underfeeding had chiseled about her nose and mouth and eyes
When your last meal is an eighteenhourold memory and when that memory has only nearcoffee and a roll to dwell on there is something in the sight of January peaches and great strawberries carelessly spilling out of a tipped box just like they do in the fruit picture on the diningroom wall that is apt to carve sharp lines in the corners of the face
The tragic line dwindled going about its business
The man with the dinner pail and the lime on his boots spat drew the back of his hand across his mouth and turned away with an ugly look
Pork was up to 1425 dressed
The errand boys blithe whistle died down to a mournful dirge
He was windowwishing
His choice wavered between the juicy pears and the foreignlooking red things that looked like oranges and werent
One hand went into his coat pocket extracting an apple that was to have formed the piece de resistance of his noonday lunch
Now he regarded it with a sort of pitying disgust and bit into it with the middleofthemorning contempt that it deserved
The mail carrier pushed back his cap and reflectively scratched his head
How much over his months wage would that green basket piled high with exotic fruit come to
Jennie stood and stared after they had left and another line had formed
If you could have followed her gaze with dotted lines as they do in the cartoons you would have seen that it was not the peaches or the prickly pears or the strawberries or the muskmelon or even the grapes that held her eye
In the center of that wonderful window was an oddly woven basket
In the basket were brown things that looked like sweet potatoes
One knew that they were not
A sign over the basket informed the puzzled gazer that these were maymeys from Cuba
Maymeys from Cuba
The humor of it might have struck Jennie if she had not been so Scotch and so hungry
As it was a slow sullen heavy Scotch wrath rose in her breast
Maymeys from Cuba
The wantonness of it
Peaches
Yes
Grapes even and pears and cherries in snow time
But maymeys from Cubawhy one did not even know if they were to be eaten with butter or with vinegar or in the hand like an apple
Who wanted maymeys from Cuba
They had gone all those hundreds of miles to get a fruit or vegetable thinga thing so luxurious so out of all reason that one did not know whether it was to be baked or eaten raw
There they lay in their foreignlooking basket taunting Jennie who needed a quarter
Have I told you how Jennie happened to be hungry and jobless
Well then I shant
It doesnt really matter anyway
The fact is enough
If you really demand to know you might inquire of Mr Felix Klein
You will find him in a mahogany office on the sixth floor
The door is marked manager
It was his idea to import Scotch lassies from Dunfermline for his Scotch linen department
The idea was more fetching than feasible
There are people who will tell you that no girl possessing a grain of common sense and a little nerve need go hungry no matter how great the city
Dont you believe them
The city has heard the cry of wolf so often that it refuses to listen when he is snarling at the door particularly when the door is next door
Where did we leave Jennie
Still standing on the sidewalk before the fruit and fancy goods shop gazing at the maymeys from Cuba
Finally her Scotch bump of curiosity could stand it no longer
She dug her elbow into the arm of the person standing next in line
What are those
she asked
The next in line happened to be a man
He was a man without an overcoat and with his chin sunk deep into his collar and his hands thrust deep into his pockets
It looked as though he were trying to crawl inside himself for warmth
Those
That sign says theyre maymeys from Cuba
I know persisted Jennie but what are they
Search me
Say I aint bothering about maymeys from Cuba
A couple of hot murphies from Ireland served with a lump of butter would look good enough to me
Do you suppose any one buys them
marveled Jennie
Surest thing you know
Some rich dame coming by here wondering what she can have for dinner to tempt the jaded palates of her dear ones see
She sees them Cuban maymeys
The very thing
she says
Ill have em served just before the salad
And she sails in and buys a pound or two
I wonder now do you eat em with a fruit knife or with a spoon
Jennie took one last look at the woven basket with its foreign contents
Then she moved on slowly
She had been moving on for hoursweeks
Most people have acquired the habit of eating three meals a day
In a city of some few millions the habit has made necessary the establishing of many thousands of eating places
Jennie would have told you that there were billions of these
To her the world seemed composed of one huge glittering restaurant with myriads of windows through which one caught maddening glimpses of ketchup bottles and nickel coffee heaters and piles of doughnuts and scurrying waiters in white and people critically studying menu cards
She walked in a maze of restaurants cafes eatinghouses
Tables and diners loomed up at every turn on every street from Michigan Avenues roseshaded Louis the Somethingth palaces where every waiter owns his man to the white tile mausoleums where every man is his own waiter
Everywhere there were windows full of lemon cream pies and pans of baked apples swimming in lakes of golden syrup and pots of baked beans with the pink and crispy slices of pork just breaking through the crust
Every dairy lunch mocked one with the sign of wheat cakes with maple syrup and country sausage 20 cents
There are those who will say that for cases like Jennies there are soup kitchens Y W C
A
s relief associations policemen and things like that
And so there are
Unfortunately the people who need them arent up on them
Try it
Plant yourself penniless in the middle of State Street on a busy day dive into the howling scrambling pushing maelstrom that hurls itself against the mountainous and impregnable form of the crossing policeman and see what youll get out of it provided you have the courage
Desperation gave Jennie a false courage
On the strength of it she made two false starts
The third time she reached the arm of the crossing policeman and clutched it
That imposing giant removed the whistle from his mouth and majestically inclined his head without turning his gaze upon Jennie one eye being fixed on a red automobile that was showing signs of sulking at its enforced pause the other being busy with a cursing drayman who was having an argument with his off horse
Jennie mumbled her question
Said the crossing policeman Getcher car on Wabash ride to umptysecond transfer get off at Blank Street and walk three blocks south
Then he put the whistle back in his mouth blew two shrill blasts and the horde of men women motors drays trucks cars and horses swept over him through him past him leaving him miraculously untouched
Jennie landed on the opposite curbing breathing hard
What was that street
Umptywhat
Well it didnt matter anyway
She hadnt the nickel for car fare
What did you do next
You begged from people on the street
Jennie selected a middleaged prosperous motherly looking woman
She framed her plea with stiff lips
Before she had finished her sentence she found herself addressing empty air
The middleaged prosperous motherly looking woman had hurried on
Well then you tried a man
You had to be careful there
He mustnt be the wrong kind
There were so many wrong kinds
Just an ordinary looking family man would be best
Ordinary looking family men are strangely in the minority
There are so many more bullnecked tanshoed ones
Finally Jennies eye grown sharp with want saw one
Not too well dressed kindfaced middleaged
She fell into step beside him
Please can you help me out with a shilling
Jennies nose was red and her eyes watery
Said the middleaged family man with the kindly face Beat it
Youve had about enough I guess
Jennie walked into a department store picked out the oldest and most stationary looking floorwalker and put it to him
The floorwalker bent his head caught the word food swung about and pointed over Jennies head
Grocery department on the seventh floor
Take one of those elevators up
Any one but a floorwalker could have seen the misery in Jennies face
But to floorwalkers all womens faces are horrible
Jennie turned and walked blindly toward the elevators
There was no fight left in her
If the floorwalker had said Silk negligees on the fourth floor
Take one of those elevators up Jennie would have ridden up to the fourth floor and stupidly gazed at pink silk and val lace negligees in glass cases
Tell me have you ever visited the grocery department of a great store on the wrong side of State Street
Its a mouthwatering experience
A department store grocery is a glorified mixture of delicatessen shop meat market and vaudeville
Starting with the live lobsters and crabs you work your hungry way right around past the cheeses and the sausages and the hams and tongues and headcheese past the blonde person in white who makes marvelous and uneatable things out of gelatine through a thousand smells and scentssmells of things smoked and pickled and spiced and baked and preserved and roasted
Jennie stepped out of the elevator licking her lips
She sniffed the air eagerly as a hound sniffs the scent
She shut her eyes when she passed the sugarcured hams
A woman was buying a slice from one and the butcher was extolling its merits
Jennie caught the words juicy and cornfed
That particular store prides itself on its cheese department
It boasts that there one can get anything in cheese from the simple cottage variety to imposing mottled Stilton
There are cheeses from France cheeses from Switzerland cheeses from Holland
Brick and parmesan Edam and limburger perfumed the atmosphere
Behind the counters were big fullfed men in white aprons and coats
They flourished keen bright knives
As Jennie gazed one of them in a moment of idleness cut a tiny wedge from a rich yellow Swiss cheese and stood nibbling it absently his eyes wandering toward the blonde gelatine demonstrator
Jennie swayed and caught the counter
She felt horribly faint and queer
She shut her eyes for a moment
When she opened them a womana fat housewifely comfortable looking womanwas standing before the cheese counter
She spoke to the cheese man
Once more his sharp knife descended and he was offering the possible customer a sample
She picked it off the knifes sharp tip nibbled thoughtfully shook her head and passed on
A great glorious world of hope opened out before Jennie
Her cheeks grew hot and her eyes felt dry and bright as she approached the cheese counter
A bit of that she said pointing
It doesnt look just as I like it
Very fine madam the man assured her and turned the knife point toward her with the infinitesimal wedge of cheese reposing on its blade
Jennie tried to keep her hand steady as she delicately picked it off nibbled as she had seen that other woman do it her head on one side before it shook a slow negative
The effort necessary to keep from cramming the entire piece into her mouth at once left her weak and trembling
She passed on as the other woman had done around the corner and into a world of sausages
Great rosy mounds of them filled counters and cases
Sausage
Sneer you pate de foies grasers
But may you know the day when hunger will have you
And on that day may you run into linked temptation in the form of Braunschweiger Metwurst
May you know the longing that causes the eyes to glaze at the sight of Thuringer sausage and the mouth to water at the scent of Cervelat wurst and the fingers to tremble at the nearness of smoked liver
Jennie stumbled on through the smells and the sights
That nibble of cheese had been like a drop of human blood to a maneating tiger
It made her bold cunning even while it maddened
She stopped at this counter and demanded a slice of summer sausage
It was paperthin but delicious beyond belief
At the next counter there was corned beef streaked fat and lean
Jennie longed to bury her teeth in the succulent meat and get one great soulsatisfying mouthful
She had to be content with her judicious nibbling
To pass the goldenbrown breaded pigs feet was torture
To look at the codfish balls was agony
And so Jennie went on sampling tasting the scraps of food acting only as an aggravation
Up one aisle and down the next she went
And then just around the corner she brought up before the grocery departments pride and boast the Scotch bakery
It is the stores star vaudeville feature
All day long the gaping crowd stands before it watching David the Scone Man as with sleeves rolled high above his big arms he kneads and slaps and molds and thumps and shapes the dough into toothsome Scotch confections
There was a crowd around the white counters now and the flat baking surface of the gas stove was just hot enough and David the Scone Man he called them Scuns was whipping about here and there turning the baking oat cakes filling the shelf above the stove when they were done to a turn rolling out fresh ones waiting on customers
His nutcracker face almost allowed itself a pleased expressionbut not quite
David the Scone Man was Scotch I was going to add dye ken but I will not
Jennie wondered if she really saw those things
Mutton pies
Scones
Scotch short bread
Oat cakes
She edged closer wriggling her way through the little crowd until she stood at the counters edge
David the Scone Man his back to the crowd was turning the last batch of oat cakes
Jennie felt strangely lightheaded and unsteady and airy
She stared straight ahead a halfsmile on her lips while a hand that she knew was her own and that yet seemed no part of her stole out very very slowly and cunningly and extracted a hot scone from the pile that lay in the tray on the counter
That hand began to steal back more quickly now
But not quickly enough
Another hand grasped her wrist
A womans high shrill voice why will women do these things to each other
said excitedly Say Scone Man
Scone Man
This girl is stealing something
A buzz of exclamations from the crowda closing in upon hera whirl of faces and counter and trays and gas stove
Jennie dropped with a crash the warm scone still grasped in her fingers
Just before the ambulance came it was the blonde lady of the impossible gelatines who caught the murmur that came from Jennies white lips
The blonde lady bent her head closer
Closer still
When she raised her face to those other faces crowded near her eyes were round with surprise
S fars I can make out she says her names Mamie and shes from Cuba
Well wouldnt that eat you
I always thought they was dark complected
VII THE LEADING LADY The leading lady lay on her bed and wept
Not as you have seen leading ladies weep becomingly with eyebrows pathetically Vshaped mouth quivering sequined bosom heaving
The leading lady lay on her bed in a redandbluestriped kimono and wept as a woman weeps her head burrowing into the depths of the lumpy hotel pillow her teeth biting the pillowcase to choke back the sounds so that the grouch in the next room might not hear
Presently the leading ladys right hand began to grope about on the bedspread for her handkerchief
Failing to find it she sat up wearily raising herself on one elbow and pushing her hair back from her foreheadnot as you have seen a leading lady pass a lily hand across her alabaster brow but as a heartsick woman does it
Her tears and sniffles had formed a little oasis of moisture on the pillows white bosom so that the ugly stripe of the ticking showed through
She gazed down at the damp circle with smarting swollen eyes and another lump came up into her throat
Then she sat up resolutely and looked about her
The leading lady had a large and saving sense of humor
But there is nothing that blunts the sense of humor more quickly than a few months of onenight stands
Even O Henry could have seen nothing funny about that room
The bed was of green enamel with flyspecked gold trimmings
It looked like a huge frog
The wallpaper was a crime
It represented an army of tan mustard plasters climbing up a chocolatefudge wall
The leading lady was conscious of a feeling of nausea as she gazed at it
So she got up and walked to the window
The room faced west and the hot afternoon sun smote full on her poor swollen eyes
Across the street the red brick walls of the enginehouse caught the glare and sent it back
The firemen in their blue shirtsleeves were seated in the shade before the door their chairs tipped at an angle of sixty
The leading lady stared down into the sunbaked street turned abruptly and made as though to fall upon the bed again with a view to forming another little damp oasis on the pillow
But when she reached the center of the stifling little bedroom her eye chanced on the electric callbutton near the door
Above the electric bell was tacked a printed placard giving information on the subjects of laundry icewater bellboys and diningroom hours
The leading lady stood staring at it a moment thoughtfully
Then with a sudden swift movement she applied her forefinger to the button and held it there for a long halfminute
Then she sat down on the edge of the bed her kimono folded about her and waited
She waited until a lank bellboy in a brown uniform that was some sizes too small for him had ceased to take any interest in the game of chess which Bauer and Merkle the champion firemen chessplayers were contesting on the walk before the open doorway of the enginehouse
The proprietor of the Burke House had originally intended that the brown uniform be worn by a diminutive bellboy such as one sees in musical comedies
But the available supply of stage size bellboys in our town is somewhat limited and was soon exhausted
There followed a succession of lank bellboys with arms and legs sticking ungracefully out of sleeves and trousers
Come
called the leading lady quickly in answer to the lank youths footsteps and before he had had time to knock
Ring
asked the boy stepping into the torrid little room
The leading lady did not reply immediately
She swallowed something in her throat and pushed back the hair from her moist forehead again
The brown uniform repeated his question a trifle irritably
Whereupon the leading lady spoke desperately Is there a woman around this place
I dont mean diningroom girls or the person behind the cigarcounter
Since falling heir to the brown uniform the lank youth had heard some strange requests
He had been interviewed by various ladies in varicolored kimonos relative to liquid refreshment laundry and the cost of hiring a horse and rig for a couple of hours
One had even summoned him to ask if there was a Bible in the house
But this latest question was a new one
He stared leaning against the door and thrusting one hand into the depths of his very tight breeches pocket
Why theres Pearlie Schultz he said at last with a grin
Whos she
The leading lady sat up expectantly
Steno
The expectant figure drooped
Blonde
And Irish crochet collar with a black velvet bow on her chest
Who
Pearlie
Naw
You mustnt get Pearlie mixed with the common or garden variety of stenos
Pearlie is fat and she wears specs and shes got a double chin
Her hair is skimpy and she dont wear no rat
Wy no traveling man has ever tried to flirt with Pearlie yet
Pearlies what youd call a woman all right
You wouldnt never make a mistake and think shed escaped from the first row in the chorus
The leading lady rose from the bed reached out for her pocketbook extracted a dime and held it out to the bellboy
Here
Will you ask her to come up here to me
Tell her I said please
After he had gone she seated herself on the edge of the bed again with a look in her eyes like that which you have seen in the eyes of a dog that is waiting for a door to be opened
Fifteen minutes passed
The look in the eyes of the leading lady began to fade
Then a footstep sounded down the hall
The leading lady cocked her head to catch it and smiled blissfully
It was a heavy comfortable footstep under which a board or two creaked
There came a big sensible thumpthumpthump at the door with stout knuckles
The leading lady flew to answer it
She flung the door wide and stood there clutching her kimono at the throat and looking up into a red goodnatured face
Pearlie Schultz looked down at the leading lady kindly and benignantly as a mastiff might look at a terrier
Lonesome for a bosom to cry on
asked she and stepped into the room walked to the west windows and jerked down the shades with a zipzip shutting off the yellow glare
She came back to where the leading lady was standing and patted her on the cheek lightly
You tell me all about it said she smiling
The leading lady opened her lips gulped tried again gulped againPearlie Schultz shook a sympathetic head
Aint had a decent closetonature powwow with a woman for weeks and weeks have you
How did you know
cried the leading lady
Youve got that hungry look
There was a lady drummer here last winter and she had the same expression
She was so dead sick of eating her supper and then going up to her ugly room and reading and sewing all evening that it was a wonder shed stayed good
She said it was easy enough for the men
They could smoke and play pool and go to a show and talk to any one that looked good to em
But if she tried to amuse herself everybodyd say she was tough
She cottoned to me like a burr to a wool skirt
She traveled for a perfumery house and she said she hadnt talked to a woman except the drygoods clerks who were nice to her trying to work her for her perfume samples for weeks an weeks
Why that woman made crochet by the bolt and mended her clothes evenings whether they needed it or not and read till her eyes come near going back on her
The leading lady seized Pearlies hand and squeezed it
Thats it
Why I havent talkedreally talkedto a real woman since the company went out on the road
Im leading lady of the Second Wife company you know
Its one of those small cast plays with only five people in it
I play the wife and Im the only woman in the cast
Its terrible
I ought to be thankful to get the part these days
And I was too
But I didnt know it would be like this
Im going crazy
The men in the company are good kids but I cant go trailing around after them all day
Besides it wouldnt be right
Theyre all married except Billy who plays the kid and hes busy writing a vawdeville skit that he thinks the New York managers are going to fight for when he gets back home
We were to play Athens Wisconsin tonight but the house burned down night before last and that left us with an open date
When I heard the news youd have thought I had lost my mother
Its bad enough having a whole day to kill but when I think of tonight the leading ladys voice took on a note of hysteria it seems as though Id Say Pearlie interrupted abruptly you aint got a real good corsetcover pattern have you
One that fits smooth over the bust and dont slip off the shoulders
I dont seem able to get my hands on the kind I want
Have I
yelled the leading lady
And made a flying leap from the bed to the floor
She flapped back the cover of a big suitcase and began burrowing into its depths strewing the floor with lingerie newspaper clippings blouses photographs and Dutch collars
Pearlie came over and sat down on the floor in the midst of the litter
The leading lady dived once more fished about in the bottom of the suitcase and brought a crumpled piece of paper triumphantly to the surface
This is it
It only takes a yard and fiveeighths
And fits
Like Anna Helds skirts
Comes down in a V front and backlike this
See
And no fulness
Wait a minute
Ill show you my princess slip
I made it all by hand too
Ill bet you couldnt buy it under fifteen dollars and it cost me four dollars and eighty cents with the lace and all
Before an hour had passed the leading lady had displayed all her treasures from the photograph of her baby that died to her new Blanche Ring curl cluster and was calling Pearlie by her first name
When a bell somewhere boomed six oclock Pearlie was being instructed in a new exercise calculated to reduce the hips an inch a month
My land
cried Pearlie aghast and scrambled to her feet as nimbly as any woman can who weighs two hundred pounds
Suppertime and Ive got a bunch of letters an inch thick to get out
Id better reduce that some before I begin on my hips
But say Ive had a lovely time
The leading lady clung to her
Youve saved my life
Why I forgot all about being hot and lonely and a couple of thousand miles from New York
Must you go
Got to
But if youll promise you wont laugh Ill make a date for this evening thatll give you a new sensation anyway
Theres going to be a strawberry social on the lawn of the parsonage of our church
Ive got a booth
You shed that kimono and put on a thin dress and those curls and some powder and Ill introduce you as my friend Miss Evans
You dont look Evans but this is a Methodist church strawberry festival and if I was to tell them that you are leading lady of the Second Wife company theyd excommunicate my booth
A strawberry social
gasped the leading lady
Do they still have them
She did not laugh
Why I used to go to strawberry festivals when I was a little girl in Careful
Youll be giving away your age and anyway you dont look it
Fashions in strawberry socials aint changed much
Better bathe your eyes in eau de cologne or whatever it is theyre always dabbing on em in books
See you at eight
At eight oclock Pearlies thumpthump sounded again and the leading lady sprang to the door as before
Pearlie stared
This was no tearstained heatbedraggled creature in an unbecoming redstriped kimono
It was a remarkably pretty woman in a white lingerie gown over a pink slip
The leading lady knew a thing or two about the gentle art of makingup
That just goes to show remarked Pearlie that you must never judge a woman in a kimono or a bathing suit
You look nineteen
Say I forgot something downstairs
Just get your handkerchief and chamois together and meet in my cubbyhole next to the lobby will you
Ill be ready for you
Downstairs she summoned the lank bellboy
You go outside and tell Sid Strang I want to see him will you
Hes on the bench with the baseball bunch
Pearlie had not seen Sid Strang outside
She did not need to
She knew he was there
In our town all the young men dress up in their pale gray suits and lavenderstriped shirts after supper on summer evenings
Then they stroll down to the Burke House buy a cigar and sit down on the benches in front of the hotel to talk baseball and watch the girls go by
It is astonishing to note the number of our girls who have letters to mail after supper
One would think that they must drive their pens fiercely all the afternoon in order to get out such a mass of correspondence
The obedient Sid reached the door of Pearlies little office just off the lobby as the leading lady came down the stairs with a spangled scarf trailing over her arm
It was an effective entrance
Why hello
said Pearlie looking up from her typewriter as though Sid Strang were the last person in the world she expected to see
What do you want here
Ethel this is my friend Mr Sid Strang one of our rising young lawyers
His neckties always match his socks
Sid this is my friend Miss Ethel Evans of New York
Were going over to the strawberry social at the M E parsonage
I dont suppose youd care about going
Mr Sid Strang gazed at the leading lady in the white lingerie dress with the pink slip and the Vshaped neck and the spangled scarf and turned to Pearlie
Why Pearlie Schultz
he said reproachfully
How can you ask
You know what a strawberry social means to me
I havent missed one in years
I know it replied Pearlie with a grin
You feel the same way about Thursday evening prayermeeting too dont you
You can walk over with us if you want to
Were going now
Miss Evans and I have got a booth
Sid walked
Pearlie led them determinedly past the rows of gray suits and lavender and pink shirts on the benches in front of the hotel
And as the leading lady came into view the gray suits stopped talking baseball and sat up and took notice
Pearlie had known all those young men inside of the swagger suits in the days when their summer costume consisted of a pair of dads pants cut down to a doubtful fit and a nondescript shirt damp from the swimminghole
So she called out cheerily Were going over to the strawberry festival
I expect to see all you boys there to contribute your mite to the church carpet
The leading lady turned to look at them and smiled
They were such a dapper pinkcheeked cleanlooking lot of boys she thought
At that the benches rose to a man and announced that they might as well stroll over right now
Whenever a new girl comes to visit in our town our boys make a concerted rush at her and develop a case immediately and the girl goes home when her visit is over with her head swimming and forever after bores the girls of her home town with tales of her conquests
The ladies of the First M E Church still talk of the money they garnered at the strawberry festival
Pearlies outoftown friend was garnererinchief
You take a crosseyed pockmarked girl and put her in a white dress with a pink slip on a green lawn under a string of rosecolored Japanese lanterns and shell develop an almost Oriental beauty
It is an ideal setting
The leading lady was not crosseyed or pockmarked
She stood at the lanternillumined booth with Pearlie in the background and dis pensed an unbelievable amount of strawberries
Sid Strang and the hotel bench brigade assisted
They made engagements to take Pearlie and her friend down river next day and to the ball game and planned innumerable picnics gazing meanwhile into the leading ladys eyes
There grew in the cheeks of the leading lady a flush that was not brought about by the pink slip or the Japanese lanterns or the skillful application of rouge
By nine oclock the strawberry supply was exhausted and the president of the Foreign Missionary Society was sending wildly downtown for more icecream
I call it an outrage puffed Pearlie happily ladling icecream like mad
Making a poor working girl like me slave all evening
How many was that last order
Four
My land
thats the third dish of icecream Ed Whites had
Youll have something to tell the villagers about when you get back to New York
The leading lady turned a flushed face toward Pearlie
This is more fun than the Actors Fair
I had the photograph booth last year and I took in nearly as much as Lil Russell and goodness knows all she needs to do at a fair is to wear her diamondandpearl stomacher and her setpiece smile and the men just swarm around her like the pictures of a crowd in a McCutcheon cartoon
When the last Japanese lantern had guttered out Pearlie Schultz and the leading lady prepared to go home
Before they left the M E ladies came over to Pearlies booth and personally congratulated the leading lady and thanked her for the interest she had taken in the cause and the secretary of the Epworth League asked her to come to the tea that was to be held at her home the following Tuesday
The leading lady thanked her and said shed come if she could
Escorted by a bodyguard of gray suits and lavenderstriped shirts Pearlie and her friend Miss Evans walked toward the hotel
The attentive bodyguard confessed itself puzzled
Arent you staying at Pearlies house
asked Sid tenderly when they reached the Burke House
The leading lady glanced up at the windows of the stifling little room that faced west
No answered she and paused at the foot of the steps to the ladies entrance
The light from the electric globe over the doorway shone on her hair and sparkled in the folds of her spangled scarf
Im not staying at Pearlies because my name isnt Ethel Evans
Its Aimee Fox with a little French accent mark over the double E Im leading lady of the Second Wife company and old enough to bewell your aunty anyway
We go out at onethirty tomorrow morning
IX THAT HOMETOWN FEELING We all have our ambitions
Mine is to sit in a rockingchair on the sidewalk at the corner of Clark and Randolph Streets and watch the crowds go by
South Clark Street is one of the most interesting and cosmopolitan thoroughfares in the world New Yorkers please sniff
If you are from Paris France or Paris Illinois and should chance to be in that neighborhood you will stop at Tonys news stand to buy your hometown paper
Dont mistake the nature of this story
There is nothing of the shiveringnewsboywaif about Tony
He has the voice of a foghorn the purplestriped shirt of a sport the diamond scarfpin of a racetrack tout and the savoir faire of the gutterbred
Youd never pick him for a newsboy if it werent for his chapped hands and the eternal coldsore on the upper left corner of his mouth
It is a fascinating thing Tonys stand
A high wooden structure rising tier on tier containing papers from every corner of the world
Ill defy you to name a paper that Tony doesnt handle from Timbuctoo to Tarrytown from South Bend to South Africa
A paper marked Christiania Norway nestles next to a sheet from Kalamazoo Michigan
You can get the War Cry or Le Figaro
With one hand Tony will give you the Berlin Tageblatt and with the other the Times from Neenah Wisconsin
Take your choice between the Bulletin from Sydney Australia or the Bee from Omaha
But perhaps you know South Clark Street
It is honeycombed with good copymansize stuff
South Clark Street reminds one of a slatternly woman brave in silks and velvets on the surface but ragged and rumpled and none too clean as to nether garments
It begins with a tenement so vile so filthy so repulsive that the municipal authorities deny its very existence
It ends with a brandnew hotel all red brick and white tiling and Louise Quinze furniture and sourcream colored marble lobby and oriental rugs lavishly scattered under the feet of the unappreciative guest from Kansas City
It is a street of signs is South Clark
They vary all the way from Banca Italiana done in fat flyspecked letters of gold to Sang Yuen scrawled in Chinese red and black
Spaghetti and chop suey and dairy lunches nestle side by side
Here an electric sign blazons forth the tempting announcement of lunch
Just across the way delicately suggesting a means of availing ones self of the invitation is another which announces Loans
South Clark Street can transform a winter overcoat into hamburger and onions so quickly that the eye cant follow the hand
Do you gather from this that you are being taken slumming
Not at all
For the passerby on Clark Street varies as to color nationality raiment fingernails and haircut according to the locality in which you find him
At the tenement end the feminine passerby is apt to be shawled swarthy downattheheel and dragging a darkeyed fretting baby in her wake
At the hotel end you will find her blonde of hair velvet of boot plumed of headgear and prone to have at her heels a white woolly pinkeyed dog
The masculine Clark Streeter
I throw up my hands
Pray remember that South Clark Street embraces the dime lodging house pawnshop hotel theater chopsuey and railway office district all within a few blocks
From the sidewalk in front of his groggery Bath House John can see the City Hall
The trim khakigarbed enlistment officer rubs elbows with the lodging house bum
The masculine Clark Streeter may be of the kind that begs a dime for a bed or he may loll in manicured luxury at the marblelined hotel
South Clark Street is so splendidly indifferent
Copyhunting I approached Tony with hope in my heart a smile on my lips and a nickel in my hand
PhiladelphiaerInquirer
I asked those being the city and paper which fire my imagination least
Tony whipped it out dexterously
I looked at his keen blue eye his lean brown face and his punishing jaw and I knew that no airy persiflage would deceive him
Boldly I waded in
I write for the magazines said I
Do they know it
grinned Tony
Just beginning to be faintly aware
Your stand looks like a story to me
Tell me does one ever come your way
For instance dont they come here asking for their hometown papersobs in their voicegrasp the sheet with trembling handstype swims in a misty haze before their eyesturn aside to brush away a tearall that kind of stuff you know
Tonys grin threatened his coldsore
You cant stand on the corner of Clark and Randolph all those years without getting wise to everything there is
Im on said he but Im afraid I cant accommodate girlie
I guess my ear aint attuned to that sob stuff
Whats that
Yessir
Nossir fifteen cents
Well I cant help that fifteens the reglar price of foreign papers
Thanks
There did you see that
I bet that gink give up fifteen of his last two bits to get that paper
O well sometimes they look happy and then again sometimes theyYesm
Mississippi
Five cents
Los Vegas Optic right here
Heh there
Youre forgettin your changean then again sometimes they look all to the doleful
Say stick around
Maybe somebodyll start something
You cant never tell
And then this happened
A man approached Tonys news stand from the north and a woman approached Tonys news stand from the south
They brought my story with them
The woman reeked of the city
I hope you know what I mean
She bore the stamp and seal and imprint of it
It had ground its heel down on her face
At the front of her coat she wore a huge bunch of violets with a fleshly tuberose rising from its center
Her furs were voluminous
Her hat was hidden beneath the cascades of a green willow plume
A green willow plume would make Edna May look sophisticated
She walked with that humping hip movement which city women acquire
She carried a jangling handful of useless gold trinkets
Her heels were too high and her hair too yellow and her lips too red and her nose too white and her cheeks too pink
Everything about her was too from the black stitching on her white gloves to the buckle of brilliants in her hat
The city had her body and soul and had fashioned her in its metallic cast
You would have sworn that she had never seen flowers growing in a field
Said she to Tony Got a Kewaskum Courier
As she said it the man stopped at the stand and put his question
To present this thing properly I ought to be able to describe them both at the same time like a juggler keeping two balls in the air at once
Kindly carry the lady in your minds eye
The man was tall and rawboned with very white teeth very blue eyes and an openfaced collar that allowed full play to an objectionably apparent Adams apple
His hair and mustache were sandy his gait loping
His manner clothes and complexion breathed of Waco Texas or is it Arizona
Said he to Tony Let me have the London Times
Well there you are
I turned an accusing eye on Tony
And you said no stories came your way I murmured reproachfully
Help yourself said Tony
The blonde lady grasped the Kewaskum Courier
Her green plume appeared to be unduly agitated as she searched its columns
The sheet rattled
There was no breeze
The hands in the tooblack stitched gloves were trembling
I turned from her to the man just in time to see the Adams apple leaping about unpleasantly and convulsively
Whereupon I jumped to two conclusions
Conclusion one Any woman whose hands can tremble over the Kewaskum Courier is homesick
Conclusion two Any man any part of whose anatomy can become convulsed over the London Times is homesick
She looked up from her Courier
He glanced away from his Times
As the novelists have it their eyes met
And there in each pair of eyes there swam that misty haze about which I had so earnestly consulted Tony
The Green Plume took an involuntary step forward
The Adams Apple did the same
They spoke simultaneously
Theyre going to pave Main Street said the Green Plume and Mrs Wilcox that was Jeri Meyers has got another baby girl and the ladies of the First M E made seven dollars and sixtynine cents on their needlework bazaar and missionary tea
I aint been home in eleven years
Hallem is trying for Parliament in Westchester and the King is back at Windsor
My mother wears a lace cap down to breakfast and the place is famous for its tapestries and yew trees and family ghost
I havent been home in twelve years
The great soft light of fellow feeling and sympathy glowed in the eyes of each
The Green Plume took still another step forward and laid her hand on his arm as is the way of Green Plumes the world over
Why dont you go kid
she inquired softly
Adams Apple gnawed at his mustache end
Im the black sheep
Why dont you
The blonde lady looked down at her glove tips
Her lower lip was caught between her teeth
Whats the feminine for black sheep
Im that
Anyway Id be afraid to go home for fear it would be too much of a shock for them when they saw my hair
They wasnt in on the intermediate stages when it was chestnut auburn Titian gold and orange colored
I want to spare their feelings
The last time they saw me it was just plain brown
Where I come from a woman who dyes her hair when it is beginning to turn gray is considered as good as lost
Funny aint it
And yet I remember the ministers wife used to wear false teeththe kind that clicks
But hair is different
Dear lady said the blueeyed man it would make no difference to your own people
I know they would be happy to see you hair and all
Ones own people My folks
Thats just it
If the Prodigal Son had been a daughter theyd probably have handed her one of her sisters mother hubbards and put her to work washing dishes in the kitchen
You see after Ma died my brother married and I went to live with him and Lil
I was an ugly little mug and it looked all to the Cinderella for me with the coach and four and prince left out
Lil was the village beauty when my brother married her and she kind of got into the habit of leaving the heavy role to me and confining herself to thinking parts
One day I took twenty dollars and came to the city
Oh I paid it back long ago but Ive never been home since
But say do you know every time I get near a news stand like this I grab the hometown paper
Ill bet Ive kept track every time my sisterinlaws sewing circle has met for the last ten years and the spring the paper said they built a new porch I was just dying to write and askem what they did with the Virginia creeper that used to cover the whole front and sides of the old porch
Look here said the man very abruptly if its money you need why Me
Do I look like a touch
Now you Finest stock farm and ranch in seven counties
I come to Chicago once a year to sell
Ive got just thirteen thousand nestling next to my left floating rib this minute
The eyes of the woman with the green plume narrowed down to two glittering slits
A new look came into her facea look that matched her hat and heels and gloves and complexion and hair
Thirteen thousand
Thirteen thous Say isnt it chilly on this corner hm
I know a kind of a restaurant just around the corner where Its no use said the sandyhaired man gently
And I wouldnt have said that if I were you
I was going back today on the 525 but Im sick of it all
So are you or you wouldnt have said what you just said
Listen
Lets go back home you and I
The sight of a Navajo blanket nauseates me
The thought of those prairies makes my eyes ache
I know that if I have to eat one more meal cooked by that Chink of mine Ill hang him by his own pigtail
Those rangy western ponies arent horseflesh fit for a man to ride
Why back home our stables were Look here
I want to see a silver teaservice with a coatofarms on it
I want to dress for dinner and take in a girl with a white gown and smooth white shoulders
My sister clips roses in the morning before breakfast in a pink ruffled dress and garden gloves
Would you believe that here on Clark Street with a whiskey sign overhead and the stockyard smells undernose
O hell
Im going home
Home
repeated the blonde lady
Home
The sagging lines about her flaccid chin took on a new look of firmness and resolve
The light of determination glowed in her eyes
Ill beat you to it she said
Im going home too
Ill be there tomorrow
Im dead sick of this
Who cares whether I live or die
Its just one darned round of grease paint and sky blue tights and new boarding houses and humping over to the theater every night going on and humping back to the room again
I want to wash up some supper dishes with egg on em and set some yeast for bread and pop a dishpan full of corn and put a shawl over my head and run over to Millie Krauses to get her kimono sleeve pattern
Im sour on this dirt and noise
I want to spend the rest of my life in a place so that when I die theyll put a column in the paper with a verse at the top and all the neighborsll come in and help bake up
Herewhy here Id just be two lines on the want ad page with fifty cents extra for Kewaskum paper please copy
The man held out his hand
Goodbye he said and please excuse me if I say God bless you
Ive never really wanted to say it before so its quite extraordinary
My names Guy Peel
The white glove with its tooconspicuous black stitching disappeared within his palm
Mines Mercedes Meron late of the Morning Glory Burlesquers but from now on Sadie Hayes of Kewaskum Wisconsin
Goodbye andwellGod bless you too
Say I hope you dont think Im in the habit of talking to strange gents like this
I am quite sure you are not said Guy Peel very gravely and bowed slightly before he went south on Clark Street and she went north
Dear Reader will you take my hand while I assist you to make a one years leap
Whoopla
There you are
A man and a woman approached Tonys news stand
You are quite right
But her willow plume was purple this time
A purple willow plume would make Mario Doro look sophisticated
The man was sandyhaired rawboned with a loping gait very blue eyes very white teeth and an objectionably apparent Adams apple
He came from the north and she from the south
In story books and on the stage when two people meet unexpectedly after a long separation they always stop short bring one hand up to their breast and say You
Sometimes especially in the case where the heroine chances on the villain they say simultaneously You
Here
I have seen people reunited under surprising circumstances but they never said You
They said something quite unmelodramatic and commonplace such as Well look whos here
or My land
If it aint Ed
Hows Ed
So it was that the Purple Willow Plume and the Adams Apple stopped shook hands and viewed one another while the Plume said I kind of thought Id bump into you
Felt it in my bones
And the Adams Apple said Then youre not living in KewaskumerWisconsin
Not any responded she briskly
How do you happen to be straying away from the tapestries and the yew trees and the ghost and the pink roses and the garden gloves and the silver teaservice with the coatofarms on it
A slow grim smile overspread the features of the man
You tell yours first he said
Well began she in the first place my names Mercedes Meron of the Morning Glory Burlesquers formerly Sadie Hayes of Kewaskum Wisconsin
I went home next day like I said I would
Say Mr Peel you said Peel didnt you
Guy Peel
Nice neat name to this day when I eat lobster late at night and have dreams its always about that visit home
How long did you stay
Im coming to that
Or maybe you can figure it out yourself when I tell you Ive been back eleven months
I wired the folks I was coming and then I came before they had a chance to answer
When the train reached Kewaskum I stepped off into the arms of a dowd in a homemademadeoveryearbeforelast suit and a hat that would have been funny if it hadnt been so pathetic
I grabbed her by the shoulders and I held her off and lookedlooked at the wrinkles and the sallow complexion and the coat with the sleeves in wrong and the mashed hat I told you Lil used to be the village peach didnt I
and I says For Gawds sakes Lil does your husband beat you
Steve
she shrieks beat me
You must be crazy
Well if he dont he ought to
Those clothes are grounds for divorce I says
Mr
Guy Peel it took me just four weeks to get wise to the fact that the way to cure homesickness is to go home
I spent those four weeks trying to revolutionize my sisterinlaws house dress kids husband wall paper and parlor carpet
I took all the doilies from under the ornaments and spoke my mind on the subject of the handpainted lamp and Lil hates me for it yet and will to her dying day
I fitted three dresses for her and made her get some corsets that shell never wear
They have roast pork for dinner on Sundays and they never go to the theater and they like bread pudding and theyre happy
I wasnt
They treated me fine and it was home all right but not my home
It was the same but I was different
Eleven years away from anything makes it shrink if you know what I mean
I guess maybe you do
I remember that I used to think that the Grand View Hotel was a regular little oriental palace that was almost too luxurious to be respectable and that the traveling men who stopped there were gods and just to prance past the hotel after supper had the Atlantic City board walk looking like a back alley on a rainy night
Well everything had sort of shriveled up just like that
The popcorn gave me indigestion and I burned the skin off my nose popping it
Kneading bread gave me the backache and the blamed stuff wouldnt raise right
I got so I was crazy to hear the roar of an L train and the sound of a crossing policemans whistle
I got to thinking how Michigan Avenue looks downtown with the lights shining down on the asphalt and all those people eating in the swell hotels and the autos and the theater crowds and the windows andwell Im back
Glad I went
You said it
Because it made me so darned glad to get back
Ive found out one thing and its a great little lesson when you get it learned
Most of us are where we are because we belong there and if we didnt we wouldnt be
Say that does sound mixed dont it
But its straight
Now you tell yours
I think youve said it all began Guy Peel
Its queer isnt it how twelve years of America will spoil one for afternoon tea and yew trees and tapestries and lace caps and roses
The mater was glad to see me but she said I smelled woolly
They think a Navajo blanket is a thing the Indians wear on the war path and they dont know whether Texas is a state or a mineral water
It was slowslow
About the time they were taking afternoon tea Id be reckoning how the boys would be rounding up the cattle for the night and about the time wed sit down to dinner something seemed to whisk the dinner table and the flowers and the men and women in evening clothes right out of sight like magic and I could see the boys stretched out in front of the bunk house after their supper of bacon and beans and biscuit and coffee
Theyd be smoking their pipes that smelled to Heaven and further and Wing would be squealing one of his creepy old Chink songs out in the kitchen and the sky would besay Miss Meron did you ever see the night sky out West
Purple you know and soft as soap suds and so near that you want to reach up and touch it with your hand
Toward the end my mother used to take me off in a corner and tell me that I hadnt spoken a word to the little girl that I had taken in to dinner and that if I couldnt forget my uncouth western ways for an hour or two at least perhaps Id better not try to mingle with civilized people
I discovered that home isnt always the place where you were born and bred
Home is the place where your everyday clothes are and where somebody or something needs you
They didnt need me over there in England
Lord no
I was sick for the sight of a Navajo blanket
My shacks glowing with them
And my books needed me and the boys and the critters and Kate
Kate
repeated Miss Meron quickly
Kates my horse
Im going back on the 525 tonight
This is my regular trip you know
I came around here to buy a paper because it has become a habit
And then too I sort of feltwell something told me that you Youre a nice boy said Miss Meron
By the way did I tell you that I married the manager of the show the week after I got back
We go to Bloomington tonight and then we jump to St Paul
I came around here just as usual becausewellbecause Tonys gift for remembering faces and facts amounts to genius
With two deft movements he whisked two papers from among the many in the rack and held them out
Kewaskum Courier
he suggested
Nix said Mercedes Meron Ill take a Chicago Scream
London Times
said Tony
No replied Guy Peel
Give me the San Antonio Express
X THE HOMELY HEROINE Millie Whitcomb of the fancy goods and notions beckoned me with her finger
I had been standing at Kate OMalleys counter pretending to admire her new basketweave suitings but in reality reveling in her droll account of how in the train coming up from Chicago Mrs Judge Porterfield had worn the negro porters coat over her chilly shoulders in mistake for her husbands
Kate OMalley can tell a funny story in a way to make the afterdinner pleasantries of a Washington diplomat sound like the clumsy jests told around the village grocery stove
I wanted to tell you that I read that last story of yours said Millie sociably when I had strolled over to her counter and I liked it all but the heroine
She had an adorable throat and hair that waved away from her white brow and eyes that now were blue and now gray
Say why dont you write a story about an ugly girl
My land
protested I
Its bad enough trying to make them accept my stories as it is
That last heroine was a raving beauty but she came back eleven times before the editor of Blakelys succumbed to her charms
Millies fingers were busy straightening the contents of a tray of combs and imitation jet barrettes
Millies fingers were not intended for that task
They are slender tapering fingers pinktipped and sensitive
I should think mused she rubbing a cloudy piece of jet with a bit of soft cloth that theyd welcome a homely one with relief
These goddesses are so cloying
Millie Whitcombs black hair is touched with soft mists of gray and she wears lavender shirtwaists and white stocks edged with lavender
There is a Colonial air about her that has nothing to do with celluloid combs and imitation jet barrettes
It breathes of dim old rooms rich with the tones of mahogany and old brass and Millie in the midst of it graygowned a soft white fichu crossed upon her breast
In our town the clerks are not the pert and gumchewing young persons that storywriters are wont to describe
The girls at Bascoms are institutions
They know us all by our first names and our lives are as an open book to them
Kate OMalley who has been at Bascoms for so many years that she is rumored to have stock in the company may be said to govern the fashions of our town
She is wont to say when we express a fancy for gray as the color of our new spring suit Oh now Nellie dont get gray again
You had it year before last and dont you think it was just the least leetle bit trying
Let me show you that green that came in yesterday
I said the minute I clapped my eyes on it that it was just the color for you with your brown hair and all
And we end by deciding on the green
The girls at Bascoms are not gossipsthey are too busy for thatbut they may be said to be delightfully well informed
How could they be otherwise when we go to Bascoms for our wedding dresses and party favors and baby flannels
There is news at Bascoms that our daily paper never hears of and wouldnt dare print if it did
So when Millie Whitcomb of the fancy goods and notions expressed her hunger for a homely heroine I did not resent the suggestion
On the contrary it sent me home in thoughtful mood for Millie Whitcomb has acquired a knowledge of human nature in the dispensing of her fancy goods and notions
It set me casting about for a really homely heroine
There never has been a really ugly heroine in fiction
Authors have started bravely out to write of an unlovely woman but they never have had the courage to allow her to remain plain
On Page 237 she puts on a black lace dress and red roses and the combination brings out unexpected tawny lights in her hair and olive tints in her cheeks and there she is the same old beautiful heroine
Even in the Duchess books one finds the simple Irish girl on donning a green corduroy gown cut square at the neck transformed into a wildrose beauty at sight of whom a ballroom is hushed into admiring awe
Theres the case of jane Eyre too
She is constantly described as plain and mouselike but there are covert hints as to her gray eyes and slender figure and clear skin and we have a sneaking notion that she wasnt such a fright after all
Therefore when I tell you that I am choosing Pearlie Schultz as my leading lady you are to understand that she is ugly not only when the story opens but to the bitter end
In the first place Pearlie is fat
Not plump or rounded or dimpled or deliciously curved but FAT
She bulges in all the wrong places including her chin
Sister who has a way of snooping over my desk in my absence says that I may as well drop this now because nobody would ever read it anyway least of all any sane editor
I protest when I discover that Sis has been over my papers
It bothers me
But she says you have to do these things when you have a genius in the house and cites the case of Kiplings Recessional which was rescued from the depths of his wastebasket by his wife
Pearlie Schultz used to sit on the front porch summer evenings and watch the couples stroll by and weep in her heart
A fat girl with a fat girls soul is a comedy
But a fat girl with a thin girls soul is a tragedy
Pearlie in spite of her two hundred pounds had the soul of a willow wand
The walk in front of Pearlies house was guarded by a row of big trees that cast kindly shadows
The strolling couples used to step gratefully into the embrace of these shadows and from them into other embraces
Pearlie sitting on the porch could see them dimly although they could not see her
She could not help remarking that these strolling couples were strangely lacking in sprightly conversation
Their remarks were but fragmentary disjointed affairs spoken in low tones with a queer tremulous note in them
When they reached the deepest blackest kindliest shadow which fell just before the end of the row of trees the strolling couples almost always stopped and then there came a quick movement and a little smothered cry from the girl and then a sound and then a silence
Pearlie sitting alone on the porch in the dark listened to these things and blushed furiously
Pearlie had never strolled into the kindly shadows with a little beating of the heart and she had never been surprised with a quick arm about her and eager lips pressed warmly against her own
In the daytime Pearlie worked as public stenographer at the Burke Hotel
She rose at seven in the morning and rolled for fifteen minutes and lay on her back and elevated her heels in the air and stood stiffkneed while she touched the floor with her finger tips one hundred times and went without her breakfast
At the end of each month she usually found that she weighed three pounds more than she had the month before
The folks at home never joked with Pearlie about her weight
Even ones family has some respect for a life sorrow
Whenever Pearlie asked that inevitable question of the fat woman Am I as fat as she is
her mother always answered You
Well I should hope not
Youre looking real peaked lately Pearlie
And your blue skirt just ripples in the back its getting so big for you
Of such blessed stuff are mothers made
But if the gods had denied Pearlie all charms of face or form they had been decent enough to bestow on her one gift
Pearlie could cook like an angel no better than an angel for no angel could be a really clever cook and wear those flowing kimonolike sleeves
Theyd get into the soup
Pearlie could take a piece of rump and some suet and an onion and a cup or so of water and evolve a pot roast that you could cut with a fork
She could turn out a surprisingly good cake with surprisingly few eggs all covered with white icing and bearing cunning little jelly figures on its snowy bosom
She could beat up biscuits that fell apart at the lightest pressure revealing little pools of golden butter within
Oh Pearlie could cook
On week days Pearlie rattled the typewriter keys but on Sundays she shooed her mother out of the kitchen
Her mother went protesting faintly Now Pearlie dont fuss so for dinner
You ought to get your rest on Sunday instead of stewing over a hot stove all morning
Hot fiddlesticks ma Pearlie would say cheerily
It aint hot because its a gas stove
And Ill only get fat if I sit around
You put on your blackandwhite and go to church
Call me when youve got as far as your corsets and Ill puff your hair for you in the back
In her capacity of public stenographer at the Burke Hotel it was Pearlies duty to take letters dictated by traveling men and beginning Yours of the 10th at hand
In reply would say



or Enclosed please find etc
As clinching proof of her plainness it may be stated that none of the traveling men not even Max Baum who was so fresh that the girl at the cigar counter actually had to squelch him ever called Pearlie baby doll or tried to make a date with her
Not that Pearlie would ever have allowed them to
But she never had had to reprove them
During pauses in dictation she had a way of peering nearsightedly over her glasses at the dapper welldressed traveling salesman who was rolling off the items on his sale bill
That is a trick which would make the prettiest kind of a girl look owlish
On the night that Sam Miller strolled up to talk to her Pearlie was working late
She had promised to get out a long and intricate bill for Max Baum who travels for Kuhn and Klingman so that he might take the nine oclock evening train
The irrepressible Max had departed with much eclat and clatter and Pearlie was preparing to go home when Sam approached her
Sam had just come in from the Gayety Theater across the street whither he had gone in a vain search for amusement after supper
He had come away in disgust
A soiled soubrette with orangecolored hair and baby socks had swept her practiced eye over the audience and attracted by Sams goodlooking blond head in the second row had selected him as the target of her song
She had run up to the extreme edge of the footlights at the risk of teetering over and had informed Sam through the medium of songto the huge delight of the audience and to Sams redfaced discomfiturethat she liked his smile and he was just her style and just as cute as he could be and just the boy for her
On reaching the chorus she had whipped out a small round mirror and assisted by the calciumlight man in the rear had thrown a wretched little spotlight on Sams head
Ordinarily Sam would not have minded it
But that evening in the vest pocket just over the place where he supposed his heart to be reposed his girls daily letter
They were to be married on Sams return to New York from his first long trip
In the letter near his heart she had written prettily and seriously about traveling men and traveling mens wives and her little code for both
The fragrant girlish grave little letter had caused Sam to sour on the efforts of the soiled soubrette
As soon as possible he had fled up the aisle and across the street to the hotel writingroom
There he had spied Pearlies goodhumored homely face and its contrast with the silly red andwhite countenance of the unlaundered soubrette had attracted his homesick heart
Pearlie had taken some letters from him earlier in the day
Now in his hunger for companionship he strolled up to her desk just as she was putting her typewriter to bed
Gee I This is a lonesome town
said Sam smiling down at her
Pearlie glanced up at him over her glasses
I guess you must be from New York she said
Ive heard a real New Yorker can get bored in Paris
In New York the sky is bluer and the grass is greener and the girls are prettier and the steaks are thicker and the buildings are higher and the streets are wider and the air is finer than the sky or the grass or the girls or the steaks or the air of any place else in the world
Aint they
Oh now protested Sam quit kiddin me
Youd be lonesome for the little old town too if youd been born and dragged up in it and hadnt seen it for four months
New to the road arent you
asked Pearlie
Sam blushed a little
How did you know
Well you generally can tell
They dont know what to do with themselves evenings and they look rebellious when they go into the diningroom
The oldtimers just look resigned
Youve picked up a thing or two around here havent you
I wonder if the time will ever come when Ill look resigned to a hotel dinner after four months of em
Why girl Ive got so I just eat the things that are covered uplike baked potatoes in the shell and soft boiled eggs and baked apples and oranges that I can peel and nuts
Why you poor kid breathed Pearlie her pale eyes fixed on him in motherly pity
You oughtnt to do that
Youll get so thin your girl wont know you
Sam looked up quickly
How in thunderation did you know
Pearlie was pinning on her hat and she spoke succinctly her hatpins between her teeth Youve been here two days now and I notice you dictate all your letters except the longest one and you write that one off in a corner of the writingroom all by yourself with your cigar just glowing like a live coal and you squint up through the smoke and grin to yourself
Say would you mind if I walked home with you
asked Sam
If Pearlie was surprised she was woman enough not to show it
She picked up her gloves and hand bag locked her drawer with a click and smiled her acquiescence
And when Pearlie smiled she was awful
It was a glorious evening in the early summer moonless velvety and warm
As they strolled homeward Sam told her all about the Girl as is the way of traveling men the world over
He told her about the tiny apartment they had taken and how he would be on the road only a couple of years more as this was just a tryout that the firm always insisted on
And they stopped under an arc light while Sam showed her the picture in his watch as is also the way of traveling men since time immemorial
Pearlie made an excellent listener
He was so boyish and so much in love and so pathetically eager to make good with the firm and so happy to have some one in whom to confide
But its a dogs life after all reflected Sam again after the fashion of all traveling men
Any fellow on the road earns his salary these days you bet
I used to think it was all getting up when you felt like it and sitting in the big front window of the hotel smoking a cigar and watching the pretty girls go by
I wasnt wise to the packing and the unpacking and the rotten train service and the grouchy customers and the canceled bills and the grub
Pearlie nodded understandingly
A man told me once that twice a week regularly he dreamed of the way his wife cooked noodlesoup
My folks are German explained Sam
And my mothercan she cook
Well I just dont seem able to get her potato pancakes out of my mind
And her roast beef tasted and looked like roast beef and not like a wet red flannel rag
At this moment Pearlie was seized with a brilliant idea
Tomorrows Sunday
Youre going to Sunday here arent you
Come over and eat your dinner with us
If you have forgotten the taste of real food I can give you a dinner thatll jog your memory
Oh really protested Sam
Youre awfully good but I couldnt think of it
I You neednt be afraid
Im not letting you in for anything
I may be homelier than an English suffragette and I know my lines are all bumps but theres one thing you cant take away from me and thats my cooking hand
I can cook boy in a way to make your mothers Sunday dinner with company expected look like Mrs Newlyweds first attempt at riz biscuits
And I dont mean any disrespect to your mother when I say it
Im going to have noodlesoup and fried chicken and hot biscuits and creamed beans from our own garden and strawberry shortcake with real Hush
shouted Sam
If I aint there youll know that I passed away during the night and you can telephone the clerk to break in my door
The Grim Reaper spared him and Sam came and was introduced to the family and ate
He put himself in a class with Dr Johnson and Ben Brust and Gargantua only that his table manners were better
He almost forgot to talk during the soup and he came back three times for chicken and by the time the strawberry shortcake was half consumed he was looking at Pearlie with a sort of awe in his eyes
That night he came over to say goodbye before taking his train out for Ishpeming
He and Pearlie strolled down as far as the park and back again
I didnt eat any supper said Sam
It would have been sacrilege after that dinner of yours
Honestly I dont know how to thank you being so good to a stranger like me
When I come back next trip I expect to have the Kid with me and I want her to meet you by George
Shes a winner and a pippin but she wouldnt know whether a porterhouse was stewed or frapped
Ill tell her about you you bet
In the meantime if theres anything I can do for you Im yours to command
Pearlie turned to him suddenly
You see that clump of thick shadows ahead of us where those big trees stand in front of our house
Sure replied Sam
Well when we step into that deepest blackest shadow right in front of our porch I want you to reach up and put your arm around me and kiss me on the mouth just once
And when you get back to New York you can tell your girl I asked you to
There broke from him a little involuntary exclamation
It might have been of pity and it might have been of surprise
It had in it something of both but nothing of mirth
And as they stepped into the depths of the soft black shadows he took off his smart straw sailor which was so different from the sailors that the boys in our town wear
And there was in the gesture something of reverence
Millie Whitcomb didnt like the story of the homely heroine after all
She says that a steady diet of such literary fare would give her blue indigestion
Also she objects on the ground that no one got marriedthat is the heroine didnt
And she says that a heroine who does not get married isnt a heroine at all
She thinks she prefers the pinkcheeked goddess kind in the end
XI SUN DRIED There come those times in the life of every woman when she feels that she must wash her hair at once
And then she does it
The feeling may come upon her suddenly without warning at any hour of the day or night or its approach may be slow and insidious so that the victim does not at first realize what it is that fills her with that sensation of unrest
But once in the clutches of the idea she knows no happiness no peace until she has donned a kimono gathered up two bath towels a spray and the green soap and she breathes again only when head dripping she makes for the back yard the sittingroom radiator or the side porch depending on her place of residence and the time of year
Mary Louise was seized with the feeling at ten oclock on a joyous June morning
She tried to fight it off because she had got to that stage in the construction of her story where her hero was beginning to talk and act a little more like a real live man and a little less like a clothing store dummy
By the way they dont seem to be using those pinkandwhite blackmustachioed figures any more
Another good simile gone
Mary Louise had been battling with that hero for a week
He wouldnt make love to the heroine
In vain had Mary Louise striven to instill red blood into his watery veins
He and the beauteous heroine were as far apart as they had been on Page One of the typewritten manuscript
Mary Louise was developing nerves over him
She had bitten her finger nails and twisted her hair into corkscrews over him
She had risen every morning at the chaste hour of seven breakfasted hurriedly tidied the tiny tworoom apartment and sat down in the unromantic morning light to wrestle with her stick of a hero
She had made her heroine a creature of grace wit and loveliness but thus far the hero had not once clasped her to him fiercely or pressed his lips to her hair her eyes her cheeks
Nay as the storywriters would put it he hadnt even devoured her with his gaze
This morning however he had begun to show some signs of life
He was developing possibilities
Whereupon at this critical stage in the storywriting game the hairwashing mania seized Mary Louise
She tried to dismiss the idea
She pushed it out of her mind and slammed the door
It only popped in again
Her fingers wandered to her hair
Her eyes wandered to the June sunshine outside
The hero was left poised arms outstretched and unquenchable lovelight burning in his eyes while Mary Louise mused thus It certainly feels sticky
Its been six weeks at least
And I could sit hereby the windowin the sunand dry it With a jerk she brought her straying fingers away from her hair and her wandering eyes away from the sunshine and her runaway thoughts back to the typewritten page
For three minutes the snap of the little disks crackled through the stillness of the tiny apartment
Then suddenly as though succumbing to an irresistible force Mary Louise rose walked across the room a matter of six steps removing hairpins as she went and shoved aside the screen which hid the stationary washbowl by day
Mary Louise turned on a faucet and held her finger under it while an agonized expression of doubt and suspense overspread her features
Slowly the look of suspense gave way to a smile of beatific content
A sighdeep soulfilling satisfiedwelled up from Mary Louises breast
The water was hot
Half an hour later head swathed turban fashion in a towel Mary Louise strolled over to the window
Then she stopped aghast
In that half hour the sun had slipped just around the corner and was now beating brightly and uselessly against the brick wall a few inches away
Slowly Mary Louise unwound the towel bent double in the contortionistic attitude that women assume on such occasions and watched with melancholy eyes while the drops trickled down to the ends of her hair and fell unsunned to the floor
If only thought Mary Louise bitterly there was such a thing as a back yard in this citya back yard where I could squat on the grass in the sunshine and the breeze Maybe there is
Ill ask the janitor
She bound her hair in the turban again and opened the door
At the far end of the long dim hallway Charlie the janitor was doing something to the floor with a mop and a great deal of sloppy water whistling the while with a shrill abandon that had announced his presence to Mary Louise
Oh Charlie
called Mary Louise
Charlee
Can you come here just a minute
You bet
answered Charlie with the accent on the you and came
Charlie is there a back yard or something where the sun is you knowsome nice grassy place where I can sit and dry my hair and let the breezes blow it
Back yard
grinned Charlie
I guess youre new to N York all right with ground costin a million or so a foot
Not much they aint no back yard unless youd give that name to an ashbarrel and a dump heap or so and a crop of tin cans
I wouldnt invite a goat to set in it
Disappointment curved Mary Louises mouth
It was a lovely enough mouth at any time but when it curved in disappointmentell janitors are but human after all
Tell you what though said Charlie
Ill let you up on the roof
It aint long on grassy spots up there but say breeze
Like a summer resort
On a clear day you can see way over s far s Eight Avenoo
Only for the love of Mike dont blab it to the other women folks in the buildin or Ill have the whole works of em usin the roof for a general sun massage an beauty parlor
Come on
Ill never breathe it to a soul promised Mary Louise solemnly
Oh wait a minute
She turned back into her room appearing again in a moment with something green in her hand
Whats that
asked Charlie suspiciously
Mary Louise speeding down the narrow hallway after Charlie blushed a little
Itits parsley she faltered
Parsley
exploded Charlie
Well what the Well you see
Im from the country explained Mary Louise and in the country at this time of year when you dry your hair in the back yard you get the most wonderful scent of green and growing thingsnot only of flowers you know but of the new things just coming up in the vegetable garden andandwell this parsley happens to be the only really gardeny thing I have so I thought Id bring it along and sniff it once in a while and make believe its the country up there on the roof
Halfway up the perilous little flight of stairs that led to the roof Charlie the janitor turned to gaze down at Mary Louise who was just behind and keeping fearfully out of the way of Charlies heels
Wimmin observed Charlie the janitor is nothin but little girls in long skirts and their hair done up
I know it giggled Mary Louise and sprang up on the roof looking with her towelswathed head like a lady Aladdin leaping from her underground grotto
The two stood there a moment looking up at the blue sky and all about at the June sunshine
If you go up high enough observed Mary Louise the sunshine is almost the same as it is in the country isnt it
I shouldnt wonder said Charlie though Calvary cemetery is about as nears Ill ever get to the country
Say you can set here on this soap box and let your feet hang down
The last janitors wife used to hang her washin up here I guess
Ill leave this door open see
Youre so kind smiled Mary Louise
Kin you blame me
retorted the gallant Charles
And vanished
Mary Louise perched on the soap box unwound her turban draped the damp towel over her shoulders and shook out the wet masses of her hair
Now the average girl shaking out the wet masses of her hair looks like a drowned rat
But Nature had been kind to Mary Louise
She had given her hair that curled in little ringlets when wet and that waved in all the right places when dry
Just now it hung in damp shining strands on either side of her face so that she looked most remarkably like one of those ovalfaced greateyed redlipped women that the old Italian artists were so fond of painting
Below her blazing in the sun lay the great stone and iron city
Mary Louise shook out her hair idly with one hand sniffed her parsley shut her eyes threw back her head and began to sing beating time with her heel against the soap box and forgetting all about the letter that had come that morning stating that it was not from any lack of merit etc
She sang and sniffed her parsley and waggled her hair in the breeze and beat time idly with the heel of her little boot when Holy Cats
exclaimed a mans voice
What is this anyway
A Coney Island concession gone wrong
Mary Louises eyes unclosed in a flash and Mary Louise gazed upon an iratelooking youngish man who wore shabby slippers and no collar with a full dress air
I presume that you are the janitors beautiful daughter growled the collarless man
Well not precisely answered Mary Louise sweetly
Are you the scrubladys stalwart son
Ha
exploded the man
But then all women look alike with their hair down
I ask your pardon though
Not at all replied Mary Louise
For that matter all men look like picked chickens with their collars off
At that the collarless man who until now had been standing on the top step that led up to the roof came slowly forward stepped languidly over a skylight or two draped his handkerchief over a convenient chimney and sat down hugging his long lean legs to him
Nice up here isnt it
he remarked
It was said Mary Louise
Ha
exploded he again
Then Wheres your mirror
he demanded
Mirror
echoed Mary Louise
Certainly
You have the hair the comb the attitude and the general Lorelei effect
Also your singing lured me to your shores
You didnt look lured retorted Mary Louise
You looked lurid
Whats that stuff in your hand
next demanded he
He really was a most astonishingly rude young man
Parsley
Parsley
shouted he much as Charlie had done
Well what the Back home elucidated Mary Louise once more patiently after youve washed your hair you dry it in the back yard sitting on the grass in the sunshine and the breeze
And the garden smells come to youthe nasturtiums and the pansies and the geraniums you know and even that clean grass smell and the pungent vegetable odor and there are ants and bees and butterflies Go on urged the young man eagerly
And Mrs Next Door comes out to hang up a few stockings and a jabot or so and a couple of baby dresses that she has just rubbed through and she calls out to you Washed your hair
Yes you say
It was something awful and I wanted it nice for Tuesday night
But I suppose I wont be able to do a thing with it
And then Mrs Next Door stands there a minute on the clothesreel platform with the wind whipping her skirts about her and the fresh smell of the growing things coming to her
And suddenly she says I guess Ill wash mine too while the babys asleep
The collarless young man rose from his chimney picked up his handkerchief and moved to the chimney just next to Mary Louises soap box
Live here
he asked in his impolite way
If I did not do you think that I would choose this as the one spot in all New York in which to dry my hair
When I said Live here I didnt mean just that
I meant who are you and why are you here and where do you come from and do you sign your real name to your stuff or use a nom de plume
Whyhow did you know
gasped Mary Louise
Give me five minutes more grinned the keeneyed young man and Ill tell you what make your typewriter is and where the last rejection slip came from
Oh
said Mary Louise again
Then you are the scrubladys stalwart son and youve been ransacking my wastebasket
Quite unheeding the collarless man went on And so you thought you could write and you came on to New York you know one doesnt just travel to New York or ride to it or come to it one comes on to New York and now youre not so sure about the writing hm
And back home what did you do
Back home I taught schooland hated it
But I kept on teaching until Id saved five hundred dollars
Every other school maam in the world teaches until she has saved five hundred dollars and then she packs two suitcases and goes to Europe from June until September
But I saved my five hundred for New York
Ive been here six months now and the five hundred has shrunk to almost nothing and if I dont break into the magazines pretty soon Then
Then said Mary Louise with a quaver in her voice Ill have to go back and teach thirtyseven young devils that six times five is thirty put down the naught and carry six and that the French are a gay people fond of dancing and light wines
But Ill scrimp on everything from hairpins to shoes and back again including pretty collars and gloves and hats until Ive saved up another five hundred and then Ill try it all over again because Icanwrite
From the depths of one capacious pocket the inquiring man took a small black pipe from another a bag of tobacco from another a match
The long deft fingers made a brief task of it
I didnt ask you he said after the first puff because I could see that you werent the fool kind that objects
Then with amazing suddenness Know any of the editors
Know them
cried Mary Louise
Know them
If camping on their doorsteps and haunting the office buildings and cajoling and fighting with secretaries and office boys and assistants and things constitutes knowing them then were chums
What makes you think you can write
sneered the thin man
Mary Louise gathered up her brush and comb and towel and parsley and jumped off the soap box
She pointed belligerently at her tormentor with the hand that held the brush
Being the scrubladys stalwart son you wouldnt understand
But I can write
I shant go under
Im going to make this town count me in as the four million and oneth
Sometimes I get so tired of being nobody at all with not even enough cleverness in me to wrest a living from this big city that I long to stand out at the edge of the curbing and take off my hat and wave it and shout Say you four million uncaring people Im Mary Louise Moss from Escanaba Michigan and I like your town and I want to stay here
Wont you please pay some slight attention to me
No one knows Im here except myself and the rent collector
And I put in the rude young man
O you sneered Mary Louise equally rude you dont count
The collarless young man in the shabby slippers smiled a curious little twisted smile
You never can tell he grinned I might
Then quite suddenly he stood up knocked the ash out of his pipe and came over to Mary Louise who was preparing to descend the steep little flight of stairs
Look here Mary Louise Moss from Escanaba Michigan you stop trying to write the slop youre writing now
Stop it
Drop the love tales that are like the stuff that everybody else writes
Stop trying to write about New York
You dont know anything about it
Listen
You get back to work and write about Mrs Next Door and the hairwashing and the vegetable garden and bees and the back yard understand
You write the way you talked to me and then you send your stuff in to Cecil Reeves
Reeves
mocked Mary Louise
Cecil Reeves of The Earth
He wouldnt dream of looking at my stuff
And anyway it really isnt your affair
And began to descend the stairs
Well you know you brought me up here kicking with your heels and singing at the top of your voice
I couldnt work
So its really your fault
Then just as Mary Louise had almost disappeared down the stairway he put his last astonishing question
How often do you wash your hair
he demanded
Well back home confessed Mary Louise every six weeks or so was enough but Not here put in the rude young man briskly
Never
Thats all very well for the country but it wont do in the city
Once a week at least and on the roof
Cleanliness demands it
But if Im going back to the country replied Mary Louise it wont be necessary
But youre not calmly said the collarless young man just as Mary Louise vanished from sight
Down at the other end of the hallway on Mary Louises floor Charlie the janitor was doing something to the windows now with a rag and a pail of water
Get it dry
he called out sociably
Yes thank you answered Mary Louise and turned to enter her own little apartment
Then hesitatingly she came back to Charlies window
Therethere was a man up therea very tall very thin very rude verythat is rather nice youngish oldish man in slippers and no collar
I wonder Oh him
snorted Charlie
He dont show himself onct in a blue moon
None of the other tenants knows hes up there
Has the whole top floor to himself and shuts himself up there for weeks at a time writin books or some such truck
That guy he owns the building
Owns the building
said Mary Louise faintly
Why he lookedhe looked Sure grinned Charlie
Thats him
Names ReevesCecil Reeves
Say aint that a divil of a name
XII WHERE THE CAR TURNS AT 18TH This will be a homing pigeon story
Though I send it ever so farthough its destination be the office of a homeandfireside magazine or one of the kind with a French story in the back it will return to me
After each flight its feathers will be a little more rumpled its wings more weary its course more wavering until battered spent broken it will flutter to rest in the waste basket
And yet though its message may never be delivered it must be sent becausewell because You know where the car turns at Eighteenth
There you see a glaringly attractive billboard poster
It depicts groups of smiling whiteclad men standing on tropical shores with waving palms overhead and a glimpse of blue sea in the distance
The wording beneath the picture runs something like this Young men wanted
An unusual opportunity for travel education and advancement
Good pay
No expenses
When the car turns at Eighteenth and I see that I remember Eddie Houghton back home
And when I remember Eddie Houghton I see red
The day after Eddie Houghton finished high school he went to work
In our town we dont take a job
We accept a position
Our paper had it that Edwin Houghton had accepted a position as clerk and assistant chemist at the Kunz drugstore where he would take up his new duties Monday
His new duties seemed at first to consist of opening the store in the morning sweeping out and whizzing about town on a bicycle with an unnecessarily insistent bell delivering prescriptions which had been telephoned for
But by the time the summer had really set in Eddie was installed back of the soda fountain
There never was anything better looking than Eddie Houghton in his white duck coat
He was one of those misleadingly gold and pink and white men
I say misleadingly because you usually associate pinkandwhiteness with such words as sissy and mollycoddle
Eddie was neither
He had played quarterback every year from his freshman year and he could putt the shot and cut classes with the best of em
But in that white duck coat with the braiding and frogs he had any musicalcomedy whiteflannel tenor lieutenant whose duty it is to march down to the edge of the footlights snatch out his sword and warble about his countrys flag looking like a flatnosed bluegummed Igorrote
Kunzs soda water receipts swelled to double their usual size and the girls complexions were something awful that summer
Ive known Nellie Donovan to take as many as three ice cream sodas and two phosphates a day when Eddie was mixing
He had a way of throwing in a goodnatured smile and an easy flow of conversation with every drink
While indulging in a little airy persiflage the girls had a great little trick of pursing their mouths into rosebud shapes over their soda straws and casting their eyes upward at Eddie
They all knew the trick and its value so that at night Eddies dreams were haunted by whole rows of rosily pursed lips and seas of upturned adoring eyes
Of course we all noticed that on those rare occasions when Josie Morehouse came into Kunzs her glass was heaped higher with ice cream than that of any of the other girls and that Eddies usually easy flow of talk was interspersed with certain stammerings and stutterings
But Josie didnt come in often
She had a lot of dignity for a girl of eighteen
Besides she was taking the teachers examinations that summer when the other girls were playing tennis and drinking sodas
Eddie really hated the soda water end of the business as every soda clerk in the world does
But he went about it goodnaturedly
He really wanted to learn the drug business but the boss knew he had a drawing card and insisted that Eddie go right on concocting faerie queens and strawberry sundaes and nectars and Kunzs specials
One Saturday when he happened to have on hand an oversupply of bananas that would have spoiled over Sunday he invented a mess and called it the Eddie Extra and the girls swarmed on it like flies around a honey pot
That kind of thing would have spoiled most boys
But Eddie had a sensible mother
On those nights when he used to come home nauseated with dealing out chop suey sundaes and orangeades and saying that there was no future for a fellow in our dead little hole his mother would give him something rather special for supper and set him hoeing and watering the garden
So Eddie stuck to his job and waited and all the time he was saying with a melting look to the last silly little girl who was drinking her third soda Somebody looks mighty sweet in pink today or while he was doping tomorrows ball game with one of the boys who dropped in for a cigar he was thinking of bigger things and longing for a mansize job
The mansize job loomed up before Eddies dazzled eyes when he least expected it
It was at the close of a particularly hot day when it seemed to Eddie that every one in town had had everything from birch beer to peach ice cream
On his way home to supper he stopped at the postoffice with a handful of letters that old man Kunz had given him to mail
His mother had told him that they would have corn out of their own garden for supper that night and Eddie was in something of a hurry
He and his mother were great pals
In one corner of the dim little postoffice lobby a man was busily tacking up posters
The whitewashed walls bloomed with them
They were gay attractivelooking posters done in red and blue and green and after Eddie had dumped his mail into the slot and had called out Hello Jake
to the stamp clerk whose back was turned to the window he strolled idly over to where the man was putting the finishing touches to his work
The man was dressed in a sailor suit of blue with a picturesque silk scarf knotted at his hairy chest
He went right on tacking posters
They certainly were attractive pictures
Some showed groups of stalwart immaculately clad young gods lolling indolently on tropical shores with a splendor of palms overhead and a sparkling blue sea in the distance
Others depicted a group of whiteclad men wading kneedeep in the surf as they laughingly landed a cutter on the sandy beach
There was a particularly fascinating one showing two barefooted young chaps on a waveswept raft engaged in that delightfully perilous task known as signaling
Another showed the keeneyed gunners busy about the big guns
Eddie studied them all
The man finished his task and looked up quite casually
Hello kid he said
Hello answered Eddie
ThenThats some picture gallery youre giving us
The man in the sailor suit fell back a pace or two and surveyed his work with a critical but satisfied eye
Pitchers he said dont do it justice
Weve opened a recruiting office here
Looking for young men with brains and muscle and ambition
Its a great chance
We dont get to these here little towns much
He placed a handbill in Eddies hand
Eddie glanced down at it sheepishly
Ive heard he said that its a hard life
The man in the sailor suit threw back his head and laughed displaying a great deal of hairy throat and chest
Hard
he jeered and slapped one of the gaycolored posters with the back of his hand
You see that
Well it aint a bit exaggerated
Not a bit
I ought to know
Its the only life for a young man especially for a guy in a little town
Theres no chance here for a bright young man and if he goes to the city what does he get
The citys jam full of kids that flock there in the spring and fall looking for jobs and thinking the citys sittin up waitin for em
And where do they land
In the dime lodging houses thats where
In the navy you see the world and it dont cost you a cent
A guy is a fool to bury himself alive in a hole like this
You could be seeing the world traveling by sea from port to port from country to country from ocean to ocean amid everchanging scenery and climatic conditions to see and study the habits and conditions of the strange races It rolled off his tongue with fascinating glibness
Eddie glanced at the folder in his hand
I always did like the water he said
Sure agreed the hairy man heartily
What young feller dont
Ill tell you what
Come on over to the office with me and Ill show you some real stuff
Its my supper time hesitated Eddie
I guess Id better not Oh supper laughed the man
You come on and have supper with me kid
Eddies pink cheeks went three shades pinker
Gee
Thatd be great
But my motherthat isshe The man in the sailor suit laughed againa laugh with a sting in it
A great big feller like you aint tied to your mas apron strings are you
Not much Im not
retorted Eddie
Ill telephone her when I get to your hotel thats what Ill do
But they were such fascinating things those new booklets and the man had such marvelous tales to tell that Eddie forgot trifles like supper and waiting mothers
There were pictures taken on board ship showing frolics and ball games and minstrel shows and glee clubs and the men at mess and each sailor sleeping snug as a bug in his hammock
There were other pictures showing foreign scenes and strange ports
Eddies tea grew cold and his apple pie and cheese lay untasted on his plate
Now me said the recruiting officer Im a married man
But my wife she wouldnt have it no other way
No sir
Shell be in the navy herself Ill bet when women vote
Why before I joined the navy I didnt know whether Guam was a vegetable or an island and Culebra wasnt in my geography
Now
Why now Im as much at home in Porto Rico as I am in San Francisco
Im as well acquainted in Valparaiso as I am in Vermont and Ive run around Cairo Egypt until I know it better than Cairo Illinois
Its the only way to see the world
You travel by sea from port to port from country to country from ocean to ocean amid everchanging scenery and climatic conditions to see and study the And Eddie forgot that it was Wednesday night which was the prescription clerks night off forgot that the boss was awaiting his return that he might go home to his own supper forgot his mother and her little treat of green corn out of the garden forgot everything in the wonder of this mans tales of people and scenes such as he never dreamed could exist outside of a Jack London story
Now and then Eddie interrupted with a Yes but that grew more and more infrequent until finally they ceased altogether
Eddies mansize job had come
When we heard the news we all dropped in at the drug store to joke with him about it
We had a good deal to say about rolling gaits and bellshaped trousers and anchors and sea serpents tattooed on the arm
One of the boys scored a hit by slapping his dime down on the soda fountain marble and bellowing for rum and salt horse
Some one started to tease the little Morehouse girl about sailors having sweethearts in every port but when they saw the look in her eyes they changed their mind and stopped
Its funny how a girl of twenty is a woman when a man of twenty is a boy
Eddie dished out the last of his chocolate ice cream sodas and cherry phosphates and root beers while the girls laughingly begged him to bring them back kimonos from China and scarves from the Orient and Eddie promised laughing too but with a faroff eager look in his eyes
When the time came for him to go there was quite a little bodyguard of us ready to escort him down to the depot
We picked up two or three more outside ORourkes pool room and a couple more from the benches outside the hotel
Eddie walked ahead with his mother
I have said that Mrs Houghton was a sensible woman
She was never more so than now
Any other mother would have gone into hysterics and begged the recruiting officer to let her boy off
But she knew better
Still I think Eddie felt some uncomfortable pangs when he looked at her set face
On the way to the depot we had to pass the Agassiz School where Josie Morehouse was substituting second reader for the Wilson girl who was sick
She was standing in the window as we passed
Eddie took off his cap and waved to her and she returned the wave as well as she could without having the children see her
That would never have done seeing that she was the teacher and substituting at that
But when we turned the corner we noticed that she was still standing at the window and leaning out just a bit even at the risk of being indiscreet
When the 1015 pulled out Eddie stood on the bottom step with his cap off looking I cant tell you how boyish and straight and clean and handsome with his lips parted and his eyes very bright
The hairychested recruiting officer stood just beside him and suffered by contrast
There was a bedlam of goodbyes and last messages and goodnatured badinage but Eddies mothers eyes never left his face until the train disappeared around the curve in the track
Well they got a new boy at Kunzsa sandyhaired youth with pimples and no knack at mixing and we got out of the habit of dropping in there although those fall months were unusually warm
It wasnt long before we began to get postcardspictures of the naval training station and the gymnasium and of model camps and of drills and of Eddie in his uniform
His mother insisted on calling it his sailor suit as though he were a little boy
One day Josie Morehouse came over to Mrs Houghtons with a group picture in her hand
She handed it to Eddies mother without comment
Mrs Houghton looked at it eagerly her eye selecting her own boy from the group as unerringly as a mother bird finds her nest in the forest
Oh Eddies better looking than that
she cried with a tremulous little laugh
How funny those pants make them look dont they
And his mouth isnt that way at all
Eddie always had the sweetest mouth from the time he was a baby
Lets see some of these other boys
Whywhy Then she fell silent scanning those other faces
Presently Josie bent over her and looked too and the brows of both women knitted in perplexity
They looked for a long long minute and the longer they looked the more noticeable became the cluster of fine little wrinkles that had begun to form about Mrs Houghtons eyes
When finally they looked up it was to gaze at one another questioningly
Those other boys faltered Eddies mother theythey dont look like Eddie do they
I mean No they dont agreed Josie
They look older and they have such queerlooking eyes and jaws and foreheads
But then she finished with mock cheerfulness you can never tell in those silly kodak pictures
Eddies mother studied the card again and sighed gently
I hope she said that Eddie wont get into bad company
After that our postal cards ceased
I wish that there was some way of telling this story so that the end wouldnt come in the middle
But there is none
In our town we know the news before the paper comes out and we only read it to verify what we have heard
So that long before the paper came out in the middle of the afternoon we had been horrified by the news of Eddie Houghtons desertion and suicide
We stopped one another on Main Street to talk about it and recall how boyish and handsome he had looked in his white duck coat and on that last day just as the 10I5 pulled out
It dont seem hardly possible does it
we demanded of each other
But when Eddies mother brought out the letters that had come after our postal cards had ceased we understood
And when they brought him home and we saw him for the last time all those of us who had gone to school with him and to dances and sleigh rides and hayrack parties and picnics and when we saw the look on his facethe look of one who walking in a sunny path has stumbled upon something horrible and uncleanwe forgave him his neglect of us we forgave him desertion forgave him the taking of his own life forgave him the look that he had brought into his mothers eyes
There had never been anything extraordinary about Eddie Houghton
He had had his faults and virtues and good and bad sides just like other boys of his age
Heoh I am using too many words when one slang phrase will express it
Eddie had been just a nice young kid
I think the worst thing he had ever said was Damn
perhaps
If he had sworn it was with clean oaths calculated to relieve the mind and feelings
But the men that he shipped with during that year or moreI am sure that he had never dreamed that such men were
He had never stood on the curbing outside a recruiting office on South State Street in the old levee district and watched that tragic panorama move bythose nightmare faces drinkmarred vicescarred ruined
I know that he had never seen such faces in all his clean hardworking young boys life spent in our prosperous little country town
I am certain that he had never heard such words as came from the lips of his fellow seamengreat mouthfilling soulsearing wordswords unclean nauseating unspeakable and yet spoken
I dont say that Eddie Houghton had not taken his drink now and then
There were certain dark rumors in our town to the effect that favored ones who dropped into Kunzs more often than seemed needful were privileged to have a thimbleful of something choice in the prescription room back of the partition at the rear of the drug store
But that was the most devilish thing that Eddie had ever done
I dont say that all crews are like that one
Perhaps he was unfortunate in falling in with that one
But it was an Eastern trip and every port was a Port Said
Eddie Houghtons thoughts were not these mens thoughts his actions were not their actions his practices were not their practices
To Eddie Houghton a Chinese woman in a sampan on the water front at Shanghai was something picturesque something about which to write home to his mother and to Josie
To those other men she was possible prey
Those other men saw that he was different and they pestered him
They illtreated him when they could and made his life a hellish thing
Men do those things and people do not speak of it
I dont know all the things that he suffered
But in his mind day by day grew the great overwhelming desire to get away from it allfrom this horrible life that was such a dreadful mistake
I think that during the long night watches his mind was filled with thoughts of our decent little townof his mothers kitchen with its Wednesday and Saturday scent of newmade breadof the shady front porch with its purple clematisof the smooth front yard which it was his Saturday duty to mow that it might be trim and sightly for Sundayof the boys and girls who used to drop in at the drug storethose cleareyed innocently coquettish giggling blushing girls in their middy blouses and white skirts their slender arms and throats browned from tennis and boating their eyes smiling into his as they sat perched at the fountain after a hot set of tennisthose slim clean young boys sunbrowned laughing their talk all of swimming and boating and tennis and girls
He did not realize that it was desertionthat thought that grew and grew in his mind
In it there was nothing of faithlessness to his country
He was only trying to be true to himself and to the things that his mother had taught him
He only knew that he was deadly sick of these sights of disease and vice
He only knew that he wanted to get awayback to his own decent life with the decent people to whom he belonged
And he went
He went as a child runs home when it had tripped and fallen in the mud not dreaming of wrongdoing or punishment
The first few hundred miles on the train were a dream
But finally Eddie found himself talking to a mana big lean blueeyed western man who regarded Eddie with kindly puzzled eyes
Eddie found himself telling his story in a disjointed breathless sort of way
When he had finished the man uncrossed his long lean legs took his pipe out of his mouth and sat up
There was something of horror in his eyes as he sat looking at Eddie
Why kid he said at last
Youre deserting
Youll get the pen dont you know that if they catch you
Where you going
Going
repeated Eddie
Going
Why Im going home of course
Then I dont see what youre gaining said the man because theyll sure get you there
Eddie sat staring at the man for a dreadful minute
In that minute the last of his glorious youth and ambition and zest of life departed from him
He got off the train at the next town and the western man offered him some money which Eddie declined with all his oldtime sweetness of manner
It was rather a large town with a great many busy people in it
Eddie went to a cheap hotel and took a room and sat on the edge of the thin little bed and stared at the car pet
It was a dusty red carpet
In front of the bureau many feet had worn a hole so that the bare boards showed through with a tuft of ragged red fringe edging them
Eddie Houghton sat and stared at the worn place with a curiously blank look on his face
He sat and stared and saw many things
He saw his mother for one thing sitting on the porch with a gingham apron over her light dress waiting for him to come home to supper he saw his own rooma typical boys room with camera pictures and blue prints stuck in the sides of the dresser mirror and the boxing gloves on the wall and his tennis racquet with one string broken he had always meant to have that racquet restrung and his track shoes relics of high school days flung in one corner and his gaycolored school pennants draped to form a fresco and the cush ion that Josie Morenouse had made for him two years ago at Christmas time and the dainty white bedspread that he fussed about because he said it was too sissy for a boys roomoh I cant tell you what he saw as he sat and stared at that worn place in the carpet
But pretty soon it began to grow dark and at last he rose keeping his fascinated eyes still on the bare spot walked to the door opened it and backed out queerly still keeping his eyes on the spot
He was back again in fifteen minutes with a bottle in his hand
He should have known better than to choose carbolic being a druggist but all men are a little mad at such times
He lay down at the edge of the thin little bed that was little more than a pallet and he turned his face toward the bare spot that could just be seen in the gathering gloom
And when he raised the bottle to his lips the oldtime sweetness of his smile illumined his face
Where the car turns at Eighteenth Street there is a big glaring billboard poster showing a group of stalwart young men in white ducks lolling on shores of tropical splendor with palms waving overhead and a glimpse of blue sea in the distance
The wording beneath it runs something like this Young men wanted
An unusual opportunity for travel education and advancement
Good pay
No expenses
When I see that sign I think of Eddie Houghton back home
And when I think of Eddie Houghton I see red
