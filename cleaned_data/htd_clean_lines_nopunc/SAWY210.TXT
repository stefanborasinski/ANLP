TOM SAWYER ABROAD CHAPTER I TOM SEEKS NEW ADVENTURES DO you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures
I mean the adventures we had down the river and the time we set the darky Jim free and Tom got shot in the leg
No he wasnt
It only just pisoned him for more
That was all the effect it had
You see when we three came back up the river in glory as you may say from that long travel and the village received us with a torchlight procession and speeches and everybody hurrahd and shouted it made us heroes and that was what Tom Sawyer had always been hankering to be
For a while he WAS satisfied
Everybody made much of him and he tilted up his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it
Some called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler and that just swelled him up fit to bust
You see he laid over me and Jim considerable because we only went down the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat but Tom went by the steamboat both ways
The boys envied me and Jim a good deal but land
they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM
Well I dont know maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadnt been for old Nat Parsons which was postmaster and powerful long and slim and kind o goodhearted and silly and baldheaded on account of his age and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see
For as much as thirty years hed been the only man in the village that had a reputation  I mean a reputation for being a traveler and of course he was mortal proud of it and it was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years he had told about that journey over a million times and enjoyed it every time
And now comes along a boy not quite fifteen and sets everybody admiring and gawking over HIS travels and it just give the poor old man the high strikes
It made him sick to listen to Tom and to hear the people say My land
Did you ever
My goodness sakes alive
and all such things but he couldnt pull away from it any more than a fly thats got its hind leg fast in the molasses
And always when Tom come to a rest the poor old cretur would chip in on HIS same old travels and work them for all they were worth but they were pretty faded and didnt go for much and it was pitiful to see
And then Tom would take another innings and then the old man again  and so on and so on for an hour and more each trying to beat out the other
You see Parsons travels happened like this When he first got to be postmaster and was green in the busi ness there come a letter for somebody he didnt know and there wasnt any such person in the village
Well he didnt know what to do nor how to act and there the letter stayed and stayed week in and week out till the bare sight of it gave him a conniption
The postage wasnt paid on it and that was another thing to worry about
There wasnt any way to collect that ten cents and he reckond the govment would hold him respon sible for it and maybe turn him out besides when they found he hadnt collected it
Well at last he couldnt stand it any longer
He couldnt sleep nights he couldnt eat he was thinned down to a shadder yet he dasnt ask anybodys advice for the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let the govment know about the letter
He had the letter buried under the floor but that did no good if he happened to see a person standing over the place itd give him the cold shivers and loaded him up with suspicions and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark and then he would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place
Of course people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads and whispering because the way he was looking and acting they judged he had killed somebody or done something terrible they didnt know what and if he had been a stranger they wouldve lynched him
Well as I was saying it got so he couldnt stand it any longer so he made up his mind to pull out for Washington and just go to the President of the United States and make a clean breast of the whole thing not keeping back an atom and then fetch the letter out and lay it before the whole govment and say Now there she is  do with me what youre a mind to though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a family that must starve and yet hadnt had a thing to do with it which is the whole truth and I can swear to it
So he did it
He had a little wee bit of steamboat ing and some stagecoaching but all the rest of the way was horseback and it took him three weeks to get to Washington
He saw lots of land and lots of vil lages and four cities
He was gone most eight weeks and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back
His travels made him the greatest man in all that region and the most talked about and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country and from over in the Illinois bottoms too just to look at him  and there theyd stand and gawk and hed gabble
You never see anything like it
Well there wasnt any way now to settle which was the greatest traveler some said it was Nat some said it was Tom
Everybody allowed that Nat had seen the most longitude but they had to give in that what ever Tom was short in longitude he had made up in latitude and climate
It was about a standoff so both of them had to whoop up their dangerous adventures and try to get ahead THAT way
That bulletwound in Toms leg was a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck against but he bucked the best he could and at a disadvantage too for Tom didnt set still as hed orter done to be fair but always got up and sauntered around and worked his limp while Nat was painting up the adventure that HE had in Washington for Tom never let go that limp when his leg got well but prac ticed it nights at home and kept it good as new right along
Nats adventure was like this I dont know how true it is maybe he got it out of a paper or some where but I will say this for him that he DID know how to tell it
He could make anybodys flesh crawl and hed turn pale and hold his breath when he told it and sometimes women and girls got so faint they couldnt stick it out
Well it was this way as near as I can remember He come aloping into Washington and put up his horse and shoved out to the Presidents house with his letter and they told him the President was up to the Capitol and just going to start for Philadelphia  not a minute to lose if he wanted to catch him
Nat most dropped it made him so sick
His horse was put up and he didnt know what to do
But just then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack and he see his chance
He rushes out and shouts A half a dollar if you git me to the Capitol in half an hour and a quarter extra if you do it in twenty minutes
Done
says the darky
Nat he jumped in and slammed the door and away they went aripping and atearing over the roughest road a body ever see and the racket of it was some thing awful
Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on for life and death but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in the air and the bottom fell out and when it come down Nats feet was on the ground and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he couldnt keep up with the hack
He was horrible scared but he laid into his work for all he was worth and hung tight to the armloops and made his legs fairly fly
He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop and so did the crowds along the street for they could see his legs spinning along under the coach and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through the windows and he was in awful danger but the more they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and shouted Dont you fret Ise gwine to git you dah in time boss Is gwine to do it sho
for you see he thought they were all hurrying him up and of course he couldnt hear any thing for the racket he was making
And so they went ripping along and everybody just petrified to see it and when they got to the Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made and everybody said so
The horses laid down and Nat dropped all tuck ered out and he was all dust and rags and barefooted but he was in time and just in time and caught the President and give him the letter and everything was all right and the President give him a free pardon on the spot and Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of one because he could see that if he hadnt had the hack he wouldnta got there in time nor anywhere near it
It WAS a powerful good adventure and Tom Sawyer had to work his bulletwound mighty lively to hold his own against it
Well by and by Toms glory got to paling down graduly on account of other things turning up for the people to talk about  first a horserace and on top of that a house afire and on top of that the circus and on top of that the eclipse and that started a revival same as it always does and by that time there wasnt any more talk about Tom so to speak and you never see a person so sick and disgusted
Pretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day out and when I asked him what WAS he in such a state about he said it most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away and him getting older and older and no wars breaking out and no way of making a name for himself that he could see
Now that is the way boys is always thinking but he was the first one I ever heard come out and say it
So then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated and pretty soon he struck it and offered to take me and Jim in
Tom Sawyer was always free and generous that way
Theres aplenty of boys thats mighty good and friendly when YOUVE got a good thing but when a good thing happens to come their way they dont say a word to you and try to hog it all
That warnt ever Tom Sawyers way I can say that for him
Theres plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you when youve got an apple and beg the core off of you but when theyve got one and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them a core one time they say thank you most to death but there aint agoing to be no core
But I notice they always git come up with all you got to do is to wait
Well we went out in the woods on the hill and Tom told us what it was
It was a crusade
Whats a crusade
I says
He looked scornful the way hes always done when he was ashamed of a person and says Huck Finn do you mean to tell me you dont know what a crusade is
No says I I dont
And I dont care to nuther
Ive lived till now and done without it and had my health too
But as soon as you tell me Ill know and thats soon enough
I dont see any use in finding out things and clogging up my head with them when I maynt ever have any occasion to use em
There was Lance Williams he learned how to talk Choctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him
Now then whats a crusade
But I can tell you one thing before you begin if its a patentright theres no money in it
Bill Thompson he  Patentright
says he
I never see such an idiot
Why a crusade is a kind of war
I thought he must be losing his mind
But no he was in real earnest and went right on perfectly cam
A crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from the paynim
Which Holy Land
Why the Holy Land  there aint but one
What do we want of it
Why cant you understand
Its in the hands of the paynim and its our duty to take it away from them
How did we come to let them git hold of it
We didnt come to let them git hold of it
They always had it
Why Tom then it must belong to them dont it
Why of course it does
Who said it didnt
I studied over it but couldnt seem to git at the right of it no way
I says Its too many for me Tom Sawyer
If I had a farm and it was mine and another person wanted it would it be right for him to  Oh shucks
you dont know enough to come in when it rains Huck Finn
It aint a farm its entirely different
You see its like this
They own the land just the mere land and thats all they DO own but it was our folks our Jews and Christians that made it holy and so they havent any business to be there defiling it
Its a shame and we ought not to stand it a minute
We ought to march against them and take it away from them
Why it does seem to me its the most mixedup thing I ever see
Now if I had a farm and another person  Dont I tell you it hasnt got anything to do with farming
Farming is business just common lowdown business thats all it is its all you can say for it but this is higher this is religious and totally different
Religious to go and take the land away from people that owns it
Certainly its always been considered so
Jim he shook his head and says Mars Tom I reckon deys a mistake about it somers  dey mos sholy is
Is religious myself en I knows plenty religious people but I haint run across none dat acts like dat
It made Tom hot and he says Well its enough to make a body sick such mulletheaded ignorance
If either of youd read any thing about history youd know that Richard Cur de Loon and the Pope and Godfrey de Bulleyn and lots more of the most noblehearted and pious people in the world hacked and hammered at the paynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their land away from them and swum neckdeep in blood the whole time  and yet heres a couple of sapheaded country yahoos out in the backwoods of Missouri set ting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs of it than they did
Talk about cheek
Well of course that put a more different light on it and me and Jim felt pretty cheap and ignorant and wished we hadnt been quite so chipper
I couldnt say nothing and Jim he couldnt for a while then he says Well den I reckon its all right becase ef dey didnt know dey aint no use for po ignorant folks like us to be trying to know en so ef its our duty we got to go en tackle it en do de bes we can
Same time I feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars Tom
De hard part gwine to be to kill folks dat a body haint been quainted wid and dat haint done him no harm
Dats it you see
Ef we wuz to go mongst em jist we three en say wes hungry en ast em for a bite to eat why maybe deys jist like yuther people
Dont you reckon dey is
Why DEYD give it I know dey would en den  Then what
Well Mars Tom my idea is like dis
It aint no use we CANT kill dem po strangers dat aint doin us no harm till weve had practice  I knows it perfectly well Mars Tom  deed I knows it perfectly well
But ef we takes a axe or two jist you en me en Huck en slips acrost de river tonight arter de moons gone down en kills dat sick famly dats over on the Sny en burns dey house down en  Oh you make me tired
says Tom
I dont want to argue any more with people like you and Huck Finn thats always wandering from the subject and aint got any more sense than to try to reason out a thing thats pure theology by the laws that protect real estate
Now thats just where Tom Sawyer warnt fair
Jim didnt mean no harm and I didnt mean no harm
We knowed well enough that he was right and we was wrong and all we was after was to get at the HOW of it and that was all and the only reason he couldnt explain it so we could understand it was because we was ignorant  yes and pretty dull too I aint deny ing that but land
that aint no crime I should think
But he wouldnt hear no more about it  just said if we had tackled the thing in the proper spirit he would a raised a couple of thousand knights and put them in steel armor from head to heel and made me a lieu tenant and Jim a sutler and took the command himself and brushed the whole paynim outfit into the sea like flies and come back across the world in a glory like sunset
But he said we didnt know enough to take the chance when we had it and he wouldnt ever offer it again
And he didnt
When he once got set you couldnt budge him
But I didnt care much
I am peaceable and dont get up rows with people that aint doing nothing to me
I allowed if the paynim was satisfied I was and we would let it stand at that
Now Tom he got all that notion out of Walter Scotts book which he was always reading
And it WAS a wild notion because in my opinion he never couldve raised the men and if he did as like as not he wouldve got licked
I took the book and read all about it and as near as I could make it out most of the folks that shook farming to go crusading had a mighty rocky time of it
CHAPTER II
THE BALLOON ASCENSION WELL Tom got up one thing after another but they all had tender spots about em somewheres and he had to shove em aside
So at last he was about in despair
Then the St Louis papers begun to talk a good deal about the balloon that was going to sail to Europe and Tom sort of thought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like but couldnt make up his mind
But the papers went on talking and so he allowed that maybe if he didnt go he mightnt ever have another chance to see a balloon and next he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to see it and that decided him of course
He wasnt going to have Nat Parsons coming back brag ging about seeing the balloon and him having to listen to it and keep quiet
So he wanted me and Jim to go too and we went
It was a noble big balloon and had wings and fans and all sorts of things and wasnt like any balloon you see in pictures
It was away out toward the edge of town in a vacant lot corner of Twelfth street and there was a big crowd around it making fun of it and making fun of the man  a lean pale feller with that soft kind of moonlight in his eyes you know  and they kept saying it wouldnt go
It made him hot to hear them and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they was animals and blind but some day they would find they had stood face to face with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations and was too dull to know it and right here on this spot their own children and grandchildren would build a monument to him that would outlast a thousand years but his name would outlast the monument
And then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again and yell at him and ask him what was his name before he was married and what he would take to not do it and what was his sisters cats grandmothers name and all the things that a crowd says when theyve got hold of a feller that they see they can plague
Well some things they said WAS funny  yes and mighty witty too I aint denying that  but all the same it warnt fair nor brave all them people pitching on one and they so glib and sharp and him without any gift of talk to answer back with
But good land
what did he want to sass back for
You see it couldnt do him no good and it was just nuts for them
They HAD him you know
But that was his way
I reckon he couldnt help it he was made so I judge
He was a good enough sort of cretur and hadnt no harm in him and was just a genius as the papers said which wasnt his fault
We cant all be sound weve got to be the way were made
As near as I can make out geniuses think they know it all and so they wont take peoples advice but always go their own way which makes everybody forsake them and despise them and that is perfectly natural
If they was humbler and listened and tried to learn it would be better for them
The part the professor was in was like a boat and was big and roomy and had watertight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of things in and a body could sit on them and make beds on them too
We went aboard and there was twenty people there snoop ing around and examining and old Nat Parsons was there too
The professor kept fussing around getting ready and the people went ashore drifting out one at a time and old Nat he was the last
Of course it wouldnt do to let him go out behind US
We mustnt budge till he was gone so we could be last ourselves
But he was gone now so it was time for us to follow
I heard a big shout and turned around  the city was dropping from under us like a shot
It made me sick all through I was so scared
Jim turned gray and couldnt say a word and Tom didnt say nothing but looked excited
The city went on dropping down and down and down but we didnt seem to be doing nothing but just hang in the air and stand still
The houses got smaller and smaller and the city pulled itself together closer and closer and the men and wagons got to looking like ants and bugs crawling around and the streets like threads and cracks and then it all kind of melted together and there wasnt any city any more it was only a big scar on the earth and it seemed to me a body could see up the river and down the river about a thousand miles though of course it wasnt so much
By and by the earth was a ball  just a round ball of a dull color with shiny stripes wriggling and winding around over it which was rivers
The Widder Douglas always told me the earth was round like a ball but I never took any stock in a lot of them superstitions o hers and of course I paid no attention to that one because I could see my self that the world was the shape of a plate and flat
I used to go up on the hill and take a look around and prove it for myself because I reckon the best way to get a sure thing on a fact is to go and examine for yourself and not take anybodys sayso
But I had to give in now that the widder was right
That is she was right as to the rest of the world but she warnt right about the part our village is in that part is the shape of a plate and flat I take my oath
The professor had been quiet all this time as if he was asleep but he broke loose now and he was mighty bitter
He says something like this Idiots
They said it wouldnt go and they wanted to examine it and spy around and get the secret of it out of me
But I beat them
Nobody knows the secret but me
Nobody knows what makes it move but me and its a new power  a new power and a thousand times the strongest in the earth
Steams foolishness to it
They said I couldnt go to Europe
To Europe
Why theres power aboard to last five years and feed for three months
They are fools
What do they know about it
Yes and they said my airship was flimsy
Why shes good for fifty years
I can sail the skies all my life if I want to and steer where I please though they laughed at that and said I couldnt
Couldnt steer
Come here boy well see
You press these buttons as I tell you
He made Tom steer the ship all about and every which way and learnt him the whole thing in nearly no time and Tom said it was perfectly easy
He made him fetch the ship down most to the earth and had him spin her along so close to the Illinois prairies that a body could talk to the farmers and hear every thing they said perfectly plain and he flung out printed bills to them that told about the balloon and said it was going to Europe
Tom got so he could steer straight for a tree till he got nearly to it and then dart up and skin right along over the top of it
Yes and he showed Tom how to land her and he done it firstrate too and set her down in the prairies as soft as wool
But the minute we started to skip out the professor says No you dont
and shot her up in the air again
It was awful
I begun to beg and so did Jim but it only give his temper a rise and he begun to rage around and look wild out of his eyes and I was scared of him
Well then he got on to his troubles again and mourned and grumbled about the way he was treated and couldnt seem to git over it and especially peoples saying his ship was flimsy
He scoffed at that and at their saying she warnt simple and would be always getting out of order
Get out of order
That graveled him he said that she couldnt any more get out of order than the solar sister
He got worse and worse and I never see a person take on so
It give me the cold shivers to see him and so it did Jim
By and by he got to yelling and screaming and then he swore the world shouldnt ever have his secret at all now it had treated him so mean
He said he would sail his balloon around the globe just to show what he could do and then he would sink it in the sea and sink us all along with it too
Well it was the awfulest fix to be in and here was night coming on
He give us something to eat and made us go to the other end of the boat and he laid down on a locker where he could boss all the works and put his old pepperbox revolver under his head and said if any body come fooling around there trying to land her he would kill him
We set scrunched up together and thought consider able but didnt say much  only just a word once in a while when a body had to say something or bust we was so scared and worried
The night dragged along slow and lonesome
We was pretty low down and the moonshine made everything soft and pretty and the farmhouses looked snug and homeful and we could hear the farm sounds and wished we could be down there but laws
we just slipped along over them like a ghost and never left a track
Away in the night when all the sounds was late sounds and the air had a late feel and a late smell too  about a twooclock feel as near as I could make out  Tom said the professor was so quiet this time he must be asleep and wed better  Better what
I says in a whisper and feeling sick all over because I knowed what he was thinking about
Better slip back there and tie him and land the ship he says
I says No sir
Don you budge Tom Sawyer
And Jim  well Jim was kind o gasping he was so scared
He says Oh Mars Tom DONT
Ef you teches him wes gone  wes gone sho
I aint gwine anear him not for nothin in dis worl
Mars Tom hes plumb crazy
Tom whispers and says  Thats WHY weve got to do something
If he wasnt crazy I wouldnt give shucks to be anywhere but here you couldnt hire me to get out  now that Ive got used to this balloon and over the scare of being cut loose from the solid ground  if he was in his right mind
But its no good politics sailing around like this with a person thats out of his head and says hes going round the world and then drown us all
Weve GOT to do something I tell you and do it before he wakes up too or we maynt ever get another chance
Come
But it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of it and we said we wouldnt budge
So Tom was for slipping back there by himself to see if he couldnt get at the steeringgear and land the ship
We begged and begged him not to but it warnt no use so he got down on his hands and knees and begun to crawl an inch at a time we aholding our breath and watching
After he got to the middle of the boat he crept slower than ever and it did seem like years to me
But at last we see him get to the professors head and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell in his face and listen
Then we see him begin to inch along again toward the professors feet where the steeringbuttons was
Well he got there all safe and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons but he knocked down something that made a noise and we see him slump down flat an soft in the bottom and lay still
The professor stirred and says Whats that
But everybody kept dead still and quiet and he begun to mutter and mumble and nestle like a person thats going to wake up and I thought I was going to die I was so worried and scared
Then a cloud slid over the moon and I most cried I was so glad
She buried herself deeper and deeper into the cloud and it got so dark we couldnt see Tom
Then it began to sprinkle rain and we could hear the professor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather
We was afraid every minute he would touch Tom and then we would be goners and no help but Tom was already on his way back and when we felt his hands on our knees my breath stopped sudden and my heart fell down mongst my other works because I couldnt tell in the dark but it might be the professor
which I thought it WAS
Dear
I was so glad to have him back that I was just as near happy as a person could be that was up in the air that way with a deranged man
You cant land a balloon in the dark and so I hoped it would keep on raining for I didnt want Tom to go meddling any more and make us so awful uncomfortable
Well I got my wish
It drizzled and drizzled along the rest of the night which wasnt long though it did seem so and at daybreak it cleared and the world looked mighty soft and gray and pretty and the forests and fields so good to see again and the horses and cattle standing sober and thinking
Next the sun come a blazing up gay and splendid and then we began to feel rusty and stretchy and first we knowed we was all asleep
CHAPTER III
TOM EXPLAINS WE went to sleep about four oclock and woke up about eight
The professor was setting back there at his end looking glum
He pitched us some breakfast but he told us not to come abaft the midship compass
That was about the middle of the boat
Well when you are sharpset and you eat and satisfy yourself everything looks pretty different from what it done before
It makes a body feel pretty near com fortable even when he is up in a balloon with a genius
We got to talking together
There was one thing that kept bothering me and by and by I says Tom didnt we start east
Yes
How fast have we been going
Well you heard what the professor said when he was raging round
Sometimes he said we was making fifty miles an hour sometimes ninety sometimes a hundred said that with a gale to help he could make three hundred any time and said if he wanted the gale and wanted it blowing the right direction he only had to go up higher or down lower to find it
Well then its just as I reckoned
The professor lied
Why
Because if we was going so fast we ought to be past Illinois oughtnt we
Certainly
Well we aint
Whats the reason we aint
I know by the color
Were right over Illinois yet
And you can see for yourself that Indiana aint in sight
I wonder whats the matter with you Huck
You know by the COLOR
Yes of course I do
Whats the color got to do with it
Its got everything to do with it
Illinois is green Indiana is pink
You show me any pink down here if you can
No sir its green
Indiana PINK
Why what a lie
It aint no lie Ive seen it on the map and its pink
You never see a person so aggravated and disgusted
He says Well if I was such a numbskull as you Huck Finn I would jump over
Seen it on the map
Huck Finn did you reckon the States was the same color outofdoors as they are on the map
Tom Sawyer whats a map for
Aint it to learn you facts
Of course
Well then hows it going to do that if it tells lies
Thats what I want to know
Shucks you muggins
It dont tell lies
It dont dont it
No it dont
All right then if it dont there aint no two States the same color
You git around THAT if you can Tom Sawyer
He see I had him and Jim see it too and I tell you I felt pretty good for Tom Sawyer was always a hard person to git ahead of
Jim slapped his leg and says I tell YOU
dats smart dats right down smart
Aint no use Mars Tom he got you DIS time sho
He slapped his leg again and says My LAN but it was smart one
I never felt so good in my life and yet I didnt know I was saying anything much till it was out
I was just mooning along perfectly careless and not expecting anything was going to happen and never THINKING of such a thing at all when all of a sudden out it came
Why it was just as much a surprise to me as it was to any of them
It was just the same way it is when a person is munching along on a hunk of cornpone and not thinking about anything and all of a sudden bites into a dimond
Now all that HE knows first off is that its some kind of gravel hes bit into but he dont find out its a dimond till he gits it out and brushes off the sand and crumbs and one thing or another and has a look at it and then hes surprised and glad  yes and proud too though when you come to look the thing straight in the eye he aint entitled to as much credit as he would a been if hed been HUNTING dimonds
You can see the difference easy if you think it over
You see an accident that way aint fairly as big a thing as a thing thats done apurpose
Anybody could find that dimond in that cornpone but mind you its got to be somebody thats got THAT KIND OF A CORNPONE
Thats where that fellers credit comes in you see and thats where mine comes in
I dont claim no great things  I dont reckon I could a done it again  but I done it that time thats all I claim
And I hadnt no more idea I could do such a thing and warnt any more thinking about it or trying to than you be this minute
Why I was just as cam a body couldnt be any camer and yet all of a sudden out it come
Ive often thought of that time and I can remember just the way everything looked same as if it was only last week
I can see it all beautiful rolling country with woods and fields and lakes for hundreds and hundreds of miles all around and towns and villages scattered everywheres under us here and there and yonder and the professor mooning over a chart on his little table and Toms cap flopping in the rigging where it was hung up to dry
And one thing in particular was a bird right alongside not ten foot off going our way and trying to keep up but losing ground all the time and a railroad train doing the same thing down there sliding among the trees and farms and pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and now and then a little puff of white and when the white was gone so long you had almost forgot it you would hear a little faint toot and that was the whistle
And we left the bird and the train both behind WAY behind and done it easy too
But Tom he was huffy and said me and Jim was a couple of ignorant blatherskites and then he says Suppose theres a brown calf and a big brown dog and an artist is making a picture of them
What is the MAIN thing that that artist has got to do
He has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the minute you look at them haint he
Of course
Well then do you want him to go and paint BOTH of them brown
Certainly you dont
He paints one of them blue and then you cant make no mistake
Its just the same with the maps
Thats why they make every State a different color it aint to deceive you its to keep you from deceiving yourself
But I couldnt see no argument about that and neither could Jim
Jim shook his head and says Why Mars Tom if you knowed what chuckle heads dem painters is youd wait a long time before youd fetch one er DEM in to back up a fac
Is gwine to tell you den you kin see for youself
I see one of em apaintin away one day down in ole Hank Wilsons back lot en I went down to see en he was paintin dat old brindle cow wid de near horn gone  you knows de one I means
En I ast him what hes paintin her for en he say when he git her painted de pictures wuth a hundred dollars
Mars Tom he could a got de cow fer fifteen en I tole him so
Well sah if youll blieve me he jes shuck his head dat painter did en went on adobbin
Bless you Mars Tom DEY dont know nothin
Tom lost his temper
I notice a person most always does thats got laid out in an argument
He told us to shut up and maybe wed feel better
Then he see a town clock away off down yonder and he took up the glass and looked at it and then looked at his silver turnip and then at the clock and then at the turnip again and says Thats funny
That clocks near about an hour fast
So he put up his turnip
Then he see another clock and took a look and it was an hour fast too
That puzzled him
Thats a mighty curious thing he says
I dont understand it
Then he took the glass and hunted up another clock and sure enough it was an hour fast too
Then his eyes began to spread and his breath to come out kinder gaspy like and he says Gerreat Scott its the LONGITUDE
I says considerably scared Well whats been and gone and happened now
Why the thing thats happened is that this old bladder has slid over Illinois and Indiana and Ohio like nothing and this is the east end of Pennsylvania or New York or somewheres around there
Tom Sawyer you dont mean it
Yes I do and its dead sure
Weve covered about fifteen degrees of longitude since we left St Louis yesterday afternoon and them clocks are right
Weve come close on to eight hundred miles
I didnt believe it but it made the cold streaks trickle down my back just the same
In my experi ence I knowed it wouldnt take much short of two weeks to do it down the Mississippi on a raft
Jim was working his mind and studying
Pretty soon he says Mars Tom did you say dem clocks uz right
Yes theyre right
Aint yo watch right too
Shes right for St Louis but shes an hour wrong for here
Mars Tom is you tryin to let on dat de time aint de SAME everywheres
No it aint the same everywheres by a long shot
Jim looked distressed and says It grieves me to hear you talk like dat Mars Tom Is right down ashamed to hear you talk like dat arter de way yous been raised
Yassir itd break yo Aunt Pollys heart to hear you
Tom was astonished
He looked Jim over wonder ing and didnt say nothing and Jim went on Mars Tom who put de people out yonder in St Louis
De Lord done it
Who put de people here whar we is
De Lord done it
Ain dey bofe his children
Cose dey is
WELL den
is he gwine to SCRIMINATE twixt em
Scriminate
I never heard such ignorance
There aint no discriminating about it
When he makes you and some more of his children black and makes the rest of us white what do you call that
Jim see the pint
He was stuck
He couldnt answer
Tom says He does discriminate you see when he wants to but this case HERE aint no discrimination of his its mans
The Lord made the day and he made the night but he didnt invent the hours and he didnt distribute them around
Man did that
Mars Tom is dat so
Man done it
Certainly
Who tole him he could
Nobody
He never asked
Jim studied a minute and says Well dat do beat me
I wouldnt a tuck no sich resk
But some people aint scared o nothin
Dey bangs right ahead DEY dont care what happens
So den deys allays an hours diffunce everywhah Mars Tom
An hour
No
Its four minutes difference for every degree of longitude you know
Fifteen of ems an hour thirty of ems two hours and so on
When its one clock Tuesday morning in England its eight oclock the night before in New York
Jim moved a little way along the locker and you could see he was insulted
He kept shaking his head and muttering and so I slid along to him and patted him on the leg and petted him up and got him over the worst of his feelings and then he says Mars Tom talkin sich talk as dat
Choosday in one place en Monday in tother bofe in the same day
Huck dis aint no place to joke  up here whah we is
Two days in one day
How you gwine to get two days inter one day
Cant git two hours inter one hour kin you

is you gwine to tell me its dis year in one place en las year in tother bofe in de identical same minute
Its de beatenest rubbage
I cant stan it  I cant stan to hear tell bout it
Then he begun to shiver and turn gray and Tom says NOW whats the matter
Whats the trouble
Jim could hardly speak but he says Mars Tom you aint jokin en its SO
No Im not and it is so
Jim shivered again and says Den dat Monday could be de las day en dey wouldnt be no las day in England en de dead wouldnt be called
We mustnt go over dah Mars Tom
Please git him to turn back I wants to be whah  All of a sudden we see something and all jumped up and forgot everything and begun to gaze
Tom says Aint that the  He catched his breath then says It IS sure as you live
Its the ocean
That made me and Jim catch our breath too
Then we all stood petrified but happy for none of us had ever seen an ocean or ever expected to
Tom kept muttering Atlantic Ocean  Atlantic
Land dont it sound great
And thats IT  and WE are looking at it  we
Why its just too splendid to believe
Then we see a big bank of black smoke and when we got nearer it was a city  and a monster she was too with a thick fringe of ships around one edge and we wondered if it was New York and begun to jaw and dispute about it and first we knowed it slid from under us and went flying behind and here we was out over the very ocean itself and going like a cyclone
Then we woke up I tell you
We made a break aft and raised a wail and begun to beg the professor to turn back and land us but he jerked out his pistol and motioned us back and we went but nobody will ever know how bad we felt
The land was gone all but a little streak like a snake away off on the edge of the water and down under us was just ocean ocean ocean  millions of miles of it heaving and pitching and squirming and white sprays blowing from the wavetops and only a few ships in sight wallowing around and laying over first on one side and then on tother and sticking their bows under and then their sterns and before long there warnt no ships at all and we had the sky and the whole ocean all to ourselves and the roomiest place I ever see and the lonesomest
CHAPTER IV
STORM AND it got lonesomer and lonesomer
There was the big sky up there empty and awful deep and the ocean down there without a thing on it but just the waves
All around us was a ring where the sky and the water come together yes a monstrous big ring it was and we right in the dead center of it  plumb in the center
We was racing along like a prairie fire but it never made any difference we couldnt seem to git past that center no way
I couldnt see that we ever gained an inch on that ring
It made a body feel creepy it was so curious and unaccountable
Well everything was so awful still that we got to talking in a very low voice and kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and less talky till at last the talk ran dry altogether and we just set there and thunk as Jim calls it and never said a word the longest time
The professor never stirred till the sun was overhead then he stood up and put a kind of triangle to his eye and Tom said it was a sextant and he was taking the sun to see whereabouts the balloon was
Then he ciphered a little and looked in a book and then he begun to carry on again
He said lots of wild things and among others he said he would keep up this hundredmile gait till the middle of tomorrow after noon and then hed land in London
We said we would be humbly thankful
He was turning away but he whirled around when we said that and give us a long look of his blackest kind  one of the maliciousest and suspiciousest looks I ever see
Then he says You want to leave me
Dont try to deny it
We didnt know what to say so we held in and didnt say nothing at all
He went aft and set down but he couldnt seem to git that thing out of his mind
Every now and then he would rip out something about it and try to make us answer him but we dasnt
It got lonesomer and lonesomer right along and it did seem to me I couldnt stand it
It was still worse when night begun to come on
By and by Tom pinched me and whispers Look
I took a glance aft and see the professor taking a whet out of a bottle
I didnt like the looks of that
By and by he took another drink and pretty soon he begun to sing
It was dark now and getting black and stormy
He went on singing wilder and wilder and the thunder begun to mutter and the wind to wheeze and moan among the ropes and altogether it was awful
It got so black we couldnt see him any more and wished we couldnt hear him but we could
Then he got still but he warnt still ten minutes till we got suspicious and wished he would start up his noise again so we could tell where he was
By and by there was a flash of lightning and we see him start to get up but he staggered and fell down
We heard him scream out in the dark They dont want to go to England
All right Ill change the course
They want to leave me
I know they do
Well they shall  and NOW
I most died when he said that
Then he was still again  still so long I couldnt bear it and it did seem to me the lightning wouldnt EVER come again
But at last there was a blessed flash and there he was on his hands and knees crawling and not four feet from us
My but his eyes was terrible
He made a lunge for Tom and says Overboard YOU go
but it was already pitchdark again and I couldnt see whether he got him or not and Tom didnt make a sound
There was another long horrible wait then there was a flash and I see Toms head sink down outside the boat and disappear
He was on the ropeladder that dangled down in the air from the gunnel
The professor let off a shout and jumped for him and straight off it was pitchdark again and Jim groaned out Po Mars Tom hes a goner
and made a jump for the professor but the professor warnt there
Then we heard a couple of terrible screams and then another not so loud and then another that was way below and you could only JUST hear it and I heard Jim say Po Mars Tom
Then it was awful still and I reckon a person could a counted four thousand before the next flash come
When it come I see Jim on his knees with his arms on the locker and his face buried in them and he was crying
Before I could look over the edge it was all dark again and I was glad because I didnt want to see
But when the next flash come I was watching and down there I see somebody aswinging in the wind on the ladder and it was Tom
Come up
I shouts come up Tom
His voice was so weak and the wind roared so I couldnt make out what he said but I thought he asked was the professor up there
I shouts No hes down in the ocean
Come up
Can we help you
Of course all this in the dark
Huck who is you hollerin at
Im hollerin at Tom
Oh Huck how kin you act so when you know po Mars Tom  Then he let off an awful scream and flung his head and his arms back and let off another one because there was a white glare just then and he had raised up his face just in time to see Toms as white as snow rise above the gunnel and look him right in the eye
He thought it was Toms ghost you see
Tom clumb aboard and when Jim found it WAS him and not his ghost he hugged him and called him all sorts of loving names and carried on like he was gone crazy he was so glad
Says I What did you wait for Tom
Why didnt you come up at first
I dasnt Huck
I knowed somebody plunged down past me but I didnt know who it was in the dark
It could a been you it could a been Jim
That was the way with Tom Sawyer  always sound
He warnt coming up till he knowed where the pro fessor was
The storm let go about this time with all its might and it was dreadful the way the thunder boomed and tore and the lightning glared out and the wind sung and screamed in the rigging and the rain come down
One second you couldnt see your hand before you and the next you could count the threads in your coat sleeve and see a whole wide desert of waves pitching and tossing through a kind of veil of rain
A storm like that is the loveliest thing there is but it aint at its best when you are up in the sky and lost and its wet and lonesome and theres just been a death in the family
We set there huddled up in the bow and talked low about the poor professor and everybody was sorry for him and sorry the world had made fun of him and treated him so harsh when he was doing the best he could and hadnt a friend nor nobody to encourage him and keep him from brooding his mind away and going deranged
There was plenty of clothes and blankets and everything at the other end but we thought wed ruther take the rain than go meddling back there
CHAPTER V LAND WE tried to make some plans but we couldnt come to no agreement
Me and Jim was for turning around and going back home but Tom allowed that by the time daylight come so we could see our way we would be so far toward England that we might as well go there and come back in a ship and have the glory of saying we done it
About midnight the storm quit and the moon come out and lit up the ocean and we begun to feel com fortable and drowsy so we stretched out on the lockers and went to sleep and never woke up again till sunup
The sea was sparkling like dimonds and it was nice weather and pretty soon our things was all dry again
We went aft to find some breakfast and the first thing we noticed was that there was a dim light burning in a compass back there under a hood
Then Tom was disturbed
He says You know what that means easy enough
It means that somebody has got to stay on watch and steer this thing the same as he would a ship or shell wander around and go wherever the wind wants her to
Well I says whats she been doing since  er  since we had the accident
Wandering he says kinder troubled  wander ing without any doubt
Shes in a wind now thats blowing her south of east
We dont know how long thats been going on either
So then he pinted her east and said he would hold her there till we rousted out the breakfast
The pro fessor had laid in everything a body could want he couldnt a been better fixed
There wasnt no milk for the coffee but there was water and everything else you could want and a charcoal stove and the fixings for it and pipes and cigars and matches and wine and liquor which warnt in our line and books and maps and charts and an accordion and furs and blankets and no end of rubbish like brass beads and brass jewelry which Tom said was a sure sign that he had an idea of visiting among savages
There was money too
Yes the professor was well enough fixed
After breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to steer and divided us all up into fourhour watches turn and turn about and when his watch was out I took his place and he got out the professors papers and pens and wrote a letter home to his aunt Polly tell ing her everything that had happened to us and dated it IN THE WELKIN APPROACHING ENGLAND and folded it together and stuck it fast with a red wafer and directed it and wrote above the direction in big writing FROM TOM SAWYER THE ERRONORT and said it would stump old Nat Parsons the postmaster when it come along in the mail
I says Tom Sawyer this aint no welkin its a balloon
Well now who SAID it was a welkin smarty
Youve wrote it on the letter anyway
What of it
That dont mean that the balloons the welkin
Oh I thought it did
Well then what is a welkin
I see in a minute he was stuck
He raked and scraped around in his mind but he couldnt find noth ing so he had to say I dont know and nobody dont know
Its just a word and its a mighty good word too
There aint many that lays over it
I dont believe theres ANY that does
Shucks
I says
But what does it MEAN
 thats the pint 
I dont know what it means I tell you
Its a word that people uses for  for  well its orna mental
They dont put ruffles on a shirt to keep a person warm do they
Course they dont
But they put them ON dont they
Yes
All right then that letter I wrote is a shirt and the welkins the ruffle on it
I judged that that would gravel Jim and it did
Now Mars Tom it aint no use to talk like dat en moreover its sinful
You knows a letter aint no shirt en dey aint no ruffles on it nuther
Dey aint no place to put em on you cant put em on and dey wouldnt stay ef you did
Oh DO shut up and wait till somethings started that you know something about
Why Mars Tom sholy you cant mean to say I dont know about shirts when goodness knows Is toted home de washin ever sence  I tell you this hasnt got anything to do with shirts
I only  Why Mars Tom you said yoself dat a letter  Do you want to drive me crazy
Keep still
I only used it as a metaphor
That word kinder bricked us up for a minute
Then Jim says  rather timid because he see Tom was get ting pretty tetchy Mars Tom what is a metaphor
A metaphors a  well its a  a  a metaphors an illustration
He see THAT didnt git home so he tried again
When I say birds of a feather flocks together its a metaphorical way of saying  But dey DONT Mars Tom
No sir deed dey dont
Dey aint no feathers dats more alike den a bluebird en a jaybird but ef you waits till you catches dem birds together youll  Oh give us a rest
You cant get the simplest little thing through your thick skull
Now dont bother me any more
Jim was satisfied to stop
He was dreadful pleased with himself for catching Tom out
The minute Tom begun to talk about birds I judged he was a goner because Jim knowed more about birds than both of us put together
You see he had killed hundreds and hundreds of them and thats the way to find out about birds
Thats the way people does that writes books about birds and loves them so that theyll go hungry and tired and take any amount of trouble to find a new bird and kill it
Their name is ornitholo gers and I could have been an ornithologer myself because I always loved birds and creatures and I started out to learn how to be one and I see a bird setting on a limb of a high tree singing with its head tilted back and its mouth open and before I thought I fired and his song stopped and he fell straight down from the limb all limp like a rag and I run and picked him up and he was dead and his body was warm in my hand and his head rolled about this way and that like his neck was broke and there was a little white skin over his eyes and one little drop of blood on the side of his head and laws
I couldnt see nothing more for the tears and I haint never murdered no creature since that warnt doing me no harm and I aint going to
But I was aggravated about that welkin
I wanted to know
I got the subject up again and then Tom explained the best he could
He said when a person made a big speech the newspapers said the shouts of the people made the welkin ring
He said they always said that but none of them ever told what it was so he allowed it just meant outdoors and up high
Well that seemed sensible enough so I was satisfied and said so
That pleased Tom and put him in a good humor again and he says Well its all right then and well let bygones be bygones
I dont know for certain what a welkin is but when we land in London well make it ring anyway and dont you forget it
He said an erronort was a person who sailed around in balloons and said it was a mighty sight finer to be Tom Sawyer the Erronort than to be Tom Sawyer the Traveler and we would be heard of all round the world if we pulled through all right and so he wouldnt give shucks to be a traveler now
Toward the middle of the afternoon we got every thing ready to land and we felt pretty good too and proud and we kept watching with the glasses like Columbus discovering America
But we couldnt see nothing but ocean
The afternoon wasted out and the sun shut down and still there warnt no land any wheres
We wondered what was the matter but reckoned it would come out all right so we went on steering east but went up on a higher level so we wouldnt hit any steeples or mountains in the dark
It was my watch till midnight and then it was Jims but Tom stayed up because he said ship captains done that when they was making the land and didnt stand no regular watch
Well when daylight come Jim give a shout and we jumped up and looked over and there was the land sure enough  land all around as far as you could see and perfectly level and yaller
We didnt know how long wed been over it
There warnt no trees nor hills nor rocks nor towns and Tom and Jim had took it for the sea
They took it for the sea in a dead cam but we was so high up anyway that if it had been the sea and rough it would a looked smooth all the same in the night that way
We was all in a powerful excitement now and grabbed the glasses and hunted everywheres for Lon don but couldnt find hair nor hide of it nor any other settlement  nor any sign of a lake or a river either
Tom was clean beat
He said it warnt his notion of England he thought England looked like America and always had that idea
So he said we better have breakfast and then drop down and inquire the quickest way to London
We cut the breakfast pretty short we was so impatient
As we slanted along down the weather began to moderate and pretty soon we shed our furs
But it kept ON moder ating and in a precious little while it was most too moderate
We was close down now and just blistering
We settled down to within thirty foot of the land  that is it was land if sand is land for this wasnt any thing but pure sand
Tom and me clumb down the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs and it felt amazing good  that is the stretching did but the sand scorched our feet like hot embers
Next we see somebody coming and started to meet him but we heard Jim shout and looked around and he was fairly dancing and making signs and yelling
We couldnt make out what he said but we was scared anyway and begun to heel it back to the balloon
When we got close enough we understood the words and they made me sick Run
Run fo yo life
Hits a lion I kin see him thoo de glass
Run boys do please heel it de bes you kin
Hes busted outen de menagerie en dey aint nobody to stop him
It made Tom fly but it took the stiffening all out of my legs
I could only just gasp along the way you do in a dream when theres a ghost gaining on you
Tom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and waited for me and as soon as I got a foothold on it he shouted to Jim to soar away
But Jim had clean lost his head and said he had forgot how
So Tom shinned along up and told me to follow but the lion was arriving fetching a most ghastly roar with every lope and my legs shook so I dasnt try to take one of them out of the rounds for fear the other one would give way under me
But Tom was aboard by this time and he started the balloon up a little and stopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten or twelve feet above ground
And there was the lion aripping around under me and roaring and springing up in the air at the ladder and only missing it about a quarter of an inch it seemed to me
It was delicious to be out of his reach perfectly delicious and made me feel good and thank ful all up one side but I was hanging there helpless and couldnt climb and that made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable all down the other
It is most seldom that a person feels so mixed like that and it is not to be recommended either
Tom asked me what hed better do but I didnt know
He asked me if I could hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lion behind
I said I could if he didnt go no higher than he was now but if he went higher I would lose my head and fall sure
So he said Take a good grip and he started
Dont go so fast I shouted
It makes my head swim
He had started like a lightning express
He slowed down and we glided over the sand slower but still in a kind of sickening way for it IS uncomfortable to see things sliding and gliding under you like that and not a sound
But pretty soon there was plenty of sound for the lion was catching up
His noise fetched others
You could see them coming on the lope from every direc tion and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of them under me jumping up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at each other and so we went skimming along over the sand and these fellers doing what they could to help us to not forgit the occasion and then some other beasts come without an invite and they started a regular riot down there
We see this plan was a mistake
We couldnt ever git away from them at this gait and I couldnt hold on forever
So Tom took a think and struck another idea
That was to kill a lion with the pepperbox revolver and then sail away while the others stopped to fight over the carcass
So he stopped the balloon still and done it and then we sailed off while the fuss was going on and come down a quarter of a mile off and they helped me aboard but by the time we was out of reach again that gang was on hand once more
And when they see we was really gone and they couldnt get us they sat down on their hams and looked up at us so kind of disappointed that it was as much as a person could do not to see THEIR side of the matter
CHAPTER VI
ITS A CARAVAN I WAS so weak that the only thing I wanted was a chance to lay down so I made straight for my lockerbunk and stretched myself out there
But a body couldnt get back his strength in no such oven as that so Tom give the command to soar and Jim started her aloft
We had to go up a mile before we struck comfort able weather where it was breezy and pleasant and just right and pretty soon I was all straight again
Tom had been setting quiet and thinking but now he jumps up and says I bet you a thousand to one I know where we are
Were in the Great Sahara as sure as guns
He was so excited he couldnt hold still but I wasnt
I says Well then wheres the Great Sahara
In Eng land or in Scotland
Taint in either its in Africa
Jims eyes bugged out and he begun to stare down with no end of interest because that was where his originals come from but I didnt more than half be lieve it
I couldnt you know it seemed too awful far away for us to have traveled
But Tom was full of his discovery as he called it and said the lions and the sand meant the Great Desert sure
He said he could a found out before we sighted land that we was crowding the land some wheres if he had thought of one thing and when we asked him what he said These clocks
Theyre chronometers
You al ways read about them in sea voyages
One of them is keeping Grinnage time and the other is keeping St Louis time like my watch
When we left St Louis it was four in the afternoon by my watch and this clock and it was ten at night by this Grinnage clock
Well at this time of the year the sun sets at about seven oclock
Now I noticed the time yesterday evening when the sun went down and it was halfpast five oclock by the Grinnage clock and half past 11 AM by my watch and the other clock
You see the sun rose and set by my watch in St Louis and the Grin nage clock was six hours fast but weve come so far east that it comes within less than half an hour of set ting by the Grinnage clock now and Im away out  more than four hours and a half out
You see that meant that we was closing up on the longitude of Ireland and would strike it before long if we was pinted right  which we wasnt
No sir weve been awandering  wandering way down south of east and its my opinion we are in Africa
Look at this map
You see how the shoulder of Africa sticks out to the west
Think how fast weve traveled if we had gone straight east we would be long past England by this time
You watch for noon all of you and well stand up and when we cant cast a shadow well find that this Grinnage clock is coming mighty close to marking twelve
Yes sir I think were in Africa and its just bully
Jim was gazing down with the glass
He shook his head and says Mars Tom I reckon deys a mistake somers
haint seen no niggers yit
Thats nothing they dont live in the desert
What is that way off yonder
Gimme a glass
He took a long look and said it was like a black string stretched across the sand but he couldnt guess what it was
Well I says I reckon maybe youve got a chance now to find out whereabouts this balloon is because as like as not that is one of these lines here thats on the map that you call meridians of longi tude and we can drop down and look at its number and  Oh shucks Huck Finn I never see such a lunk head as you
Did you spose theres meridians of longitude on the EARTH
Tom Sawyer theyre set down on the map and you know it perfectly well and here they are and you can see for yourself
Of course theyre on the map but thats nothing there aint any on the GROUND
Tom do you know that to be so
Certainly I do
Well then that maps a liar again
I never see such a liar as that map
He fired up at that and I was ready for him and Jim was warming his opinion too and next minute wed a broke loose on another argument if Tom hadnt dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands like a maniac and sing out Camels
 Camels
So I grabbed a glass and Jim too and took a look but I was disappointed and says Camels your granny theyre spiders
Spiders in a desert you shad
Spiders walking in a procession
You dont ever reflect Huck Finn and I reckon you really havent got anything to reflect WITH
Dont you know were as much as a mile up in the air and that that string of crawlers is two or three miles away
Spiders good land
Spiders as big as a cow
Perhaps youd like to go down and milk one of em
But theyre camels just the same
Its a caravan thats what it is and its a mile long
Well then lets go down and look at it
I dont believe in it and aint going to till I see it and know it
All right he says and give the command Lower away
As we come slanting down into the hot weather we could see that it was camels sure enough plodding along an everlasting string of them with bales strapped to them and several hundred men in long white robes and a thing like a shawl bound over their heads and hanging down with tassels and fringes and some of the men had long guns and some hadnt and some was riding and some was walking
And the weatherJ well it was just roasting
And how slow they did creep along
We swooped down now all of a sudden and stopped about a hundred yards over their heads
The men all set up a yell and some of them fell flat on their stomachs some begun to fire their guns at us and the rest broke and scampered every which way and so did the camels
We see that we was making trouble so we went up again about a mile to the cool weather and watched them from there
It took them an hour to get together and form the procession again then they started along but we could see by the glasses that they wasnt pay ing much attention to anything but us
We poked along looking down at them with the glasses and by and by we see a big sand mound and something like people the other side of it and there was something like a man laying on top of the mound that raised his head up every now and then and seemed to be watch ing the caravan or us we didnt know which
As the caravan got nearer he sneaked down on the other side and rushed to the other men and horses  for that is what they was  and we see them mount in a hurry and next here they come like a house afire some with lances and some with long guns and all of them yell ing the best they could
They come atearing down on to the caravan and the next minute both sides crashed together and was all mixed up and there was such another popping of guns as you never heard and the air got so full of smoke you could only catch glimpses of them struggling together
There must a been six hundred men in that battle and it was terrible to see
Then they broke up into gangs and groups fighting tooth and nail and scurrying and scampering around and laying into each other like everything and whenever the smoke cleared a little you could see dead and wounded people and camels scattered far and wide and all about and camels racing off in every direction
At last the robbers see they couldnt win so their chief sounded a signal and all that was left of them broke away and went scampering across the plain
The last man to go snatched up a child and carried it off in front of him on his horse and a woman run screaming and begging after him and followed him away off across the plain till she was separated a long ways from her people but it warnt no use and she had to give it up and we see her sink down on the sand and cover her face with her hands
Then Tom took the hellum and started for that yahoo and we come awhizzing down and made a swoop and knocked him out of the saddle child and all and he was jarred considerable but the child wasnt hurt but laid there working its hands and legs in the air like a tumblebug thats on its back and cant turn over
The man went staggering off to overtake his horse and didnt know what had hit him for we was three or four hundred yards up in the air by this time
We judged the woman would go and get the child now but she didnt
We could see her through the glass still setting there with her head bowed down on her knees so of course she hadnt seen the perform ance and thought her child was clean gone with the man
She was nearly a half a mile from her people so we thought we might go down to the child which was about a quarter of a mile beyond her and snake it to her before the caravan people could git to us to do us any harm and besides we reckoned they had enough business on their hands for one while anyway with the wounded
We thought wed chance it and we did
We swooped down and stopped and Jim shinned down the ladder and fetched up the kid which was a nice fat little thing and in a noble good humor too considering it was just out of a battle and been tumbled off of a horse and then we started for the mother and stopped back of her and tolerable near by and Jim slipped down and crept up easy and when he was close back of her the child googood the way a child does and she heard it and whirled and fetched a shriek of joy and made a jump for the kid and snatched it and hugged it and dropped it and hugged Jim and then snatched off a gold chain and hung it around Jims neck and hugged him again and jerked up the child again asobbing and glorifying all the time and Jim he shoved for the ladder and up it and in a minute we was back up in the sky and the woman was staring up with the back of her head between her shoulders and the child with its arms locked around her neck
And there she stood as long as we was in sight asailing away in the sky
CHAPTER VII
TOM RESPECTS THE FLEA NOON
says Tom and so it was
His shadder was just a blot around his feet
We looked and the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve the difference didnt amount to nothing
So Tom said London was right north of us or right south of us one or tother and he reckoned by the weather and the sand and the camels it was north and a good many miles north too as many as from New York to the city of Mexico he guessed
Jim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the fastest thing in the world unless it might be some kinds of birds  a wild pigeon maybe or a railroad
But Tom said he had read about railroads in England going nearly a hundred miles an hour for a little ways and there never was a bird in the world that could do that  except one and that was a flea
A flea
Why Mars Tom in de fust place he aint a bird strickly speakin  He aint a bird eh
Well then what is he
I dont rightly know Mars Tom but I speck hes only jist a animal
No I reckon dat wont do nuther he aint big enough for a animal
He mus be a bug
Yassir dats what he is hes a bug
I bet he aint but let it go
Whats your second place
Well in de second place birds is creturs dat goes a long ways but a flea dont
He dont dont he
Come now what IS a long distance if you know
Why its miles and lots of em  anybody knows dat
Cant a man walk miles
Yassir he kin
As many as a railroad
Yassir if you give him time
Cant a flea
Well  I spose so  ef you gives him heaps of time
Now you begin to see dont you that DISTANCE aint the thing to judge by at all its the time it takes to go the distance IN that COUNTS aint it
Well hit do look sorter so but I wouldnt a blieved it Mars Tom
Its a matter of PROPORTION thats what it is and when you come to gauge a things speed by its size wheres your bird and your man and your railroad alongside of a flea
The fastest man cant run more than about ten miles in an hour  not much over ten thousand times his own length
But all the books says any common ordinary thirdclass flea can jump a hun dred and fifty times his own length yes and he can make five jumps a second too  seven hundred and fifty times his own length in one little second  for he dont fool away any time stopping and starting  he does them both at the same time youll see if you try to put your finger on him
Now thats a common ordinary thirdclass fleas gait but you take an Eye talian FIRSTclass thats been the pet of the nobility all his life and hasnt ever knowed what want or sickness or exposure was and he can jump more than three hundred times his own length and keep it up all day five such jumps every second which is fifteen hundred times his own length
Well suppose a man could go fifteen hundred times his own length in a second  say a mile and a half
Its ninety miles a minute its considerable more than five thousand miles an hour
Wheres your man NOW
 yes and your bird and your railroad and your balloon
Laws they dont amount to shucks longside of a flea
A flea is just a comet biled down small
Jim was a good deal astonished and so was I Jim said Is dem figgers jist edjackly true en no jokin en no lies Mars Tom
Yes they are theyre perfectly true
Well den honey a bodys got to respec a flea
I aint had no respec for um befo scasely but dey aint no gittin roun it dey do deserve it dats certain
Well I bet they do
Theyve got ever so much more sense and brains and brightness in proportion to their size than any other cretur in the world
A person can learn them most anything and they learn it quicker than any other cretur too
Theyve been learnt to haul little carriages in harness and go this way and that way and tother way according to their orders yes and to march and drill like soldiers doing it as exact according to orders as soldiers does it
Theyve been learnt to do all sorts of hard and troublesome things
Spose you could cultivate a flea up to the size of a man and keep his natural smartness agrowing and agrowing right along up bigger and bigger and keener and keener in the same proportion  whered the human race be do you reckon
That flea would be President of the United States and you couldnt any more prevent it than you can prevent lightning
My lan Mars Tom I never knowed dey was so much TO de beas
No sir I never had no idea of it and dats de fac
Theres more to him by a long sight than there is to any other cretur man or beast in proportion to size
Hes the interestingest of them all
People have so much to say about an ants strength and an ele phants and a locomotives
Shucks they dont begin with a flea
He can lift two or three hundred times his own weight
And none of them can come anywhere near it
And moreover he has got notions of his own and is very particular and you cant fool him his instinct or his judgment or whatever it is is per fectly sound and clear and dont ever make a mistake
People think all humans are alike to a flea
It aint so
Theres folks that he wont go near hungry or not hungry and Im one of them
Ive never had one of them on me in my life
Mars Tom
Its so I aint joking
Well sah I haint ever heard de likes o dat befo
Jim couldnt believe it and I couldnt so we had to drop down to the sand and git a supply and see
Tom was right
They went for me and Jim by the thou sand but not a one of them lit on Tom
There warnt no explaining it but there it was and there warnt no getting around it
He said it had always been just so and hed just as soon be where there was a million of them as not theyd never touch him nor bother him
We went up to the cold weather to freeze em out and stayed a little spell and then come back to the comfortable weather and went lazying along twenty or twentyfive miles an hour the way wed been doing for the last few hours
The reason was that the longer we was in that solemn peaceful desert the more the hurry and fuss got kind of soothed down in us and the more happier and contented and satisfied we got to feeling and the more we got to liking the desert and then loving it
So we had cramped the speed down as I was saying and was having a most noble good lazy time sometimes watching through the glasses sometimes stretched out on the lockers reading some times taking a nap
It didnt seem like we was the same lot that was in such a state to find land and git ashore but it was
But we had got over that  clean over it
We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more and didnt want to be anywheres else
Why it seemed just like home it most seemed as if I had been born and raised in it and Jim and Tom said the same
And always I had had hateful people around me anagging at me and pestering of me and scolding and finding fault and fussing and bothering and sticking to me and keeping after me and making me do this and making me do that and tother and always selecting out the things I didnt want to do and then giving me Sam Hill because I shirked and done something else and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time but up here in the sky it was so still and sunshiny and lovely and plenty to eat and plenty of sleep and strange things to see and no nagging and no pester ing and no good people and just holiday all the time
Land I warnt in no hurry to git out and buck at civilization again
Now one of the worst things about civilization is that anybody that gits a letter with trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes you feel bad and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all over the world and keeps you downhearted and dismal most all the time and its such a heavy load for a person
I hate them newspapers and I hate letters and if I had my way I wouldnt allow nobody to load his troubles on to other folks he aint acquainted with on tother side of the world that way
Well up in a balloon there aint any of that and its the darlingest place there is
We had supper and that night was one of the prettiest nights I ever see
The moon made it just like daylight only a heap softer and once we see a lion standing all alone by himself just all alone on the earth it seemed like and his shadder laid on the sand by him like a puddle of ink
Thats the kind of moon light to have
Mainly we laid on our backs and talked we didnt want to go to sleep
Tom said we was right in the midst of the Arabian Nights now
He said it was right along here that one of the cutest things in that book happened so we looked down and watched while he told about it because there aint anything that is so interesting to look at as a place that a book has talked about
It was a tale about a cameldriver that had lost his camel and he come along in the desert and met a man and says Have you run across a stray camel today
And the man says Was he blind in his left eye
Yes
Had he lost an upper front tooth
Yes
Was his off hind leg lame
Yes
Was he loaded with milletseed on one side and honey on the other
Yes but you neednt go into no more details  thats the one and Im in a hurry
Where did you see him
I haint seen him at all the man says
Haint seen him at all
How can you describe him so close then
Because when a person knows how to use his eyes everything has got a meaning to it but most peoples eyes aint any good to them
I knowed a camel had been along because I seen his track
I knowed he was lame in his off hind leg because he had favored that foot and trod light on it and his track showed it
I knowed he was blind on his left side because he only nibbled the grass on the right side of the trail
I knowed he had lost an upper front tooth because where he bit into the sod his teethprint showed it
The milletseed sifted out on one side  the ants told me that the honey leaked out on the other  the flies told me that
I know all about your camel but I haint seen him
Jim says Go on Mars Tom hits a mighty good tale and powerful interestin
Thats all Tom says
ALL
says Jim astonished
What come o de camel
I dont know
Mars Tom dont de tale say
No
Jim puzzled a minute then he says Well
Ef dat aint de beatenes tale ever I struck
Jist gits to de place whah de intrust is gittin redhot en down she breaks
Why Mars Tom dey aint no SENSE in a tale dat acts like dat
Haint you got no IDEA whether de man got de camel back er not
No I havent
I see myself there warnt no sense in the tale to chop square off that way before it come to anything but I warnt going to say so because I could see Tom was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out and the way Jim had popped on to the weak place in it and I dont think its fair for everybody to pile on to a feller when hes down
But Tom he whirls on me and says What do YOU think of the tale
Of course then I had to come out and make a clean breast and say it did seem to me too same as it did to Jim that as long as the tale stopped square in the middle and never got to no place it really warnt worth the trouble of telling
Toms chin dropped on his breast and stead of being mad as I reckoned hed be to hear me scoff at his tale that way he seemed to be only sad and he says Some people can see and some cant  just as that man said
Let alone a camel if a cyclone had gone by YOU duffers wouldnt a noticed the track
I dont know what he meant by that and he didnt say it was just one of his irrulevances I reckon  he was full of them sometimes when he was in a close place and couldnt see no other way out  but I didnt mind
Wed spotted the soft place in that tale sharp enough he couldnt git away from that little fact
It graveled him like the nation too I reckon much as he tried not to let on
CHAPTER VIII
THE DISAPPEARING LAKE WE had an early breakfast in the morning and set looking down on the desert and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely although we warnt high up
You have to come down lower and lower after sundown in the desert because it cools off so fast and so by the time it is getting toward dawn you are skimming along only a little ways above the sand
We was watching the shadder of the balloon slide along the ground and now and then gazing off across the desert to see if anything was stirring and then down on the shadder again when all of a sudden almost right under us we see a lot of men and camels laying scattered about perfectly quiet like they was asleep
We shut off the power and backed up and stood over them and then we see that they was all dead
It give us the cold shivers
And it made us hush down too and talk low like people at a funeral
We dropped down slow and stopped and me and Tom clumb down and went among them
There was men and women and children
They was dried by the sun and dark and shriveled and leathery like the pictures of mummies you see in books
And yet they looked just as human you wouldnt a believed it just like they was asleep
Some of the people and animals was partly covered with sand but most of them not for the sand was thin there and the bed was gravel and hard
Most of the clothes had rotted away and when you took hold of a rag it tore with a touch like spider web
Tom reckoned they had been laying there for years
Some of the men had rusty guns by them some had swords on and had shawl belts with long silver mounted pistols stuck in them
All the camels had their loads on yet but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the freight out on the ground
We didnt reckon the swords was any good to the dead people any more so we took one apiece and some pistols
We took a small box too because it was so handsome and inlaid so fine and then we wanted to bury the people but there warnt no way to do it that we could think of and nothing to do it with but sand and that would blow away again of course
Then we mounted high and sailed away and pretty soon that black spot on the sand was out of sight and we wouldnt ever see them poor people again in this world
We wondered and reasoned and tried to guess how they come to be there and how it all hap pened to them but we couldnt make it out
First we thought maybe they got lost and wandered around and about till their food and water give out and they starved to death but Tom said no wild animals nor vultures hadnt meddled with them and so that guess wouldnt do
So at last we give it up and judged we wouldnt think about it no more because it made us lowspirited
Then we opened the box and it had gems and jewels in it quite a pile and some little veils of the kind the dead women had on with fringes made out of curious gold money that we warnt acquainted with
We wondered if we better go and try to find them again and give it back but Tom thought it over and said no it was a country that was full of robbers and they would come and steal it and then the sin would be on us for putting the temptation in their way
So we went on but I wished we had took all they had so there wouldnt a been no temptation at all left
We had had two hours of that blazing weather down there and was dreadful thirsty when we got aboard again
We went straight for the water but it was spoiled and bitter besides being pretty near hot enough to scald your mouth
We couldnt drink it
It was Mississippi river water the best in the world and we stirred up the mud in it to see if that would help but no the mud wasnt any better than the water
Well we hadnt been so very very thirsty before while we was interested in the lost people but we was now and as soon as we found we couldnt have a drink we was more than thirtyfive times as thirsty as we was a quarter of a minute before
Why in a little while we wanted to hold our mouths open and pant like a dog
Tom said to keep a sharp lookout all around every wheres because wed got to find an oasis or there warnt no telling what would happen
So we done it
We kept the glasses gliding around all the time till our arms got so tired we couldnt hold them any more
Two hours  three hours  just gazing and gazing and nothing but sand sand SAND and you could see the quivering heatshimmer playing over it
Dear dear a body dont know what real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through and is certain he aint ever going to come to any water any more
At last I couldnt stand it to look around on them baking plains I laid down on the locker and give it up
But by and by Tom raised a whoop and there she was
A lake wide and shiny with pamtrees leaning over it asleep and their shadders in the water just as soft and delicate as ever you see
I never see anything look so good
It was a long ways off but that warnt anything to us we just slapped on a hundred mile gait and calculated to be there in seven minutes but she stayed the same old distance away all the time we couldnt seem to gain on her yes sir just as far and shiny and like a dream but we couldnt get no nearer and at last all of a sudden she was gone
Toms eyes took a spread and he says Boys it was a MYridge
Said it like he was glad
I didnt see nothing to be glad about
I says Maybe
I dont care nothing about its name the thing I want to know is whats become of it
Jim was trembling all over and so scared he couldnt speak but he wanted to ask that question himself if he could a done it
Tom says Whats BECOME of it
Why you see yourself its gone
Yes I know but wheres it gone TO
He looked me over and says Well now Huck Finn where WOULD it go to
Dont you know what a myridge is
No I dont
What is it
It aint anything but imagination
There aint anything TO it 
It warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that and I says Whats the use you talking that kind of stuff Tom Sawyer
Didnt I see the lake
Yes  you think you did
I dont think nothing about it I DID see it
I tell you you DIDNT see it either  because it warnt there to see
It astonished Jim to hear him talk so and he broke in and says kind of pleading and distressed Mars Tom PLEASE dont say sich things in sich an awful time as dis
You aint only reskin yo own self but yous reskin us  same way like Anna Nias en Siffra
De lake WUZ dah  I seen it jis as plain as I sees you en Huck dis minute
I says Why he seen it himself
He was the very one that seen it first
NOW then
Yes Mars Tom hits so  you cant deny it
We all seen it en dat PROVE it was dah
Proves it
How does it prove it
Same way it does in de courts en everywheres Mars Tom
One pusson might be drunk or dreamy or suthin en he could be mistaken en two might maybe but I tell you sah when three sees a thing drunk er sober its SO
Dey aint no gittin aroun dat en you knows it Mars Tom
I dont know nothing of the kind
There used to be forty thousand million people that seen the sun move from one side of the sky to the other every day
Did that prove that the sun DONE it
Course it did
En besides dey warnt no casion to prove it
A body ats got any sense aint gwine to doubt it
Dah she is now  a sailin thoo de sky like she allays done
Tom turned on me then and says What do YOU say  is the sun standing still
Tom Sawyer whats the use to ask such a jackass question
Anybody that aint blind can see it dont stand still
Well he says Im lost in the sky with no company but a passel of lowdown animals that dont know no more than the head boss of a university did three or four hundred years ago
It warnt fair play and I let him know it
I says Throwin mud aint arguin Tom Sawyer
Oh my goodness oh my goodness gracious dahs de lake agin
yelled Jim just then
NOW Mars Tom what you gwine to say
Yes sir there was the lake again away yonder across the desert perfectly plain trees and all just the same as it was before
I says I reckon youre satisfied now Tom Sawyer
But he says perfectly cam Yes satisfied there aint no lake there
Jim says DONT talk so Mars Tom  it skyers me to hear you
Its so hot en yous so thirsty dat you aint in yo right mine Mars Tom
Oh but dont she look good
clah I doan know how Is gwine to wait tell we gits dah Is SO thirsty
Well youll have to wait and it wont do you no good either because there aint no lake there I tell you
I says Jim dont you take your eye off of it and I wont either
Deed I wont en bless you honey I couldnt ef I wanted to
We went atearing along toward it piling the miles behind us like nothing but never gaining an inch on it  and all of a sudden it was gone again
Jim stag gered and most fell down
When he got his breath he says gasping like a fish Mars Tom hits a GHOS dats what it is en I hopes to goodness we aint gwine to see it no mo
Deys BEEN a lake en suthins happened en de lakes dead en wes seen its ghos wes seen it twiste en dats proof
De deserts hanted its hanted sho oh Mars Tom les git outen it Id ruther die den have de night ketch us in it agin en de ghos er dat lake come amournin aroun us en we asleep en doan know de danger wes in
Ghost you gander
It aint anything but air and heat and thirstiness pasted together by a persons imagination
If I  gimme the glass
He grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right
Its a flock of birds he says
Its getting toward sundown and theyre making a beeline across our track for somewheres
They mean business  maybe theyre going for food or water or both
Let her go to starboard
 Port your hellum
Hard down
There  ease up  steady as you go
We shut down some of the power so as not to out speed them and took out after them
We went skim ming along a quarter of a mile behind them and when we had followed them an hour and a half and was get ting pretty discouraged and was thirsty clean to unendurableness Tom says Take the glass one of you and see what that is away ahead of the birds
Jim got the first glimpse and slumped down on the locker sick
He was most crying and says Shes dah agin Mars Tom shes dah agin en I knows Is gwine to die case when a body sees a ghos de third time dats what it means
I wisht Id never come in dis balloon dat I does
He wouldnt look no more and what he said made me afraid too because I knowed it was true for that has always been the way with ghosts so then I wouldnt look any more either
Both of us begged Tom to turn off and go some other way but he wouldnt and said we was ignorant superstitious blatherskites
Yes and hell git come up with one of these days I says to myself insulting ghosts that way
Theyll stand it for a while maybe but they wont stand it always for anybody that knows about ghosts knows how easy they are hurt and how revenge ful they are
So we was all quiet and still Jim and me being scared and Tom busy
By and by Tom fetched the balloon to a standstill and says NOW get up and look you sapheads
We done it and there was the sureenough water right under us
 clear and blue and cool and deep and wavy with the breeze the loveliest sight that ever was
And all about it was grassy banks and flowers and shady groves of big trees looped together with vines and all looking so peaceful and comfortable  enough to make a body cry it was so beautiful
Jim DID cry and rip and dance and carry on he was so thankful and out of his mind for joy
It was my watch so I had to stay by the works but Tom and Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece and fetched me up a lot and Ive tasted a many a good thing in my life but nothing that ever begun with that water
Then we went down and had a swim and then Tom came up and spelled me and me and Jim had a swim and then Jim spelled Tom and me and Tom had a footrace and a boxingmill and I dont reckon I ever had such a good time in my life
It warnt so very hot because it was close on to evening and we hadnt any clothes on anyway
Clothes is well enough in school and in towns and at balls too but there aint no sense in them when there aint no civilization nor other kinds of bothers and fussiness around
Lions acomin
 lions
Quick Mars Tom
Jump for yo life Huck
Oh and didnt we
We never stopped for clothes but waltzed up the ladder just so
Jim lost his head straight off  he always done it whenever he got ex cited and scared and so now stead of just easing the ladder up from the ground a little so the animals couldnt reach it he turned on a raft of power and we went whizzing up and was dangling in the sky before he got his wits together and seen what a foolish thing he was doing
Then he stopped her but he had clean forgot what to do next so there we was so high that the lions looked like pups and we was drifting off on the wind
But Tom he shinned up and went for the works and begun to slant her down and back toward the lake where the animals was gathering like a campmeeting and I judged he had lost HIS head too for he knowed I was too scared to climb and did he want to dump me among the tigers and things
But no his head was level he knowed what he was about
He swooped down to within thirty or forty feet of the lake and stopped right over the center and sung out Leggo and drop
I done it and shot down feet first and seemed to go about a mile toward the bottom and when I come up he says Now lay on your back and float till youre rested and got your pluck back then Ill dip the ladder in the water and you can climb aboard
I done it
Now that was ever so smart in Tom be cause if he had started off somewheres else to drop down on the sand the menagerie would a come along too and might a kept us hunting a safe place till I got tuckered out and fell
And all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes and trying to divide them up so there would be some for all but there was a misunderstand ing about it somewheres on account of some of them trying to hog more than their share so there was another insurrection and you never see anything like it in the world
There must a been fifty of them all mixed up together snorting and roaring and snapping and biting and tearing legs and tails in the air and you couldnt tell which was which and the sand and fur aflying
And when they got done some was dead
and some was limping off crippled and the rest was setting around on the battlefield some of them licking their sore places and the others looking up at us and seemed to be kind of inviting us to come down and have some fun but which we didnt want any
As for the clothes they warnt any any more
Every last rag of them was inside of the animals and not agreeing with them very well I dont reckon for there was considerable many brass buttons on them and there was knives in the pockets too and smoking tobacco and nails and chalk and marbles and fish hooks and things
But I wasnt caring
All that was bothering me was that all we had now was the pro fessors clothes a big enough assortment but not suit able to go into company with if we came across any because the britches was as long as tunnels and the coats and things according
Still there was everything a tailor needed and Jim was a kind of jack legged tailor and he allowed he could soon trim a suit or two down for us that would answer
CHAPTER IX
TOM DISCOURSES ON THE DESERT STILL we thought we would drop down there a minute but on another errand
Most of the pro fessors cargo of food was put up in cans in the new way that somebody had just invented the rest was fresh
When you fetch Missouri beefsteak to the Great Sahara you want to be particular and stay up in the coolish weather
So we reckoned we would drop down into the lion market and see how we could make out there
We hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we was just above the reach of the animals then we let down a rope with a slipknot in it and hauled up a dead lion a small tender one then yanked up a cub tiger
We had to keep the congregation off with the revolver or they would a took a hand in the proceed ings and helped
We carved off a supply from both and saved the skins and hove the rest overboard
Then we baited some of the professors hooks with the fresh meat and went afishing
We stood over the lake just a con venient distance above the water and catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever see
It was a most amazing good supper we had lion steak tiger steak fried fish and hot cornpone
I dont want nothing better than that
We had some fruit to finish off with
We got it out of the top of a monstrous tall tree
It was a very slim tree that hadnt a branch on it from the bottom plumb to the top and there it bursted out like a feather duster
It was a pamtree of course anybody knows a pamtree the minute he see it by the pictures
We went for cocoanuts in this one but there warnt none
There was only big loose bunches of things like over sized grapes and Tom allowed they was dates because he said they answered the description in the Arabian Nights and the other books
Of course they mightnt be and they might be poison so we had to wait a spell and watch and see if the birds et them
They done it so we done it too and they was most amaz ing good
By this time monstrous big birds begun to come and settle on the dead animals
They was plucky creturs they would tackle one end of a lion that was being gnawed at the other end by another lion
If the lion drove the bird away it didnt do no good he was back again the minute the lion was busy
The big birds come out of every part of the sky  you could make them out with the glass while they was still so far away you couldnt see them with your naked eye
Tom said the birds didnt find out the meat was there by the smell they had to find it out by seeing it
Oh but aint that an eye for you
Tom said at the distance of five mile a patch of dead lions couldnt look any bigger than a persons fingernail and he couldnt imagine how the birds could notice such a little thing so far off
It was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion and we thought maybe they warnt kin
But Jim said that didnt make no difference
He said a hog was fond of her own children and so was a spider and he reckoned maybe a lion was pretty near as unprincipled though maybe not quite
He thought likely a lion wouldnt eat his own father if he knowed which was him but reckoned he would eat his brotherinlaw if he was uncommon hungry and eat his motherinlaw any time
But RECKONING dont settle nothing
You can reckon till the cows come home but that dont fetch you to no decision
So we give it up and let it drop
Generly it was very still in the Desert nights but this time there was music
A lot of other animals come to dinner sneaking yelpers that Tom allowed was jackals and roachedbacked ones that he said was hyenas and all the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the time
They made a picture in the moonlight that was more different than any picture I ever see
We had a line out and made fast to the top of a tree and didnt stand no watch but all turned in and slept but I was up two or three times to look down at the animals and hear the music
It was like having a front seat at a menagerie for nothing which I hadnt ever had before and so it seemed foolish to sleep and not make the most of it I mightnt ever have such a chance again
We went afishing again in the early dawn and then lazied around all day in the deep shade on an island taking turn about to watch and see that none of the animals come asnooping around there after erronorts for dinner
We was going to leave the next day but couldnt it was too lovely
The day after when we rose up toward the sky and sailed off eastward we looked back and watched that place till it warnt nothing but just a speck in the Desert and I tell you it was like saying goodbye to a friend that you aint ever going to see any more
Jim was thinking to himself and at last he says Mars Tom wes mos to de end er de Desert now I speck
Why
Well hit stan to reason we is
You knows how long wes been askimmin over it
Mus be mos out o san
Hits a wonder to me dat its hilt out as long as it has
Shucks theres plenty sand you neednt worry
Oh I aint aworryin Mars Tom only wonderin dats all
De Lords got plenty san I aint doubtin dat but nemmine He aint gwyne to WASE it jist on dat account en I allows dat dis Deserts plenty big enough now jist de way she is en you cant spread her out no mo dout wasin san
Oh go long
we aint much more than fairly STARTED across this Desert yet
The United States is a pretty big country aint it
Aint it Huck
Yes I says there aint no bigger one I dont reckon
Well he says this Desert is about the shape of the United States and if you was to lay it down on top of the United States it would cover the land of the free out of sight like a blanket
Thered be a little corner sticking out up at Maine and away up north west and Florida sticking out like a turtles tail and thats all
Weve took California away from the Mexicans two or three years ago so that part of the Pacific coast is ours now and if you laid the Great Sahara down with her edge on the Pacific she would cover the United States and stick out past New York six hundred miles into the Atlantic ocean
I say Good land
have you got the documents for that Tom Sawyer
Yes and theyre right here and Ive been study ing them
You can look for yourself
From New York to the Pacific is 2600 miles
From one end of the Great Desert to the other is 3200
The United States contains 3600000 square miles the Desert contains 4162000
With the Deserts bulk you could cover up every last inch of the United States and in under where the edges projected out you could tuck England Scotland Ireland France Denmark and all Germany
Yes sir you could hide the home of the brave and all of them countries clean out of sight under the Great Sahara and you would still have 2000 square miles of sand left
Well I says it clean beats me
Why Tom it shows that the Lord took as much pains makin this Desert as makin the United States and all them other countries
Jim says Huck dat don stan to reason
I reckon dis Desert want made at all
Now you take en look at it like dis  you look at it and see ef Is right
Whats a desert good for
Taint good for nuthin
Dey aint no way to make it pay
Haint dat so Huck
Yes I reckon
Haint it so Mars Tom
I guess so
Go on
Ef a thing aint no good its made in vain aint it
Yes
NOW den
Do de Lord make anything in vain
You answer me dat
Well  no He dont
Den how come He make a desert
Well go on
How DID He come to make it
Mars Tom I blieve it uz jes like when yous buildin a house deys allays a lot o truck en rubbish lef over
What does you do wid it
Doan you take en kyart it off en dump it into a ole vacant back lot
Course
Now den its my opinion hit was jes like dat  dat de Great Sahara warnt made at all she jes HAPPEN
I said it was a real good argument and I believed it was the best one Jim ever made
Tom he said the same but said the trouble about arguments is they aint nothing but THEORIES after all and theories dont prove nothing they only give you a place to rest on a spell when you are tuckered out butting around and around trying to find out something there aint no way TO find out
And he says Theres another trouble about theories theres always a hole in them somewheres sure if you look close enough
Its just so with this one of Jims
Look what billions and billions of stars there is
How does it come that there was just exactly enough star stuff and none left over
How does it come there aint no sandpile up there
But Jim was fixed for him and says Whats de Milky Way
 dats what I want to know
Whats de Milky Way
Answer me dat
In my opinion it was just a sockdologer
Its only an opinion its only MY opinion and others may think different but I said it then and I stand to it now  it was a sockdologer
And moreover besides it landed Tom Sawyer
He couldnt say a word
He had that stunned look of a person thats been shot in the back with a kag of nails
All he said was as for people like me and Jim hed just as soon have intellectual intercourse with a catfish
But anybody can say that  and I notice they always do when somebody has fetched them a lifter
Tom Sawyer was tired of that end of the subject
So we got back to talking about the size of the Desert again and the more we compared it with this and that and tother thing the more nobler and bigger and grander it got to look right along
And so hunt ing among the figgers Tom found by and by that it was just the same size as the Empire of China
Then he showed us the spread the Empire of China made on the map and the room she took up in the world
Well it was wonderful to think of and I says Why Ive heard talk about this Desert plenty of times but I never knowed before how important she was
Then Tom says Important
Sahara important
Thats just the way with some people
If a things big its important
Thats all the sense theyve got
All they can see is SIZE
Why look at England
Its the most important country in the world and yet you could put it in Chinas vestpocket and not only that but youd have the dickenss own time to find it again the next time you wanted it
And look at Russia
It spreads all around and everywhere and yet aint no more im portant in this world than Rhode Island is and hasnt got half as much in it thats worth saving
Away off now we see a little hill astanding up just on the edge of the world
Tom broke off his talk and reached for a glass very much excited and took a look and says Thats it  its the one Ive been looking for sure
If Im right its the one the dervish took the man into and showed him all the treasures
So we begun to gaze and he begun to tell about it out of the Arabian Nights
CHAPTER X
THE TREASUREHILL TOM said it happened like this
A dervish was stumping it along through the Desert on foot one blazing hot day and he had come a thousand miles and was pretty poor and hungry and ornery and tired and along about where we are now he run across a cameldriver with a hundred camels and asked him for some ams
But the camel driver he asked to be excused
The dervish said Dont you own these camels
Yes theyre mine
Are you in debt
Who  me
No
Well a man that owns a hundred camels and aint in debt is rich  and not only rich but very rich
Aint it so
The cameldriver owned up that it was so
Then the dervish says God has made you rich and He has made me poor
He has His reasons and they are wise blessed be His name
But He has willed that His rich shall help His poor and you have turned away from me your brother in my need and He will remember this and you will lose by it
That made the cameldriver feel shaky but all the same he was born hoggish after money and didnt like to let go a cent so he begun to whine and explain and said times was hard and although he had took a full freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it he couldnt git no return freight and so he warnt making no great things out of his trip
So the dervish starts along again and says All right if you want to take the risk but I reckon youve made a mistake this time and missed a chance
Of course the cameldriver wanted to know what kind of a chance he had missed because maybe there was money in it so he run after the dervish and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at last the dervish gave in and says Do you see that hill yonder
Well in that hill is all the treasures of the earth and I was looking around for a man with a particular good kind heart and a noble generous disposition because if I could find just that man Ive got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and he could see the treasures and get them out
So then the cameldriver was in a sweat and he cried and begged and took on and went down on his knees and said he was just that kind of a man and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he wasnt ever described so exact before
Well then says the dervish all right
If we load the hundred camels can I have half of them
The driver was so glad he couldnt hardly hold in and says Now youre shouting
So they shook hands on the bargain and the dervish got out his box and rubbed the salve on the drivers right eye and the hill opened and he went in and there sure enough was piles and piles of gold and jewels sparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down
So him and the dervish laid into it and they loaded every camel till he couldnt carry no more then they said goodbye and each of them started off with his fifty
But pretty soon the cameldriver come arunning and overtook the dervish and says You aint in society you know and you dont really need all youve got
Wont you be good and let me have ten of your camels
Well the dervish says I dont know but what you say is reasonable enough
So he done it and they separated and the dervish started off again with his forty
But pretty soon here comes the cameldriver bawling after him again and whines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of him saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough to see a dervish through because they live very simple you know and dont keep house but board around and give their note
But that warnt the end yet
That ornery hound kept coming and coming till he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred
Then he was satisfied and ever so grateful and said he wouldnt ever forgit the dervish as long as he lived and nobody hadnt been so good to him before and liberal
So they shook hands goodbye and separated and started off again
But do you know it warnt ten minutes till the cameldriver was unsatisfied again  he was the low downest reptyle in seven counties  and he come a running again
And this time the thing he wanted was to get the dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye
Why
said the dervish
Oh you know says the driver
Know what
Well you cant fool me says the driver
Youre trying to keep back something from me you know it mighty well
You know I reckon that if I had the salve on the other eye I could see a lot more things thats valuable
Come  please put it on
The dervish says I wasnt keeping anything back from you
I dont mind telling you what would happen if I put it on
Youd never see again
Youd be stoneblind the rest of your days
But do you know that beat wouldnt believe him
No he begged and begged and whined and cried till at last the dervish opened his box and told him to put it on if he wanted to
So the man done it and sure enough he was as blind as a bat in a minute
Then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him and says Goodbye  a man thats blind haint got no use for jewelry
And he cleared out with the hundred camels and left that man to wander around poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the Desert
Jim said hed bet it was a lesson to him
Yes Tom says and like a considerable many lessons a body gets
They aint no account because the thing dont ever happen the same way again  and cant
The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly and crippled his back for life everybody said it would be a lesson to him
What kind of a lesson
How was he going to use it
He couldnt climb chimblies no more and he hadnt no more backs to break
All de same Mars Tom dey IS sich a thing as learnin by expeence
De Good Book say de burnt chile shun de fire
Well I aint denying that a things a lesson if its a thing that can happen twice just the same way
Theres lots of such things and THEY educate a person thats what Uncle Abner always said but theres forty MILLION lots of the other kind  the kind that dont happen the same way twice  and they aint no real use they aint no more instructive than the smallpox
When youve got it it aint no good to find out you ought to been vaccinated and it aint no good to git vaccinated afterward because the smallpox dont come but once
But on the other hand Uncle Abner said that the person that had took a bull by the tail once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a person that hadnt and said a person that started in to carry a cat home by the tail was gitting knowledge that was always going to be useful to him and warnt ever going to grow dim or doubtful
But I can tell you Jim Uncle Abner was down on them people thats all the time trying to dig a lesson out of everything that happens no matter whether  But Jim was asleep
Tom looked kind of ashamed because you know a person always feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the other person is admiring and that other person goes to sleep that way
Of course he oughtnt to go to sleep because its shabby but the finer a person talks the certainer it is to make you sleep and so when you come to look at it it aint nobodys fault in particular both of thems to blame
Jim begun to snore  soft and blubbery at first then a long rasp then a stronger one then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water sucking down the plughole of a bathtub then the same with more power to it and some big coughs and snorts flung in the way a cow does that is choking to death and when the person has got to that point he is at his level best and can wake up a man that is in the next block with a dipperful of loddanum in him but cant wake himself up although all that awful noise of hisn aint but three inches from his own ears
And that is the curiosest thing in the world seems to me
But you rake a match to light the candle and that little bit of a noise will fetch him
I wish I knowed what was the reason of that but there dont seem to be no way to find out
Now there was Jim alarming the whole Desert and yanking the animals out for miles and miles around to see what in the nation was going on up there there warnt nobody nor nothing that was as close to the noise as HE was and yet he was the only cretur that wasnt disturbed by it
We yelled at him and whooped at him it never done no good but the first time there come a little wee noise that wasnt of a usual kind it woke him up
No sir Ive thought it all over and so has Tom and there aint no way to find out why a snorer cant hear himself snore
Jim said he hadnt been asleep he just shut his eyes so he could listen better
Tom said nobody warnt accusing him
That made him look like he wished he hadnt said anything
And he wanted to git away from the sub ject I reckon because he begun to abuse the camel driver just the way a person does when he has got catched in something and wants to take it out of some body else
He let into the cameldriver the hardest he knowed how and I had to agree with him and he praised up the dervish the highest he could and I had to agree with him there too
But Tom says I aint so sure
You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good and unselfish but I dont quite see it
He didnt hunt up another poor dervish did he
No he didnt
If he was so unselfish why didnt he go in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and be satisfied
No sir the person he was hunting for was a man with a hundred camels
He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could
Why Mars Tom he was willin to divide fair and square he only struck for fifty camels
Because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by
Mars Tom he TOLE de man de truck would make him bline
Yes because he knowed the mans character
It was just the kind of a man he was hunting for  a man that never believes in anybodys word or any bodys honorableness because he aint got none of his own
I reckon theres lots of people like that dervish
They swindle right and left but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself
They keep inside of the letter of the law all the time and there aint no way to git hold of them
THEY dont put the salve on  oh no that would be sin but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on then its you that blinds yourself
I reckon the dervish and the cameldriver was just a pair  a fine smart brainy rascal and a dull coarse ignorant one but both of them rascals just the same
Mars Tom does you reckon deys any o dat kind o salve in de worl now
Yes Uncle Abner says there is
He says theyve got it in New York and they put it on country peoples eyes and show them all the railroads in the world and they go in and git them and then when they rub the salve on the other eye the other man bids them good bye and goes off with their railroads
Heres the treasurehill now
Lower away
We landed but it warnt as interesting as I thought it was going to be because we couldnt find the place where they went in to git the treasure
Still it was plenty interesting enough just to see the mere hill itself where such a wonderful thing happened
Jim said he woudnt a missed it for three dollars and I felt the same way
And to me and Jim as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could come into a strange big country like this and go straight and find a little hump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other humps that was almost just like it and nothing to help him but only his own learning and his own natural smartness
We talked and talked it over together but couldnt make out how he done it
He had the best head on him I ever see and all he lacked was age to make a name for himself equal to Captain Kidd or George Washington
I bet you it would a crowded either of THEM to find that hill with all their gifts but it warnt nothing to Tom Sawyer he went across Sahara and put his finger on it as easy as you could pick a nigger out of a bunch of angels
We found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt around the edges and loaded up the lions skin and the tigers so as they would keep till Jim could tan them
CHAPTER XI
THE SANDSTORM WE went afooling along for a day or two and then just as the full moon was touching the ground on the other side of the desert we see a string of little black figgers moving across its big silver face
You could see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink
It was another caravan
We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it just to have company though it warnt going our way
It was a rattler that caravan and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun come astreaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand granddaddylong legses marching in procession
We never went very near it because we knowed better now than to act like that and scare peoples camels and break up their cara vans
It was the gayest outfit you ever see for rich clothes and nobby style
Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries the first we ever see and very tall and they go plunging along like they was on stilts and they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable I bet you but they make noble good time and a camel aint nowheres with them for speed
The caravan camped during the middle part of the day and then started again about the middle of the afternoon
Before long the sun begun to look very curious
First it kind of turned to brass and then to copper and after that it begun to look like a blood red ball and the air got hot and close and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up and looked thick and foggy but fiery and dreadful  like it looks through a piece of red glass you know
We looked down and see a big confusion going on in the caravan and a rushing every which way like they was scared and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and laid there perfectly still
Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide wall and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun and it was coming like the nation too
Then a little faint breeze struck us and then it come harder and grains of sand begun to sift against our faces and sting like fire and Tom sung out Its a sandstorm  turn your backs to it
We done it and in another minute it was blowing a gale and the sand beat against us by the shovelful and the air was so thick with it we couldnt see a thing
In five minutes the boat was level full and we was setting on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand and only our heads out and could hardly breathe
Then the storm thinned and we see that monstrous wall go asailing off across the desert awful to look at I tell you
We dug ourselves out and looked down and where the caravan was before there wasnt any thing but just the sand ocean now and all still and quiet
All them people and camels was smothered and dead and buried  buried under ten foot of sand we reckoned and Tom allowed it might be years before the wind uncovered them and all that time their friends wouldnt ever know what become of that caravan
Tom said NOW we know what it was that happened to the people we got the swords and pistols from
Yes sir that was just it
It was as plain as day now
They got buried in a sandstorm and the wild animals couldnt get at them and the wind never un covered them again until they was dried to leather and warnt fit to eat
It seemed to me we had felt as sorry for them poor people as a person could for anybody and as mournful too but we was mistaken this last caravans death went harder with us a good deal harder
You see the others was total strangers and we never got to feeling acquainted with them at all except maybe a little with the man that was watching the girl but it was different with this last caravan
We was huvvering around them a whole night and most a whole day and had got to feeling real friendly with them and acquainted
I have found out that there aint no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them
Just so with these
We kind of liked them from the start and traveling with them put on the finisher
The longer we traveled with them and the more we got used to their ways the better and better we liked them and the gladder and gladder we was that we run across them
We had come to know some of them so well that we called them by name when we was talking about them and soon got so familiar and sociable that we even dropped the Miss and Mister and just used their plain names without any handle and it did not seem unpolite but just the right thing
Of course it wasnt their own names but names we give them
There was Mr Elexander Robinson and Miss Adaline Robinson and Colonel Jacob McDougal and Miss Harryet McDougal and Judge Jeremiah Butler and young Bushrod Butler and these was big chiefs mostly that wore splendid great turbans and simmeters and dressed like the Grand Mogul and their families
But as soon as we come to know them good and like them very much it warnt Mister nor Judge nor nothing any more but only Elleck and Addy and Jake and Hattie and Jerry and Buck and so on
And you know the more you join in with people in their joys and their sorrows the more nearer and dearer they come to be to you
Now we warnt cold and indifferent the way most travelers is we was right down friendly and sociable and took a chance in every thing that was going and the caravan could depend on us to be on hand every time it didnt make no differ ence what it was
When they camped we camped right over them ten or twelve hundred feet up in the air
When they et a meal we et ourn and it made it ever so much home liker to have their company
When they had a wed ding that night and Buck and Addy got married we got ourselves up in the very starchiest of the professors duds for the blowout and when they danced we jined in and shook a foot up there
But it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the nearest and it was a funeral that done it with us
It was next morning just in the still dawn
We didnt know the diseased and he warnt in our set but that never made no difference he belonged to the caravan and that was enough and there warnt no more sincerer tears shed over him than the ones we dripped on him from up there eleven hundred foot on high
Yes parting with this caravan was much more bitterer than it was to part with them others which was comparative strangers and been dead so long anyway
We had knowed these in their lives and was fond of them too and now to have death snatch them from right before our faces while we was looking and leave us so lonesome and friendless in the middle of that big desert it did hurt so and we wished we mightnt ever make any more friends on that voyage if we was going to lose them again like that
We couldnt keep from talking about them and they was all the time coming up in our memory and looking just the way they looked when we was all alive and happy together
We could see the line marching and the shiny spearheads awinking in the sun we could see the dromedaries lumbering along we could see the wedding and the funeral and more oftener than anything else we could see them praying because they dont allow nothing to prevent that whenever the call come several times a day they would stop right there and stand up and face to the east and lift back their heads and spread out their arms and begin and four or five times they would go down on their knees and then fall forward and touch their forehead to the ground
Well it warnt good to go on talking about them lovely as they was in their life and dear to us in their life and death both because it didnt do no good and made us too downhearted
Jim allowed he was going to live as good a life as he could so he could see them again in a better world and Tom kept still and didnt tell him they was only Mohammedans it warnt no use to disappoint him he was feeling bad enough just as it was
When we woke up next morning we was feeling a little cheerfuller and had had a most powerful good sleep because sand is the comfortablest bed there is and I dont see why people that can afford it dont have it more
And its terrible good ballast too I never see the balloon so steady before
Tom allowed we had twenty tons of it and wondered what we better do with it it was good sand and it didnt seem good sense to throw it away
Jim says Mars Tom cant we tote it back home en sell it
How longll it take
Depends on the way we go
Well sah shes wuth a quarter of a dollar a load at home en I reckon wes got as much as twenty loads haint we
How much would dat be
Five dollars
By jings Mars Tom les shove for home right on de spot
Hits moren a dollar en a half apiece haint it
Yes
Well ef dat aint makin money de easiest ever I struck
She jes rained in  never cos us a lick o work
Les mosey right along Mars Tom
But Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy and excited he never heard him
Pretty soon he says Five dollars  sho
Look here this sands worth  worth  why its worth no end of money
How is dat Mars Tom
Go on honey go on
Well the minute people knows its genuwyne sand from the genuwyne Desert of Sahara theyll just be in a perfect state of mind to git hold of some of it to keep on the whatnot in a vial with a label on it for a curiosity
All we got to do is to put it up in vials and float around all over the United States and peddle them out at ten cents apiece
Weve got all of ten thousand dollars worth of sand in this boat
Me and Jim went all to pieces with joy and begun to shout whoopjamboreehoo and Tom says And we can keep on coming back and fetching sand and coming back and fetching more sand and just keep it agoing till weve carted this whole Desert over there and sold it out and there aint ever going to be any opposition either because well take out a patent
My goodness I says well be as rich as Creo sote wont we Tom
Yes  Creesus you mean
Why that dervish was hunting in that little hill for the treasures of the earth and didnt know he was walking over the real ones for a thousand miles
He was blinder than he made the driver
Mars Tom how much is we gwyne to be worth
Well I dont know yet
Its got to be ciphered and it aint the easiest job to do either because its over four million square miles of sand at ten cents a vial
Jim was awful excited but this faded it out consider able and he shook his head and says Mars Tom we cant ford all dem vials  a king couldnt
We better not try to take de whole Desert Mars Tom de vials gwyne to bust us sho
Toms excitement died out too now and I reck oned it was on account of the vials but it wasnt
He set there thinking and got bluer and bluer and at last he says Boys it wont work we got to give it up
Why Tom
On account of the duties
I couldnt make nothing out of that neither could Jim
I says What IS our duty Tom
Because if we cant git around it why cant we just DO it
People often has to
But he says Oh it aint that kind of duty
The kind I mean is a tax
Whenever you strike a frontier  thats the border of a country you know  you find a custom house there and the govment officers comes and rum mages among your things and charges a big tax which they call a duty because its their duty to bust you if they can and if you dont pay the duty theyll hog your sand
They call it confiscating but that dont deceive nobody its just hogging and thats all it is
Now if we try to carry this sand home the way were pointed now we got to climb fences till we git tired  just frontier after frontier  Egypt Arabia Hindostan and so on and theyll all whack on a duty and so you see easy enough we CANT go THAT road
Why Tom I says we can sail right over their old frontiers how are THEY going to stop us
He looked sorrowful at me and says very grave Huck Finn do you think that would be honest
I hate them kind of interruptions
I never said nothing and he went on Well were shut off the other way too
If we go back the way weve come theres the New York customhouse and that is worse than all of them others put together on account of the kind of cargo weve got
Why
Well they cant raise Sahara sand in America of course and when they cant raise a thing there the duty is fourteen hundred thousand per cent
on it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it
There aint no sense in that Tom Sawyer
Who said there WAS
What do you talk to me like that for Huck Finn
You wait till I say a things got sense in it before you go to accusing me of say ing it
All right consider me crying about it and sorry
Go on
Jim says Mars Tom do dey jam dat duty onto everything we cant raise in America en dont make no stinction twix anything
Yes thats what they do
Mars Tom aint de blessin o de Lord de mos valuable thing dey is
Yes it is
Dont de preacher stan up in de pulpit en call it down on de people
Yes
Whah do it come from
From heaven
Yassir
yous jes right deed you is honey  it come from heaven en dats a foreign country
NOW den
do dey put a tax on dat blessin
No they dont
Course dey dont en so it stan to reason dat yous mistaken Mars Tom
Dey wouldnt put de tax on po truck like san dat everybody aint bleeged to have en leave it offn de bes thing dey is which nobody cant git along widout
Tom Sawyer was stumped he see Jim had got him where he couldnt budge
He tried to wiggle out by saying they had FORGOT to put on that tax but theyd be sure to remember about it next session of Con gress and then theyd put it on but that was a poor lame comeoff and he knowed it
He said there warnt nothing foreign that warnt taxed but just that one and so they couldnt be consistent without taxing it and to be consistent was the first law of politics
So he stuck to it that theyd left it out unintentional and would be certain to do their best to fix it before they got caught and laughed at
But I didnt feel no more interest in such things as long as we couldnt git our sand through and it made me lowspirited and Jim the same
Tom he tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another speculation for us that would be just as good as this one and better but it didnt do no good we didnt believe there was any as big as this
It was mighty hard such a little while ago we was so rich and could a bought a country and started a kingdom and been celebrated and happy and now we was so poor and ornery again and had our sand left on our hands
The sand was looking so lovely before just like gold and dimonds and the feel of it was so soft and so silky and nice but now I couldnt bear the sight of it it made me sick to look at it and I knowed I wouldnt ever feel comfortable again till we got shut of it and I didnt have it there no more to remind us of what we had been and what we had got degraded down to
The others was feeling the same way about it that I was
I knowed it because they cheered up so the minute I says les throw this truck overboard
Well it was going to be work you know and pretty solid work too so Tom he divided it up according to fairness and strength
He said me and him would clear out a fifth apiece of the sand and Jim three fifths
Jim he didnt quite like that arrangement
He says Course Is de stronges en Is willin to do a share accordin but by jings yous kinder pilin it onto ole Jim Mars Tom haint you
Well I didnt think so Jim but you try your hand at fixing it and lets see
So Jim reckoned it wouldnt be no more than fair if me and Tom done a TENTH apiece
Tom he turned his back to git room and be private and then he smole a smile that spread around and covered the whole Sahara to the westward back to the Atlantic edge of it where we come from
Then he turned around again and said it was a good enough arrangement and we was satisfied if Jim was
Jim said he was
So then Tom measured off our twotenths in the bow and left the rest for Jim and it surprised Jim a good deal to see how much difference there was and what a raging lot of sand his share come to and said he was powerful glad now that he had spoke up in time and got the first arrangement altered for he said that even the way it was now there was more sand than enjoyment in his end of the contract he believed
Then we laid into it
It was mighty hot work and tough so hot we had to move up into cooler weather or we couldnt a stood it
Me and Tom took turn about and one worked while tother rested but there warnt nobody to spell poor old Jim and he made all that part of Africa damp he sweated so
We couldnt work good we was so full of laugh and Jim he kept fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so and we had to keep making up things to account for it and they was pretty poor inventions but they done well enough Jim didnt see through them
At last when we got done we was most dead but not with work but with laughing
By and by Jim was most dead too but it was with work then we took turns and spelled him and he was as thankfull as he could be and would set on the gunnel and swab the sweat and heave and pant and say how good we was to a poor old nigger and he wouldnt ever forgit us
He was always the gratefulest nigger I ever see for any little thing you done for him
He was only nigger outside inside he was as white as you be
CHAPTER XII
JIM STANDING SIEGE THE next few meals was pretty sandy but that dont make no difference when you are hungry and when you aint it aint no satisfaction to eat any way and so a little grit in the meat aint no particular drawback as far as I can see
Then we struck the east end of the Desert at last sailing on a northeast course
Away off on the edge of the sand in a soft pinky light we see three little sharp roofs like tents and Tom says Its the pyramids of Egypt
It made my heart fairly jump
You see I had seen a many and a many a picture of them and heard tell about them a hundred times and yet to come on them all of a sudden that way and find they was REAL stead of imaginations most knocked the breath out of me with surprise
Its a curious thing that the more you hear about a grand and big and bully thing or person the more it kind of dreamies out as you may say and gets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of moon shine and nothing solid to it
Its just so with George Washington and the same with them pyramids
And moreover besides the thing they always said about them seemed to me to be stretchers
There was a feller come to the Sundayschool once and had a picture of them and made a speech and said the big gest pyramid covered thirteen acres and was most five hundred foot high just a steep mountain all built out of hunks of stone as big as a bureau and laid up in perfectly regular layers like stairsteps
Thirteen acres you see for just one building its a farm
If it hadnt been in Sundayschool I would a judged it was a lie and outside I was certain of it
And he said there was a hole in the pyramid and you could go in there with candles and go ever so far up a long slanting tunnel and come to a large room in the stomach of that stone mountain and there you would find a big stone chest with a king in it four thousand years old
I said to myself then if that aint a lie I will eat that king if they will fetch him for even Methusalem warnt that old and nobody claims it
As we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand come to an end in a long straight edge like a blanket and on to it was joined edge to edge a wide country of bright green with a snaky stripe crooking through it and Tom said it was the Nile
It made my heart jump again for the Nile was another thing that wasnt real to me
Now I can tell you one thing which is dead certain if you will fool along over three thou sand miles of yaller sand all glimmering with heat so that it makes your eyes water to look at it and youve been a considerable part of a week doing it the green country will look so like home and heaven to you that it will make your eyes water AGAIN
It was just so with me and the same with Jim
And when Jim got so he could believe it WAS the land of Egypt he was looking at he wouldnt enter it standing up but got down on his knees and took off his hat because he said it wasnt fitten for a humble poor nigger to come any other way where such men had been as Moses and Joseph and Pharaoh and the other prophets
He was a Presbyterian and had a most deep respect for Moses which was a Presbyterian too he said
He was all stirred up and says Hits de lan of Egypt de lan of Egypt en Is lowed to look at it wid my own eyes
En dahs de river dat was turn to blood en Is looking at de very same groun whah de plagues was en de lice en de frogs en de locus en de hail en whah dey marked de doorpos en de angel o de Lord come by in de darkness o de night en slew de fustborn in all de lan o Egypt
Ole Jim aint worthy to see dis day
And then he just broke down and cried he was so thankful
So between him and Tom there was talk enough Jim being excited because the land was so full of history  Joseph and his brethren Moses in the bulrushers Jacob coming down into Egypt to buy corn the silver cup in the sack and all them interesting things and Tom just as excited too because the land was so full of history that was in HIS line about Noureddin and Bedreddin and such like monstrous giants that made Jims wool rise and a raft of other Arabian Nights folks which the half of them never done the things they let on they done I dont believe
Then we struck a disappointment for one of them early morning fogs started up and it warnt no use to sail over the top of it because we would go by Egypt sure so we judged it was best to set her by compass straight for the place where the pyramids was gitting blurred and blotted out and then drop low and skin along pretty close to the ground and keep a sharp lookout
Tom took the hellum I stood by to let go the anchor and Jim he straddled the bow to dig through the fog with his eyes and watch out for danger ahead
We went along a steady gait but not very fast and the fog got solider and solider so solid that Jim looked dim and ragged and smoky through it
It was awful still and we talked low and was anxious
Now and then Jim would say Highst her a pint Mars Tom highst her
and up she would skip a foot or two and we would slide right over a flatroofed mud cabin with people that had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and gap and stretch and once when a feller was clear up on his hind legs so he could gap and stretch better we took him a blip in the back and knocked him off
By and by after about an hour and everything dead still and we astraining our ears for sounds and holding our breath the fog thinned a little very sudden and Jim sung out in an awful scare Oh for de lans sake set her back Mars Tom heres de biggest giant outen de Rabian Nights a comin for us
and he went over backwards in the boat
Tom slammed on the backaction and as we slowed to a standstill a mans face as big as our house at home looked in over the gunnel same as a house looks out of its windows and I laid down and died
I must a been clear dead and gone for as much as a minute or more then I come to and Tom had hitched a boat hook on to the lower lip of the giant and was holding the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his head back and got a good long look up at that awful face
Jim was on his knees with his hands clasped gazing up at the thing in a begging way and working his lips but not getting anything out
I took only just a glimpse and was fading out again but Tom says He aint alive you fools its the Sphinx
I never see Tom look so little and like a fly but that was because the giants head was so big and awful
Awful yes so it was but not dreadful any more because you could see it was a noble face and kind of sad and not thinking about you but about other things and larger
It was stone reddish stone and its nose and ears battered and that give it an abused look and you felt sorrier for it for that
We stood off a piece and sailed around it and over it and it was just grand
It was a mans head or maybe a womans on a tigers body a hundred and twentyfive foot long and there was a dear little temple between its front paws
All but the head used to be under the sand for hundreds of years maybe thou sands but they had just lately dug the sand away and found that little temple
It took a power of sand to bury that cretur most as much as it would to bury a steamboat I reckon
We landed Jim on top of the head with an American flag to protect him it being a foreign land then we sailed off to this and that and tother distance to git what Tom called effects and perspectives and propor tions and Jim he done the best he could striking all the different kinds of attitudes and positions he could study up but standing on his head and working his legs the way a frog does was the best
The further we got away the littler Jim got and the grander the Sphinx got till at last it was only a clothespin on a dome as you might say
Thats the way perspective brings out the correct proportions Tom said he said Julus Cesars niggers didnt know how big he was they was too close to him
Then we sailed off further and further till we couldnt see Jim at all any more and then that great figger was at its noblest agazing out over the Nile Valley so still and solemn and lonesome and all the little shabby huts and things that was scattered about it clean disappeared and gone and nothing around it now but a soft wide spread of yaller velvet which was the sand
That was the right place to stop and we done it
We set there alooking and athinking for a half an hour nobody asaying anything for it made us feel quiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been looking over that valley just that same way and think ing its awful thoughts all to itself for thousands of years
and nobody cant find out what they are to this day
At last I took up the glass and see some little black things acapering around on that velvet carpet and some more aclimbing up the creturs back and then I see two or three wee puffs of white smoke and told Tom to look
He done it and says Theyre bugs
No  hold on they  why I be lieve theyre men
Yes its men  men and horses both
Theyre hauling a long ladder up onto the Sphinxs back  now aint that odd
And now theyre trying to lean it up a  theres some more puffs of smoke  its guns
Huck theyre after Jim
We clapped on the power and went for them a biling
We was there in no time and come awhizzing down amongst them and they broke and scattered every which way and some that was climbing the ladder after Jim let go all holts and fell
We soared up and found him laying on top of the head panting and most tuckered out partly from howling for help and partly from scare
He had been standing a siege a long time  a week HE said but it warnt so it only just seemed so to him because they was crowding him so
They had shot at him and rained the bullets all around him but he warnt hit and when they found he wouldnt stand up and the bullets couldnt git at him when he was laying down they went for the ladder and then he knowed it was all up with him if we didnt come pretty quick
Tom was very indignant and asked him why he didnt show the flag and command them to GIT in the name of the United States
Jim said he done it but they never paid no attention
Tom said he would have this thing looked into at Washington and says Youll see that theyll have to apologize for insult ing the flag and pay an indemnity too on top of it even if they git off THAT easy
Jim says Whats an indemnity Mars Tom
Its cash thats what it is
Who gits it Mars Tom
Why WE do
En who gits de apology
The United States
Or we can take whichever we please
We can take the apology if we want to and let the govment take the money
How much money will it be Mars Tom
Well in an aggravated case like this one it will be at least three dollars apiece and I dont know but more
Well den well take de money Mars Tom blame de pology
Haint dat yo notion too
En haint it yourn Huck
We talked it over a little and allowed that that was as good a way as any so we agreed to take the money
It was a new business to me and I asked Tom if countries always apologized when they had done wrong and he says Yes the little ones does
We was sailing around examining the pyramids you know and now we soared up and roosted on the flat top of the biggest one and found it was just like what the man said in the Sundayschool
It was like four pairs of stairs that starts broad at the bottom and slants up and comes together in a point at the top only these stairsteps couldnt be clumb the way you climb other stairs no for each step was as high as your chin and you have to be boosted up from behind
The two other pyramids warnt far away and the people moving about on the sand between looked like bugs crawling we was so high above them
Tom he couldnt hold himself he was so worked up with gladness and astonishment to be in such a cele brated place and he just dripped history from every pore seemed to me
He said he couldnt scarcely believe he was standing on the very identical spot the prince flew from on the Bronze Horse
It was in the Arabian Night times he said
Somebody give the prince a bronze horse with a peg in its shoulder and he could git on him and fly through the air like a bird and go all over the world and steer it by turning the peg and fly high or low and land wherever he wanted to
When he got done telling it there was one of them uncomfortable silences that comes you know when a person has been telling a whopper and you feel sorry for him and wish you could think of some way to change the subject and let him down easy but git stuck and dont see no way and before you can pull your mind together and DO something that silence has got in and spread itself and done the business
I was embar rassed Jim he was embarrassed and neither of us couldnt say a word
Well Tom he glowered at me a minute and says Come out with it
What do you think
I says Tom Sawyer YOU dont believe that yourself
Whats the reason I dont
Whats to hender me
Theres one thing to hender you it couldnt happen thats all
Whats the reason it couldnt happen
You tell me the reason it COULD happen
This balloon is a good enough reason it could happen I should reckon
WHY is it
WHY is it
I never saw such an idiot
Aint this balloon and the bronze horse the same thing under different names
No theyre not
One is a balloon and the others a horse
Its very different
Next youll be saying a house and a cow is the same thing
By Jackson Hucks got him agin
Dey aint no wigglin outer dat
Shut your head Jim you dont know what youre talking about
And Huck dont
Look here Huck Ill make it plain to you so you can understand
You see it aint the mere FORM thats got anything to do with their being similar or unsimilar its the PRINCI PLE involved and the principle is the same in both
Dont you see now
I turned it over in my mind and says Tom it aint no use
Principles is all very well but they dont git around that one big fact that the thing that a balloon can do aint no sort of proof of what a horse can do
Shucks Huck you dont get the idea at all
Now look here a minute  its perfectly plain
Dont we fly through the air
Yes
Very well
Dont we fly high or fly low just as we please
Yes
Dont we steer whichever way we want to
Yes
And dont we land when and where we please
Yes
How do we move the balloon and steer it
By touching the buttons
NOW I reckon the thing is clear to you at last
In the other case the moving and steering was done by turning a peg
We touch a button the prince turned a peg
There aint an atom of difference you see
I knowed I could git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough
He felt so happy he begun to whistle
But me and Jim was silent so he broke off surprised and says Looky here Huck Finn dont you see it YET
I says Tom Sawyer I want to ask you some questions
Go ahead he says and I see Jim chirk up to listen
As I understand it the whole thing is in the buttons and the peg  the rest aint of no consequence
A button is one shape a peg is another shape but that aint any matter
No that aint any matter as long as theyve both got the same power
All right then
What is the power thats in a candle and in a match
Its the fire
Its the same in both then
Yes just the same in both
All right
Suppose I set fire to a carpenter shop with a match what will happen to that carpenter shop
Shell burn up
And suppose I set fire to this pyramid with a candle  will she burn up
Of course she wont
All right
Now the fires the same both times
WHY does the shop burn and the pyramid dont
Because the pyramid CANT burn
Aha
and A HORSE CANT FLY
My lan ef Huck aint got him agin
Hucks landed him high en dry dis time I tell you
Hits de smartes trap I ever see a body walk inter  en ef I  But Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and couldnt go on and Tom was that mad to see how neat I had floored him and turned his own argument agin him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with it that all he could manage to say was that whenever he heard me and Jim try to argue it made him ashamed of the human race
I never said nothing I was feel ing pretty well satisfied
When I have got the best of a person that way it aint my way to go around crow ing about it the way some people does for I consider that if I was in his place I wouldnt wish him to crow over me
Its better to be generous thats what I think
CHAPTER XIII
GOING FOR TOMS PIPE BY AND BY we left Jim to float around up there in the neighborhood of the pyramids and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the tunnel and went in with some Arabs and candles and away in there in the middle of the pyramid we found a room and a big stone box in it where they used to keep that king just as the man in the Sundayschool said but he was gone now somebody had got him
But I didnt take no interest in the place because there could be ghosts there of course not fresh ones but I dont like no kind
So then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece and then went in a boat another piece and then more donkeys and got to Cairo and all the way the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as ever I see and had tall datepams on both sides and naked children everywhere and the men was as red as copper and fine and strong and handsome
And the city was a curiosity
Such narrow streets  why they were just lanes and crowded with people with turbans and women with veils and everybody rigged out in blazing bright clothes and all sorts of colors and you wondered how the camels and the people got by each other in such narrow little cracks but they done it  a perfect jam you see and everybody noisy
The stores warnt big enough to turn around in but you didnt have to go in the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on his counter smoking his snaky long pipe and had his things where he could reach them to sell and he was just as good as in the street for the camelloads brushed him as they went by
Now and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed men running and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long rod that didnt get out of the way
And by and by along comes the Sultan riding horseback at the head of a procession and fairly took your breath away his clothes was so splendid and everybody fell flat and laid on his stomach while he went by
I forgot but a feller helped me to remember
He was one that had a rod and run in front
There was churches but they dont know enough to keep Sunday they keep Friday and break the Sab bath
You have to take off your shoes when you go in
There was crowds of men and boys in the church setting in groups on the stone floor and making no end of noise  getting their lessons by heart Tom said out of the Koran which they think is a Bible and people that knows better knows enough to not let on
I never see such a big church in my life before and most awful high it was it made you dizzy to look up our village church at home aint a circumstance to it if you was to put it in there people would think it was a drygoods box
What I wanted to see was a dervish because I was interested in dervishes on accounts of the one that played the trick on the cameldriver
So we found a lot in a kind of a church and they called themselves Whirling Dervishes and they did whirl too
I never see anything like it
They had tall sugarloaf hats on and linen petticoats and they spun and spun and spun round and round like tops and the petticoats stood out on a slant and it was the prettiest thing I ever see and made me drunk to look at it
They was all Moslems Tom said and when I asked him what a Moslem was he said it was a person that wasnt a Presbyterian
So there is plenty of them in Missouri though I didnt know it before
We didnt see half there was to see in Cairo because Tom was in such a sweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history
We had a most tiresome time to find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain before the famine and when we found it it warnt worth much to look at being such an old tumbledown wreck but Tom was satisfied and made more fuss over it than I would make if I stuck a nail in my foot
How he ever found that place was too many for me
We passed as much as forty just like it before we come to it and any of them would a done for me but none but just the right one would suit him I never see any body so particular as Tom Sawyer
The minute he struck the right one he reconnized it as easy as I would reconnize my other shirt if I had one but how he done it he couldnt any more tell than he could fly he said so himself
Then we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that learned the cadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new ones and said it was out of the Arabian Nights and he would tell me and Jim about it when he got time
Well we hunted and hunted till I was ready to drop and I wanted Tom to give it up and come next day and git somebody that knowed the town and could talk Missourian and could go straight to the place but no he wanted to find it himself and nothing else would answer
So on we went
Then at last the remarkablest thing happened I ever see
The house was gone  gone hundreds of years ago  every last rag of it gone but just one mud brick
Now a person wouldnt ever believe that a backwoods Missouri boy that hadnt ever been in that town before could go and hunt that place over and find that brick but Tom Sawyer done it
I know he done it because I see him do it
I was right by his very side at the time and see him see the brick and see him reconnize it
Well I says to myself how DOES he do it
Is it knowledge or is it instink
Now theres the facts just as they happened let everybody explain it their own way
Ive ciphered over it a good deal and its my opinion that some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink
The reason is this Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum with his name on it and the facts when he went home and I slipped it out and put another brick considerable like it in its place and he didnt know the difference  but there was a difference you see
I think that settles it  its mostly instink not knowledge
Instink tells him where the exact PLACE is for the brick to be in and so he reconnizes it by the place its in not by the look of the brick
If it was knowledge not instink he would know the brick again by the look of it the next time he seen it  which he didnt
So it shows that for all the brag you hear about knowledge being such a wonderful thing instink is worth forty of it for real unerringness
Jim says the same
When we got back Jim dropped down and took us in and there was a young man there with a red skull cap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacket and baggy trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it that could talk English and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us to Mecca and Medina and Central Africa and everywheres for a half a dollar a day and his keep and we hired him and left and piled on the power and by the time we was through dinner we was over the place where the Israelites crossed the Red Sea when Pharaoh tried to overtake them and was caught by the waters
We stopped then and had a good look at the place and it done Jim good to see it
He said he could see it all now just the way it happened he could see the Israelites walking along between the walls of water and the Egyptians coming from away off yonder hurrying all they could and see them start in as the Israelites went out and then when they was all in see the walls tumble together and drown the last man of them
Then we piled on the power again and rushed away and huvvered over Mount Sinai and saw the place where Moses broke the tables of stone and where the children of Israel camped in the plain and worshiped the golden calf and it was all just as interesting as could be and the guide knowed every place as well as I knowed the village at home
But we had an accident now and it fetched all the plans to a standstill
Toms old ornery corncob pipe had got so old and swelled and warped that she couldnt hold together any longer notwithstanding the strings and bandages but caved in and went to pieces
Tom he didnt know WHAT to do
The professors pipe wouldnt answer it warnt anything but a mershum and a person thats got used to a cob pipe knows it lays a long ways over all the other pipes in this world and you cant git him to smoke any other
He wouldnt take mine I couldnt persuade him
So there he was
He thought it over and said we must scour around and see if we could roust out one in Egypt or Arabia or around in some of these countries but the guide said no it warnt no use they didnt have them
So Tom was pretty glum for a little while then he chirked up and said hed got the idea and knowed what to do
He says Ive got another corncob pipe and its a prime one too and nearly new
Its laying on the rafter thats right over the kitchen stove at home in the village
Jim you and the guide will go and get it and me and Huck will camp here on Mount Sinai till you come back
But Mars Tom we couldnt ever find de village
I could find de pipe case I knows de kitchen but my lan we cant ever find de village nur Sent Louis nur none o dem places
We dont know de way Mars Tom
That was a fact and it stumped Tom for a minute
Then he said Looky here it can be done sure and Ill tell you how
You set your compass and sail west as straight as a dart till you find the United States
It aint any trouble because its the first land youll strike the other side of the Atlantic
If its daytime when you strike it bulge right on straight west from the upper part of the Florida coast and in an hour and three quarters youll hit the mouth of the Mississippi  at the speed that Im going to send you
Youll be so high up in the air that the earth will be curved considerable  sorter like a washbowl turned upside down  and youll see a raft of rivers crawling around every which way long before you get there and you can pick out the Miss issippi without any trouble
Then you can follow the river north nearly an hour and three quarters till you see the Ohio come in then you want to look sharp because youre getting near
Away up to your left youll see another thread coming in  thats the Missouri and is a little above St Louis
Youll come down low then so as you can examine the villages as you spin along
Youll pass about twentyfive in the next fifteen minutes and youll recognize ours when you see it  and if you dont you can yell down and ask
Ef its dat easy Mars Tom I reckon we kin do it  yassir I knows we kin
The guide was sure of it too and thought that he could learn to stand his watch in a little while
Jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour Tom said
This balloons as easy to manage as a canoe
Tom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it and says To go back west is the shortest way you see
Its only about seven thousand miles
If you went east and so on around its over twice as far
Then he says to the guide I want you both to watch the telltale all through the watches and whenever it dont mark three hundred miles an hour you go higher or drop lower till you find a stormcurrent thats going your way
Theres a hundred miles an hour in this old thing without any wind to help
Theres two hundredmile gales to be found any time you want to hunt for them
Well hunt for them sir
See that you do
Sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles and itll be pison cold but most of the time youll find your storm a good deal lower
If you can only strike a cyclone  thats the ticket for you
Youll see by the professors books that they travel west in these latitudes and they travel low too
Then he ciphered on the time and says  Seven thousand miles three hundred miles an hour  you can make the trip in a day  twentyfour hours
This is Thursday youll be back here Sat urday afternoon
Come now hustle out some blankets and food and books and things for me and Huck and you can start right along
There aint no occasion to fool around  I want a smoke and the quicker you fetch that pipe the better
All hands jumped for the things and in eight min utes our things was out and the balloon was ready for America
So we shook hands goodbye and Tom gave his last orders Its 1O minutes to 2 PM now Mount Sinai time
In 24 hours youll be home and itll be 6 tomor row morning village time
When you strike the village land a little back of the top of the hill in the woods out of sight then you rush down Jim and shove these letters in the postoffice and if you see anybody stirring pull your slouch down over your face so they wont know you
Then you go and slip in the back way to the kitchen and git the pipe and lay this piece of paper on the kitchen table and put something on it to hold it and then slide out and git away and dont let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you nor nobody else
Then you jump for the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three hundred miles an hour
You wont have lost more than an hour
Youll start back at 7 or 8 AM village time and be here in 24 hours arriving at 2 or 3 PM Mount Sinai time
Tom he read the piece of paper to us
He had wrote on it THURSDAY AFTERNOON
Tom Sawyer the Erro nort sends his love to Aunt Polly from Mount Sinai where the Ark was and so does Huck Finn and she will get it tomorrow morning halfpast six
  This misplacing of the Ark is probably Hucks error not Toms
 MT
Thatll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come he says
Then he says Stand by
One  two  three  away you go
And away she DID go
Why she seemed to whiz out of sight in a second
Then we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole big plain and there we camped to wait for the pipe
The balloon come hack all right and brung the pipe but Aunt Polly had catched Jim when he was getting it and anybody can guess what happened she sent for Tom
So Jim he says Mars Tom shes out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky alayin for you en she say she aint gwyne to budge from dah tell she gits hold of you
Deys gwyne to be trouble Mars Tom deed dey is
So then we shoved for home and not feeling very gay neither
END
