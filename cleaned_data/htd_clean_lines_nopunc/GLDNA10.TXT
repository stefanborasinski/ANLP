But to those whose nearest were aunts and uncles a special attitude of mind may be allowed
They treated us indeed with kindness enough as to the needs of the flesh but after that with indifference an indifference as I recognise the result of a certain stupidity and therewith the commonplace conviction that your child is merely animal
At a very early age I remember realising in a quite impersonal and kindly way the existence of that stupidity and its tremendous influence in the world while there grew up in me as in the parallel case of Caliban upon Setebos a vague sense of a ruling power wilful and freakish and prone to the practice of vagariesjust choosing so as for instance the giving of authority over us to these hopeless and incapable creatures when it might far more reasonably have been given to ourselves over them
These elders our betters by a trick of chance commanded no respect but only a certain blend of envy of their good luckand pityfor their inability to make use of it
Indeed it was one of the most hopeless features in their character when we troubled ourselves to waste a thought on them which wasnt often that having absolute licence to indulge in the pleasures of life they could get no good of it
They might dabble in the pond all day hunt the chickens climb trees in the most uncompromising Sunday clothes they were free to issue forth and buy gunpowder in the full eye of the sunfree to fire cannons and explode mines on the lawn yet they never did any one of these things
No irresistible Energy haled them to church o Sundays yet they went there regularly of their own accord though they betrayed no greater delight in the experience than ourselves
On the whole the existence of these Olympians seemed to be entirely void of interests even as their movements were confined and slow and their habits stereotyped and senseless
To anything but appearances they were blind
For them the orchard a place elfhaunted wonderful
simply produced so many apples and cherries or it didnt when the failures of Nature were not infrequently ascribed to us
They never set foot within firwood or hazelcopse nor dreamt of the marvels hid therein
The mysterious sourcessources as of old Nilethat fed the duckpond had no magic for them
They were unaware of Indians nor recked they anything of bisons or of pirates with pistols
 though the whole place swarmed with such portents
They cared not about exploring for robbers caves nor digging for hidden treasure
Perhaps indeed it was one of their best qualities that they spent the greater part of their time stuffily indoors
To be sure there was an exception in the curate who would receive unblenching the information that the meadow beyond the orchard was a prairie studded with herds of buffalo which it was our delight moccasined and tomahawked to ride down with those whoops that announce the scenting of blood
He neither laughed nor sneered as the Olympians would have done but possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy he would contribute such lots of valuable suggestion as to the pursuit of this particular sort of big game that as it seemed to us his mature age and eminent position could scarce have been attained without a practical knowledge of the creature in its native lair
Then too he was always ready to constitute himself a hostile army or a band of marauding Indians on the shortest possible notice in brief a distinctly able man with talents so far as we could judge immensely above the majority
I trust he is a bishop by this timehe had all the necessary qualifications as we knew
These strange folk had visitors sometimesstiff and colourless Olympians like themselves equally without vital interests and intelligent pursuits emerging out of the clouds and passing away again to drag on an aimless existence somewhere out of our ken
Then brute force was pitilessly applied
We were captured washed and forced into clean collars silently submitting as was our wont with more contempt than anger
Anon with unctuous hair and faces stiffened in a conventional grin we sat and listened to the usual platitudes
How could reasonable people spend their precious time so
That was ever our wonder as we bounded forth at lastto the old claypit to make pots or to hunt bears among the hazels
It was incessant matter for amazement how these Olympians would talk over our headsduring meals for instanceof this or the other social or political inanity under the delusion that these pale phantasms of reality were among the importances of life
We illuminati eating silently our heads full of plans and conspiracies could have told them what real life was
We had just left it outside and were all on fire to get back to it
Of course we didnt waste the revelation on them the futility of imparting our ideas had long been demonstrated
One in thought and purpose linked by the necessity of combating one hostile fate a power antagonistic evera power we lived to evadewe had no confidants save ourselves
This strange anaemic order of beings was further removed from us in fact than the kindly beasts who shared our natural existence in the sun
The estrangement was fortified by an abiding sense of injustice arising from the refusal of the Olympians ever to defend retract or admit themselves in the wrong or to accept similar concessions on our part
For instance whenI flung the cat out of an upper window though I did it from no illfeeling and it didnt hurt the cat I was ready after a moments reflection to own I was wrong as a gentleman should
But was the matter allowed to end there
I trow not
Again when Harold was locked up in his room all day for assault and battery upon a neighbours pigan action he would have scorned being indeed on the friendliest terms with the porker in questionthere was no handsome expression of regret on the discovery of the real culprit
What Harold had felt was not so much the imprisonmentindeed he had very soon escaped by the window with assistance from his allies and had only gone back in time for his releaseas the Olympian habit
A word would have set all right but of course that word was never spoken
Well
The Olympians are all past and gone
Somehow the sun does not seem to shine so brightly as it used the trackless meadows of old time have shrunk and dwindled away to a few poor acres
A saddening doubt a dull suspicion creeps over me
Et in Arcadia egoI certainly did once inhabit Arcady
Can it be I too have become an Olympian
A HOLIDAY
The masterful wind was up and out shouting and chasing the lord of the morning
Poplars swayed and tossed with a roaring swish dead leaves sprang aloft and whirled into space and all the clearswept heaven seemed to thrill with sound like a great harp
It was one of the first awakenings of the year
The earth stretched herself smiling in her sleep and everything leapt and pulsed to the stir of the giants movement
With us it was a whole holiday the occasion a birthdayit matters not whose
Some one of us had had presents and pretty conventional speeches and had glowed with that sense of heroism which is no less sweet that nothing has been done to deserve it
But the holiday was for all the rapture of awakening Nature for all the various outdoor joys of puddles and sun and hedgebreaking for all
Coltlike I ran through the meadows frisking happy heels in the face of Nature laughing responsive
Above the sky was bluest of the blue wide pools left by the winters floods flashed the colour back true and brilliant and the soft air thrilled with the germinating touch that seemed to kindle something in my own small person as well as in the rash primrose already lurking in sheltered haunts
Out into the brimming sun bathed world I sped free of lessons free of discipline and correction for one day at least
My legs ran of themselves and though I heard my name called faint and shrill behind there was no stopping for me
It was only Harold I concluded and his legs though shorter than mine were good for a longer spurt than this
Then I heard it called again but this time more faintly with a pathetic break in the middle and I pulled up short recognising Charlottes plaintive note
She panted up anon and dropped on the turf beside me
Neither had any desire for talk the glow and the glory of existing on this perfect morning were satisfaction full and sufficient
Wheres Harold I asked presently
Oh hes just playin muffinman as usual said Charlotte with petulance
Fancy wanting to be a muffinman on a whole holiday
It was a strange craze certainly but Harold who invented his own games and played them without assistance always stuck staunchly to a new fad till he had worn it quite out
Just at present he was a muffinman and day and night he went through passages and up and down staircases ringing a noiseless bell and offering phantom muffins to invisible wayfarers
It sounds a poor sort of sport and yetto pass along busy streets of your own building for ever ringing an imaginary bell and offering airy muffins of your own make to a bustling thronging crowd of your own creationthere were points about the game it cannot be denied though it seemed scarce in harmony with this radiant windswept morning
And Edward where is he
I questioned again
Hes coming along by the road said Charlotte
Hell be crouching in the ditch when we get there and hes going to be a grizzly bear and spring out on us only you mustnt say I told you cos its to be a surprise
All right I said magnanimously
Come on and lets be surprised
But I could not help feeling that on this day of days even a grizzly felt misplaced and common
Sure enough an undeniable bear sprang out on us as we dropped into the road then ensued shrieks growlings revolvershots and unrecorded heroisms till Edward condescended at last to roll over and die bulking large and grim an unmitigated grizzly
It was an understood thing that whoever took upon himself to be a bear must eventually die sooner or later even if he were the eldest born else life would have been all strife and carnage and the Age of Acorns have displaced our hardwon civilisation
This little affair concluded with satisfaction to all parties concerned we rambled along the road picking up the defaulting Harold by the way muffinless now and in his right and social mind
What would you do
asked Charlotte presentlythe book of the moment always dominating her thoughts until it was sucked dry and cast asidewhat would you do if you saw two lions in the road one on each side and you didnt know if they was loose or if they was chained up
Do
shouted Edward valiantly I shouldI shouldI should His boastful accents died away into a mumble Dunno what I should do
Shouldnt do anything I observed after consideration and really it would be difficult to arrive at a wiser conclusion
If it came to DOING remarked Harold reflectively the lions would do all the doing there was to do wouldnt they
But if they was GOOD lions rejoined Charlotte they would do as they would be done by
Ah but how are you to know a good lion from a bad one
said Edward
The books dont tell you at all and the lions aint marked any different
Why there arent any good lions said Harold hastily
Oh yes there are heaps and heaps contradicted Edward
Nearly all the lions in the storybooks are good lions
There was Androcles lion and St Jeromes lion andandthe Lion and the Unicorn He beat the Unicorn observed Harold dubiously all round the town
That PROVES he was a good lion cried Edwards triumphantly
But the question is how are you to tell em when you see em
I should ask Martha said Harold of the simple creed
Edward snorted contemptuously then turned to Charlotte
Look here he said lets play at lions anyhow and Ill run on to that corner and be a lionIll be two lions one on each side of the roadand youll come along and you wont know whether Im chained up or not and thatll be the fun
No thank you said Charlotte firmly youll be chained up till Im quite close to you and then youll be loose and youll tear me in pieces and make my frock all dirty and praps youll hurt me as well
I know your lions
No I wont I swear I wont protested Edward
Ill be quite a new lion this timesomething you cant even imagine
And he raced off to his post
Charlotte hesitated then she went timidly on at each step growing less Charlotte the mummer of a minute and more the anxious Pilgrim of all time
The lions wrath waxed terrible at her approach his roaring filled the startled air
I waited until they were both thoroughly absorbed and then I slipped through the hedge out of the trodden highway into the vacant meadow spaces
It was not that I was unsociable nor that I knew Edwards lions to the point of satiety but the passion and the call of the divine morning were high in my blood
Earth to earth
That was the frank note the joyous summons of the day and they could not but jar and seem artificial these human discussions and pretences when boon Nature reticent no more was singing that fullthroated song of hers that thrills and claims control of every fibre
The air was wine the moist earthsmell wine the larks song the wafts from the cowshed at top of the field the pant and smoke of a distant trainall were wineor song was it
or odour this unity they all blended into
I had no words then to describe it that earth effluence of which I was so conscious nor indeed have I found words since
I ran sideways shouting I dug glad heels into the squelching soil I splashed diamond showers from puddles with a stick I hurled clods skywards at random and presently I somehow found myself singing
The words were mere nonsense irresponsible babble the tune was an improvisation a weary unrhythmic thing of rise and fall and yet it seemed to me a genuine utterance and just at that moment the one thing fitting and right and perfect
Humanity would have rejected it with scorn Nature everywhere singing in the same key recognised and accepted it without a flicker of dissent
All the time the hearty wind was calling to me companionably from where he swung and bellowed in the treetops
Take me for guide today he seemed to plead
Other holidays you have tramped it in the track of the stolid unswerving sun a belated truant you have dragged a weary foot homeward with only a pale expressionless moon for company
Today why not I the trickster the hypocrite
I who whip round corners and bluster relapse and evade then rally and pursue
I can lead you the best and rarest dance of any for I am the strong capricious one the lord of misrule and I alone am irresponsible and unprincipled and obey no law
And for me I was ready enough to fall in with the fellows humour was not this a whole holiday
So we sheered off together arminarm so to speak and with fullest confidence I took the jigging thwartwise course my chainless pilot laid for me
A whimsical comrade I found him ere he had done with me
Was it in jest or with some serious purpose of his own that he brought me plump upon a pair of lovers silent face to face oer a discreet unwinking stile
As a rule this sort of thing struck me as the most pitiful tomfoolery
Two calves rubbing noses through a gate were natural and right and within the order of things but that human beings with salient interests and active pursuits beckoning them on from every side could thus
Well it was a thing to hurry past shamed of face and think on no more
But this morning everything I met seemed to be accounted for and set in tune by that same magical touch in the air and it was with a certain surprise that I found myself regarding these fatuous ones with kindliness instead of contempt as I rambled by unheeded of them
There was indeed some reconciling influence abroad which could bring the like antics into harmony with bud and growth and the frolic air
A puff on the right cheek from my wilful companion sent me off at a fresh angle and presently I came in sight of the village church sitting solitary within its circle of elms
From forth the vestry window projected two small legs gyrating hungry for foothold with larcenynot to say sacrilegein their every wriggle a godless sight for a supporter of the Establishment
Though the rest was hidden I knew the legs well enough they were usually attached to the body of Bill Saunders the peerless bad boy of the village
Bills coveted booty too I could easily guess at that it came from the Vicars store of biscuits kept as I knew in a cupboard along with his official trappings
For a moment I hesitated then I passed on my way
I protest I was not on Bills side but then neither was I on the Vicars and there was something in this immoral morning which seemed to say that perhaps after all Bill had as much right to the biscuits as the Vicar and would certainly enjoy them better and anyhow it was a disputable point and no business of mine
Nature who had accepted me for ally cared little who had the worlds biscuits and assuredly was not going to let any friend of hers waste his time in playing policeman for Society
He was tugging at me anew my insistent guide and I felt sure as I rambled off in his wake that he had more holiday matter to show me
And so indeed he had and all of it was to the same lawless tune
Like a black pirate flag on the blue ocean of air a hawk hung ominous then plummetwise dropped to the hedgerow whence there rose thin and shrill a piteous voice of squealing
By the time I got there a whisk of feathers on the turflike scattered playbillswas all that remained to tell of the tragedy just enacted
Yet Nature smiled and sang on pitiless gay impartial
To her who took no sides there was every bit as much to be said for the hawk as for the chaffinch
Both were her children and she would show no preferences
Further on a hedgehog lay dead athwart the pathnay more than dead decadent distinctly a sorry sight for one that had known the fellow in more bustling circumstances
Nature might at least have paused to shed one tear over this rough jacketed little son of hers for his wasted aims his cancelled ambitions his whole career of usefulness cut suddenly short
But not a bit of it
Jubilant as ever her song went bubbling on and Deathin Life and again LifeinDeath were its alternate burdens
And looking round and seeing the sheepnibbled heels of turnips that dotted the ground their hearts eaten out of them in frost bound days now over and done I seemed to discern faintly a something of the stern meaning in her valorous chant
My invisible companion was singing also and seemed at times to be chuckling softly to himself doubtless at thought of the strange new lessons he was teaching me perhaps too at a special bit of waggishness he had still in store
For when at last he grew weary of such insignificant earthbound company he deserted me at a certain spot I knew then dropped subsided and slunk away into nothingness
I raised my eyes and before me grim and lichened stood the ancient whippingpost of the village its sides fretted with the initials of a generation that scorned its mute lesson but still clipped by the stout rusty shackles that had tethered the wrists of such of that generations ancestors as had dared to mock at order and law
Had I been an infant Sterne here was a grand chance for sentimental output
As things were I could only hurry homewards my moral tail well between my legs with an uneasy feeling as I glanced back over my shoulder that there was more in this chance than met the eye
And outside our gate I found Charlotte alone and crying
Edward it seemed had persuaded her to hide in the full expectation of being duly found and ecstatically pounced upon then he had caught sight of the butchers cart and forgetting his obligations had rushed off for a ride
Harold it further appeared greatly coveting tadpoles and topheavy with the eagerness of possession had fallen into the pond
This in itself was nothing but on attempting to sneak in by the back door he had rendered up his duckweedbedabbled person into the hands of an aunt and had been promptly sent off to bed and this on a holiday was very much
The moral of the whipping post was working itself out and I was not in the least surprised when on reaching home I was seized upon and accused of doing something I had never even thought of
And my frame of mind was such that I could only wish most heartily that I had done it
A WHITEWASHED UNCLE In our small lives that day was eventful when another uncle was to come down from town and submit his character and qualifications albeit unconsciously to our careful criticism
Previous uncles had been weighed in the balance andalas found grievously wanting
There was Uncle Thomasa failure from the first
Not that his disposition was malevolent nor were his habits such as to unfit him for decent society but his rooted conviction seemed to be that the reason of a childs existence was to serve as a butt for senseless adult jokesor what from the accompanying guffaws of laughter appeared to be intended for jokes
Now we were anxious that he should have a perfectly fair trial so in the toolhouse between breakfast and lessons we discussed and examined all his witticisms one by one calmly critically dispassionately
It was no good we could not discover any salt in them
And as only a genuine gift of humour could have saved Uncle Thomasfor he pretended to naught besideshe was reluctantly writ down a hopeless impostor
Uncle Georgethe youngestwas distinctly more promising
He accompanied us cheerily round the establishmentsuffered himself to be introduced to each of the cows held out the right hand of fellowship to the pig and even hinted that a pair of pinkeyed Himalayan rabbits might arriveunexpectedlyfrom town some day
We were just considering whether in this fertile soil an apparently accidental remark on the solid qualities of guinea pigs or ferrets might haply blossom and bring forth fruit when our governess appeared on the scene
Uncle Georges manner at once underwent a complete and contemptible change
His interest in rational topics seemed like a fountains sickening pulse to flag and ebb away and though Miss Smedleys ostensible purpose was to take Selina for her usual walk I can vouch for it that Selina spent her morning ratting along with the keepers boy and me while if Miss Smedley walked with any one it would appear to have been with Uncle George
But despicable as his conduct had been he underwent no hasty condemnation
The defection was discussed in all its bearings but it seemed sadly clear at last that this uncle must possess some innate badness of character and fondness for low company
We who from daily experience knew Miss Smedley like a bookwere we not only too well aware that she had neither accomplishments nor charms no characteristic in fact but an inbred viciousness of temper and disposition
True she knew the dates of the English kings by heart but how could that profit Uncle George who having passed into the army had ascended beyond the need of useful information
Our bows and arrows on the other hand had been freely placed at his disposal and a soldier should not have hesitated in his choice a moment
No Uncle George had fallen from grace and was unanimously damned
And the nonarrival of the Himalayan rabbits was only another nail in his coffin
Uncles therefore were just then a heavy and lifeless market and there was little inclination to deal
Still it was agreed that Uncle William who had just returned from India should have as fair a trial as the others more especially as romantic possibilities might well be embodied in one who had held the gorgeous East in fee
Selina had kicked my shinslike the girl she isduring a scuffle in the passage and I was still rubbing them with one hand when I found that the uncleonapprobation was half heartedly shaking the other
A florid elderly man and unmistakably nervous he dropped our grimy paws in succession and turning very red with an awkward simulation of heartiness Well h are y all
he said Glad to see me eh
As we could hardly in justice be expected to have formed an opinion on him at that early stage we could but look at each other in silence which scarce served to relieve the tension of the situation
Indeed the cloud never really lifted during his stay
In talking it over later some one put forward the suggestion that he must at some time or other have committed a stupendous crime but I could not bring myself to believe that the man though evidently unhappy was really guilty of anything and I caught him once or twice looking at us with evident kindliness though seeing himself observed he blushed and turned away his head
When at last the atmosphere was clear of this depressing influence we met despondently in the potatocellarall of us that is but Harold who had been told off to accompany his relative to the station and the feeling was unanimous that at an uncle William could not be allowed to pass
Selina roundly declared him a beast pointing out that he had not even got us a halfholiday and indeed there seemed little to do but to pass sentence
We were about to put it when Harold appeared on the scene his red face round eyes and mysterious demeanour hinting at awful portents
Speechless he stood a space then slowly drawing his hand from the pocket of his knickerbockers he displayed on a dirty palm onetwothreefour halfcrowns
We could but gazetranced breathless mute never had any of us seen in the aggregate so much bullion before
Then Harold told his tale
I took the old fellow to the station he said and as we went along I told him all about the stationmasters family and how I had seen the porter kissing our housemaid and what a nice fellow he was with no airs or affectation about him and anything I thought would be of interest
 but he didnt seem to pay much attention but walked along puffing his cigar and once I thoughtIm not certain but I THOUGHTI heard him say Well thank God thats over
When we got to the station he stopped suddenly and said Hold on a minute
Then he shoved these into my hand in a frightened sort of way and said Look here youngster
These are for you and the other kids
Buy what you likemake little beasts of yourselvesonly dont tell the old people mind
Now cut away home
So I cut
A solemn hush fell on the assembly broken first by the small Charlotte
I didnt know she observed dreamily that there were such good men anywhere in the world
I hope hell die to night for then hell go straight to heaven
But the repentant Selina bewailed herself with tears and sobs refusing to be comforted for that in her haste she had called this whitesouled relative a beast
Ill tell you what well do said Edward the mastermind risingas he always didto the situation Well christen the piebald pig after himthe one that hasnt got a name yet
And thatll show were sorry for our mistake
II christened that pig this morning Harold guiltily confessed I christened it after the curate
Im very sorry but he came and bowed to me last night after you others had all been sent to bed earlyand somehow I felt I HAD to do it
Oh but that doesnt count said Edward hastily because we werent all there
Well take that christening off and call it Uncle William
And you can save up the curate for the next litter
And the motion being agreed to without a division the House went into Committee of Supply
ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS Lets pretend suggested Harold that were Cavaliers and Roundheads and YOU be a Roundhead
O bother I replied drowsily we pretended that yesterday and its not my turn to be a Roundhead anyhow
The fact is I was lazy and the call to arms fell on indifferent ears
We three younger ones were stretched at length in the orchard
The sun was hot the season merry June and never I thought had there been such wealth and riot of buttercups throughout the lush grass
Greenandgold was the dominant key that day
Instead of active pretence with its shouts and perspiration how much betterI heldto lie at ease and pretend to ones self in green and golden fancies slipping the husk and passing a careless lounger through a sleepy imaginary world all gold and green
But the persistent Harold was not to be fobbed of
Well then he began afresh lets pretend were Knights of the Round Table and with a rush Ill be Lancelot
I wont play unless Im Lancelot I said
I didnt mean it really but the game of Knights always began with this particular contest
O PLEASE implored Harold
You know when Edwards here I never get a chance of being Lancelot
I havent been Lancelot for weeks
Then I yielded gracefully
All right I said
Ill be Tristram
O but you cant cried Harold again
Charlotte has always been Tristram
She wont play unless shes allowed to be Tristram
Be somebody else this time
Charlotte said nothing but breathed hard looking straight before her
The peerless hunter and harper was her special hero of romance and rather than see the part in less appreciative hands she would even have returned sadly to the stuffy schoolroom
I dont care I said Ill be anything
Ill be Sir Kay
Come on
Then once more in this countrys story the mailclad knights paced through the greenwood shaw questing adventure redressing wrong and bandits five to one broke and fled discomfited to their caves
Once again were damsels rescued dragons disembowelled and giants in every corner of the orchard deprived of their already superfluous number of heads while Palamides the Saracen waited for us by the well and Sir Breuse Saunce Pite vanished in craven flight before the skilled spear that was his terror and his bane
Once more the lists were dight in Camelot and all was gay with shimmer of silk and gold the earth shook with thunder of horses ashstaves flew in splinters and the firmament rang to the clash of sword on helm
The varying fortune of the day swung doubtfulnow on this side now on that till at last Lancelot grim and great thrusting through the press unhorsed Sir Tristram an easy task and bestrode her threatening doom while the Cornish knight forgetting hard won fame of old cried piteously Youre hurting me I tell you
and youre tearing my frock
Then it happed that Sir Kay hurtling to the rescue stopped short in his stride catching sight suddenly through appleboughs of a gleam of scarlet afar off while the confused tramp of many horses mingled with talk and laughter was borne to our ears
What is it
inquired Tristram sitting up and shaking out her curls while Lancelot forsook the clanging lists and trotted nimbly to the hedge
I stood spellbound for a moment longer and then with a cry of Soldiers
I was off to the hedge Charlotte picking herself up and scurrying after
Down the road they came two and two at an easy walk scarlet flamed in the eye bits jingled and saddles squeaked delightfully while the men in a halo of dust smoked their short clays like the heroes they were
In a swirl of intoxicating glory the troop clinked and clattered by while we shouted and waved jumping up and down and the big jolly horsemen acknowledged the salute with easy condescension
The moment they were past we were through the hedge and after them
Soldiers were not the common stuff of everyday life
There had been nothing like this since the winter before last when on a certain afternoonbare of leaf and monochrome in its hue of sodden fallow and frostnipt copsesuddenly the hounds had burst through the fence with their mellow cry and all the paddock was for the minute reverberant of thudding hoof and dotted with glancing red
But this was better since it could only mean that blows and bloodshed were in the air
Is there going to be a battle
panted Harold hardly able to keep up for excitement
Of course there is I replied
Were just in time
Come on
Perhaps I ought to have known better and yet The pigs and poultry with whom we chiefly consorted could instruct us little concerning the peace that in these latter days lapped this sea girt realm
In the schoolroom we were just now dallying with the Wars of the Roses and did not legends of the countryside inform us how Cavaliers had once galloped up and down these very lanes from their quarters in the village
Here now were soldiers unmistakable and if their business was not fighting what was it
Sniffing the joy of battle we followed hard on their tracks
Wont Edward be sorry puffed Harold that hes begun that beastly Latin
It did indeed seem hard
Edward the most martial spirit of us all was drearily conjugating AMO of all verbs between four walls while Selina who ever thrilled ecstatic to a red coat was struggling with the uncouth German tongue
Age I reflected carries its penalties
It was a grievous disappointment to us that the troop passed through the village unmolested
Every cottage I pointed out to my companions ought to have been loopholed and strongly held
But no opposition was offered to the soldiers who indeed conducted themselves with a recklessness and a want of precaution that seemed simply criminal
At the last cottage a transitory gleam of common sense flickered across me and turning on Charlotte I sternly ordered her back
The small maiden docile but exceedingly dolorous dragged reluctant feet homewards heavy at heart that she was to behold no stout fellows slain that day but Harold and I held steadily on expecting every instant to see the environing hedges crackle and spit forth the leaden death
Will they be Indians
inquired my brother meaning the enemy or Roundheads or what
I reflected
Harold always required direct straightforward answersnot faltering suppositions
They wont be Indians I replied at last nor yet Roundheads
There havent been any Roundheads seen about here for a long time
Theyll be Frenchmen
Harolds face fell
All right he said Frenchmenll do but I did hope theyd be Indians
If they were going to be Indians I explained II dont think Id go on
Because when Indians take you prisoner they scalp you first and then burn you at a stake
But Frenchmen dont do that sort of thing
Are you quite sure
asked Harold doubtfully
Quite I replied
Frenchmen only shut you up in a thing called the Bastille and then you get a file sent in to you in a loaf of bread and saw the bars through and slide down a rope and they all fire at youbut they dont hit youand you run down to the seashore as hard as you can and swim off to a British frigate and there you are
Harold brightened up again
The programme was rather attractive
If they try to take us prisoner he said wewe wont run will we
Meanwhile the craven foe was a long time showing himself and we were reaching strange outland country uncivilised wherein lions might be expected to prowl at nightfall
I had a stitch in my side and both Harolds stockings had come down
Just as I was beginning to have gloomy doubts of the proverbial courage of Frenchmen the officer called out something the men closed up and breaking into a trot the troopsalready far ahead vanished out of our sight
With a sinking at the heart I began to suspect we had been fooled
Are they charging
cried Harold weary but rallying gamely
I think not I replied doubtfully
When theres going to be a charge the officer always makes a speech and then they draw their swords and the trumpets blow andbut lets try a short cut
We may catch them up yet
So we struck across the fields and into another road and pounded down that and then over more fields panting downhearted yet hoping for the best
The sun went in and a thin drizzle began to fall we were muddy breathless almost dead beat but we blundered on till at last we struck a road more brutally more callously unfamiliar than any road I ever looked upon
Not a hint nor a sign of friendly direction or assistance on the dogged white face of it
There was no longer any disguising it we were hopelessly lost
The small rain continued steadily the evening began to come on
Really there are moments when a fellow is justified in crying and I would have cried too if Harold had not been there
That rightminded child regarded an elder brother as a veritable god and I could see that he felt himself as secure as if a whole Brigade of Guards hedged him round with protecting bayonets
But I dreaded sore lest he should begin again with his questions
As I gazed in dumb appeal on the face of unresponsive nature the sound of nearing wheels sent a pulse of hope through my being increasing to rapture as I recognised in the approaching vehicle the familiar carriage of the old doctor
If ever a god emerged from a machine it was when this heavensent friend recognising us stopped and jumped out with a cheery hail
Harold rushed up to him at once
Have you been there
he cried
Was it a jolly fight
who beat
were there many people killed
The doctor appeared puzzled
I briefly explained the situation
I see said the doctor looking grave and twisting his face this way and that
Well the fact is there isnt going to be any battle today
Its been put off on account of the change in the weather
You will have due notice of the renewal of hostilities
And now youd better jump in and Ill drive you home
Youve been running a fine rig
Why you might have both been taken and shot as spies
This special danger had never even occurred to us
The thrill of it accentuated the cosey homelike feeling of the cushions we nestled into as we rolled homewards
The doctor beguiled the journey with bloodcurdling narratives of personal adventure in the tented field he having followed the profession of arms so it seemed in every quarter of the globe
Time the destroyer of all things beautiful subsequently revealed the baselessness of these legends but what of that
There are higher things than truth and we were almost reconciled by the time we were dropped at our gate to the fact that the battle had been postponed
THE FINDING OF THE PRINCESS
It was the day I was promoted to a toothbrush
The girls irrespective of age had been thus distinguished some time before why we boys could never rightly understand except that it was part and parcel of a system of studied favouritism on behalf of creatures both physically inferior and as was shown by a fondness for talebearing of weaker mental fibre
It was not that we yearned after these strange instruments in themselves Edward indeed applied his to the scrubbingout of his squirrels cage and for personal use when a superior eye was grim on him borrowed Harolds or mine indifferently but the nimbus of distinction that clung to themthat we coveted exceedingly
What more indeed was there to ascend to before the remote but still possible razor and strop
Perhaps the exaltation had mounted to my head or nature and the perfect morning joined to him at disaffection anyhow having breakfasted and triumphantly repeated the collect I had broken down in the last Sundaytwas one without rhythm or alliteration a most objectionable collecthaving achieved thus much the small natural man in me rebelled and I vowed as I straddled and spat about the stableyard in feeble imitation of the coachman that lessons might go to the Inventor of them
It was only geography that morning any way and the practical thing was worth any quantity of bookish theoretic as for me I was going on my travels and imports and exports populations and capitals might very well wait while I explored the breathing coloured world outside
True a fellowrebel was wanted and Harold might as a rule have been counted on with certainty
But just then Harold was very proud
The week before he had gone into tables and had been endowed with a new slate having a miniature sponge attached wherewith we washed the faces of Charlottes dolls thereby producing an unhealthy pallor which struck terror into the childs heart always timorous regarding epidemic visitations
As to tables nobody knew exactly what they were least of all Harold but it was a step over the heads of the rest and therefore a subject for selfadulation and generally speakingairs so that Harold hugging his slate and his chains was out of the question now
In such a matter girls were worse than useless as wanting the necessary tenacity of will and contempt for selfconstituted authority
So eventually I slipped through the hedge a solitary protestant and issued forth on the lane what time the rest of the civilised world was sitting down to lessons
The scene was familiar enough and yet this morning how different it all seemed
The act with its daring tinted everything with new strange hues affecting the individual with a sort of bruised feeling just below the pit of the stomach that was intensified whenever his thoughts flew back to the ink stained smelly schoolroom
And could this be really me
or was I only contemplating from the schoolroom aforesaid some other jolly young mutineer faring forth under the genial sun
Anyhow here was the friendly well in its old place half way up the lane
Hither the yokeshouldering villagefolk were wont to come to fill their clinking buckets when the drippings made worms of wet in the thick dust of the road
They had flat wooden crosses inside each pail which floated on the top and we were instructed served to prevent the water from slopping over
We used to wonder by what magic this strange principle worked and who first invented the crosses and whether he got a peerage for it
But indeed the well was a centre of mystery for a hornets nest was somewhere hard by and the very thought was fearsome
Wasps we knew well and disdained storming them in their fastnesses
But these great Beasts vestured in angry orange three stings from whichso t was averredwould kill a horse these were of a different kidney and their warning drone suggested prudence and retreat
At this time neither villagers nor hornets encroached on the stillness lessons apparently pervaded all Nature
So after dabbling awhile in the wellwhat boy has ever passed a bit of water without messing in itI scrambled through the hedge avoiding the hornethaunted side and struck into the silence of the copse
If the lane had been deserted this was loneliness become personal
Here mystery lurked and peeped here brambles caught and held with a purpose of their own and saplings whipped the face with human spite
The copse too proved vaster in extent more direfully drawn out than one would ever have guessed from its frontage on the lane and I was really glad when at last the wood opened and sloped down to a streamlet brawling forth into the sunlight
By this cheery companion I wandered along conscious of little but that Nature in providing store of waterrats had thoughtfully furnished provender of rightsized stones
Rapids also there were telling of canoes and portagescrinkling bays and inletscaves for pirates and hidden treasuresthe wise Dame had forgotten nothingtill at last after what lapse of time I know not my further course though not the streams was barred by some six feet of stout wire netting stretched from side to side just where a thick hedge arching till it touched forbade all further view
The excitement of the thing was becoming thrilling
A Black Flag must surely be fluttering close by
Here was evidently a malignant contrivance of the Pirates designed to baffle our gun boats when we dashed upstream to shell them from their lair
A gunboat indeed might well have hesitated so stout was the netting so close the hedge but I spied where a rabbit was wont to pass close down by the waters edge where a rabbit could go a boy could follow albeit stomachwise and with one leg in the stream so the passage was achieved and I stood inside safe but breathless at the sight
Gone was the brambled waste gone the flickering tangle of woodland
Instead terrace after terrace of shaven sward stone edged urncornered stepped delicately down to where the stream now tamed and educated passed from one to another marble basin in which on occasion gleams of red hinted at goldfish in among the spreading waterlilies
The scene lay silent and slumbrous in the brooding noonday sun the drowsing peacock squatted humped on the lawn no fish leapt in the pools nor bird declared himself from the environing hedges
Selfconfessed it was here then at last the Garden of Sleep
Two things in those old days I held in especial distrust gamekeepers and gardeners
Seeing however no baleful apparitions of either nature I pursued my way between rich flowerbeds in search of the necessary Princess
Conditions de56clared her presence patently as trumpets without this centre such surroundings could not exist
A pavilion gold topped wreathed with lush jessamine beckoned with a special significance over closeset shrubs
There if anywhere She should be enshrined
Instinct and some knowledge of the habits of princesses triumphed for indeed there She was
In no tranced repose however but laughingly struggling to disengage her hand from the grasp of a grownup man who occupied the marble bench with her
As to age I suppose now that the two swung in respective scales that pivoted on twenty
But children heed no minor distinctions to them the inhabited world is composed of the two main divisions children and upgrown people the latter being in no way superior to the formeronly hopelessly different
These two then belonged to the grownup section
I paused thinking it strange they should prefer seclusion when there were fish to be caught and butterflies to hunt in the sun outside and as I cogitated thus the grownup man caught sight of me
Hallo sprat
he said with some abruptness where do you spring from
I came up the stream I explained politely and comprehensively and I was only looking for the Princess
Then you are a waterbaby he replied
And what do you think of the Princess now youve found her
I think she is lovely I said and doubtless I was right having never learned to flatter
But shes wideawake so I suppose somebody has kissed her
This very natural deduction moved the grownup man to laughter but the Princess turning red and jumping up declared that it was time for lunch
Come along then said the grownup man and you too Water baby come and have something solid
You must want it
I accompanied them without any feeling of false delicacy
The world as known to me was spread with food each several midday and the particular table one sat at seemed a matter of no importance
The palace was very sumptuous and beautiful just what a palace ought to be and we were met by a stately lady rather more grownup than the Princessapparently her mother
My friend the Man was very kind and introduced me as the Captain saying I had just run down from Aldershot
I didnt know where Aldershot was but had no manner of doubt that he was perfectly right
As a rule indeed grownup people are fairly correct on matters of fact it is in the higher gift of imagination that they are so sadly to seek
The lunch was excellent and varied
Another gentleman in beautiful clothesa lord presumablylifted me into a high carved chair and stood behind it brooding over me like a Providence
I endeavoured to explain who I was and where I had come from and to impress the company with my own toothbrush and Harolds tables but either they were stupidor is it a characteristic of Fairyland that every one laughs at the most ordinary remarks
My friend the Man said goodnaturedly All right Waterbaby you came up the stream and thats good enough for us
The lorda reserved sort of man I thoughttook no share in the conversation
After lunch I walked on the terrace with the Princess and my friend the Man and was very proud
And I told him what I was going to be and he told me what he was going to be and then I remarked I suppose you two are going to get married
He only laughed after the Fairy fashion
Because if you arent I added you really ought to meaning only that a man who discovered a Princess living in the right sort of Palace like this and didnt marry her there and then was false to all recognised tradition
They laughed again and my friend suggested I should go down to the pond and look at the goldfish while they went for a stroll
I was sleepy and assented but before they left me the grownup man put two halfcrowns in my hand for the purpose he explained of treating the other waterbabies
I was so touched by this crowning mark of friendship that I nearly cried and thought much more of his generosity than of the fact that the Princess ere she moved away stooped down and kissed me
I watched them disappear down the pathhow naturally arms seem to go round waists in Fairylandand then my cheek on the cool marble lulled by the trickle of water I slipped into dreamland out of real and magic world alike
When I woke the sun had gone in a chill wind set all the leaves awhispering and the peacock on the lawn was harshly calling up the rain
A wild unreasoning panic possessed me and I sped out of the garden like a guilty thing wriggled through the rabbitrun and threaded my doubtful way homewards hounded by nameless terrors
The half crowns happily remained solid and real to the touch but could I hope to bear such treasure safely through the brigandhaunted wood
It was a dirty weary little object that entered its home at nightfall by the unassuming aid of the scullerywindow and only to be sent tealess to bed seemed infinite mercy to him
Officially tealess that is for as was usual after such escapades a sympathetic housemaid coming delicately by backstairs stayed him with chunks of cold pudding and condolence till his small skin was tight as any drum
Then nature asserting herself I passed into the comforting kingdom of sleep where a golden carp of fattest build I oared it in translucent waters with a new halfcrown snug under right fin and left and thrust up a nose through waterlily leaves to be kissed by a roseflushed Princess
SAWDUST AND SIN A belt of rhododendrons grew close down to one side of our pond and along the edge of it many things flourished rankly
If you crept through the undergrowth and crouched by the waters rim it was easyif your imagination were in healthy working orderto transport yourself in a trice to the heart of a tropical forest
Overhead the monkeys chattered parrots flashed from bough to bough strange large blossoms shone around you and the push and rustle of great beasts moving unseen thrilled you deliciously
And if you lay down with your nose an inch or two from the water it was not long ere the old sense of proportion vanished clean away
The glittering insects that darted to and fro on its surface became seamonsters dire the gnats that hung above them swelled to albatrosses and the pond itself stretched out into a vast inland sea whereon a navy might ride secure and whence at any moment the hairy scalp of a sea serpent might be seen to emerge
It is impossible however to play at tropical forests properly when homely accents of the human voice intrude and all my hopes of seeing a tiger seized by a crocodile while drinking vide picturebooks passim vanished abruptly and earth resumed her old dimensions when the sound of Charlottes prattle somewhere hard by broke in on my primeval seclusion
Looking out from the bushes I saw her trotting towards an open space of lawn the other side the pond chattering to herself in her accustomed fashion a doll tucked under either arm and her brow knit with care
Propping up her double burden against a friendly stump she sat down in front of them as full of worry and anxiety as a Chancellor on a Budget night
Her victims who stared resignedly in front of them were recognisable as Jerry and Rosa
Jerry hailed from far Japan his hair was straight and black his one garment cotton of a simple blue and his reputation was distinctly bad
Jerome was his proper name from his supposed likeness to the holy man who hung in a print on the staircase though a shaven crown was the only thing in common twixt Western saint and Eastern sinner
Rosa was typical British from her flaxen poll to the stout calves she displayed so liberally and in character she was of the blameless order of those who have not yet been found out
I suspected Jerry from the first there was a latent devilry in his slant eyes as he sat there moodily and knowing what he was capable of I scented trouble in store for Charlotte
Rosa I was not so sure about she sat demurely and upright and looked far away into the treetops in a visionary worldforgetting sort of way yet the prim purse of her mouth was somewhat overdone and her eyes glittered unnaturally
Now Im going to begin where I left off said Charlotte regardless of stops and thumping the turf with her fist excitedly and you must pay attention cos this is a treat to have a story told you before youre put to bed
Well so the White Rabbit scuttled off down the passage and Alice hoped hed come back cos he had a waistcoat on and her flamingo flew up a treebut we havent got to that part yetyou must wait a minute andwhere had I got to
Jerry only remained passive until Charlotte had got well under way and then began to heel over quietly in Rosas direction
His head fell on her plump shoulder causing her to start nervously
Charlotte seized and shook him with vigour O Jerry she cried piteously if youre not going to be good how ever shall I tell you my story
Jerrys face was injured innocence itself
Blame if you like Madam he seemed to say the eternal laws of gravitation but not a helpless puppet who is also an orphan and a stranger in the land
Now well go on began Charlotte once more
So she got into the garden at lastIve left out a lot but you wont care Ill tell you some other timeand they were all playing croquet and thats where the flamingo comes in and the Queen shouted out Off with her head
At this point Jerry collapsed forward suddenly and completely his bald pate between his knees
Charlotte was not very angry this time
The sudden development of tragedy in the story had evidently been too much for the poor fellow
She straightened him out wiped his nose and after trying him in various positions to which he refused to adapt himself she propped him against the shoulder of the apparently unconscious Rosa
Then my eyes were opened and the full measure of Jerrys infamy became apparent
This then was what he had been playing up for
The fellow had designs
I resolved to keep him under close observation
If youd been in the garden went on Charlotte reproachfully and flopped down like that when the Queen said Off with his head
shed have offed with your head but Alice wasnt that sort of girl at all
She just said Im not afraid of you youre nothing but a pack of cardsoh dear
Ive got to the end already and I hadnt begun hardly
I never can make my stories last out
Never mind Ill tell you another one
Jerry didnt seem to care now he had gained his end whether the stories lasted out or not
He was nestling against Rosas plump form with a look of satisfaction that was simply idiotic and one arm had disappeared from viewwas it round her waist
Rosas natural blush seemed deeper than usual her head inclined shyly it must have been round her waist
If it wasnt so near your bedtime continued Charlotte reflectively Id tell you a nice story with a bogy in it
But youd be frightened and youd dream of bogies all night
So Ill tell you one about a White Bear only you mustnt scream when the bear says Wow like I used to cos hes a good bear really Here Rosa fell flat on her back in the deadest of faints
Her limbs were rigid her eyes glassy what had Jerry been doing
It must have been something very bad for her to take on like that
I scrutinised him carefully while Charlotte ran to comfort the damsel
He appeared to be whistling a tune and regarding the scenery
If I only possessed Jerrys command of feature I thought to myself half regretfully I would never be found out in anything
Its all your fault Jerry said Charlotte reproachfully when the lady had been restored to consciousness Rosas as good as gold except when you make her wicked
Id put you in the corner only a stump hasnt got a cornerwonder why that is
Thought everything had corners
Never mind youll have to sit with your face to the wallSO
Now you can sulk if you like
Jerry seemed to hesitate a moment between the bliss of indulgence in sulks with a sense of injury and the imperious summons of beauty waiting to be wooed at his elbow then carried away by his passion he fell sideways across Rosas lap
One arm stuck stiffly upwards as in passionate protestation his amorous countenance was full of entreaty
Rosa hesitatedwaveredand yielded crushing his slight frame under the weight of her full bodied surrender
Charlotte had stood a good deal but it was possible to abuse even her patience
Snatching Jerry from his lawless embraces she reversed him across her knee and thenthe outrage offered to the whole superior sex in Jerrys hapless person was too painful to witness but though I turned my head away the sound of brisk slaps continued to reach my tingling ears
When I looked again Jerry was sitting up as before his garment somewhat crumpled was restored to its original position but his pallid countenance was set hard
Knowing as I did only too well what a volcano of passion and shame must be seething under that impassive exterior for the moment I felt sorry for him
Rosas face was still buried in her frock it might have been shame it might have been grief for Jerrys sufferings
But the callous Japanese never even looked her way
His heart was exceeding bitter within him
In merely following up his natural impulses he had run his head against convention and learnt how hard a thing it was and the sunshiny world was all black to him
Even Charlotte softened somewhat at the sight of his rigid misery
If youll say youre sorry
Jerome she said Ill say Im sorry too
Jerry only dropped his shoulders against the stump and stared out in the direction of his dear native Japan where love was no sin and smacking had not been introduced
Why had he ever left it
He would go back tomorrowand yet there were obstacles another grievance
Nature in endowing Jerry with every grace of form and feature along with a sensitive soul had somehow forgotten the gift of locomotion
There was a crackling in the bushes behind me with sharp short pants as of a small steamengine and Rollo the black retriever just released from his chain by some friendly hand burst through the underwood seeking congenial company
I joyfully hailed him to stop and be a panther but he sped away round the pond upset Charlotte with a boisterous caress and seizing Jerry by the middle disappeared with him down the drive
Charlotte raved panting behind the swiftfooted avenger of crime Rosa lay dishevelled bereft of consciousness Jerry himself spread helpless arms to heaven and I almost thought I heard a cry for mercy a tardy promise of amendment but it was too late
The Black Man had got Jerry at last and though the tear of sensibility might moisten the eye no one who really knew him could deny the justice of his fate
YOUNG ADAM CUPID NO one would have suspected Edward of being in love but that after breakfast with an overacted carelessness Anybody who likes he said can feed my rabbits and he disappeared with a jauntiness that deceived nobody in the direction of the orchard
Now kingdoms might totter and reel and convulsions change the map of Europe but the iron unwritten law prevailed that each boy severely fed his own rabbits
There was good ground then for suspicion and alarm and while the lettuce leaves were being drawn through the wires Harold and I conferred seriously on the situation
It may be thought that the affair was none of our business and indeed we cared little as individuals
We were only concerned as members of a corporation for each of whom the mental or physical ailment of one of his fellows might have farreaching effects
It was thought best that Harold as least open to suspicion of motive should be despatched to probe and peer
His instructions were to proceed by a report on the health of our rabbits in particular to glide gently into a discussion on rabbits in general their customs practices and vices to pass thence by a natural transition to the female sex the inherent flaws in its composition and the reasons for regarding it speaking broadly as dirt
He was especially to be very diplomatic and then to return and report progress
He departed on his mission gaily but his absence was short and his return discomfited and in tears seemed to betoken some want of parts for diplomacy
He had found Edward it appeared pacing the orchard with the sort of set smile that mountebanks wear in their precarious antics fixed painfully on his face as with pins
Harold had opened well on the rabbit subject but with a fatal confusion between the abstract and the concrete had then gone on to remark that Edwards lopeared doe with her long hindlegs and contemptuous twitch of the nose always reminded him of Sabina Larkin a nine yearold damsel child of a neighbouring farmer at which point Edward it would seem had turned upon and savagely maltreated him twisting his arm and punching him in the short ribs
So that Harold returned to the rabbithutches preceded by longdrawn wails anon wishing with sobs that he were a man to kick his lovelorn brother anon lamenting that ever he had been born
I was not big enough to stand up to Edward personally so I had to console the sufferer by allowing him to grease the wheels of the donkeycarta luscious treat that had been specially reserved for me a week past by the gardeners boy for putting in a good word on his behalf with the new kitchenmaid
Harold was soon all smiles and grease and I was not on the whole dissatisfied with the significant hint that had been gained as to the fons at origo mali
Fortunately means were at hand for resolving any doubts on the subject since the morning was Sunday and already the bells were ringing for church
Lest the connexion may not be evident at first sight I should explain that the gloomy period of church time with its enforced inaction and its lack of real interest passed too within sight of all that the village held of fairestwas just the one when a young mans fancies lightly turned to thoughts of love
For such trifling the rest of the week afforded no leisure but in churchwell there was really nothing else to do
True naughtsandcrosses might be indulged in on flyleaves of prayerbooks while the Litany dragged its slow length along but what balm or what solace could be found for the sermon
Naturally the eye wandering here and there among the serried ranks made bold untrammelled choice among our fair fellowsupplicants
It was in this way that some months earlier under the exceptional strain of the Athanasian Creed my roving fancy had settled upon the bakers wife as a fit object for a lifelong devotion
Her riper charms had conquered a heart which none of her bemuslined tittering juniors had been able to subdue and that she was already wedded had never occurred to me as any bar to my affection
Edwards general demeanour then during morning service was safe to convict him but there was also a special test for the particular case
It happened that we sat in a transept and the Larkins being behind us Edwards only chance of feasting on Sabinas charms was in the alltoo fleeting interval when we swung round eastwards
I was not mistaken
During the singing of the Benedictus the impatient one made several false starts and at last he slewed fairly round before As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be was half finished
The evidence was conclusive a court of law could have desired no better
The fact being patent the next thing was to grapple with it and my mind was fully occupied during the sermon
There was really nothing unfair or unbrotherly in my attitude
A philosophic affection such as mine own which clashed with nothing was I held permissible but the volcanic passions in which Edward indulged about once a quarter were a serious interference with business
To make matters worse next week there was a circus coming to the neighbourhood to which we had all been strictly forbidden to go and without Edward no visit in contempt of law and orders could be successfully brought off
I had sounded him as to the circus on our way to church and he had replied briefly that the very thought of a clown made him sick
Morbidity could no further go
But the sermon came to an end without any line of conduct having suggested itself and I walked home in some depression feeling sadly that Venus was in the ascendant and in direful opposition while Aurigathe circus stardrooped declinant perilously near the horizon
By the irony of fate Aunt Eliza of all people turned out to be the Dea ex machina which thing fell out in this wise
It was that ladys obnoxious practice to issue forth of a Sunday afternoon on a visit of state to such farmers and cottagers as dwelt at hand on which occasion she was wont to hale a reluctant boy along with her from the mixed motives of propriety and his souls health
Much cudgelling of brains I suppose had on that particular day made me torpid and unwary
Anyhow when a victim came to be sought for I fell an easy prey while the others fled scatheless and whooping
Our first visit was to the Larkins
Here ceremonial might be viewed in its finest flower and we conducted ourselves like Queen Elizabeth when she trod the measure high and disposedly
In the low oakpanelled parlour cake and currant wine were set forth and after courtesies and compliments exchanged Aunt Eliza greatly condescending talked the fashions with Mrs Larkin while the farmer and I perspiring with the unusual effort exchanged remarks on the mutability of the weather and the steady fall in the price of corn
Who would have thought to hear us that only two short days ago we had confronted each other on either side of a hedgeI triumphant provocative derisive he flushed wroth cracking his whip and volleying forth profanity
So powerful is allsubduing ceremony
Sabina the while demurely seated with a Pilgrims Progress on her knee and apparently absorbed in a brightly coloured presentment of Apollyon Straddling Right across the Way eyed me at times with shy interest but repelled all Aunt Elizas advances with a frigid politeness for which I could not sufficiently admire her
Its surprising to me I heard my aunt remark presently how my eldest nephew Edward despises little girls
I heard him tell Charlotte the other day that he wished he could exchange her for a pair of Japanese guineapigs
It made the poor child cry
Boys are so heartless
I saw Sabina stiffen as she sat and her tiptilted nose twitched scornfully
Now this boy here my soul descended into my very boots
Could the woman have intercepted any of my amorous glances at the bakers wife
Now this boy my aunt went on is more human altogether
Only yesterday he took his sister to the bakers shop and spent his only penny buying her sweets
I thought it showed such a nice disposition
I wish Edward were more like him
I breathed again
It was unnecessary to explain my real motives for that visit to the bakers
Sabinas face softened and her contemptuous nose descended from its altitude of scorn she gave me one shy glance of kindness and then concentrated her attention upon Mercy knocking at the Wicket Gate
I felt awfully mean as regarded Edward but what could I do
I was in Gaza gagged and bound the Philistines hemmed me in
The same evening the storm burst the bolt fell andto continue the metaphorthe atmosphere grew serene and clear once more
The evening service was shorter than usual the vicar as he ascended the pulpit steps having dropped two pages out of his sermoncaseunperceived by any but ourselves either at the moment or subsequently when the hiatus was reached so as we joyfully shuffled out I whispered Edward that by racing home at top speed we should make time to assume our bows and arrows laid aside for the day and play at Indians and buffaloes with Aunt Elizas fowlsalready strolling roostwards regardless of their doombefore that sedately stepping lady could return
Edward hung at the door wavering the suggestion had unhallowed charms
At that moment Sabina issued primly forth and seeing Edward put out her tongue at him in the most exasperating manner conceivable then passed on her way her shoulders rigid her dainty head held high
A man can stand very much in the cause of love poverty aunts rivals barriers of every sortall these only serve to fan the flame
But personal ridicule is a shaft that reaches the very vitals
Edward led the race home at a speed which one of Ballantynes heroes might have equalled but never surpassed and that evening the Indians dispersed Aunt Elizas fowls over several square miles of country so that the tale of them remaineth incomplete unto this day
Edward himself cheering wildly pursued the big CochinChina cock till the bird sank gasping under the drawingroom window whereat its mistress stood petrified and after supper in the shrubbery smoked a halfconsumed cigar he had picked up in the road and declared to an awestricken audience his final his immitigable resolve to go into the army
The crisis was past and Edward was saved



And yet 


sunt lachrymae rerem 


to me watching the cigar stump alternately pale and glow against the dark background of laurel a vision of a tiptilted nose of a small head poised scornfully seemed to hover on the gathering gloomseemed to grow and fade and grow again like the grin of the Cheshire cat pathetically reproachfully even and the charms of the bakers wife slipped from my memory like snowwreaths in thaw
After all Sabina was nowise to blame why should the child be punished
Tomorrow I would give them the slip and stroll round by her garden promiscuouslike at a time when the farmer was safe in the rickyard
If nothing came of it there was no harm done and if on the contrary



THE BURGLARS It was much too fine a night to think of going to bed at once and so although the witching hour of nine PM had struck Edward and I were still leaning out of the open window in our nightshirts watching the play of the cedarbranch shadows on the moonlit lawn and planning schemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny morrow
From below strains of the jocund piano declared that the Olympians were enjoying themselves in their listless impotent way for the new curate had been bidden to dinner that night and was at the moment unclerically proclaiming to all the world that he feared no foe
His discordant vociferations doubtless started a train of thought in Edwards mind for the youth presently remarked a propos of nothing that had been said before I believe the new curates rather gone on Aunt Maria
I scouted the notion
Why shes quite old I said
She must have seen some fiveandtwenty summers
Of course she is replied Edward scornfully
Its not her its her money hes after you bet
Didnt know she had any money I observed timidly
Sure to have said my brother with confidence
Heaps and heaps
Silence ensued both our minds being busy with the new situation thus presentedmine in wonderment at this flaw that so often declared itself in enviable natures of fullest endowmentin a grownup man and a good cricketer for instance even as this curate Edwards apparently in the consideration of how such a state of things supposing it existed could be best turned to his own advantage
Bobby Ferris told me began Edward in due course that there was a fellow spooning his sister once Whats spooning
I asked meekly
Oh I dunno said Edward indifferently
Itsitsits just a thing they do you know
And he used to carry notes and messages and things between em and he got a shilling almost every time
What from each of em
I innocently inquired
Edward looked at me with scornful pity
Girls never have any money he briefly explained
But she did his exercises and got him out of rows and told stories for him when he needed itand much better ones than he could have made up for himself
Girls are useful in some ways
So he was living in clover when unfortunately they went and quarrelled about something
Dont see what thats got to do with it I said
Nor dont I rejoined Edward
But anyhow the notes and things stopped and so did the shillings
Bobby was fairly cornered for he had bought two ferrets on tick and promised to pay a shilling a week thinking the shillings were going on for ever the silly young ass
So when the week was up and he was being dunned for the shilling he went off to the fellow and said Your brokenhearted Bella implores you to meet her at sundown by the hollow oak as of old be it only for a moment
Do not fail
He got all that out of some rotten book of course
The fellow looked puzzled and said What hollow oak
I dont know any hollow oak
Perhaps it was the Royal Oak
said Bobby promptly cos he saw he had made a slip through trusting too much to the rotten book but this didnt seem to make the fellow any happier
Should think not I said the Royal Oaks an awful low sort of pub
I know said Edward
Well at last the fellow said I think I know what she means the hollow tree in your fathers paddock
It happens to be an elm but she wouldnt know the difference
All right say Ill be there
Bobby hung about a bit for he hadnt got his money
She was crying awfully he said
Then he got his shilling
And wasnt the fellow riled I inquired when he got to the place and found nothing
He found Bobby said Edward indignantly
Young Ferris was a gentleman every inch of him
He brought the fellow another message from Bella I dare not leave the house
My cruel parents immure me closely If you only knew what I suffer
Your brokenhearted Bella
Out of the same rotten book
This made the fellow a little suspiciouscos it was the old Ferrises who had been keen about the thing all through the fellow you see had tin
But whats that got to I began again
Oh I dunno said Edward impatiently
Im telling you just what Bobby told me
He got suspicious anyhow but he couldnt exactly call Bellas brother a liar so Bobby escaped for the time
But when he was in a hole next week over a stiff French exercise and tried the same sort of game on his sister she was too sharp for him and he got caught out
Somehow women seem more mistrustful than men
Theyre so beastly suspicious by nature you know
I know said I
But did the twothe fellow and the sistermake it up afterwards
I dont remember about that replied Edward indifferently but Bobby got packed off to school a whole year earlier than his people meant to send himwhich was just what he wanted
So you see it all came right in the end
I was trying to puzzle out the moral of this storyit was evidently meant to contain one somewherewhen a flood of golden lamplight mingled with the moon rays on the lawn and Aunt Maria and the new curate strolled out on the grass below us and took the direction of a garden seat that was backed by a dense laurel shrubbery reaching round in a halfcircle to the house
Edward mediated moodily
If we only knew what they were talking about said he youd soon see whether I was right or not
Look here
Lets send the kid down by the porch to reconnoitre
Harolds asleep I said it seems rather a shame Oh rot
said my brother hes the youngest and hes got to do as hes told
So the luckless Harold was hauled out of bed and given his sailingorders
He was naturally rather vexed at being stood up suddenly on the cold floor and the job had no particular interest for him but he was both staunch and well disciplined
The means of exit were simple enough
A porch of iron trellis came up to within easy reach of the window and was habitually used by all three of us when modestly anxious to avoid public notice
Harold climbed deftly down the porch like a white rat and his night gown glimmered a moment on the gravel walk ere he was lost to sight in the darkness of the shrubbery
A brief interval of silence ensued broken suddenly by a sound of scuffle and then a shrill longdrawn squeal as of metallic surfaces in friction
Our scout had fallen into the hands of the enemy
Indolence alone had made us devolve the task of investigation on our younger brother
Now that danger had declared itself there was no hesitation
In a second we were down the side of the porch and crawling Cherokeewise through the laurels to the back of the gardenseat
Piteous was the sight that greeted us
Aunt Maria was on the seat in a white evening frock lookingfor an auntreally quite nice
On the lawn stood an incensed curate grasping our small brother by a large ear whichjudging from the row he was makingseemed on the point of parting company with the head it adorned
The gruesome noise he was emitting did not really affect us otherwise than aesthetically
To one who has tried both the wail of genuine physical anguish is easy distinguishable from the pumpedup ad misericordiam blubber
Harolds could clearly be recognised as belonging to the latter class
Now you young whelp I think it was but Edward stoutly maintains it was devil said the curate sternly tell us what you mean by it
Well leggo of my ear then
shrilled Harold and Ill tell you the solemn truth
Very well agreed the curate releasing him now go ahead and dont lie more than you can help
We abode the promised disclosure without the least misgiving but even we had hardly given Harold due credit for his fertility of resource and powers of imagination
I had just finished saying my prayers began that young gentleman slowly when I happened to look out of the window and on the lawn I saw a sight which froze the marrow in my veins
A burglar was approaching the house with snakelike tread
He had a scowl and a dark lantern and he was armed to the teeth
We listened with interest
The style though unlike Harolds native notes seemed strangely familiar
Go on said the curate grimly
Pausing in his stealthy career continued Harold he gave a low whistle
Instantly the signal was responded to and from the adjacent shadows two more figures glided forth
The miscreants were both armed to the teeth
Excellent said the curate proceed
The robber chief pursued Harold warming to his work joined his nefarious comrades and conversed with them in silent tones
His expression was truly ferocious and I ought to have said that he was armed to the t There never mind his teeth interrupted the curate rudely theres too much jaw about you altogether
Hurry up and have done
I was in a frightful funk continued the narrator warily guarding his ear with his hand but just then the drawingroom window opened and you and Aunt Maria came outI mean emerged
The burglars vanished silently into the laurels with horrid implications
The curate looked slightly puzzled
The tale was well sustained and certainly circumstantial
After all the boy might have really seen something
How was the poor man to knowthough the chaste and lofty diction might have supplied a hintthat the whole yarn was a free adaptation from the last Penny Dreadful lent us by the knifeandboot boy
Why did you not alarm the house
he asked
Cos I was afraid said Harold sweetly that praps they mightnt believe me
But how did you get down here you naughty little boy
put in Aunt Maria
Harold was hard pressedby his own flesh and blood too
At that moment Edward touched me on the shoulder and glided off through the laurels
When some ten yards away he gave a low whistle
I replied by another
The effect was magical
Aunt Maria started up with a shriek
Harold gave one startled glance around and then fled like a hare made straight for the back door burst in upon the servants at supper and buried himself in the broad bosom of the cook his special ally
The curate faced the laurelshesitatingly
But Aunt Maria flung herself on him
O Mr
Hodgitts
I heard her cry you are brave
for my sake do not be rash
He was not rash
When I peeped out a second later the coast was entirely clear
By this time there were sounds of a household timidly emerging and Edward remarked to me that perhaps we had better be off
Retreat was an easy matter
A stunted laurel gave a leg up on to the garden wall which led in its turn to the roof of an out house up which at a dubious angle we could crawl to the window of the boxroom
This overland route had been revealed to us one day by the domestic cat when hard pressed in the course of an otterhunt in which the catsomewhat unwillinglywas filling the title role and it had proved distinctly useful on occasions like the present
We were snug in bedminus some cuticle from knees and elbowsand Harold sleepily chewing something sticky had been carried up in the arms of the friendly cook ere the clamour of the burglarhunters had died away
The curates undaunted demeanour as reported by Aunt Maria was generally supposed to have terrified the burglars into flight and much kudos accrued to him thereby
Some days later however when he hid dropped in to afternoon tea and was making a mild curatorial joke about the moral courage required for taking the last piece of breadandbutter I felt constrained to remark dreamily and as it were to the universe at large Mr Hodgitts
you are brave
for my sake do not be rash
Fortunately for me the vicar was also a caller on that day and it was always a comparatively easy matter to dodge my longcoated friend in the open
A HARVESTING The year was in its yellowing time and the face of Nature a study in old gold
A field or semee with garbs of the same it may be false HeraldryNatures generally isbut it correctly blazons the display that Edward and I considered from the rickyard gate Harold was not on in this scene being stretched upon the couch of pain the special disorder stomachic as usual
The evening before Edward in a fit of unwonted amiability had deigned to carve me out a turnip lantern an artandcraft he was peculiarly deft in and Harold as the interior of the turnip flew out in scented fragments under the hollowing knife had eaten largely thereof regarding all such jetsam as his special perquisite
Now he was dreeing his weird with such assistance as the chemist could afford
But Edward and I knowing that this particular field was to be carried today were revelling in the privilege of riding in the empty waggons from the rickyard back to the sheaves whence we returned toilfully on foot to career it again over the billowy acres in these great galleys of a stubble sea
It was the nearest approach to sailing that we inland urchins might compass and hence it ensued that such stirring scenes as Sir Richard Grenville on the Revenge the smokewreathed Battle of the Nile and the Death of Nelson had all been enacted in turn on these dusty quarter decks as they swayed and bumped afield
Another waggon had shot its load and was jolting out through the rickyard gate as we swung ourselves in shouting over its tail
Edward was the first up and as I gained my feet he clutched me in a deathgrapple
I was a privateersman he proclaimed and he the captain of the British frigate Terpsichore ofI forget the precise number of guns
Edward always collared the best parts to himself but I was holding my own gallantly when I suddenly discovered that the floor we battled on was swarming with earwigs
Shrieking I hurled free of him and rolled over the tailboard on to the stubble
Edward executed a wardance of triumph on the deck of the retreating galleon but I cared little for that
I knew HE knew that I wasnt afraid of him but that I wasand terriblyof earwigs those mortal bugs o the field
So I let him disappear shouting lustily for all hands to repel boarders while I strolled inland down the village
There was a touch of adventure in the expedition
This was not our own village but a foreign one distant at least a mile
One felt that sense of mingled distinction and insecurity which is familiar to the traveller distinction in that folk turned the head to note you curiously insecurity by reason of the ever present possibility of missiles on the part of the more juvenile inhabitants a class eternally conservative
Elated with isolation I went even more noseinair than usual and even so I mused might Mungo Park have threaded the trackless African forest and


Here I plumped against a soft but resisting body
Recalled to my senses by the shock I fell back in the attitude every boy under these circumstances instinctively adoptsboth elbows well up over the ears
I found myself facing a tall elderly man cleanshaven clad in wellworn blacka clergyman evidently and I noted at once a faraway look in his eyes as if they were used to another plane of vision and could not instantly focus things terrestrial being suddenly recalled thereto
His figure was bent in apologetic protest I ask a thousand pardons sir he said I am really so very absent minded
I trust you will forgive me
Now most boys would have suspected chaff under this courtly style of address
I take infinite credit to myself for recognising at once the natural attitude of a man to whom his fellows were gentlemen all neither Jew nor Gentile clean nor unclean
Of course I took the blame on myself adding that I was very absentminded toowhich was indeed the case
I perceive he said pleasantly that we have something in common
I an old man dream dreams you a young one see visions
Your lot is the happier
And now his hand had been resting all this time on a wicketgateyou are hot it is easily seen the day is advanced Virgo is the Zodiacal sign
Perhaps I may offer you some poor refreshment if your engagements will permit
My only engagement that afternoon was an arithmetic lesson and I had not intended to keep it in any case so I passed in while he held the gate open politely murmuring Venit Hesperus ite capellae come little kid
and then apologising abjectly for a familiarity which he said was less his than the Roman poets
A straight flagged walk led up to the coollooking old house and my host lingering in his progress at this rosetree and that forgot all about me at least twice waking up and apologising humbly after each lapse
During these intervals I put two and two together and identified him as the Rector a bachelor eccentric learned exceedingly round whom the crust of legend was already beginning to form to myself an object of special awe in that he was alleged to have written a real book
Heaps o books Martha my informant said but I knew the exact rate of discount applicable to Marthas statements
We passed eventually through a dark hall into a room which struck me at once as the ideal I had dreamed but failed to find
None of your feminine fripperies here
None of your chairbacks and tidies
This man it was seen groaned under no aunts
Stout volumes in calf and vellum lined three sides books sprawled or hunched themselves on chairs and tables books diffused the pleasant odour of printers ink and bindings topping all a faint aroma of tobacco cheered and heartened exceedingly as under foreign skies the flap and rustle over the wayfarers head of the Union Jackthe old flag of emancipation
And in one corner bookpiled like the rest of the furniture stood a piano
This I hailed with a squeal of delight
Want to strum
inquired my friend as if it was the most natural wish in the worldhis eyes were already straying towards another corner where bits of writingtable peeped out from under a sort of Alpine system of book and foolscap
O but may I
I asked in doubt
At home Im not allowed to only beastly exercises
Well you can strum here at all events he replied and murmuring absently Age dic Latinum barbite carmen he made his way mechanically guided as it seemed to the irresistible writingable
In ten seconds he was out of sight and call
A great book open on his knee another propped up in front a score or so disposed within easy reach he read and jotted with an absorption almost passionate
I might have been in Boeotia for any consciousness he had of me
So with a light heart I turned to and strummed
Those who painfully and with bleeding feet have scaled the crags of mastery over musical instruments have yet their loss in thisthat the wild joy of strumming has become a vanished sense
Their happiness comes from the concord and the relative value of the notes they handle the pure absolute quality and nature of each note in itself are only appreciated by the strummer
For some notes have all the sea in them and some cathedral bells others a woodland joyance and a smell of greenery in some fauns dance to the merry reed and even the grave centaurs peep out from their caves
Some bring moonlight and some the deep crimson of a roses heart some are blue some red and others will tell of an army with silken standards and marchmusic
And throughout all the sequence of suggestion up above the little white men leap and peep and strive against the imprisoning wires and all the big rosewood box hums as it were full of hiving bees
Spent with the rapture I paused a moment and caught my friends eye over the edge of a folio
But as for these Germans he began abruptly as if we had been in the middle of a discussion the scholarship is there I grant you but the spark the fine perception the happy intuition where is it
They get it all from us
They get nothing whatever from US I said decidedly the word German only suggesting Bands to which Aunt Eliza was bitterly hostile
You think not
he rejoined doubtfully getting up and walking about the room
Well I applaud such fairness and temperance in so young a critic
They are qualitiesin youthas rare as they are pleasing
But just look at Schrumpffius for instancehow he struggles and wrestles with a simple GREEK gar in this very passage here
I peeped fearfully through the open door halfdreading to see some sinuous and snarklike conflict in progress on the mat but all was still
I saw no trouble at all in the passage and I said so
Precisely he cried delighted
To you who possess the natural scholars faculty in so happy a degree there is no difficulty at all
But to this Schrumpffius But here luckily for me in came the housekeeper a cleanlooking woman of staid aspect
Your tea is in the garden she said as if she were correcting a faulty emendation
Ive put some cakes and things for the little gentleman and youd better drink it before it gets cold
He waved her off and continued his stride brandishing an aorist over my devoted head
The housekeeper waited unmoved till there fell a moments break in his descant and then Youd better drink it before it gets cold she observed again impassively
The wretched man cast a deprecating look at me
Perhaps a little tea would be rather nice he observed feebly and to my great relief he led the way into the garden
I looked about for the little gentleman but failing to discover him I concluded he was absentminded too and attacked the cakes and things with no misgivings
After a most successful and most learned tea a something happened which small as I was never quite shook itself out of my memory
To us at parley in an arbour over the high road there entered slouching into view a dingy tramp satellited by a frowsy woman and a pariah dog and catching sight of us he set up his professional whine and I looked at my friend with the heartiest compassion for I knew well from Marthait was common talkthat at this time of day he was certainly and surely penniless
Morn by morn he started forth with pockets lined and each returning evening found him with never a sou
All this he proceeded to explain at length to the tramp courteously and even shamefacedly as one who was in the wrong and at last the gentleman of the road realising the hopelessness of his case set to and cursed him with gusto vocabulary and abandonment
He reviled his eyes his features his limbs his profession his relatives and surroundings and then slouched off still oozing malice and filth
We watched the party to a turn in the road where the woman plainly weary came to a stop
Her lord after some conventional expletives demanded of him by his position relieved her of her bundle and caused her to hang on his arm with a certain rough kindness of tone and in action even a dim approach to tenderness and the dingy dog crept up for one lick at her hand
See said my friend bearing somewhat on my shoulder how this strange thing this love of ours lives and shines out in the unlikeliest of places
You have been in the fields in early morning
Barren acres all
But only stoopcatch the light thwartwiseand all is a silver network of gossamer
So the fairy filaments of this strange thing underrun and link together the whole world
Yet it is not the old imperious god of the fatal bow3 GREEKnot thatnor even the placid respectable GREEKbut something still unnamed perhaps more mysterious more divine
Only one must stoop to see it old fellow one must stoop
The dew was falling the dusk closing as I trotted briskly homewards down the road
Lonely spaces everywhere above and around
Only Hesperus hung in the sky solitary pure ineffably fardrawn and remote yet infinitely heartening somehow in his valorous isolation113 SNOWBOUND Twelfthnight had come and gone and life next morning seemed a trifle flat and purposeless
But yestereve and the mummers were here
They had come striding into the old kitchen powdering the red brick floor with snow from their barbaric bedizenments and stamping and crossing and declaiming till all was whirl and riot and shout
Harold was frankly afraid unabashed he buried himself in the cooks ample bosom
Edward feigned a manly superiority to illusion and greeted these awful apparitions familiarly as Dick and Harry and Joe
As for me I was too big to run too rapt to resist the magic and surprise
Whence came these outlanders breaking in on us with song and ordered masque and a terrible clashing of wooden swords
And after these what strange visitants might we not look for any quiet night when the chestnuts popped in the ashes and the old ghost stories drew the awestricken circle close
Old Merlin perhaps all furred in black sheepskins and a russet gown with a bow and arrows and bearing wild geese in his hand
Or stately Ogier the Dane recalled from Faery asking his way to the land that once had need of him
Or even on some white night the Snow Queen herself with a chime of sleighbells and the patter of reindeers feet with sudden halt at the door flung wide while aloft the Northern Lights went shaking attendant spears among the quiet stars
This morning housebound by the relentless indefatigable snow I was feeling the reaction Edward on the contrary being violently stage struck on this his first introduction to the real Drama was striding up and down the floor proclaiming Here be I King Gearge the Third in a strong Berkshire accent
Harold accustomed as the youngest to lonely antics and to sports that asked no sympathy was absorbed in clubmen a performance consisting in a measured progress round the room arminarm with an imaginary companion of reverend years with occasional halts at imaginary clubs whereimaginary steps being leisurely ascendedimaginary papers were glanced at imaginary scandal was discussed with elderly shakings of the head andregrettable to sayimaginary glasses were lifted lipwards
Heaven only knows how the germ of this dreary pastime first found way into his smallboyish being
It was his own invention and he was proportionately proud of it
Meanwhile Charlotte and I crouched in the windowseat watched spellstricken the whirl and eddy and drive of the innumerable snowflakes wrapping our cheery little world in an uncanny uniform ghastly in line and hue
Charlotte was sadly out of spirits
Having countered Miss Smedley at breakfast during some argument or other by an apt quotation from her favourite classic the Fairy Book she had been gently but firmly informed that no such things as fairies ever really existed
Do you mean to say its all lies
asked Charlotte bluntly
Miss Smedley deprecated the use of any such unladylike words in any connection at all
These stories had their origin my dear she explained in a mistaken anthropomorphism in the interpretation of nature
But though we are now too well informed to fall into similar errors there are still many beautiful lessons to be learned from these myths But how can you learn anything persisted Charlotte from what doesnt exist
And she left the table defiant howbeit depressed
Dont you mind HER I said consolingly how can she know anything about it
Why she cant even throw a stone properly
Edward says theyre all rot too replied Charlotte doubtfully
Edward says everythings rot I explained now he thinks hes going into the Army
If a things in a book it MUST be true so that settles it
Charlotte looked almost reassured
The room was quieter now for Edward had got the dragon down and was boring holes in him with a purring sound Harold was ascending the steps of the Athenaeum with a jaunty airsuggestive rather of the Junior Carlton
Outside the tall elmtops were hardly to be seen through the feathery storm
The skys afalling quoted Charlotte softly I must go and tell the king
The quotation suggested a fairy story and I offered to read to her reaching out for the book
But the Wee Folk were under a cloud sceptical hints had embittered the chalice
So I was fain to fetch Arthursecond favourite with Charlotte for his dames riding errant and an easy first with us boys for his spearsplintering crash of tourney and hurtle against hopeless odds
Here again however I proved unfortunatewhat illluck made the book open at the sorrowful history of Balin and Balan
And he vanished anon I read and so he heard an horne blow as it had been the death of a beast
That blast said Balin is blowen for me for I am the prize and yet am I not dead
Charlotte began to cry she knew the rest too well
I shut the book in despair
Harold emerged from behind the armchair
He was sucking his thumb a thing which members of the Reform are seldom seen to do and he stared wide eyed at his tear stained sister
Edward put off his histrionics and rushed up to her as the consolera new part for him
I know a jolly story he began
Aunt Eliza told it me
It was when she was somewhere over in that beastly abroadhe had once spent a black month of misery at Dinanand there was a fellow there who had got two storks
And one stork diedit was the shestork
What did it die of
put in Harold
And the other stork was quite sorry and moped and went on and got very miserable
So they looked about and found a duck and introduced it to the stork
The duck was a drake but the stork didnt mind and they loved each other and were as jolly as could be
By and by another duck came alonga real sheduck this timeand when the drake saw her he fell in love and left the stork and went and proposed to the duck for she was very beautiful
But the poor stork who was left he said nothing at all to anybody but just pined and pined and pined away till one morning he was found quite dead
But the ducks lived happily ever afterwards
This was Edwards idea of a jolly story
Down again went the corners of poor Charlottes mouth
Really Edwards stupid inability to see the real point in anything was TOO annoying
It was always so
Years before it being necessary to prepare his youthful mind for a domestic event that might lead to awkward questionings at a time when there was little leisure to invent appropriate answers it was delicately inquired of him whether he would like to have a little brother or perhaps a little sister
He considered the matter carefully in all its bearings and finally declared for a Newfoundland pup
Any boy more gleg at the uptak would have met his parents halfway and eased their burden
As it was the matter had to be approached all over again from a fresh standpoint
And now while Charlotte turned away sniffingly with a hiccough that told of an overwrought soul Edward unconscious like Sir Isaacs Diamond of the mischief he had done wheeled round on Harold with a shout
I want a live dragon he announced youve got to be my dragon
Leave me go will you
squealed Harold struggling stoutly
Im playin at something else
How can I be a dragon and belong to all the clubs
But wouldnt you like to be a nice scaly dragon all green said Edward trying persuasion with a curly tail and red eyes and breathing real smoke and fire
Harold wavered an instant PallMall was still strong in him
The next he was grovelling on the floor
No saurian ever swung a tail so scaly and so curly as his
Clubland was a thousand years away
With horrific pants he emitted smokiest smoke and fiercest fire
Now I want a Princess cried Edward clutching Charlotte ecstatically and YOU can be the doctor and heal me from the dragons deadly wound
Of all professions I held the sacred art of healing in worst horror and contempt
Cataclysmal memories of purge and draught crowded thick on me and with Charlottewho courted no barren honoursI made a break for the door
Edward did likewise and the hostile forces clashed together on the mat and for a brief space things were mixed and chaotic and Arthurian
The silvery sound of the luncheonbell restored an instant peace even in the teeth of clenched antagonisms like ours
The Holy Grail itself sliding athwart a sunbeam never so effectually stilled a riot of warring passions into sweet and quiet accord
WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT Edward was standing gingerbeer like a gentleman happening as the one that had last passed under the dentists hands to be the capitalist of the flying hour
As in all wellregulated families the usual tariff obtained in ourshalfacrown a tooth one shilling only if the molar were a loose one
This one unfortunatelyin spite of Edwards interested affectation of agonyhad been shaky undisguised but the event was good enough to run to gingerbeer
As financier however Edward had claimed exemption from any servile duties of procurement and had swaggered about the garden while I fetched from the village post office and Harold stole a tumbler from the pantry
Our preparations complete we were sprawling on the lawn the staidest and most self respecting of the rabbits had been let loose to grace the feast and was lopping demurely about the grass selecting the juiciest plantains while Selina as the eldest lady present was toying in her affected feminine way with the first full tumbler daintily fishing for bits of broken cork
Hurry up cant you
growled our host what are you girls always so beastly particular for
Martha says explained Harold thirsty too but still just that if you swallow a bit of cork it swells and it swells and it swells inside you till you O bosh
said Edward draining the glass with a fine pretence of indifference to consequences but all the same as I noticed dodging the floating corkfragments with skill and judgment
O its all very well to say bosh replied Harold nettled but every one knows its true but you
Why when Uncle Thomas was here last and they got up a bottle of wine for him he took just one tiny sip out of his glass and then he said Poo my goodness thats corked
And he wouldnt touch it
And they had to get a fresh bottle up
The funny part was though I looked in his glass afterwards when it was brought out into the passage and there wasnt any cork in it at all
So I drank it all off and it was very good
Youd better be careful young man
said his elder brother regarding him severely
D you remember that night when the Mummers were here and they had mulled port and you went round and emptied all the glasses after they had gone away
Ow
I did feel funny that night chuckled Harold
Thought the house was comin down it jumped about so and Martha had to carry me up to bed cos the stairs was goin all waggity
We gazed searchingly at our graceless junior but it was clear that he viewed the matter in the light of a phenomenon rather than of a delinquency
A third bottle was by this time circling and Selina who had evidently waited for it to reach her took a most unfairly long pull and then jumping up and shaking out her frock announced that she was going for a walk
Then she fled like a hare for it was the custom of our Family to meet with physical coercion any independence of action in individuals
Shes off with those Vicarage girls again said Edward regarding Selinas long black legs twinkling down the path
She goes out with them every day now and as soon as ever they start all their heads go together and they chatter chatter chatter the whole blessed time
I cant make out what they find to talk about
They never stop its gabble gabble gabble right along like a nest of young rooks
Praps they talk about birdseggs I suggested sleepily the sun was hot the turf soft the gingerbeer potent and about ships and buffaloes and desert islands and why rabbits have white tails and whether theyd sooner have a schooner or a cutter and what theyll be when theyre menat least I mean theres lots of things to talk about if you WANT to talk
Yes but they dont talk about those sort of things at all persisted Edward
How CAN they
They dont KNOW anything they cant DO anythingexcept play the piano and nobody would want to talk about THAT and they dont care about anythinganything sensible I mean
So what DO they talk about
I asked Martha once put in Harold and she said Never YOU mind young ladies has lots of things to talk about that young gentlemen cant understand
I dont believe it Edward growled
Well thats what she SAID anyway rejoined Harold indifferently
The subject did not seem to him of firstclass importance and it was hindering the circulation of the ginger beer
We heard the click of the frontgate
Through a gap in the hedge we could see the party setting off down the road
Selina was in the middle a Vicarage girl had her by either arm their heads were together as Edward had described and the clack of their tongues came down the breeze like the busy pipe of starlings on a bright March morning
What DO they talk about Charlotte
I inquired wishing to pacify Edward
You go out with them sometimes
I dont know said poor Charlotte dolefully
They make me walk behind cos they say Im too little and mustnt hear
And I DO want to so she added
When any lady comes to see Aunt Eliza said Harold they both talk at once all the time
And yet each of em seems to hear what the other ones saying
I cant make out how they do it
Grownup people are so clever
The Curates the funniest man I remarked
Hes always saying things that have no sense in them at all and then laughing at them as if they were jokes
Yesterday when they asked him if hed have some more tea he said Once more unto the breach dear friends once more and then sniggered all over
I didnt see anything funny in that
And then somebody asked him about his buttonhole and he said Tis but a little faded flower and exploded again
I thought it very stupid
O HIM said Edward contemptuously he cant help it you know its a sort of way hes got
But its these girls I cant make out
If theyve anything really sensible to talk about how is it nobody knows what it is
And if they haventand we know they CANT have naturallywhy dont they shut up their jaw
This old rabbit hereHE doesnt want to talk
Hes got something better to do
And Edward aimed a gingerbeer cork at the unruffled beast who never budged
O but rabbits DO talk interposed Harold
Ive watched them often in their hutch
They put their heads together and their noses go up and down just like Selinas and the Vicarage girls
Only of course I can t hear what theyre saying
Well if they do said Edward unwillingly Ill bet they dont talk such rot as those girls do
which was ungenerous as well as unfair for it had not yet transpirednor has it to this dayWHAT Selina and her friends talked about
THE ARGONAUTS The advent of strangers of whatever sort into our circle had always been a matter of grave dubiety and suspicion indeed it was generally a signal for retreat into caves and fastnesses of the earth into unthreaded copses or remote outlying cowsheds whence we were only to be extricated by wily nursemaids rendered familiar by experience with our secret runs and refuges
It was not surprising therefore that the heroes of classic legend when first we made their acquaintance failed to win our entire sympathy at once
Confidence says somebody is a plant of slow growth and these stately darkhaired demigods with names hard to master and strange accoutrements had to win a citadel already strongly garrisoned with a more familiar soldiery
Their chill foreign goddesses had no such direct appeal for us as the mocking malicious fairies and witches of the North we missed the pleasant alliance of the animalthe fox who spread the bushiest of tails to convey us to the enchanted castle the frog in the well the raven who croaked advice from the tree andto Harold especiallyit seemed entirely wrong that the hero should ever be other than the youngest brother of three
This belief indeed in the special fortune that ever awaited the youngest brother as suchthe BoroughEnglish of Faeryhad been of baleful effect on Harold producing a certain selfconceit and perkiness that called for physical correction
But even in our admonishment we were on his side and as we distrustfully eyed these new arrivals old Saturn himself seemed something of a parvenu
Even strangers however if they be good fellows at heart may develop into sworn comrades and these gay swordsmen after all were of the right stuff
Perseus with his cap of darkness and his wonderful sandals was not long in winging his way to our hearts Apollo knocked at Admetus gate in something of the right fairy fashion Psyche brought with her an orthodox palace of magic as well as helpful birds and friendly ants
Ulysses with his captivating shifts and strategies broke down the final barrier and hence forth the band was adopted and admitted into our freemasonry
I had been engaged in chasing Farmer Larkins calveshis special prideround the field just to show the man we hadnt forgotten him and was returning through the kitchengarden with a conscience at peace with all men when I happened upon Edward grubbing for worms in the dungheap
Edward put his worms into his hat and we strolled along together discussing high matters of state
As we reached the toolshed strange noises arrested our steps looking in we perceived Harold alone rapt absorbed immersed in the special game of the moment
He was squatting in an old pigtrough that had been brought in to be tinkered and as he rhapsodised anon he waved a shovel over his head anon dug it into the ground with the action of those who would urge Canadian canoes
Edward strode in upon him
What rot are you playing at now
he demanded sternly
Harold flushed up but stuck to his pigtrough like a man
Im Jason he replied defiantly and this is the Argo
The other fellows are here too only you cant see them and were just going through the Hellespont so dont you come bothering
And once more he plied the winedark sea
Edward kicked the pigtrough contemptuously
Pretty sort of Argo youve got
said he
Harold began to get annoyed
I cant help it he replied
Its the best sort of Argo I can manage and its all right if you only pretend enough but YOU never could pretend one bit
Edward reflected
Look here he said presently why shouldnt we get hold of Farmer Larkins boat and go right away up the river in a real Argo and look for Medea and the Golden Fleece and everything
And Ill tell you what I dont mind your being Jason as you thought of it first
Harold tumbled out of the trough in the excess of his emotion
But we arent allowed to go on the water by ourselves he cried
No said Edward with fine scorn we arent allowed and Jason wasnt allowed either I daresaybut he WENT
Harolds protest had been merely conventional he only wanted to be convinced by sound argument
The next question was How about the girls
Selina was distinctly handy in a boat the difficulty about her was that if she disapproved of the expeditionand morally considered it was not exactly a Pilgrims Progressshe might go and tell she having just reached that disagreeable age when one begins to develop a conscience
Charlotte for her part had a habit of daydreams and was as likely as not to fall overboard in one of her rapt musings
To be sure she would dissolve in tears when she found herself left out but even that was better than a watery tomb
In fine the public voiceand rightly perhapswas against the admission of the skirted animal spite the precedent of Atalanta who was one of the original crew
And now said Edward whos to ask Farmer Larkin
I cant last time I saw him he said when he caught me again hed smack my head
YOULL have to
I hesitated for good reasons
You know those precious calves of his
I began
Edward understood at once
All right he said then we wont ask him at all
It doesnt much matter
Hed only be annoyed and that would be a pity
Now lets set off
We made our way down to the stream and captured the farmers boat without let or hindrance the enemy being engaged in the hayfields
This river so called could never be discovered by us in any atlas indeed our Argo could hardly turn in it without risk of shipwreck
But to us t was Orinoco and the cities of the world dotted its shores
We put the Argos head up stream since that led away from the Larkin province Harold was faithfully permitted to be Jason and we shared the rest of the heroes among us
Then launching forth from Thessaly we threaded the Hellespont with shouts breathlessly dodged the Clashing Rocks and coasted under the lee of the Sirenhaunted isles
Lemnos was fringed with meadowsweet dogroses dotted the Mysian shore and the cheery call of the haymaking folk sounded along the coast of Thrace
After some hour or twos seafaring the prow of the Argo embedded itself in the mud of a landingplace plashy with the tread of cows and giving on to a lane that led towards the smoke of human habitations
Edward jumped ashore alert for exploration and strode off without waiting to see if we followed but I lingered behind having caught sight of a mossgrown watergate hard by leading into a garden that from the brooding quiet lapping it round appeared to portend magical possibilities
Indeed the very air within seemed stiller as we circumspectly passed through the gate and Harold hung back shamefaced as if we were crossing the threshold of some private chamber and ghosts of old days were hustling past us
Flowers there were everywhere but they drooped and sprawled in an overgrowth hinting at indifference the scent of heliotrope possessed the place as if actually hung in solid festoons from tall untrimmed hedge to hedge
No basketchairs shawls or novels dotted the lawn with colour and on the gardenfront of the house behind the blinds were mostly drawn
A grey old sundial dominated the central sward and we moved towards it instinctively as the most human thing visible
An antique motto ran round it and with eyes and fingers we struggled at the decipherment
TIME TRYETH TROTHE spelt out Harold at last
I wonder what that means
I could not enlighten him nor meet his further questions as to the inner mechanism of the thing and where you wound it up
I had seen these instruments before of course but had never fully understood their manner of working
We were still puzzling our heads over the contrivance when I became aware that Medea herself was moving down the path from the house
Darkhaired supple of a figure lightly poised and swayed but pale and listlessI knew her at once and having come out to find her naturally felt no surprise at all
But Harold who was trying to climb on the top of the sundial having a catlike fondness for the summit of things started and fell prone barking his chin and filling the pleasance with lamentation
Medea skimmed the ground swallowlike and in a moment was on her knees comforting himwiping the dirt out of his chin with her own dainty handkerchiefand vocal with soft murmur of consolation
You neednt take on so about him I observed politely
Hell cry for just one minute and then hell be all right
My estimate was justified
At the end of his regulation time Harold stopped crying suddenly like a clock that had struck its hour and with a serene and cheerful countenance wriggled out of Medeas embrace and ran for a stone to throw at an intrusive blackbird
O you boys
cried Medea throwing wide her arms with abandonment
Where have you dropped from
How dirty you are
Ive been shut up here for a thousand years and all that time Ive never seen any one under a hundred and fifty
Lets play at something at once
Rounders is a good game I suggested
Girls can play at rounders
And we could serve up to the sundial here
But you want a bat and a ball and some more people
She struck her hands together tragically
I havent a bat she cried or a ball or more people or anything sensible whatever
Never mind lets play at hideandseek in the kitchen garden
And well race there up to that walnuttree I havent run for a century
She was so easy a victor nevertheless that I began to doubt as I panted behind whether she had not exaggerated her age by a year or two
She flung herself into hideandseek with all the gusto and abandonment of the true artist and as she flitted away and reappeared flushed and laughing divinely the pale witchmaiden seemed to fall away from her and she moved rather as that other girl I had read about snatched from fields of daffodil to reign in shadow below yet permitted once again to visit earth and light and the frank caressing air
Tired at last we strolled back to the old sundial and Harold who never relinquished a problem unsolved began afresh rubbing his finger along the faint incisions Time tryeth trothe
Please I want to know what that means
Medeas face drooped low over the sundial till it was almost hidden in her fingers
Thats what Im here for she said presently in quite a changed low voice
They shut me up herethey think Ill forgetbut I never willnever never
And he toobut I dont knowit is so longI dont know
Her face was quite hidden now
There was silence again in the old garden
I felt clumsily helpless and awkward beyond a vague idea of kicking Harold nothing remedial seemed to suggest itself
None of us had noticed the approach of another shecreatureone of the angular and rigid classhow different from our dear comrade
The years Medea had claimed might well have belonged to her she wore mittens tooa trick I detested in woman
Lucy
she said sharply in a tone with AUNT writ large over it and Medea started up guiltily
Youve been crying said the newcomer grimly regarding her through spectacles
And pray who are these exceedingly dirty little boys
Friends of mine aunt said Medea promptly with forced cheerfulness
IIve known them a long time
I asked them to come
The aunt sniffed suspiciously
You must come indoors dear she said and lie down
The sun will give you a headache
And you little boys had better run away home to your tea
Remember you should not come to pay visits without your nursemaid
Harold had been tugging nervously at my jacket for some time and I only waited till Medea turned and kissed a white hand to us as she was led away
Then I ran
We gained the boat in safety and What an old dragon
said Harold
Wasnt she a beast
I replied
Fancy the sun giving any one a headache
But Medea was a real brick
Couldnt we carry her off
We could if Edward was here said Harold confidently
The question was What had become of that defaulting hero
We were not left long in doubt
First there came down the lane the shrill and wrathful clamour of a female tongue then Edward running his best and then an excited woman hard on his heel
Edward tumbled into the bottom of the boat gasping Shove her off
And shove her off we did mightily while the dame abused us from the bank in the self same accents in which Alfred hurled defiance at the marauding Dane
That was just like a bit out of Westward Ho
I remarked approvingly as we sculled down the stream
But what had you been doing to her
Hadnt been doing anything panted Edward still breathless
I went up into the village and explored and it was a very nice one and the people were very polite
And there was a blacksmiths forge there and they were shoeing horses and the hoofs fizzled and smoked and smelt so jolly
I stayed there quite a long time
Then I got thirsty so I asked that old woman for some water and while she was getting it her cat came out of the cottage and looked at me in a nasty sort of way and said something I didnt like
So I went up to it just toto teach it manners and somehow or other next minute it was up an apple tree spitting and I was running down the lane with that old thing after me
Edward was so full of his personal injuries that there was no interesting him in Medea at all
Moreover the evening was closing in and it was evident that this cuttingout expedition must be kept for another day
As we neared home it gradually occurred to us that perhaps the greatest danger was yet to come for the farmer must have missed his boat ere now and would probably be lying in wait for us near the landingplace
There was no other spot admitting of debarcation on the home side if we got out on the other and made for the bridge we should certainly be seen and cut off
Then it was that I blessed my stars that our elder brother149 was with us that dayhe might be little good at pretending but in grappling with the stern facts of life he had no equal
Enjoining silence he waited till we were but a little way from the fated landingplace and then brought us in to the opposite bank
We scrambled out noiselessly andthe gathering darkness favouring uscrouched behind a willow while Edward pushed off the empty boat with his foot
The old Argo borne down by the gentle current slid and grazed along the rushy bank and when she came opposite the suspected ambush a stream of imprecation told us that our precaution had not been wasted
We wondered as we listened where Farmer Larkin who was bucolically bred and reared had acquired such range and wealth of vocabulary
Fully realising at last that his boat was derelict abandoned at the mercy of wind and waveas well as out of his reachhe strode away to the bridge about a quarter of a mile further down and as soon as we heard his boots clumping on the planks we nipped out recovered the craft pulled across and made the faithful vessel fast to her proper moorings
Edward was anxious to wait and exchange cour150tesies and compliments with the disappointed farmer when he should confront us on the opposite bank but wiser counsels prevailed
It was possible that the piracy was not yet laid at our particular door Ulysses I reminded him had reason to regret a similar act of bravado andwere he herewould certainly advise a timely retreat
Edward held but a low opinion of me as a counsellor but he had a very solid respect for Ulysses
THE ROMAN ROAD ALL the roads of our neighbourhood were cheerful and friendly having each of them pleasant qualities of their own but this one seemed different from the others in its masterful suggestion of a serious purpose speeding you along with a strange uplifting of the heart
The others tempted chiefly with their treasures of hedge and ditch the rapt surprise of the first lordsandladies the rustle of a fieldmouse splash of a frog while cool noses of brotherbeasts were pushed at you through gate or gap
A loiterer you had need to be did you choose one of themso many were the tiny hands thrust out to detain you from this side and that
But this other was of a sterner sort and even in its shedding off of bank and hedgerow as it marched straight and full for the open downs it seemed to declare its contempt for adventitious trappings to catch the shallowpated
When the sense of injustice or disappointment was heavy on me and things were very black within as on this particular day the road of character was my choice for that solitary ramble when I turned my back for an afternoon on a world that had unaccountably declared itself against me
The Knights Road we children had named it from a sort of feeling that if from any quarter at all it would be down this track we might some day see Lancelot and his peers come pacing on their great warhorsessupposing that any of the stout band still survived in nooks and unexplored places
Grownup people sometimes spoke of it as the Pilgrims Way but I didnt know much about pilgrimsexcept Walter in the Horselberg story
Him I sometimes saw breaking with haggard eyes out of yonder copse and calling to the pilgrims as they hurried along on their desperate march to the Holy City where peace and pardon were awaiting them
All roads lead to Rome I had once heard somebody say and I had taken the remark very seriously of course and puzzled over it many days
There must have been some mistake I concluded at last but of one road at least I intuitively felt it to be true
And my belief was clinched by something that fell from Miss Smedley during a history lesson about a strange road that ran right down the middle of England till it reached the coast and then began again in France just opposite and so on undeviating through city and vineyard right from the misty Highlands to the Eternal City
Uncorroborated any statement of Miss Smedleys usually fell on incredulous ears but here with the road itself in evidence she seemed once in a way to have strayed into truth
Rome
It was fascinating to think that it lay at the other end of this white ribbon that rolled itself off from my feet over the distant downs
I was not quite so uninstructed as to imagine l could reach it that afternoon but some day I thought if things went on being as unpleasant as they were nowsome day when Aunt Eliza had gone on a visitwe would see
I tried to imagine what it would be like when I got there
The Coliseum I knew of course from a woodcut in the historybook so to begin with I plumped that down in the middle
The rest had to be patched up from the little grey markettown where twice a year we went to have our hair cut hence in the result Vespasians amphitheatre was approached by muddy little streets wherein the Red Lion and the Blue Boar with Somebodys Entire along their front and Commercial Room on their windows the doctors house of substantial redbrick and the facade of the New Wesleyan Chapel which we thought very fine were the chief architectural ornaments while the Roman populace pottered about in smocks and corduroys twisting the tails of Roman calves and inviting each other to beer in musical Wessex
From Rome I drifted on to other cities dimly heard ofDamascus Brighton Aunt Elizas ideal Athens and Glasgow whose glories the gardener sang but there was a certain sameness in my conception of all of them that Wesleyan chapel would keep cropping up everywhere
It was easier to go abuilding among those dream cities where no limitations were imposed and one was sole architect with a free hand
Down a delectable street of cloud built palaces I was mentally pacing when I happened upon the Artist
He was seated at work by the roadside at a point whence the cool large spaces of the downs juniperstudded swept grandly westwards
His attributes proclaimed him of the artist tribe besides he wore knickerbockers like myselfa garb confined I was aware to boys and artists
I knew I was not to bother him with questions nor look over his shoulder and breathe in his earthey didnt like it this genus irritabile but there was nothing about staring in my code of instructions the point having somehow been overlooked so squatting down on the grass I devoted myself to a passionate absorbing of every detail
At the end of five minutes there was not a button on him that I could not have passed an examination in and the wearer himself of that homespun suit was probably less familiar with its pattern and texture than I was
Once he looked up nodded half held out his tobacco pouchmechanically as it werethen returning it to his pocket resumed his work and I my mental photography
After another five minutes or so had passed he remarked without looking my way Fine afternoon were having going far today
No Im not going any farther than this I replied I WAS thinking of going on to Rome but Ive put it off
Pleasant place Rome he murmured youll like it
It was some minutes later that he added But I wouldnt go just now if I were youtoo jolly hot
YOU havent been to Rome have you
I inquired
Rather he replied briefly I live there
This was too much and my jaw dropped as I struggled to grasp the fact that I was sitting there talking to a fellow who lived in Rome
Speech was out of the question besides I had other things to do
Ten solid minutes had I already spent in an examination of him as a mere stranger and artist and now the whole thing had to be done over again from the changed point of view
So I began afresh at the crown of his soft hat and worked down to his solid British shoes this time investing everything with the new Roman halo and at last I managed to get out But you dont really live there do you
never doubting the fact but wanting to hear it repeated
Well he said goodnaturedly overlooking the slight rudeness of my query I live there as much as l live anywhereabout half the year sometimes
Ive got a sort of a shanty there
You must come and see it some day
But do you live anywhere else as well
I went on feeling the forbidden tide of questions surging up within me
O yes all over the place was his vague reply
And Ive got a diggings somewhere off Piccadilly
Wheres that
I inquired
Wheres what
said he
Oh Piccadilly
Its in London
Have you a large garden
I asked and how many pigs have you got
Ive no garden at all he replied sadly and they dont allow me to keep pigs though Id like to awfully
Its very hard
But what do you do all day then I cried and where do you go and play without any garden or pigs or things
When I want to play he said gravely I have to go and play in the street but its poor fun I grant you
Theres a goat though not far off and sometimes I talk to him when Im feeling lonely but hes very proud
Goats ARE proud I admitted
Theres one lives near here and if you say anything to him at all he hits you in the wind with his head
You know what it feels like when a fellow hits you in the wind
I do well he replied in a tone of proper melancholy and painted on
And have you been to any other places I began again presently besides Rome and Piccywhatshisname
Heaps he said
Im a sort of Ulyssesseen men and cities you know
In fact about the only place I never got to was the Fortunate Island
I began to like this man
He answered your questions briefly and to the point and never tried to be funny
I felt I could be confidential with him
Wouldnt you like I inquired to find a city without any people in it at all
He looked puzzled
Im afraid I dont quite understand said he
I mean I went on eagerly a city where you walk in at the gates and the shops are all full of beautiful things and the houses furnished as grand as can be and there isnt anybody there whatever
And you go into the shops and take anything you wantchocolates and magic lanterns and injirubber ballsand theres nothing to pay and you choose your own house and live there and do just as you like and never go to bed unless you want to
The artist laid down his brush
That WOULD be a nice city he said
Better than Rome
You cant do that sort of thing in Romeor in Piccadilly either
But I fear its one of the places Ive never been to
And youd ask your friends I went on warming to my subject only those you really like of courseand theyd each have a house to themselvesthered be lots of housesand no relations at all unless they promised theyd be pleasant and if they werent theyd have to go
So you wouldnt have any relations
said the artist
Well perhaps youre right
We have tastes in common I see
Id have Harold I said reflectively and Charlotte
Theyd like it awfully
The others are getting too old
Oh and MarthaId have Martha to cook and wash up and do things
Youd like Martha
Shes ever so much nicer than Aunt Eliza
Shes my idea of a real lady
Then Im sure I should like her he replied heartily and when I come towhat do you call this city of yours
Nephelo something did you say
II dont know I replied timidly
Im afraid it hasnt got a nameyet
The artist gazed out over the downs
The poet says dear city of Cecrops he said softly to himself and wilt not thou say dear city of Zeus
Thats from Marcus Aurelius he went on turning again to his work
You dont know him I suppose you will some day
Whos he
I inquired
Oh just another fellow who lived in Rome he replied dabbing away
O dear
I cried disconsolately
What a lot of people seem to live at Rome and Ive never even been there
But I think Id like MY city best
And so would I he replied with unction
But Marcus Aurelius wouldnt you know
Then we wont invite him I said will we
I wont if you wont said he
And that point being settled we were silent for a while
Do you know he said presently Ive met one or two fellows from time to time who have been to a city like yoursperhaps it was the same one
They wont talk much about itonly broken hints now and then but theyve been there sure enough
They dont seem to care about anything in particularand every things the same to them rough or smooth and sooner or later they slip off and disappear and you never see them again
Gone back I suppose
Of course said I
Dont see what they ever came away for I wouldntto be told youve broken things when you havent and stopped having tea with the servants in the kitchen and not allowed to have a dog to sleep with you
But Ive known people too whove gone there
The artist stared but without incivility
Well theres Lancelot I went on
The book says he died but it never seemed to read right somehow
He just went away like Arthur
And Crusoe when he got tired of wearing clothes and being respectable
And all the nice men in the stones who dont marry the Princess cos only one man ever gets married in a book you know
Theyll be there
And the men who never come off he said who try like the rest but get knocked out or somehow missor break down or get bowled over in the meleeand get no Princess nor even a secondclass kingdomsome of themll be there I hope
Yes if you like I replied not quite understanding him if theyre friends of yours well ask em of course
What a time we shall have
said the artist reflectively and how shocked old Marcus Aurelius will be
The shadows had lengthened uncannily a tide of golden haze was flooding the greygreen surface of the downs and the artist began to put his traps together preparatory to a move
I felt very low we would have to part it seemed just as we were getting on so well together
Then he stood up and he was very straight and tall and the sunset was in his hair and beard as he stood there high over me
He took my hand like an equal
Ive enjoyed our conversation very much he said
That was an interesting subject you started and we havent half exhausted it
We shall meet again I hope
Of course we shall I replied surprised that there should be any doubt about it
In Rome perhaps
said he
Yes in Rome I answered or Piccytheotherplace or somewhere
Or else said he in that other citywhen weve found the way there
And Ill look out for you and youll sing out as soon as you see me
And well go down the street arminarm and into all the shops and then Ill choose my house and youll choose your house and well live there like princes and good fellows
Oh but youll stay in my house wont you
I cried wouldnt ask everybody but Ill ask YOU
He affected to consider a moment then Right
he said I believe you mean it and I WILL come and stay with you
I wont go to anybody else if they ask me ever so much
And Ill stay quite a long time too and I wont be any trouble
Upon this compact we parted and I went downheartedly from the man who understood me back to the house where I never could do anything right
How was it that everything seemed natural and sensible to him which these uncles vicars and other grownup men took for the merest tomfoolery
Well he would explain this and many another thing when we met again
The Knights Road
How it always brought consolation
Was he possibly one of those vanished knights I had been looking for so long
Perhaps he would be in armour next timewhy not
He would look well in armour I thought
And I would take care to get there first and see the sunlight flash and play on his helmet and shield as he rode up the High Street of the Golden City
Meantime there only remained the finding itan easy matter
THE SECRET DRAWER IT must surely have served as a boudoir for the ladies of old time this little used rarely entered chamber where the neglected old bureau stood
There was something very feminine in the faint hues of its faded brocades in the rose and blue of such bits of china as yet remained and in the delicate oldworld fragrance of potpourri from the great bowlblue and white with funny holes in its coverthat stood on the bureaus flat top
Modern aunts disdained this outoftheway backwater upstairs room preferring to do their accounts and grapple with their correspondence in some central position more in the whirl of things whence one eye could be kept on the carriage drive while the other was alert for malingering servants and marauding children
Those aunts of a former generationI sometimes felt would have suited our habits better
But even by us children to whom few places were private or reserved the room was visited but rarely
To be sure there was nothing particular in it that we coveted or requiredonly a few spindlelegged gilt backed chairs an old harp on which so the legend ran Aunt Eliza herself used once to play in years remote unchronicled a cornercupboard with a few pieces of china and the old bureau
But one other thing the room possessed peculiar to itself a certain sense of privacya power of making the intruder feel that he WAS intrudingperhaps even a faculty of hinting that some one might have been sitting on those chairs writing at the bureau or fingering the china just a second before one entered
No such violent word as haunted could possibly apply to this pleasant oldfashioned chamber which indeed we all rather liked but there was no doubt it was reserved and standoffish keeping itself to itself
Uncle Thomas was the first to draw my attention to the possibilities of the old bureau
He was pottering about the house one afternoon having ordered me to keep at his heels for companyhe was a man who hated to be left one minute alone when his eye fell on it
Hm
Sheraton
he remarked
He had a smattering of most things this uncle especially the vocabularies
Then he let down the flap and examined the empty pigeonholes and dusty panelling
Fine bit of inlay he went on good work all of it
I know the sort
Theres a secret drawer in there somewhere
Then as I breathlessly drew near he suddenly exclaimed By Jove I do want to smoke
and wheeling round he abruptly fled for the garden leaving me with the cup dashed from my lips
What a strange thing I mused was this smoking that takes a man suddenly be he in the court the camp or the grove grips him like an Afreet and whirls him off to do its imperious behests
Would it be even so with myself I wondered in those unknown grownup years to come
But I had no time to waste in vain speculations
My whole being was still vibrating to those magic syllables secret drawer and that particular chord had been touched that never fails to thrill responsive to such words as CAVE TRAPDOOR SLIDING PANEL BULLION INGOTS or SPANISH DOLLARS
For besides its own special bliss who ever heard of a secret drawer with nothing in it
And oh I did want money so badly
I mentally ran over the list of demands which were pressing me the most imperiously
First there was the pipe I wanted to give George Jannaway
George who was Marthas young man was a shepherd and a great ally of mine and the last fair he was at when he bought his sweetheart fairings as a rightminded shepherd should he had purchased a lovely snake expressly for me one of the wooden sort with joints waggling deliciously in the hand with yellow spots on a green ground sticky and strongsmelling as a fresh painted snake ought to be and with a redflannel tongue pasted cunningly into its jaws
I loved it much and took it to bed with me every night till what time its spinal cord was loosed and it fell apart and went the way of all mortal joys
I thought it so nice of George to think of me at the fair and thats why I wanted to give him a pipe
When the young year was chill and lambingtime was on George inhabited a little wooden house on wheels far out on the wintry downs and saw no faces but such as were sheepish and woolly and mute ant when he and Martha were married she was going to carry his dinner out to him every day two miles and after it perhaps he would smoke my pipe
It seemed an idyllic sort of existence for both the parties concerned but a pipe of quality a pipe fitted to be part of a life such as this could not be procured so Martha informed me for a less sum than eighteen pence
And meantime
Then there was the fourpence I owed Edward not that he was bothering me for it but I knew he was in need of it himself to pay back Selina who wanted it to make up a sum of two shillings to buy Harold an ironclad for his approaching birthdayH M S Majestic now lying uselessly careened in the toyshop window just when her country had such sore need of her
And then there was that boy in the village who had caught a young squirrel and I had never yet possessed one and he wanted a shilling for it but I knew that for ninepence in cashbut what was the good of these sorry threadbare reflections
I had wants enough to exhaust any possible find of bullion even if it amounted to half a sovereign
My only hope now lay in the magic drawer and here I was standing and letting the precious minutes slip by
Whether findings of this sort could morally speaking be considered keepings was a point that did not occur to me
The room was very still as I approached the bureaupossessed it seemed to be by a sort of hush of expectation
The faint odour of orrisroot that floated forth as I let down the flap seemed to identify itself with the yellows and browns of the old wood till hue and scent were of one quality and interchangeable
Even so ere this the potpourri had mixed itself with the tints of the old brocade and brocade and potpourri had long been one
With expectant fingers I explored the empty pigeonholes and sounded the depths of the softlysliding drawers
No books that I knew of gave any general recipe for a quest like this but the glory should I succeed unaided would be all the greater
To him who is destined to arrive the fates never fail to afford on the way their small encouragements in less than two minutes I had come across a rusty buttonhook
This was truly magnificent
In the nursery there existed indeed a general buttonhook common to either sex but none of us possessed a private and special buttonhook to lend or refuse as suited the high humour of the moment
I pocketed the treasure carefully and proceeded
At the back of another drawer three old foreign stamps told me I was surely on the highroad to fortune
Following on these bracing incentives came a dull blank period of unrewarded search
In vain I removed all the drawers and felt over every inch of the smooth surfaces from front to back
Never a knob spring or projection met the thrilling fingertips unyielding the old bureau stood stoutly guarding its secret if secret it really had
I began to grow weary and disheartened
This was not the first time that Uncle Thomas had proved shallow uninformed a guide into blind alleys where the echoes mocked you
Was it any good persisting longer
Was anything any good whatever
In my mind I began to review past disappointments and life seemed one long record of failure and of nonarriral
Disillusioned and depressed I left my work and went to the window
The light was ebbing from the room and outside seemed to be collecting itself on the horizon for its concentrated effort of sunset
Far down the garden Uncle Thomas was holding Edward in the air reversed and smacking him
Edward gurgling hysterically was striking blind fists in the direction where he judged his uncles stomach should rightly be the contents of his pocketsa motley showwere strewing the lawn
Somehow though I had been put through a similar performance an hour or two ago myself it all seemed very far away and cut off from me
Westwards the clouds were massing themselves in a low violet bank below them to north and south as far round as eye could reach a narrow streak of gold ran out and stretched away straight along the horizon
Somewhere very far off a horn was being blown clear and thin it sounded like the golden streak grown audible while the gold seemed the visible sound
It pricked my ebbing courage this blended strain of music and colour and I turned for a last effort and Fortune thereupon as if halfashamed of the unworthy game she had been playing with me relented opening her clenched fist
Hardly had I put my hand once more to the obdurate wood when with a sort of small sigh almost a sobas it wereof relief the secret drawer sprang open
I drew it out and carried it to the window to examine it in the failing light
Too hopeless had I gradually grown in my dispiriting search to expect very much and yet at a glance I saw that my basket of glass lay in fragments at my feet
No ingots or dollars were here to crown me the little Monte Cristo of a week
Outside the distant horn had ceased its gnatsong the gold was paling to primrose and everything was lonely and still
Within my confident little castles were tumbling down like cardhouses leaving me stripped of estate both real and personal and dominated by the depressing reaction
And yetas I looked again at the small collection that lay within that drawer of disillusions some warmth crept back to my heart as I recognised that a kindred spirit to my own had been at the making of it
Two tarnished gilt buttonsnaval apparentlya portrait of a monarch unknown to me cut from some antique print and deftly coloured by hand in just my own bold style of brushworksome foreign copper coins thicker and clumsier of make than those I hoarded myselfand a list of birds eggs with names of the places where they had been found
Also a ferrets muzzle and a twist of tarry string still faintly aromatic
It was a real boys hoard then that I had happened upon
He too had found out the secret drawer this happy starred young person and here he had stowed away his treasures one by one and had cherished them secretly awhile and thenwhat
Well one would never know now the reason why these priceless possessions still lay here unreclaimed but across the void stretch of years I seemed to touch hands a moment with my little comrade of seasons long since dead
I restored the drawer with its contents to the trusty bureau and heard the spring click with a certain satisfaction
Some other boy perhaps would some day release that spring again
I trusted he would be equally appreciative
As I opened the door to go I could hear from the nursery at the end of the passage shouts and yells telling that the hunt was up
Bears apparently or bandits were on the evening bill of fare judging by the character of the noises
In another minute I would be in the thick of it in all the warmth and light and laughter
And yetwhat a long way off it all seemed both in space and time to me yet lingering on the threshold of that oldworld chamber
EXIT TYRANNUS The eventful day had arrived at last the day which when first named had seemedlike all golden dates that promise anything definiteso immeasurably remote
When it was first announced a fortnight before that Miss Smedley was really going the resultant ecstasies had occupied a full week during which we blindly revelled in the contemplation and discussion of her past tyrannies crimes malignities in recalling to each other this or that insult dishonour or physical assault sullenly endured at a time when deliverance was not even a small star on the horizon and in mapping out the golden days to come with special new troubles of their own no doubt since this is but a worka day world but at least free from one familiar scourge
The time that remained had been taken up by the planning of practical expressions of the popular sentiment
Under Edwards masterly direction arrangements had been made for a flag to be run up over the henhouse at the very moment when the fly with Miss Smedleys boxes on top and the grim oppressor herself inside began to move off down the drive
Three brass cannons set on the brow of the sunkfence were to proclaim our deathless sentiments in the ears of the retreating foe the dogs were to wear ribbons and laterbut this depended on our powers of evasiveness and dissimulationthere might be a small bonfire with a cracker or two if the public funds could bear the unwonted strain
I was awakened by Harold digging me in the ribs and Shes going today
was the morning hymn that scattered the clouds of sleep
Strange to say it was with no corresponding jubilation of spirits that I slowly realised the momentous fact
Indeed as I dressed a dull disagreeable feeling that I could not define grew within mesomething like a physical bruise
Harold was evidently feeling it too for after repeating Shes going to day
in a tone more befitting the Litany he looked hard in my face for direction as to how the situation was to be taken
But I crossly bade him look sharp and say his prayers and not bother me
What could this gloom portend that on a day of days like the present seemed to hang my heavens with black
Down at last and out in the sun we found Edward before us swinging on a gate and chanting a farmyard ditty in which all the beasts appear in due order jargoning in their several tongues and every verse begins with the couplet Now my lads come with me Out in the morning early
The fateful exodus of the day had evidently slipped his memory entirely
I touched him on the shoulder
Shes going today
I said
Edwards carol subsided like a watertap turned off
So she is
he replied and got down at once off the gate and we returned to the house without another word
At breakfast Miss Smedley behaved in a most mean and uncalledfor manner
The right divine of governesses to govern wrong includes no right to cry
In thus usurping the prerogative of their victims they ignore the rules of the ring and hit below the belt
Charlotte was crying of course but that counted for nothing
Charlotte even cried when the pigs noses were ringed in due season thereby evoking the cheery contempt of the operators who asserted they liked it and doubtless knew
But when the cloudcompeller her bolts laid aside resorted to tears mutinous humanity had a right to feel aggrieved and placed in a false and difficult position
What would the Romans have done supposing Hannibal had cried
History has not even considered the possibility
Rules and precedents should be strictly observed on both sides when they are violated the other party is justified in feeling injured
There were no lessons that morning naturallyanother grievance
The fitness of things required that we should have struggled to the last in a confused medley of moods and tenses and parted for ever flushed with hatred over the dismembered corpse of the multiplication table
But this thing was not to be and I was free to stroll by myself through the garden and combat as best I might this growing feeling of depression
It was a wrong system altogether I thought this going of people one had got used to
Things ought always to continue as they had been
Change there must be of course pigs for instance came and went with disturbing frequency Fired their ringing shot and passed Hotly charged and sank at last but Nature had ordered it so and in requital had provided for rapid successors
Did you come to love a pig and he was taken from you grief was quickly assuaged in the delight of selection from the new litter
But now when it was no question of a peerless pig but only of a governess Nature seemed helpless and the future held no litter of oblivion
Things might be better or they might be worse but they would never be the same and the innate conservatism of youth asks neither poverty nor riches but only immunity from change
Edward slouched up alongside of me presently with a hangdog look on him as if he had been caught stealing jam
What a lark itll be when shes really gone
he observed with a swagger obviously assumed
Grand fun
I replied dolorously and conversation flagged
We reached the henhouse and contemplated the banner of freedom lying ready to flaunt the breezes at the supreme moment
Shall you run it up I asked when the fly starts oror wait a little till its out of sight
Edward gazed around him dubiously
Were going to have some rain I think he said andand its a new flag
It would be a pity to spoil it
Praps I wont run it up at all
Harold came round the corner like a bison pursued by Indians
Ive polished up the cannons he cried and they look grand
Maynt I load em now
You leave em alone said Edward severely or youll be blowing yourself up consideration for others was not usually Edwards strong point
Dont touch the gunpowder till youre told or youll get your head smacked
Harold fell behind limp squashed obedient
She wants me to write to her he began presently
Says she doesnt mind the spelling it Ill only write
Fancy her saying that
Oh shut up will you
said Edward savagely and once more we were silent with only our thoughts for sorry company
Lets go off to the copse I suggested timidly feeling that something had to be done to relieve the tension and cut more new bows and arrows
She gave me a knife my last birthday said Edward moodily never budging
It wasnt much of a knifebut I wish I hadnt lost it
When my legs used to ache I said she sat up half the night rubbing stuff on them
I forgot all about that till this morning
Theres the fly
cried Harold suddenly
I can hear it scrunching on the gravel
Then for the first time we turned and stared one another in the face





The fly and its contents had finally disappeared through the gate the rumble of its wheels had died away and no flag floated defiantly in the sun no cannons proclaimed the passing of a dynasty
From out the frosted cake of our existence Fate had cut an irreplaceable segment turn which way we would the void was present
We sneaked off in different directions mutually undesirous of company and it seemed borne in upon me that I ought to go and dig my garden right over from end to end
It didnt actually want digging on the other hand no amount of digging could affect it for good or for evil so I worked steadily strenuously under the hot sun stifling thought in action
At the end of an hour or so I was joined by Edward
Ive been chopping up wood he explained in a guilty sort of way though nobody had called on him to account for his doings
What for
I inquired stupidly
Theres piles and piles of it chopped up already
I know said Edward but theres no harm in having a bit over
You never can tell what may happen
But what have you been doing all this digging for
You said it was going to rain I explained hastily so I thought Id get the digging done before it came
Good gardeners always tell you thats the right thing to do
It did look like rain at one time Edward admitted but its passed off now
Very queer weather were having
I suppose thats why Ive felt so funny all day
Yes I suppose its the weather I replied
Ive been feeling funny too
The weather had nothing to do with it as we well knew
But we would both have died rather than have admitted the real reason
THE BLUE ROOM That nature has her moments of sympathy with man has been noted often enoughand generally as a new discovery to us who had never known any other condition of things it seemed entirely right and fitting that the wind sang and sobbed in the poplar tops and in the lulls of it sudden spirts of rain spattered the already dusty roads on that blusterous March day when Edward and I awaited on the station platform the arrival of the new tutor
Needless to say this arrangement had been planned by an aunt from some fond idea that our shy innocent young natures would unfold themselves during the walk from the station and that on the revelation of each others more solid qualities that must then inevitably ensue an enduring friendship springing from mutual respect might be firmly based
A pretty dreamnothing more
For Edward who foresaw that the brunt of tutorial oppression would have to be borne by him was sulky monosyllabic and determined to be as negatively disagreeable as good manners would permit
It was therefore evident that I would have to be spokesman and purveyor of hollow civilities and I was none the more amiable on that account all courtesies welcomes explanations and other courtchamberlain kind of business being my special aversion
There was much of the tempestuous March weather in the hearts of both of us as we sullenly glowered along the carriagewindows of the slackening train
One is apt however to misjudge the special difficulties of a situation and the reception proved after all an easy and informal matter
In a trainful so uniformly bucolic a tutor was readily recognisable and his portmanteau had been consigned to the luggagecart and his person conveyed into the lane before I had discharged one of my carefully considered sentences
I breathed more easily and looking up at our new friend as we stepped out together remembered that we had been counting on something altogether more arid scholastic and severe
A boyish eager face and a petulant pincenezuntidy haira head of constant quick turns like a robins and a voice that kept breaking into altothese were all very strange and new but not in the least terrible
He proceeded jerkily through the village with glances on this side and that and Charming he broke out presently quite too charming and delightful
I had not counted on this sort of thing and glanced for help to Edward who hands in pockets looked grimly down his nose
He had taken his line and meant to stick to it
Meantime our friend had made an imaginary spyglass out of his fist and was squinting through it at something I could not perceive
What an exquisite bit
he burst out fifteenth centurynoyes it is
I began to feel puzzled not to say alarmed
It reminded me of the butcher in the Arabian Nights whose common joints displayed on the shopfront took to a startled public the appearance of dismembered humanity
This man seemed to see the strangest things in our dull familiar surroundings
Ah
he broke out again as we jogged on between hedgerows and that field nowbacked by the downswith the raincloud brooding over itthats all David Coxevery bit of it
That field belongs to Farmer Larkin I explained politely for of course he could not be expected to know
Ill take you over to Farmer Coxs tomorrow if hes a friend of yours but theres nothing to see there
Edward who was hanging sullenly behind made a face at me as if to say What sort of lunatic have we got here
It has the true pastoral character this country of yours went on our enthusiast with just that added touch in cottage and farmstead relics of a bygone art which makes our English landscape so divine so unique
Really this grasshopper was becoming a burden
These familiar fields and farms of which we knew every blade and stick had done nothing that I knew of to be bespattered with adjectives in this way
I had never thought of them as divine unique or anything else
They werewell they were just themselves and there was an end of it
Despairingly I jogged Edward in the ribs as a sign to start rational conversation but he only grinned and continued obdurate
You can see the house now I remarked presently and thats Selina chasing the donkey in the paddockor is it the donkey chasing Selina
I cant quite make out but its THEM anyhow
Needless to say he exploded with a full charge of adjectives
Exquisite
he rapped out so mellow and harmonious
and so entirely in keeping
I could see from Edwards face that he was thinking who ought to be in keeping
Such possibilities of romance now in those old gables
If you mean the garrets I said theres a lot of old furniture in them and one is generally full of apples and the bats get in sometimes under the eaves and flop about till we go up with hairbrushes and things and drive em out but theres nothing else in them that I know of
Oh but there must be more than bats he cried
Dont tell me there are no ghosts
I shall be deeply disappointed if there arent any ghosts
I did not think it worth while to reply feeling really unequal to this sort of conversation besides we were nearing the house when my task would be ended
Aunt Eliza met us at the door and in the crossfire of adjectives that ensuedboth of them talking at once as grownup folk have a habit of doingwe two slipped round to the back of the house and speedily put several solid acres between us and civilisation for fear of being ordered in to tea in the drawingroom
By the time we returned our new importation had gone up to dress for dinner so till the morrow at least we were free of him
Meanwhile the March wind after dropping a while at sundown had been steadily increasing in volume and although I fell asleep at my usual hour about midnight I was wakened by the stress and cry of it
In the bright moonlight windswung branches tossed and swayed eerily across the blinds there was rumbling in chimneys whistling in keyholes and everywhere a clamour and a call
Sleep was out of the question and sitting up in bed I looked round
Edward sat up too
I was wondering when you were going to wake he said
Its no good trying to sleep through this
I vote we get up and do something
Im game I replied
Lets play at being in a ship at sea the plaint of the old house under the buffeting wind suggested this naturally and we can be wrecked on an island or left on a raft whichever you choose but I like an island best myself because theres more things on it
Edward on reflection negatived the idea
It would make too much noise he pointed out
Theres no fun playing at ships unless you can make a jolly good row
The door creaked and a small figure in white slipped cautiously in
Thought I heard you talking said Charlotte
We dont like it were afraidSelina too
Shell be here in a minute
Shes putting on her new dressinggown shes so proud of
His arms round his knees Edward cogitated deeply until Selina appeared barefooted and looking slim and tall in the new dressinggown
Then Look here he exclaimed now were all together I vote we go and explore
Youre always wanting to explore I said
What on earth is there to explore for in this house
Biscuits
said the inspired Edward
Hooray
Come on
chimed in Harold sitting up suddenly
He had been awake all the time but had been shamming asleep lest he should be fagged to do anything
It was indeed a fact as Edward had remembered that our thoughtless elders occasionally left the biscuits out a prize for the nightwalking adventurer with nerves of steel
Edward tumbled out of bed and pulled a baggy old pair of knickerbockers over his bare shanks
Then he girt himself with a belt into which he thrust on the one side a large wooden pistol on the other an old singlestick and finally he donned a big slouchhatonce an unclesthat we used for playing Guy Fawkes and CharlestheSecondupatree in
Whatever the audience Edward if possible always dressed for his parts with care and conscientiousness while Harold and I true Elizabethans cared little about the mounting of the piece so long as the real dramatic heart of it beat sound
Our commander now enjoined on us a silence deep as the grave reminding us that Aunt Eliza usually slept with an open door past which we had to file
But well take the short cut through the Blue Room said the wary Selina
Of course said Edward approvingly
I forgot about that
Now then
You lead the way
The Blue Room had in prehistoric times been added to by taking in a superfluous passage and so not only had the advantage of two doors but enabled us to get to the head of the stairs without passing the chamber wherein our dragonaunt lay couched
It was rarely occupied except when a casual uncle came down for the night
We entered in noiseless file the room being plunged in darkness except for a bright strip of moonlight on the floor across which we must pass for our exit
On this our leading lady chose to pause seizing the opportunity to study the hang of her new dressinggown
Greatly satisfied thereat she proceeded after the feminine fashion to peacock and to pose pacing a minuet down the moonlit patch with an imaginary partner
This was too much for Edwards histrionic instincts and after a moments pause he drew his singlestick and with flourishes meet for the occasion strode onto the stage
A struggle ensued on approved lines at the end of which Selina was stabbed slowly and with unction and her corpse borne from the chamber by the ruthless cavalier
The rest of us rushed after in a clump with capers and gesticulations of delight the special charm of the performance lying in the necessity for its being carried out with the dumbest of dumb shows
Once out on the dark landing the noise of the storm without told us that we had exaggerated the necessity for silence so grasping the tails of each others nightgowns even as Alpine climbers rope themselves together in perilous places we fared stoutly down the staircasemoraine and across the grim glacier of the hall to where a faint glimmer from the halfopen door of the drawingroom beckoned to us like friendly hostellights
Entering we found that our thriftless seniors had left the sound red heart of a fire easily coaxed into a cheerful blaze and biscuitsa platefulsmiled at us in an encouraging sort of way together with the halves of a lemon already once squeezed but still suckable
The biscuits were righteously shared the lemon segments passed from mouth to mouth and as we squatted round the fire its genial warmth consoling our unclad limbs we realised that so many nocturnal perils had not been braved in vain
Its a funny thing said Edward as we chatted how I hate this room in the daytime
It always means having your face washed and your hair brushed and talking silly company talk
But tonight its really quite jolly
Looks different somehow
I never can make out I said what people come here to tea for
They can have their own tea at home if they liketheyre not poor peoplewith jam and things and drink out of their saucer and suck their fingers and enjoy themselves but they come here from a long way off and sit up straight with their feet off the bars of their chairs and have one cup and talk the same sort of stuff every time
Selina sniffed disdainfully
You dont know anything about it she said
In society you have to call on each other
Its the proper thing to do
Pooh
YOURE not in society said Edward politely and whats more you never will be
Yes I shall some day retorted Selina but I shant ask you to come and see me so there
Wouldnt come if you did growled Edward
Well you wont get the chance rejoined our sister claiming her right of the last word
There was no heat about these little amenities which made upas we understood itthe art of polite conversation
I don t like society people put in Harold from the sofa where he was sprawling at full lengtha sight the daylight hours would have blushed to witness
There were some of em here this afternoon when you two had gone off to the station
Oh and I found a dead mouse on the lawn and I wanted to skin it but I wasnt sure I knew how by myself and they came out into the garden and patted my headI wish people wouldnt do thatand one of em asked me to pick her a flower
Dont know why she couldnt pick it herself but I said All right I will if youll hold my mouse
But she screamed and threw it away and Augustus the cat got it and ran away with it
I believe it was really his mouse all the time cos hed been looking about as if he had lost something so I wasnt angry with HIM but what did SHE want to throw away my mouse for
You have to be careful with mice reflected Edward theyre such slippery things
Do you remember we were playing with a dead mouse once on the piano and the mouse was Robinson Crusoe and the piano was the island and somehow Crusoe slipped down inside the island into its works and we couldnt get him out though we tried rakes and all sorts of things till the tuner came
And that wasnt till a week after and then Here Charlotte who had been nodding solemnly fell over into the fender and we realised that the wind had dropped at last and the house was lapped in a great stillness
Our vacant beds seemed to be calling to us imperiously and we were all glad when Edward gave the signal for retreat
At the top of the staircase Harold unexpectedly turned mutinous insisting on his right to slide down the banisters in a free country
Circumstances did not allow of argument I suggested frogsmarching instead and frogsmarched he accordingly was the procession passing solemnly across the moonlit Blue Room with Harold horizontal and limply submissive
Snug in bed at last I was just slipping off into slumber when I heard Edward explode with chuckle and snort
By Jove
he said I forgot all about it
The new tutors sleeping in the Blue Room
Lucky he didnt wake up and catch us I grunted drowsily and both of us without another thought on the matter sank into wellearned repose
Next morning we came down to breakfast braced to grapple with fresh adversity but were surprised to find our garrulous friend of the previous dayhe was late in making his appearance strangely silent and apparently preoccupied
Having polished off our porridge we ran out to feed the rabbits explaining to them that a beast of a tutor would prevent their enjoying so much of our society as formerly
On returning to the house at the fated hour appointed for study we were thunderstruck to see the stationcart disappearing down the drive freighted with our new acquaintance
Aunt Eliza was brutally uncommunicative but she was overheard to remark casually that she thought the man must be a lunatic
In this theory we were only too ready to concur dismissing thereafter the whole matter from our minds
Some weeks later it happened that Uncle Thomas while paying us a flying visit produced from his pocket a copy of the latest weekly Psyche a Journal of the Unseen and proceeded laborously to rid himself of much incomprehensible humour apparently at our expense
We bore it patiently with the forced grin demanded by convention anxious to get at the source of inspiration which it presently appeared lay in a paragraph circumstantially describing our modest and humdrum habitation
Case III it began
The following particulars were communicated by a young member of the Society of undoubted probity and earnestness and are a chronicle of actual and recent experience
A fairly accurate description of the house followed with details that were unmistakable but to this there succeeded a flood of meaningless drivel about apparitions nightly visitants and the like writ in a manner betokening a disordered mind coupled with a feeble imagination
The fellow was not even original
All the old material was therethe storm at night the haunted chamber the white lady the murder reenacted and so onalready worn threadbare in many a Christmas Number
No one was able to make head or tail of the stuff or of its connexion with our quiet mansion and yet Edward who had always suspected the man persisted in maintaining that our tutor of a brief span was somehow or other at the bottom of it
A FALLING OUT Harold told me the main facts of this episode some time later in bits and with reluctance
It was not a recollection he cared to talk about
The crude blank misery of a moment is apt to leave a dull bruise which is slow to depart if it ever does so entirely and Harold confesses to a twinge or two still at times like the veteran who brings home a bullet inside him from martial plains over sea
He knew he was a brute the moment he had done it Selina had not meant to worry only to comfort and assist
But his soul was one raw sore within him when he found himself shut up in the schoolroom after hours merely for insisting that 7 times 7 amounted to 47
The injustice of it seemed so flagrant
Why not 47 as much as 49
One number was no prettier than the other to look at and it was evidently only a matter of arbitrary taste and preference and anyhow it had always been 47 to him and would be to the end of time
So when Selina came in out of the sun leaving the Trappers or the Far West behind her and putting off the glory of being an Apache squaw in order to hear him his tables and win his release Harold turned on her venomously rejected her kindly overtures and ever drove his elbow into her sympathetic ribs in his determination to be left alone in the glory of sulks
The fit passed directly his eyes were opened and his soul sat in the dust as he sorrowfully began to cast about for some atonement heroic enough to salve the wrong
Of course poor Selina looked for no sacrifice nor heroics whatever she didnt even want him to say he was sorry
If he would only make it up she would have done the apologising part herself
But that was not a boys way
Something solid Harold felt was due from him and until that was achieved makingup must not be thought of in order that the final effect might not be spoilt
Accordingly when his release came and poor Selina hung about trying to catch his eye Harold possessed by the demon of a distorted motive avoided her steadilythough he was bleeding inwardly at every minute of delayand came to me instead
Needless to say I approved his plan highly it was so much more hightoned than just going and makingup tamely which any one could do and a girl who had been jobbed in the ribs by a hostile elbow could not be expected for a moment to overlook it without the liniment of an offering to soothe her injured feelings
I know what she wants most said Harold
She wants that set of teathings in the toyshop window with the red and blue flowers on em shes wanted it for months cos her dolls are getting big enough to have real afternoon tea and she wants it so badly that she wont walk that side of the street when we go into the town
But it costs five shillings
Then we set to work seriously and devoted the afternoon to a realisation of assets and the composition of a Budget that might have been dated without shame from Whitehall
The result worked out as follows s d By one uncle unspent through having been lost for nearly a weekturned up at last in the straw of the dogkennel 



2 6  Carry forward 2 6 s d Brought forward 2 6 By advance from me on security of next uncle and failing that to be called in at Christmas 











1 0 By shaken out of missionarybox with the help of a knifeblade
They were our own pennies and a forced levy 




0 4 By bet due from Edward for walking across the field where Farmer Larkins bull was and Edward bet him twopence he wouldnt called in with difficulty 





0 2 By advance from Martha on no security at all only you mustnt tell your aunt 


1 0  Total 5 0 and at last we breathed again
The rest promised to be easy
Selina had a teaparty at five on the morrow with the chipped old wooden teathings that had served her successive dolls from babyhood
Harold would slip off directly after dinner going alone so as not to arouse suspicion as we were not allowed to go into the town by ourselves
It was nearly two miles to our small metropolis but there would be plenty of time for him to go and return even laden with the olivebranch neatly packed in shavings besides he might meet the butcher who was his friend and would give him a lift
Then finally at five the rapture of the new tea service descended from the skies and retribution made making up at last without loss of dignity
With the event before us we thought it a small thing that twentyfour hours more of alienation and pretended sulks must be kept up on Harolds part but Selina who naturally knew nothing of the treat in store for her moped for the rest of the evening and took a very heavy heart to bed
When next day the hour for action arrived Harold evaded Olympian attention with an easy modesty born of long practice and made off for the front gate
Selina who had been keeping her eye upon him thought he was going down to the pond to catch frogs a joy they had planned to share together and made after him but Harold though he heard her footsteps continued sternly on his high mission without even looking back and Selina was left to wander disconsolately among flowerbeds that had lostfor her all scent and colour
I saw it all and although cold reason approved our line of action instinct told me we were brutes
Harold reached the townso he recounted afterwardsin record time having run most of the way for fear the teathings which had reposed six months in the window should be snapped up by some other consciencestricken lacerator of a sisters feelings and it seemed hardly credible to find them still there and their owner willing to part with them for the price marked on the ticket
He paid his money down at once that there should be no drawing back from the bargain and then as the things had to be taken out of the window and packed and the afternoon was yet young he thought he might treat himself to a taste of urban joys and la vie de Boheme
Shops came first of course and he flattened his nose successively against the window with the indiarubber balls in it and the clockwork locomotive and against the barbers window with wigs on blocks reminding him of uncles and shavingcream that looked so good to eat and the grocers window displaying more currants than the whole British population could possibly consume without a special effort and the window of the bank wherein gold was thought so little of that it was dealt about in shovels
Next there was the market place with all its clamorous joys and when a runaway calf came down the street like a cannonball Harold felt that he had not lived in vain
The whole place was so brimful of excitement that he had quite forgotten the why and the wherefore of his being there when a sight of the church clock recalled him to his better self and sent him flying out of the town as he realised he had only just time enough left to get back in
If he were after his appointed hour he would not only miss his high triumph but probably would be detected as a transgressor of boundsa crime before which a private opinion on multiplication sank to nothingness
So he jogged along on his homeward way thinking of many things and probably talking to himself a good deal as his habit was and had covered nearly half the distance when suddenlya deadly sinking in the pit of his stomacha paralysis of every limbaround him a world extinct of light and musica black sun and a reeling skyhe had forgotten the tea things
It was useless it was hopeless all was over and nothing could now be done nevertheless he turned and ran back wildly blindly choking with the big sobs that evoked neither pity nor comfort from a merciless mocking world around a stitch in his side dust in his eyes and black despair clutching at his heart
So he stumbled on with leaden legs and bursting sides tillas if Fate had not yet dealt him her last worst buffeton turning a corner in the road he almost ran under the wheels of a dogcart in which as it pulled up was apparent the portly form of Farmer Larkin the archenemy whose ducks he had been shying stones at that very morning
Had Harold been in his right and unclouded senses he would have vanished through the hedge some seconds earlier rather than pain the farmer by any unpleasant reminiscences which his appearance might call up but as things were he could only stand and blubber hopelessly caring indeed little now what further ill might befall him
The farmer for his part surveyed the desolate figure with some astonishment calling out in no unfriendly accents Why Master Harold
whatever be the matter
Baint runnin away be ee
Then Harold with the unnatural courage born of desperation flung himself on the step and climbing into the cart fell in the straw at the bottom of it sobbing out that he wanted to go back go back
The situation had a vagueness but the farmer a man of action rather than words swung his horse round smartly and they were in the town again by the time Harold had recovered himself sufficiently to furnish some details
As they drove up to the shop the woman was waiting at the door with the parcel and hardly a minute seemed to have elapsed since the black crisis ere they were bowling along swiftly home the precious parcel hugged in a close embrace
And now the farmer came out in quite a new and unexpected light
Never a word did he say of broken fences and hurdles of trampled crops and harried flocks and herds
One would have thought the man had never possessed a head of live stock in his life
Instead he was deeply interested in the whole dolorous quest of the teathings and sympathised with Harold on the disputed point in mathematics as if he had been himself at the same stage of education
As they neared home Harold found himself to his surprise sitting up and chatting to his new friend like man to man and before he was dropped at a convenient gap in the garden hedge he had promised that when Selina gave her first public teaparty little Miss Larkin should be invited to come and bring ha whole sawdust family along with her and the farmer appeared as pleased and proud as if he hat been asked to a gardenparty at Marlborough House
Really those Olympians have certain good points far down in them
I shall have to leave off abusing them some day
At the hour of five Selina having spent the afternoon searching for Harold in all his accustomed haunts sat down disconsolately to tea with her dolls who ungenerously refused to wait beyond the appointed hour
The wooden teathings seemed more chipped than usual and the dolls themselves had more of wax and sawdust and less of human colour and intelligence about them than she ever remembered before
It was then that Harold burst in very dusty his stockings at his heels and the channels ploughed by tears still showing on his grimy cheeks and Selina was at last permitted to know that he had been thinking of her ever since his illjudged exhibition of temper and that his sulks had not been the genuine article nor had he gone frogging by himself
It was a very happy hostess who dispensed hospitality that evening to a glassyeyed stiffkneed circle and many a dollish gaucherie that would have been severely checked on ordinary occasions was as much overlooked as if it had been a birthday
But Harold and I in our stupid masculine way thought all her happiness sprang from possession of the longcoveted tea service
LUSISTI SATIS  Among the many fatuous ideas that possessed the Olympian noddle this one was preeminent that being Olympians they could talk quite freely in our presence on subjects of the closest import to us so long as names dates and other landmarks were ignored
We were supposed to be denied the faculty for putting two and two together and like the monkeys who very sensibly refrain from speech lest they should be set to earn their livings we were careful to conceal our capabilities for a simple syllogism
Thus we were rarely taken by surprise and so were considered by our disappointed elders to be apathetic and to lack the divine capacity for wonder
Now the daily output of the letterbag with the mysterious discussions that ensued thereon had speedily informed us that Uncle Thomas was intrusted with a missiona mission too affecting ourselves
Uncle Thomass missions were many and various a selfimportant man one liking the business while protesting that he sank under the burden he was the missionary so to speak of our remote habitation
The matching a ribbon the running down to the stores the interviewing a cookthese and similar duties lent constant colour and variety to his vacant life in London and helped to keep down his figure
When the matter however had in our presence to be referred to with nods and pronouns with significant hiatuses and interpolations in the French tongue then the red flag was flown the stormcone hoisted and by a studious pretence of inattention we were not long in plucking out the heart of the mystery
To clinch our conclusion we descended suddenly and together on Martha proceeding however not by simple inquiry as to facts that would never have donebut by informing her that the air was full of school and that we knew all about it and then challenging denial
Martha was a trusty soul but a bad witness for the defence and we soon had it all out of her
The word had gone forth the school had been selected the necessary sheets were hemming even now and Edward was the designated and appointed victim
It had always been before us as an inevitable bourne this strange unknown thing called school and yetperhaps I should say consequentlywe had never seriously set ourselves to consider what it really meant
But now that the grim spectre loomed imminent stretching lean hands for one of our flock it behoved us to face the situation to take soundings in this uncharted sea and find out whither we were drifting
Unfortunately the data in our possession were absolutely insufficient and we knew not whither to turn for exact information
Uncle Thomas could have told us all about it of course he had been there himself once in the dim and misty past
But an unfortunate conviction that Nature had intended him for a humourist tainted all his evidence besides making it wearisome to hear
Again of such among our contemporaries as we had approached the trumpets gave forth an uncertain sound
According to some it meant larks revels emancipation and a foretaste of the bliss of manhood
According to othersthe majority alasit was a private and peculiar Hades that could give the original institution points and a beating
When Edward was observed to be swaggering round with a jaunty air and his chest stuck out I knew that he was contemplating his future from the one point of view
When on the contrary he was subdued and unaggressive and sought the society of his sisters I recognised that the other aspect was in the ascendant
You can always run away you know I used to remark consolingly on these latter occasions and Edward would brighten up wonderfully at the suggestion while Charlotte melted into tears before her vision of a brother with blistered feet and an empty belly passing nights of frost neath the lee of windy haystacks
It was to Edward of course that the situation was chiefly productive of anxiety and yet the ensuing change in my own circumstances and position furnished me also with food for grave reflexion
Hitherto I had acted mostly to orders
Even when I had devised and counselled any particular devilry it had been carried out on Edwards approbation andas eldestat his special risk
Henceforward I began to be anxious of the bugbear Responsibility and to realise what a soulthrottling thing it is
True my new position would have its compensations
Edward had been masterful exceedingly imperious perhaps a little narrow impassioned for hard facts and with scant sympathy for makebelieve
I should now be free and untrammelled in the conception and carrying out of a scheme I could accept and reject to better artistic purpose
It would moreover be needless to be a Radical any more
Radical I never was really by nature or by sympathy
The part had been thrust on me one day when Edward proposed to foist the House of Lords on our small Republic
The principles of the thing he set forth learnedly and well and it all sounded promising enough till he went on to explain that for the present at least he proposed to be the House of Lords himself
We others were to be the Commons
There would be promotions of course he added dependent on service and on fitness and open to both sexes and to me in especial he held out hopes of speedy advancement
But in its initial stages the thing wouldnt work properly unless he were first and only Lord
Then I put my foot down promptly and said it was all rot and I didnt see the good of any House of Lords at all
Then you must be a low Radical
said Edward with fine contempt
The inference seemed hardly necessary but what could I do
I accepted the situation and said firmly Yes I was a low Radical
In this monstrous character I had been obliged to masquerade ever since but now I could throw it off and look the world in the face again
And yet did this and other gains really outbalance my losses
Henceforth I should it was true be leader and chief but I should also be the buffer between the Olympians and my little clan
To Edward this had been nothing he had withstood the impact of Olympus without flinching like Teneriffe or Atlas unremoved
But was I equal to the task
And was there not rather a danger that for the sake of peace and quietness I might be tempted to compromise compound and make terms
sinking thus by successive lapses into the Blameless Prig
I dont mean of course that I thought out my thoughts to the exact point here set down
In those fortunate days of old one was free from the hard necessity of transmuting the vague idea into the mechanical inadequate medium of words
But the feeling was there that I might not possess the qualities of character for so delicate a position
The unnatural halo round Edward got more pronounced his own demeanour more responsible and dignified with the arrival of his new clothes
When his trunk and playbox were sent in the approaching cleavage between our brother who now belonged to the future and ourselves still claimed by the past was accentuated indeed
His name was painted on each of them in large letters and after their arrival their owner used to disappear mysteriously and be found eventually wandering round his luggage murmuring to himself Edward in a rapt remote sort of way
It was a weakness of course and pointed to a soft spot in his character but those who can remember the sensation of first seeing their names in print will not think hardly of him
As the short days sped by and the grim event cast its shadow longer and longer across our threshold an unnatural politeness a civility scarce canny began to pervade the air
In those latter hours Edward himself was frequently heard to say Please and also Would you mind fetchin that ball
while Harold and I would sometimes actually find ourselves trying to anticipate his wishes
As for the girls they simply grovelled
The Olympians too in their uncouth way by gift of carnal delicacies and suchlike indulgence seemed anxious to demonstrate that they had hitherto misjudged this one of us
Altogether the situation grew strained and false and I think a general relief was felt when the end came
We all trooped down to the station of course it is only in later years that the farce of seeing people off is seen in its true colours
Edward was the life and soul of the party and if his gaiety struck one at times as being a trifle overdone it was not a moment to be critical
As we tramped along I promised him I would ask Farmer Larkin not to kill any more pigs till he came back for the holidays and he said he would send me a proper catapultthe real lethal article not a kids plaything
Then suddenly when we were about halfway down one of the girls fell asnivelling
The happy few who dare to laugh at the woes of seasickness will perhaps remember how on occasion the sudden collapse of a fellowvoyager before their very eyes has caused them hastily to revise their selfconfidence and resolve to walk more humbly for the future
Even so it was with Edward who turned his head aside feigning an interest in the landscape
It was but for a moment then he recollected the hat he was wearinga hard bowler the first of that sort he had ever owned
He took it off examined it and felt it over
Something about it seemed to give him strength and he was a man once more
At the station Edwards first care was to dispose his boxes on the platform so that every one might see the labels and the lettering thereon
One did not go to school for the first time every day
Then he read both sides of his ticket carefully shifted it to every one of his pockets in turn and finally fell to chinking of his money to keep his courage up
We were all dry of conversation by this time and could only stand round and stare in silence at the victim decked for the altar
And as I looked at Edward in new clothes of a manly cut with a hard hat upon his head a railway ticket in one pocket and money of his own in the othermoney to spend as he liked and no questions askedI began to feel dimly how great was the gulf already yawning betwixt us
Fortunately I was not old enough to realise further that here on this little platform the old order lay at its last gasp and that Edward might come back to us but it would not be the Edward of yore nor could things ever be the same again
When the train steamed up at last we all boarded it impetuously with the view of selecting the one peerless carriage to which Edward might be intrusted with the greatest comfort and honour and as each one found the ideal compartment at the same moment and vociferously maintained its merits he stood some chance for a time of being left behind
A porter settled the matter by heaving him through the nearest door and as the train moved off Edwards head was thrust out of the window wearing on it an unmistakable firstquality grin that he had been saving up somewhere for the supreme moment
Very small and white his face looked on the long side of the retreating train
But the grin was visible undeniable stoutly maintained till a curve swept him from our sight and he was borne away in the dying rumble out of our placid backwater out into the busy world of rubs and knocks and competition out into the New Life
When a crab has lost a leg his gait is still more awkward than his wont till Time and healing Nature make him totus teres atque rotundus once more
We straggled back from the station disjointedly Harold who was very silent sticking close to me his last slender props while the girls in front their heads together were already reckoning up the weeks to the holidays
Home at last Harold suggested one or two occupations of a spicy and contraband flavour but though we did our manful best there was no knocking any interest out of them
Then I suggested others with the same want of success
Finally we found ourselves sitting silent on an upturned wheelbarrow our chins on our fists staring haggardly into the raw new conditions of our changed life the ruins of a past behind our backs
And all the while Selina and Charlotte were busy stuffing Edwards rabbits with unwonted forage bilious and green polishing up the cage of his mice till the occupants raved and swore like householders in springtime and collecting materials for new bows and arrows whips boats guns and four inhand harness against the return of Ulysses
Little did they dream that the hero once back from Troy and all its onsets would scornfully condemn their clumsy but laborious armoury as rot and humbug and only fit for kids
This with many another like awakening was mercifully hidden from them
Could the veil have been lifted and the girls permitted to see Edward as he would appear a short three months hence ragged of attire and lawless of tongue a scorner of tradition and an adept in strange new physical tortures one who would in the same halfhour dismember a doll and shatter a hallowed beliefin fine a sort of swaggering Captain fresh from the Spanish Maincould they have had the least hint of this well then perhaps
But which of us is of mental fibre to stand the test of a glimpse into futurity
Let us only hope that even with certain disillusionment ahead the girls would have acted precisely as they did
And perhaps we have reason to be very grateful that both as children and long afterwards we are never allowed to guess how the absorbing pursuit of the moment will appear not only to others but to ourselves a very short time hence
So we pass with a gusto and a heartiness that to an onlooker would seem almost pathetic from one droll devotion to another misshapen passion and who shall care to play Rhadamanthus to appraise the record and to decide how much of it is solid achievement and how much the merest childs play
