And yet there are places where Time seems to linger lovingly long after youth has departed and to which he seems loath to bring the evil day
Who has not known some eventempered old man or woman who seemed to have drunk of the fountain of youth
Who has not seen somewhere an old town that having long since ceased to grow yet held its own without perceptible decline
Some such trite reflectionas apposite to the subject as most random reflections arepassed through the mind of a young man who came out of the front door of the Patesville Hotel about nine oclock one fine morning in spring a few years after the Civil War and started down Front Street toward the markethouse
Arriving at the town late the previous evening he had been driven up from the steamboat in a carriage from which he had been able to distinguish only the shadowy outlines of the houses along the street so that this morning walk was his first opportunity to see the town by daylight
He was dressed in a suit of linen duckthe day was warma panama straw hat and patent leather shoes
In appearance he was tall dark with straight black lustrous hair and very cleancut highbred features
When he paused by the clerks desk on his way out to light his cigar the day clerk who had just come on duty glanced at the register and read the last entry JOHN WARWICK CLARENCE SOUTH CAROLINA
One of the South Calina bigbugs I reckon probably in cotton or turpentine
The gentleman from South Carolina walking down the street glanced about him with an eager look in which curiosity and affection were mingled with a touch of bitterness
He saw little that was not familiar or that he had not seen in his dreams a hundred times during the past ten years
There had been some changes it is true some melancholy changes but scarcely anything by way of addition or improvement to counterbalance them
Here and there blackened and dismantled walls marked the place where handsome buildings once had stood for Shermans march to the sea had left its mark upon the town
The stores were mostly of brick two stories high joining one another after the manner of cities
Some of the names on the signs were familiar others including a number of Jewish names were quite unknown to him
A two minutes walk brought Warwickthe name he had registered under and as we shall call himto the markethouse the central feature of Patesville from both the commercial and the picturesque points of view
Standing foursquare in the heart of the town at the intersection of the two main streets a jog at each street corner left around the markethouse a little public square which at this hour was well occupied by carts and wagons from the country and empty drays awaiting hire
Warwick was unable to perceive much change in the markethouse
Perhaps the surface of the red brick long unpainted had scaled off a little more here and there
There might have been a slight accretion of the moss and lichen on the shingled roof
But the tall tower with its four faced clock rose as majestically and uncompromisingly as though the land had never been subjugated
Was it so irreconcilable Warwick wondered as still to peal out the curfew bell which at nine oclock at night had clamorously warned all negroes slave or free that it was unlawful for them to be abroad after that hour under penalty of imprisonment or whipping
Was the old constable whose chief business it had been to ring the bell still alive and exercising the functions of his office and had age lessened or increased the number of times that obliging citizens performed this duty for him during his temporary absences in the company of convivial spirits
A few moments later Warwick saw a colored policeman in the old constables placea stronger reminder than even the burned buildings that war had left its mark upon the old town with which Time had dealt so tenderly
The lower story of the markethouse was open on all four of its sides to the public square
Warwick passed through one of the wide brick arches and traversed the building with a leisurely step
He looked in vain into the stalls for the butcher who had sold fresh meat twice a week on market days and he felt a genuine thrill of pleasure when he recognized the red bandana turban of old Aunt Lyddy the ancient negro woman who had sold him gingerbread and fried fish and told him weird tales of witchcraft and conjuration in the old days when as an idle boy he had loafed about the markethouse
He did not speak to her however or give her any sign of recognition
He threw a glance toward a certain corner where steps led to the town hall above
On this stairway he had once seen a manacled free negro shot while being taken upstairs for examination under a criminal charge
Warwick recalled vividly how the shot had rung out
He could see again the livid look of terror on the victims face the gathering crowd the resulting confusion
The murderer he recalled had been tried and sentenced to imprisonment for life but was pardoned by a merciful governor after serving a year of his sentence
As Warwick was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet he could not foresee that thirty years later even this would seem an excessive punishment for so slight a misdemeanor
Leaving the markethouse Warwick turned to the left and kept on his course until he reached the next corner
After another turn to the right a dozen paces brought him in front of a small weatherbeaten frame building from which projected a wooden signboard bearing the inscription ARCHIBALD STRAIGHT LAWYER
He turned the knob but the door was locked
Retracing his steps past a vacant lot the young man entered a shop where a colored man was employed in varnishing a coffin which stood on two trestles in the middle of the floor
Not at all impressed by the melancholy suggestiveness of his task he was whistling a lively air with great gusto
Upon Warwicks entrance this effusion came to a sudden end and the coffinmaker assumed an air of professional gravity
Goodmawnin suh he said lifting his cap politely
Goodmorning answered Warwick
Can you tell me anything about Judge Straights office hours
De ole jedge has ben a little onreglar sence de wah suh but he ginally gits roun bout ten oclock er so
Hes ben kin er feeble fer de las few yeahs
An I reckon continued the undertaker solemnly his glance unconsciously seeking a row of fine caskets standing against the wallI reckon hell soon be goin de way er all de earth
Man dat is bawn er oman hath but a shot time ter lib an is full er misry
He cometh up an is cut down lack as a flower
De days er his life is threesco an tenan de ole jedge is libbed mo dn dat suh by five yeahs ter say de leas
Death quoted Warwick with whose mood the undertakers remarks were in tune is the penalty that all must pay for the crime of living
Dat s a fac suh dat s a fac so dey mus so dey mus
An den all de dead has ter be buried
An we does ou sheer of it suh we does ou sheer
We conducs de obsquies er all de bes wite folks er de town suh
Warwick left the undertakers shop and retraced his steps until he had passed the lawyers office toward which he threw an affectionate glance
A few rods farther led him past the old black Presbyterian church with its square tower embowered in a stately grove past the Catholic church with its many crosses and a painted wooden figure of St James in a recess beneath the gable and past the old Jefferson House once the leading hotel of the town in front of which political meetings had been held and political speeches made and political hard cider drunk in the days of Tippecanoe and Tyler too
The street down which Warwick had come intersected Front Street at a sharp angle in front of the old hotel forming a sort of flatiron block at the junction known as Liberty Pointperhaps because slave auctions were sometimes held there in the good old days
Just before Warwick reached Liberty Point a young woman came down Front Street from the direction of the markethouse
When their paths converged Warwick kept on down Front Street behind her it having been already his intention to walk in this direction
Warwicks first glance had revealed the fact that the young woman was strikingly handsome with a stately beauty seldom encountered
As he walked along behind her at a measured distance he could not help noting the details that made up this pleasing impression for his mind was singularly alive to beauty in whatever embodiment
The girls figure he perceived was admirably proportioned she was evidently at the period when the angles of childhood were rounding into the promising curves of adolescence
Her abundant hair of a dark and glossy brown was neatly plaited and coiled above an ivory column that rose straight from a pair of gently sloping shoulders clearly outlined beneath the light muslin frock that covered them
He could see that she was tastefully though not richly dressed and that she walked with an elastic step that revealed a light heart and the vigor of perfect health
Her face of course he could not analyze since he had caught only the one brief but convincing glimpse of it
The young woman kept on down Front Street Warwick maintaining his distance a few rods behind her
They passed a factory a warehouse or two and then leaving the brick pavement walked along on mother earth under a leafy arcade of spreading oaks and elms
Their way led now through a residential portion of the town which as they advanced gradually declined from staid respectability to poverty open and unabashed
Warwick observed as they passed through the respectable quarter that few people who met the girl greeted her and that some others whom she passed at gates or doorways gave her no sign of recognition from which he inferred that she was possibly a visitor in the town and not well acquainted
Their walk had continued not more than ten minutes when they crossed a creek by a wooden bridge and came to a row of mean houses standing flush with the street
At the door of one an old black woman had stooped to lift a large basket piled high with laundered clothes
The girl as she passed seized one end of the basket and helped the old woman to raise it to her head where it rested solidly on the cushion of her headkerchief
During this interlude Warwick though he had slackened his pace measurably had so nearly closed the gap between himself and them as to hear the old woman say with the dulcet negro intonation Tanky honey de Lawd gwine bless you sho
You wuz alluz a good gal and de Lawd love eveybody wat hep de po ole nigger
You gwine ter hab good luck all yo bawn days
I hope youre a true prophet Aunt Zilphy laughed the girl in response
The sound of her voice gave Warwick a thrill
It was soft and sweet and clearquite in harmony with her appearance
That it had a faint suggestiveness of the old womans accent he hardly noticed for the current Southern speech including his own was rarely without a touch of it
The corruption of the white peoples speech was one elementonly oneof the negros unconscious revenge for his own debasement
The houses they passed now grew scattering and the quarter of the town more neglected
Warwick felt himself wondering where the girl might be going in a neighborhood so uninviting
When she stopped to pull a halfnaked negro child out of a mudhole and set him upon his feet he thought she might be some young lady from the upper part of the town bound on some errand of mercy or going perhaps to visit an old servant or look for a new one
Once she threw a backward glance at Warwick thus enabling him to catch a second glimpse of a singularly pretty face
Perhaps the young woman found his presence in the neighborhood as unaccountable as he had deemed hers for finding his glance fixed upon her she quickened her pace with an air of startled timidity
A woman with such a figure thought Warwick ought to be able to face the world with the confidence of Phryne confronting her judges
By this time Warwick was conscious that something more than mere grace or beauty had attracted him with increasing force toward this young woman
A suggestion at first faint and elusive of something familiar had grown stronger when he heard her voice and became more and more pronounced with each rod of their advance and when she stopped finally before a gate and opening it went into a yard shut off from the street by a row of dwarf cedars Warwick had already discounted in some measure the surprise he would have felt at seeing her enter there had he not walked down Front Street behind her
There was still sufficient unexpectedness about the act however to give him a decided thrill of pleasure
It must be Rena he murmured
Who could have dreamed that she would blossom out like that
It must surely be Rena
He walked slowly past the gate and peered through a narrow gap in the cedar hedge
The girl was moving along a sanded walk toward a gray unpainted house with a steep roof broken by dormer windows
The trace of timidity he had observed in her had given place to the more assured bearing of one who is upon his own ground
The garden walks were bordered by long rows of jonquils pinks and carnations inclosing clumps of fragrant shrubs lilies and roses already in bloom
Toward the middle of the garden stood two fine magnoliatrees with heavy dark green glistening leaves while nearer the house two mighty elms shaded a wide piazza at one end of which a honeysuckle vine and at the other a Virginia creeper running over a wooden lattice furnished additional shade and seclusion
On dark or wintry days the aspect of this garden must have been extremely sombre and depressing and it might well have seemed a fit place to hide some guilty or disgraceful secret
But on the bright morning when Warwick stood looking through the cedars it seemed with its green frame and canopy and its bright carpet of flowers an ideal retreat from the fierce sunshine and the sultry heat of the approaching summer
The girl stooped to pluck a rose and as she bent over it her profile was clearly outlined
She held the flower to her face with a longdrawn inhalation then went up the steps crossed the piazza opened the door without knocking and entered the house with the air of one thoroughly at home
Yes said the young man to himself its Rena sure enough
The house stood on a corner around which the cedar hedge turned continuing along the side of the garden until it reached the line of the front of the house
The piazza to a rear wing at right angles to the front of the house was open to inspection from the side street which to judge from its deserted look seemed to be but little used
Turning into this street and walking leisurely past the back yard which was only slightly screened from the street by a chinatree Warwick perceived the young woman standing on the piazza facing an elderly woman who sat in a large rockingchair plying a pair of knittingneedles on a halffinished stocking
Warwicks walk led him within three feet of the side gate which he felt an almost irresistible impulse to enter
Every detail of the house and garden was familiar a thousand cords of memory and affection drew him thither but a stronger countermotive prevailed
With a great effort he restrained himself and after a momentary pause walked slowly on past the house with a backward glance which he turned away when he saw that it was observed
Warwicks attention had been so fully absorbed by the house behind the cedars and the women there that he had scarcely noticed on the other side of the neglected bystreet two men working by a large open window in a low rude building with a clapboarded roof directly opposite the back piazza occupied by the two women
Both the men were busily engaged in shaping barrelstaves each wielding a sharpedged drawingknife on a piece of seasoned oak clasped tightly in a wooden vise
I jes wonder who dat man is an wat he s doin on dis street observed the younger of the two with a suspicious air
He had noticed the gentlemans involuntary pause and his interest in the opposite house and had stopped work for a moment to watch the stranger as he went on down the street
Nev min bout dat man said the elder one
You ten ter yo wuk an finish dat bairlstave
You spens entiely too much er yo time stretchin yo neck atter other people
An you need n sturb yosef bout dem folks cross de street fer dey aint yo kin an youre wastin yo time bothin yo min wid em er wid folks wat comes on de street on account of em
Look shap now boy er youll git dat stave trim too much
The younger man resumed his work but still found time to throw a slanting glance out of the window
The gentleman he perceived stood for a moment on the rotting bridge across the old canal and then walked slowly ahead until he turned to the right into Back Street a few rods farther on
II AN EVENING VISIT Toward evening of the same day Warwick took his way down Front Street in the gathering dusk
By the time night had spread its mantle over the earth he had reached the gate by which he had seen the girl of his morning walk enter the cedar bordered garden
He stopped at the gate and glanced toward the house which seemed dark and silent and deserted
Its more than likely he thought that they are in the kitchen
I reckon Id better try the back door
But as he drew cautiously near the corner he saw a mans figure outlined in the yellow light streaming from the open door of a small house between Front Street and the cooper shop
Wishing for reasons of his own to avoid observation Warwick did not turn the corner but walked on down Front Street until he reached a point from which he could see at a long angle a ray of light proceeding from the kitchen window of the house behind the cedars
They are there he muttered with a sigh of relief for he had feared they might be away
I suspect Ill have to go to the front door after all
No one can see me through the trees
He retraced his steps to the front gate which he essayed to open
There was apparently some defect in the latch for it refused to work
Warwick remembered the trick and with a slight sense of amusement pushed his foot under the gate and gave it a hitch to the left after which it opened readily enough
He walked softly up the sanded path tiptoed up the steps and across the piazza and rapped at the front door not too loudly lest this too might attract the attention of the man across the street
There was no response to his rap
He put his ear to the door and heard voices within and the muffled sound of footsteps
After a moment he rapped again a little louder than before
There was an instant cessation of the sounds within
He rapped a third time to satisfy any lingering doubt in the minds of those who he felt sure were listening in some trepidation
A moment later a ray of light streamed through the keyhole
Whos there
a womans voice inquired somewhat sharply
A gentleman answered Warwick not holding it yet time to reveal himself
Does Mis Molly Walden live here
Yes was the guarded answer
Im Mis Walden
Whats yor business
I have a message to you from your son John
A key clicked in the lock
The door opened and the elder of the two women Warwick had seen upon the piazza stood in the doorway peering curiously and with signs of great excitement into the face of the stranger
You ve got a message from my son you say
she asked with tremulous agitation
Is he sick or in trouble
No
Hes well and doing well and sends his love to you and hopes youve not forgotten him
Fergot him
No God knows I aint fergot him
But come in sir an tell me somethin mo about him
Warwick went in and as the woman closed the door after him he threw a glance round the room
On the wall over the mantelpiece hung a steel engraving of General Jackson at the battle of New Orleans and on the opposite wall a framed fashionplate from Godeys Ladys Book
In the middle of the room an octagonal centretable with a single leg terminating in three sprawling feet held a collection of curiously shaped seashells
There was a great haircloth sofa somewhat the worse for wear and a wellfilled bookcase
The screen standing before the fireplace was covered with Confederate banknotes of various denominations and designs in which the heads of Jefferson Davis and other Confederate leaders were conspicuous
Imperious Caesar dead and turned to clay Might stop a hole to keep the wind away murmured the young man as his eye fell upon this specimen of decorative art
The woman showed her visitor to a seat
She then sat down facing him and looked at him closely
When did you last see my son
she asked
Ive never met your son he replied
Her face fell
Then the message comes through you from somebody else
No directly from your son
She scanned his face with a puzzled look
This bearded young gentleman who spoke so politely and was dressed so well surelyno it could not be
and yet Warwick was smiling at her through a mist of tears
An electric spark of sympathy flashed between them
They rose as if moved by one impulse and were clasped in each others arms
John my John
It IS John
Mothermy dear old mother
I didnt think she sobbed that Id ever see you again
He smoothed her hair and kissed her
And are you glad to see me mother
Am I glad to see you
Its like the dead comin to life
I thought Id lost you forever John my son my darlin boy
she answered hugging him strenuously
I couldnt live without seeing you mother he said
He meant it too or thought he did although he had not seen her for ten years
Youve grown so tall John and are such a fine gentleman
And you ARE a gentleman now John aint yousure enough
Nobody knows the old story
Well mother Ive taken a mans chance in life and have tried to make the most of it and I havent felt under any obligation to spoil it by raking up old stories that are best forgotten
There are the dear old books have they been read since I went away
No honey theres ben nobody to read em excep Rena an she dont take to books quite like you did
But Ive kep em dusted clean an kep the moths an the bugs out for I hoped youd come back some day an knowed youd like to find em all in their places jus like you left em
Thats mighty nice of you mother
You could have done no more if you had loved them for themselves
But where is Rena
I saw her on the street today but she didnt know me from Adam nor did I guess it was she until she opened the gate and came into the yard
Ive ben so glad to see you that Id fergot about her answered the mother
Rena oh Rena
The girl was not far away she had been standing in the next room listening intently to every word of the conversation and only kept from coming in by a certain constraint that made a brother whom she had not met for so many years seem almost as much a stranger as if he had not been connected with her by any tie
Yes mamma she answered coming forward
Rena child heres yor brother John whos come back to see us
Tell im howdy
As she came forward Warwick rose put his arm around her waist drew her toward him and kissed her affectionately to her evident embarrassment
She was a tall girl but he towered above her in quite a protecting fashion and she thought with a thrill how fine it would be to have such a brother as this in the town all the time
How proud she would be if she could but walk up the street with such a brother by her side
She could then hold up her head before all the world oblivious to the glance of pity or contempt
She felt a very pronounced respect for this tall gentleman who held her blushing face between his hands and looked steadily into her eyes
Youre the little sister I used to read stories to and whom I promised to come and see some day
Do you remember how you cried when I went away
It seems but yesterday she answered
Ive still got the dime you gave me
He kissed her again and then drew her down beside him on the sofa where he sat enthroned between the two loving and excited women
No king could have received more sincere or delighted homage
He was a man come into a household of womena man of whom they were proud and to whom they looked up with fond reverence
For he was not only a sona brotherbut he represented to them the world from which circum stances had shut them out and to which distance lent even more than its usual enchantment and they felt nearer to this faroff world because of the glory which Warwick reflected from it
Youre a very pretty girl said Warwick regarding his sister thoughtfully
I followed you down Front Street this morning and scarcely took my eyes off you all the way and yet I didnt know you and scarcely saw your face
You improve on acquaintance tonight I find you handsomer still
Now John said his mother expostulating mildly youll spile her if you dont min
The girl was beaming with gratified vanity
What woman would not find such praise sweet from almost any source and how much more so from this great man who from his exalted station in the world must surely know the things whereof he spoke
She believed every word of it she knew it very well indeed but wished to hear it repeated and itemized and emphasized
No he wont mamma she asserted for hes flattering me
He talks as if I was some rich young lady who lives on the Hillthe Hill was the aristocratic portion of the town instead of a poor Instead of a poor young girl who has the hill to climb replied her brother smoothing her hair with his hand
Her hair was long and smooth and glossy with a wave like the ripple of a summer breeze upon the surface of still water
It was the girls great pride and had been sedulously cared for
What lovely hair
It has just the wave that yours lacks mother
Yes was the regretful reply Ive never ben able to git that wave out
But her hairs ben took good care of an there aint nary gal in town thats got any finer
Dont worry about the wave mother
Its just the fashionable ripple and becomes her immensely
I think my little Albert favors his Aunt Rena somewhat
Your little Albert
they cried
Youve got a child
Oh yes he replied calmly a very fine baby boy
They began to purr in proud contentment at this information and made minute inquiries about the age and weight and eyes and nose and other important details of this precious infant
They inquired more coldly about the childs mother of whom they spoke with greater warmth when they learned that she was dead
They hung breathless on Warwicks words as he related briefly the story of his life since he had left years before the house behind the cedarshow with a stout heart and an abounding hope he had gone out into a seemingly hostile world and made fortune stand and deliver
His story had for the women the charm of an escape from captivity with all the thrill of a pirates tale
With the whole world before him he had remained in the South the land of his fathers where he conceived he had an inalienable birthright
By some good chance he had escaped military service in the Confederate army and in default of older and more experienced men had undertaken during the rebellion the management of a large estate which had been left in the hands of women and slaves
He had filled the place so acceptably and employed his leisure to such advantage that at the close of the war he found himselfhe was modest enough to think too in default of a better manthe husband of the orphan daughter of the gentleman who had owned the plantation and who had lost his life upon the battlefield
Warwicks wife was of good family and in a more settled condition of society it would not have been easy for a young man of no visible antecedents to win her hand
A year or two later he had taken the oath of allegiance and had been admitted to the South Carolina bar
Rich in his wifes right he had been able to practice his profession upon a high plane without the worry of sordid cares and with marked success for one of his age
I suppose he concluded that I have got along at the bar as elsewhere owing to the lack of better men
Many of the good lawyers were killed in the war and most of the remainder were disqualified while I had the advantage of being alive and of never having been in arms against the government
People had to have lawyers and they gave me their business in preference to the carpet baggers
Fortune you know favors the available man
His mother drank in with parted lips and glistening eyes the story of his adventures and the record of his successes
As Rena listened the narrow walls that hemmed her in seemed to draw closer and closer as though they must crush her
Her brother watched her keenly
He had been talking not only to inform the women but with a deeper purpose conceived since his morning walk and deepened as he had followed during his narrative the changing expression of Renas face and noted her intense interest in his story her pride in his successes and the occasional wistful look that indexed her selfpity so completely
An I spose youre happy John
asked his mother
Well mother happiness is a relative term and depends I imagine upon how nearly we think we get what we think we want
I have had my chance and havent thrown it away and I suppose I ought to be happy
But then I have lost my wife whom I loved very dearly and who loved me just as much and Im troubled about my child
Why
they demanded
Is there anything the matter with him
No not exactly
Hes well enough as babies go and has a good enough nurse as nurses go
But the nurse is ignorant and not always careful
A child needs some woman of its own blood to love it and look after it intelligently
Mis Mollys eyes were filled with tearful yearning
She would have given all the world to warm her sons child upon her bosom but she knew this could not be
Did your wife leave any kin
she asked with an effort
No near kin she was an only child
Youll be gettin married again suggested his mother
No he replied I think not
Warwick was still reading his sisters face and saw the spark of hope that gleamed in her expressive eye
If I had some relation of my own that I could take into the house with me he said reflectively the child might be healthier and happier and I should be much more at ease about him
The mother looked from son to daughter with a dawning apprehension and a sudden pallor
When she saw the yearning in Renas eyes she threw herself at her sons feet
Oh John she cried despairingly dont take her away from me
Dont take her John darlin for itd break my heart to lose her
Renas arms were round her mothers neck and Renas voice was sounding in her ears
There there mamma
Never mind
I wont leave you mammadear old mamma
Your Renall stay with you always and never never leave you
John smoothed his mothers hair with a comforting touch patted her withered cheek soothingly lifted her tenderly to her place by his side and put his arm about her
You love your children mother
Theyre all Ive got she sobbed an they cos me all I had
When the las ones gone Ill want to go too for Ill be all alone in the world
Dont take Rena John for if you do Ill never see her again an I cant bear to think of it
How would you like to lose yor one child
Well well mother well say no more about it
And now tell me all about yourself and about the neighbors and how you got through the war and whos dead and whos marriedand everything
The change of subject restored in some degree Mis Mollys equanimity and with returning calmness came a sense of other responsibilities
Good gracious Rena
she exclaimed
John s ben in the house an hour and aint had nothin to eat yet
Go in the kitchen an spread a clean tablecloth an git out that tater pone an a pitcher o that las kag o persimmon beer an let John take a bite an a sip
Warwick smiled at the mention of these homely dainties
I thought of your sweetpotato pone at the hotel today when I was at dinner and wondered if youd have some in the house
There was never any like yours and Ive forgotten the taste of persimmon beer entirely
Rena left the room to carry out her hospitable commission
Warwick taking advantage of her absence returned after a while to the former subject
Of course mother he said calmly I wouldnt think of taking Rena away against your wishes
A mothers claim upon her child is a high and holy one
Of course she will have no chance here where our story is known
The war has wrought great changes has put the bottom rail on top and all thatbut it hasnt wiped THAT out
Nothing but death can remove that stain if it does not follow us even beyond the grave
Here she must forever benobody
With me she might have got out into the world with her beauty she might have made a good marriage and if I mistake not she has sense as well as beauty
Yes sighed the mother shes got good sense
She aint as quick as you was an dont read as many books but shes keerful an painstakin an always tries to do whats right
Shes ben thinkin about goin away somewhere an tryin to git a school to teach er somethin sence the Yankees have started em everywhere for po white folks an niggers too
But I dont like fer her to go too fur
With such beauty and brains continued Warwick she could leave this town and make a place for herself
The place is already made
She has only to step into my carriageafter perhaps a little preparationand ride up the hill which I have had to climb so painfully
It would be a great pleasure to me to see her at the top
But of course it is impossiblea mere idle dream
YOUR claim comes first her duty chains her here
It would be so lonely without her murmured the mother weakly an I love her somy las one
No doubtno doubt returned Warwick with a sympathetic sigh of course you love her
Its not to be thought of for a moment
Its a pity that she couldnt have a chance herebut how could she
I had thought she might marry a gentleman but I dare say shell do as well as the rest of her friendsas well as Mary B for instance who marriedHomer Pettifoot did you say
Or maybe Billy Oxendine might do for her
As long as she has never known any better shell probably be as well satisfied as though she married a rich man and lived in a fine house and kept a carriage and servants and moved with the best in the land
The tortured mother could endure no more
The one thing she desired above all others was her daughters happiness
Her own life had not been governed by the highest standards but about her love for her beautiful daughter there was no taint of selfishness
The life her son had described had been to her always the ideal but unattainable life
Circumstances some beyond her control and others for which she was herself in a measure responsible had put it forever and inconceivably beyond her reach
It had been conquered by her son
It beckoned to her daughter
The comparison of this free and noble life with the sordid existence of those around her broke down the last barrier of opposition
O Lord
she moaned what shall I do with out her
Itll be lonely Johnso lonely
Youll have your home mother said Warwick tenderly accepting the implied surrender
Youll have your friends and relatives and the knowledge that your children are happy
Ill let you hear from us often and no doubt you can see Rena now and then
But you must let her go motherit would be a sin against her to refuse
She may go replied the mother brokenly
Ill not stand in her wayIve got sins enough to answer for already
Warwick watched her pityingly
He had stirred her feelings to unwonted depths and his sympathy went out to her
If she had sinned she had been more sinned against than sinning and it was not his part to judge her
He had yielded to a sentimental weakness in deciding upon this trip to Patesville
A matter of business had brought him within a days journey of the town and an over mastering impulse had compelled him to seek the mother who had given him birth and the old town where he had spent the earlier years of his life
No one would have acknowledged sooner than he the folly of this visit
Men who have elected to govern their lives by principles of abstract right and reason which happen perhaps to be at variance with what society considers equally right and reasonable should for fear of complications be careful about descending from the lofty heights of logic to the common level of impulse and affection
Many years before Warwick when a lad of eighteen had shaken the dust of the town from his feet and with it he fondly thought the blight of his inheritance and had achieved elsewhere a worthy career
But during all these years of absence he had cherished a tender feeling for his mother and now again found himself in her house amid the familiar surroundings of his childhood
His visit had brought joy to his mothers heart and was now to bring its shrouded companion sorrow
His mother had lived her life for good or ill A wider door was open to his sisterher mother must not bar the entrance
She may go the mother repeated sadly drying her tears
Ill give her up for her good
The table s ready mamma said Rena coming to the door
The lunch was spread in the kitchen a large unplastered room at the rear with a wide fireplace at one end
Only yesterday it seemed to Warwick he had sprawled upon the hearth turning sweet potatoes before the fire or roasting groundpeas in the ashes or more often reading by the light of a blazing pineknot or lump of resin some volume from the bookcase in the hall
From Bulwers novel he had read the story of Warwick the Kingmaker and upon leaving home had chosen it for his own
He was a new man but he had the blood of an old race and he would select for his own one of its worthy names
Overhead loomed the same smoky beams decorated with what might have been from all appearances the same bunches of dried herbs the same strings of onions and red peppers
Over in the same corner stood the same spinningwheel and through the open door of an adjoining room he saw the old loom where in childhood he had more than once thrown the shuttle
The kitchen was different from the stately diningroom of the old colonial mansion where he now lived but it was homelike and it was familiar
The sight of it moved his heart and he felt for the moment a sort of a blind anger against the fate which made it necessary that he should visit the home of his childhood if at all like a thief in the night
But he realized after a moment that the thought was pure sentiment and that one who had gained so much ought not to complain if he must give up a little
He who would climb the heights of life must leave even the pleasantest valleys behind
Rena asked her mother howd you like to go an pay yor brother John a visit
I guess I might spare you for a little while
The girls eyes lighted up
She would not have gone if her mother had wished her to stay but she would always have regarded this as the lost opportunity of her life
Are you sure you dont care mamma
she asked hoping and yet doubting
Oh Ill manage to git along somehow or other
You can go an stay till you git homesick an then Johnll let you come back home
But Mis Molly believed that she would never come back except like her brother under cover of the night
She must lose her daughter as well as her son and this should be the penance for her sin
That her children must expiate as well the sins of their fathers who had sinned so lightly after the manner of men neither she nor they could foresee since they could not read the future
The next boat by which Warwick could take his sister away left early in the morning of the next day but one
He went back to his hotel with the understanding that the morrow should be devoted to getting Rena ready for her departure and that Warwick would visit the household again the following evening for as has been intimated there were several reasons why there should be no open relations between the fine gentleman at the hotel and the women in the house behind the cedars who while superior in blood and breeding to the people of the neighborhood in which they lived were yet under the shadow of some cloud which clearly shut them out from the better society of the town
Almost any resident could have given one or more of these reasons of which any one would have been sufficient to most of them and to some of them Warwicks mere presence in the town would have seemed a bold and daring thing
III THE OLD JUDGE On the morning following the visit to his mother Warwick visited the old judges office
The judge was not in but the door stood open and Warwick entered to await his return
There had been fewer changes in the office where he had spent many many hours than in the town itself
The dust was a little thicker the papers in the pigeonholes of the walnut desk were a little yellower the cobwebs in the corners a little more aggressive
The flies droned as drowsily and the murmur of the brook below was just as audible
Warwick stood at the rear window and looked out over a familiar view
Directly across the creek on the low ground beyond might be seen the dilapidated stone foundation of the house where once had lived Flora Macdonald the Jacobite refugee the most romantic character of North Carolina history
Old Judge Straight had had a tree cut away from the creekside opposite his window so that this historic ruin might be visible from his office for the judge could trace the ties of blood that connected him collaterally with this famous personage
His pamphlet on Flora Macdonald printed for private circulation was highly prized by those of his friends who were fortunate enough to obtain a copy
To the left of the window a placid millpond spread its wide expanse and to the right the creek disappeared under a canopy of overhanging trees
A footstep sounded in the doorway and Warwick turning faced the old judge
Time had left greater marks upon the lawyer than upon his office
His hair was whiter his stoop more pronounced when he spoke to Warwick his voice had some of the shrillness of old age and in his hand upon which the veins stood out prominently a decided tremor was perceptible
Goodmorning Judge Straight said the young man removing his hat with the graceful Southern deference of the young for the old
Goodmorning sir replied the judge with equal courtesy
You dont remember me I imagine suggested Warwick
Your face seems familiar returned the judge cautiously but I cannot for the moment recall your name
I shall be glad to have you refresh my memory
I was John Walden sir when you knew me
The judges face still gave no answering light of recognition
Your old officeboy continued the younger man
Ah indeed so you were
rejoined the judge warmly extending his hand with great cordiality and inspecting Warwick more closely through his spectacles
Let me seeyou went away a few years before the war wasnt it
Yes sir to South Carolina
Yes yes I remember now
I had been thinking it was to the North
So many things have happened since then that it taxes an old mans memory to keep track of them all
Well well
and how have you been getting along
Warwick told his story in outline much as he had given it to his mother and sister and the judge seemed very much interested
And you married into a good family
he asked
Yes sir
And have children
One
And you are visiting your mother
Not exactly
I have seen her but I am stopping at a hotel
Hm
Are you staying long
I leave tomorrow
Its well enough
I wouldnt stay too long
The people of a small town are inquisitive about strangers and some of them have long memories
I remember we went over the law which was in your favor but custom is stronger than lawin these matters custom IS law
It was a great pity that your father did not make a will
Well my boy I wish you continued good luck I imagined you would make your way
Warwick went away and the old judge sat for a moment absorbed in reflection
Right and wrong he mused must be eternal verities but our standards for measuring them vary with our latitude and our epoch
We make our customs lightly once made like our sins they grip us in bands of steel we become the creatures of our creations
By one standard my old officeboy should never have been born
Yet he is a son of Adam and came into existence in the way ordained by God from the beginning of the world
In equity he would seem to be entitled to his chance in life it might have been wiser though for him to seek it farther afield than South Carolina
It was too near home even though the laws were with him
IV DOWN THE RIVER Neither mother nor daughter slept a great deal during the night of Warwicks first visit
Mis Molly anointed her sacrifice with tears and cried herself to sleep
Renas emotions were more conflicting she was sorry to leave her mother but glad to go with her brother
The mere journey she was about to make was a great event for the two women to contemplate to say nothing of the golden vision that lay beyond for neither of them had ever been out of the town or its vicinity
The next day was devoted to preparations for the journey
Renas slender wardrobe was made ready and packed in a large valise
Towards sunset Mis Molly took off her apron put on her slatbonnetshe was ever the pink of neatness picked her way across the street which was muddy from a rain during the day traversed the footbridge that spanned the ditch in front of the cooper shop and spoke first to the elder of the two men working there
Goodevenin Peter
Goodevenin mam responded the man briefly and not relaxing at all the energy with which he was trimming a barrelstave
Mis Molly then accosted the younger workman a darkbrown young man small in stature but with a wellshaped head an expressive forehead and features indicative of kindness intelligence humor and imagination
Frank she asked can I git you to do somethin fer me soon in the monin
Yas m I reckon so replied the young man resting his hatchet on the choppingblock
Wat is it Mis Molly
My daughter s goin away on the boat an I lowed you would n min totin her kyarpetbag down to the warf onless youd ruther haul it down on yor kyart
It aint very heavy
Of cose Ill pay you fer yor trouble
Thank y mam he replied
He knew that she would not pay him for the simple reason that he would not accept pay for such a service
Is she gwine fur
he asked with a sorrowful look which he could not entirely disguise
As fur as Wilminton an beyon
Shell be visitin her brother John who lives inanother State an wants her to come an see him
Yas m Ill come
I won need de kyart Ill tote de bag
Bout wat time shill I come over
Well long bout seven oclock or half pas
Shes goin on the Old North State an it leaves at eight
Frank stood looking after Mis Molly as she picked her way across the street until he was recalled to his duty by a sharp word from his father 
Ten ter yo wuk boy ten ter yo wuk
You re wastin yo timewastin yo time
Yes he was wasting his time
The beautiful young girl across the street could never be anything to him
But he had saved her life once and had dreamed that he might render her again some signal service that might win her friendship and convince her of his humble devotion
For Frank was not proud
A smile which Peter would have regarded as condescending to a free man who since the war was as good as anybody else a kind word which Peter would have considered offensively patronizing a piece of Mis Mollys famous potato pone from Renas hands a bone to a dog Peter called it oncewere ample rewards for the thousand and one small services Frank had rendered the two women who lived in the house behind the cedars
Frank went over in the morning a little ahead of the appointed time and waited on the back piazza until his services were required
You aint gwine ter be gone long is you Miss Rena
he inquired when Rena came out dressed for the journey in her best frock with broad white collar and cuffs
Rena did not know
She had been asking herself the same question
All sorts of vague dreams had floated through her mind during the last few hours as to what the future might bring forth
But she detected the anxious note in Franks voice and had no wish to give this faithful friend of the family unnecessary pain
Oh no Frank I reckon not
Im supposed to be just going on a short visit
My brother has lost his wife and wishes me to come and stay with him awhile and look after his little boy
Im feared youll lack it better dere Miss Rena replied Frank sorrowfully dropping his mask of unconcern an den you wont come back an none er yo friens wont never see you no mo
You dont think Frank asked Rena severely that I would leave my mother and my home and all my friends and NEVER come back again
Why no ndeed interposed Mis Molly wistfully as she hovered around her daughter giving her hair or her gown a touch here and there shell be so homesick in a month that shell be willin to walk home
You would n never hafter do dat Miss Rena returned Frank with a disconsolate smile
Ef you ever wanter come home an cant git back no other way jes let ME know an Ill take my mule an my kyart an fetch you back ef its from de een er de worl
Thank you Frank I believe you would said the girl kindly
Youre a true friend Frank and Ill not forget you while Im gone
The idea of her beautiful daughter riding home from the end of the world with Frank in a cart behind a oneeyed mule struck Mis Molly as the height of the ridiculousshe was in a state of excitement where tears or laughter would have come with equal easeand she turned away to hide her merriment
Her daughter was going to live in a fine house and marry a rich man and ride in her carriage
Of course a negro would drive the carriage but that was different from riding with one in a cart
When it was time to go Mis Molly and Rena set out on foot for the river which was only a short distance away
Frank followed with the valise
There was no gathering of friends to see Rena off as might have been the case under different circumstances
Her departure had some of the characteristics of a secret flight it was as important that her destination should not be known as it had been that her brother should conceal his presence in the town
Mis Molly and Rena remained on the bank until the steamer announced with a raucous whistle its readiness to depart
Warwick was seen for a moment on the upper deck from which he greeted them with a smile and a slight nod
He had bidden his mother an affectionate farewell the evening before
Rena gave her hand to Frank
Goodby Frank she said with a kind smile I hope you and mamma will be good friends while Im gone
The whistle blew a second warning blast and the deck hands prepared to draw in the gang plank
Rena flew into her mothers arms and then breaking away hurried on board and retired to her stateroom from which she did not emerge during the journey
The windowblinds were closed darkening the room and the stewardess who came to ask if she should bring her some dinner could not see her face distinctly but perceived enough to make her surmise that the young lady had been weeping
Po chile murmured the sympathetic colored woman I reckon some er her folks is dead er her sweetheart s gone back on her er ese shes had some kin er bad luck er nuther
Wite folks has deir troubles jes ez well ez black folks an sometimes feels em mo cause dey aint ez use ter em
Mis Molly went back in sadness to the lonely house behind the cedars henceforth to be peopled for her with only the memory of those she had loved
She had paid with her hearts blood another installment on the Shylocks bond exacted by society for her own happiness of the past and her childrens prospects for the future
The journey down the sluggish river to the seaboard in the flatbottomed sternwheel steamer lasted all day and most of the night
During the first halfday the boat grounded now and then upon a sandbank and the halfnaked negro deck hands toiled with ropes and poles to release it
Several times before Rena fell asleep that night the steamer would tie up at a landing and by the light of huge pine torches she watched the boat hands send the yellow turpentine barrels down the steep bank in a long string or pass cordwood on board from hand to hand
The excited negroes their white teeth and eyeballs glistening in the surrounding darkness to which their faces formed no relief the white officers in brown linen shouting swearing and gesticulating the yellow flickering torchlight over allmade up a scene of which the weird interest would have appealed to a more blase traveler than this girl upon her first journey
During the day Warwick had taken his meals in the diningroom with the captain and the other cabin passengers
It was learned that he was a South Carolina lawyer and not a carpetbagger
Such credentials were unimpeachable and the passengers found him a very agreeable traveling companion
Apparently sound on the subject of negroes Yankees and the righteousness of the lost cause he yet discussed these themes in a lofty and impersonal manner that gave his words greater weight than if he had seemed warped by a personal grievance
His attitude in fact piqued the curiosity of one or two of the passengers
Did your people lose any niggers
asked one of them
My father owned a hundred he replied grandly
Their respect for his views was doubled
It is easy to moralize about the misfortunes of others and to find good in the evil that they suffer only a true philosopher could speak thus lightly of his own losses
When the steamer tied up at the wharf at Wilmington in the early morning the young lawyer and a veiled lady passenger drove in the same carriage to a hotel
After they had breakfasted in a private room Warwick explained to his sister the plan he had formed for her future
Henceforth she must be known as Miss Warwick dropping the old name with the old life
He would place her for a year in a boardingschool at Charleston after which she would take her place as the mistress of his house
Having imparted this information he took his sister for a drive through the town
There for the first time Rena saw great ships which her brother told her sailed across the mighty ocean to distant lands whose flags he pointed out drooping lazily at the mast heads
The business portion of the town had an ancient and fishlike smell and most of the trade seemed to be in cotton and naval stores and products of the sea
The wharves were piled high with cotton bales and there were acres of barrels of resin and pitch and tar and spirits of turpentine
The market a long low wooden structure in the middle of the principal street was filled with a mass of people of all shades from blue black to Saxon blonde gabbling and gesticulating over piles of oysters and clams and freshly caught fish of varied hue
By ten oclock the sun was beating down so fiercely that the glitter of the white sandy streets dazzled and pained the eyes unaccustomed to it and Rena was glad to be driven back to the hotel
The travelers left together on an early afternoon train
Thus for the time being was severed the last tie that bound Rena to her narrow past and for some time to come the places and the people who had known her once were to know her no more
Some few weeks later Mis Molly called upon old Judge Straight with reference to the taxes on her property
Your son came in to see me the other day he remarked
He seems to have got along
Oh yes judge hes done fine John has an hes took his sister away with him
Ah
exclaimed the judge
Then after a pause he added I hope she may do as well
Thank you sir she said with a curtsy as she rose to go
Weve always knowed that you were our friend and wished us well
The judge looked after her as she walked away
Her bearing had a touch of timidity a shade of affectation and yet a certain pathetic dignity
It is a pity he murmured with a sigh that men cannot select their mothers
My young friend John has builded whether wisely or not very well but he has come back into the old life and carried away a part of it and I fear that this addition will weaken the structure
V THE TOURNAMENT The annual tournament of the Clarence Social Club was about to begin
The county fairground where all was in readiness sparkled with the youth and beauty of the town standing here and there under the trees in animated groups or moving toward the seats from which the pageant might be witnessed
A quarter of a mile of the race track to right and left of the judges stand had been laid off for the lists
Opposite the grand stand which occupied a considerable part of this distance a dozen uprights had been erected at measured intervals
Projecting several feet over the track from each of these uprights was an iron crossbar from which an iron hook depended
Between the uprights stout posts were planted of such a height that their tops could be easily reached by a swinging swordcut from a mounted rider passing upon the track
The influence of Walter Scott was strong upon the old South
The South before the war was essentially feudal and Scotts novels of chivalry appealed forcefully to the feudal heart
During the month preceding the Clarence tournament the local bookseller had closed out his entire stock of Ivanhoe consisting of five copies and had taken orders for seven copies more
The tournament scene in this popular novel furnished the model after which these bloodless imitations of the ancient passagesat arms were conducted with such variations as were required to adapt them to a different age and civilization
The best people gradually filled the grand stand while the poorer white and colored folks found seats outside upon what would now be known as the bleachers or stood alongside the lists
The knights masquerading in fanciful costumes in which brightcolored garments gilt paper and cardboard took the place of knightly harness were mounted on spirited horses
Most of them were gathered at one end of the lists while others practiced their steeds upon the unoccupied portion of the race track
The judges entered the grand stand and one of them after looking at his watch gave a signal
Immediately a herald wearing a bright yellow sash blew a loud blast upon a bugle and big with the importance of his office galloped wildly down the lists
An attendant on horseback busied himself hanging upon each of the pendent hooks an iron ring of some two inches in diameter while another on foot placed on top of each of the shorter posts a wooden ball some four inches through
Its my first tournament observed a lady near the front of the grand stand leaning over and addressing John Warwick who was seated in the second row in company with a very handsome girl
It is somewhat different from Ashbyde laZouch
It is the renaissance of chivalry Mrs Newberry replied the young lawyer and like any other renaissance it must adapt itself to new times and circumstances
For instance when we build a Greek portico having no Pentelic marble near at hand we use a pinetree one of natures columns which Grecian art at its best could only copy and idealize
Our knights are not weighted down with heavy armor but much more appropriately attired for a day like this in costumes that recall the picturesqueness without the discomfort of the old knightly harness
For an iron headed lance we use a wooden substitute with which we transfix rings instead of hearts while our trusty blades hew their way through wooden blocks instead of through flesh and blood
It is a South Carolina renaissance which has points of advantage over the tournaments of the olden time
Im afraid Mr Warwick said the lady that youre the least bit heretical about our chivalryor else youre a little too deep for me
The last would be impossible Mrs Newberry and Im sure our chivalry has proved its valor on many a hardfought field
The spirit of a thing after all is what counts and what is lacking here
We have the lists the knights the prancing steeds the trial of strength and skill
If our knights do not run the physical risks of Ashby delaZouch they have all the mental stimulus
Wounded vanity will take the place of wounded limbs and there will be broken hopes in lieu of broken heads
How many hearts in yonder group of gallant horsemen beat high with hope
How many possible Queens of Love and Beauty are in this group of fair faces that surround us
The lady was about to reply when the bugle sounded again and the herald dashed swiftly back upon his prancing steed to the waiting group of riders
The horsemen formed three abreast and rode down the lists in orderly array
As they passed the grand stand each was conscious of the battery of bright eyes turned upon him and each gave by his bearing some idea of his ability to stand fire from such weapons
One horse pranced proudly another caracoled with grace
One rider fidgeted nervously another trembled and looked the other way
Each horseman carried in his hand a long wooden lance and wore at his side a cavalry sabre of which there were plenty to be had since the war at small expense
Several left the ranks and drew up momentarily beside the grand stand where they took from fair hands a glove or a flower which was pinned upon the riders breast or fastened upon his hata ribbon or a veil which was tied about the lance like a pennon but far enough from the point not to interfere with the usefulness of the weapon
As the troop passed the lower end of the grand stand a horse excited by the crowd became somewhat unmanageable and in the effort to curb him the rider dropped his lance
The prancing animal reared brought one of his hoofs down upon the fallen lance with considerable force and sent a broken piece of it flying over the railing opposite the grand stand into the middle of a group of spectators standing there
The flying fragment was dodged by those who saw it coming but brought up with a resounding thwack against the head of a colored man in the second row who stood watching the grand stand with an eager and curious gaze
He rubbed his head ruefully and made a goodnatured response to the chaffing of his neighbors who seeing no great harm done made witty and original remarks about the advantage of being black upon occasions where ones skull was exposed to danger
Finding that the blow had drawn blood the young man took out a red bandana handkerchief and tied it around his head meantime letting his eye roam over the faces in the grand stand as though in search of some one that he expected or hoped to find there
The knights having reached the end of the lists now turned and rode back in open order with such skillful horsemanship as to evoke a storm of applause from the spectators
The ladies in the grand stand waved their handkerchiefs vigorously and the men clapped their hands
The beautiful girl seated by Warwicks side accidentally let a little square of white lacetrimmed linen slip from her hand
It fluttered lightly over the railing and buoyed up by the air settled slowly toward the lists
A young rider in the approaching rear rank saw the handkerchief fall and darting swiftly forward caught it on the point of his lance ere it touched the ground
He drew up his horse and made a movement as though to extend the handkerchief toward the lady who was blushing profusely at the attention she had attracted by her carelessness
The rider hesitated a moment glanced interrogatively at Warwick and receiving a smile in return tied the handkerchief around the middle of his lance and quickly rejoined his comrades at the head of the lists
The young man with the bandage round his head on the benches across the lists had forced his way to the front row and was leaning against the railing
His restless eye was attracted by the falling handkerchief and his face hitherto anxious suddenly lit up with animation
Yas suh yas suh its her
he muttered softly
Its Miss Rena shos you bawn
She looked lack a angel befo but now up dere mongs all dem rich fine folks she looks lack a whole flock er angels
Dey ain one er dem ladies wat could hol a candle ter her
I wonder wat dat mans gwine ter do wid her handkercher
I spose hes her genteman now
I wonder ef shed know me er speak ter me ef she seed me
I reckon she would spite er her gittin up so in de worl fer she wuz alluz good ter evybody an dat let even ME in he concluded with a sigh
Who is the lady Tryon
asked one of the young men addressing the knight who had taken the handkerchief
A Miss Warwick replied the knight pleasantly Miss Rowena Warwick the lawyers sister
I didnt know he had a sister rejoined the first speaker
I envy you your lady
There are six Rebeccas and eight Rowenas of my own acquaintance in the grand stand but she throws them all into the shade
She hasnt been here long surely I havent seen her before
She has been away at school she came only last night returned the knight of the crimson sash briefly
He was already beginning to feel a proprietary interest in the lady whose token he wore and did not care to discuss her with a casual acquaintance
The herald sounded the charge
A rider darted out from the group and galloped over the course
As he passed under each ring he tried to catch it on the point of his lancea feat which made the management of the horse with the left hand necessary and required a true eye and a steady arm
The rider captured three of the twelve rings knocked three others off the hooks and left six undisturbed
Turning at the end of the lists he took the lance with the reins in the left hand and drew his sword with the right
He then rode back over the course cutting at the wooden balls upon the posts
Of these he clove one in twain to use the parlance of chivalry and knocked two others off their supports
His performance was greeted with a liberal measure of applause for which he bowed in smiling acknowledgment as he took his place among the riders
Again the heralds call sounded and the tourney went forward
Rider after rider with varying skill essayed his fortune with lance and sword
Some took a liberal proportion of the rings others merely knocked them over the boundaries where they were collected by agile little negro boys and handed back to the attendants
A balking horse caused the spectators much amusement and his rider no little chagrin
The lady who had dropped the handkerchief kept her eye upon the knight who had bound it round his lance
Who is he John
she asked the gentleman beside her
That my dear Rowena is my good friend and client George Tryon of North Carolina
If he had been a stranger I should have said that he took a liberty but as things stand we ought to regard it as a compliment
The incident is quite in accord with the customs of chivalry
If George were but masked and you were veiled we should have a romantic situationyou the mysterious damsel in distress he the unknown champion
The parallel my dear might not be so hard to draw even as things are
But look it is his turn now Ill wager that he makes a good run
Ill take you up on that Mr Warwick said Mrs Newberry from behind who seemed to have a very keen ear for whatever Warwick said
Renas eyes were fastened on her knight so that she might lose no single one of his movements
As he rode down the lists more than one woman found him pleasant to look upon
He was a tall fair young man with gray eyes and a frank open face
He wore a slight mustache and when he smiled showed a set of white and even teeth
He was mounted on a very handsome and spirited bay mare was clad in a picturesque costume of which velvet kneebreeches and a crimson scarf were the most conspicuous features and displayed a marked skill in horsemanship
At the blast of the bugle his horse started forward and after the first few rods settled into an even gallop
Tryons lance held truly and at the right angle captured the first ring then the second and third
His coolness and steadiness seemed not at all disturbed by the applause which followed and one by one the remaining rings slipped over the point of his lance until at the end he had taken every one of the twelve
Holding the lance with its booty of captured rings in his left hand together with the bridle rein he drew his sabre with the right and rode back over the course
His horse moved like clockwork his eye was true and his hand steady
Three of the wooden balls fell from the posts split fairly in the middle while from the fourth he sliced off a goodly piece and left the remainder standing in its place
This performance by far the best up to this point and barely escaping perfection elicited a storm of applause
The rider was not so well known to the townspeople as some of the other participants and his name passed from mouth to mouth in answer to numerous inquiries
The girl whose token he had worn also became an object of renewed interest because of the result to her in case the knight should prove victor in the contest of which there could now scarcely be a doubt for but three riders remained and it was very improbable that any one of them would excel the last
Wagers for the remainder of the tourney stood anywhere from five and even from ten to one in favor of the knight of the crimson sash and when the last course had been run his backers were jubilant
No one of those following him had displayed anything like equal skill
The herald now blew his bugle and declared the tournament closed
The judges put their heads together for a moment
The bugle sounded again and the herald announced in a loud voice that Sir George Tryon having taken the greatest number of rings and split the largest number of balls was proclaimed victor in the tournament and entitled to the flowery chaplet of victory
Tryon having bowed repeatedly in response to the liberal applause advanced to the judges stand and received the trophy from the hands of the chief judge who exhorted him to wear the garland worthily and to yield it only to a better man
It will be your privilege Sir George announced the judge as the chief reward of your valor to select from the assembled beauty of Clarence the lady whom you wish to honor to whom we will all do homage as the Queen of Love and Beauty
Tryon took the wreath and bowed his thanks
Then placing the trophy on the point of his lance he spoke earnestly for a moment to the herald and rode past the grand stand from which there was another outburst of applause
Returning upon his tracks the knight of the crimson sash paused before the group where Warwick and his sister sat and lowered the wreath thrice before the lady whose token he had won
Oyez
Oyez
cried the herald Sir George Tryon the victor in the tournament has chosen Miss Rowena Warwick as the Queen of Love and Beauty and she will be crowned at the feast tonight and receive the devoirs of all true knights
The fairground was soon covered with scattered groups of the spectators of the tournament
In one group a vanquished knight explained in elaborate detail why it was that he had failed to win the wreath
More than one young woman wondered why some one of the home young men could not have taken the honors or if the stranger must win them why he could not have selected some belle of the town as Queen of Love and Beauty instead of this upstart girl who had blown into the town over night as one might say
Warwick and his sister standing under a spreading elm held a little court of their own
A dozen gentlemen and several ladies had sought an introduction before Tryon came up
I suppose John would have a right to call me out Miss Warwick said Tryon when he had been formally introduced and had shaken hands with Warwicks sister for taking liberties with the property and name of a lady to whom I had not had an introduction but I know John so well that you seemed like an old acquaintance and when I saw you and recalled your name which your brother had mentioned more than once I felt instinctively that you ought to be the queen
I entered my name only yesterday merely to swell the number and make the occasion more interesting
These fellows have been practicing for a month and I had no hope of winning
I should have been satisfied indeed if I hadnt made myself ridiculous but when you dropped your handkerchief I felt a sudden inspiration and as soon as I had tied it upon my lance victory perched upon my saddlebow guided my lance and sword and rings and balls went down before me like chaff before the wind
Oh it was a great inspiration Miss Warwick
Rena for it was our Patesville acquaintance fresh from boardingschool colored deeply at this frank and fervid flattery and could only murmur an inarticulate reply
Her year of instruction while distinctly improving her mind and manners had scarcely prepared her for so sudden an elevation into a grade of society to which she had hitherto been a stranger
She was not without a certain courage however and her brother who remained at her side helped her over the most difficult situations
Well forgive you George replied Warwick if youll come home to luncheon with us
Im mighty sorryawfully sorry returned Tryon with evident regret but I have another engagement which I can scarcely break even by the command of royalty
At what time shall I call for Miss Warwick this evening
I believe that privilege is mine along with the other honors and rewards of victoryunless she is bound to some one else
She is entirely free replied Warwick
Come as early as you like and Ill talk to you until shes ready
Tryon bowed himself away and after a number of gentlemen and a few ladies had paid their respects to the Queen of Love and Beauty and received an introduction to her Warwick signaled to the servant who had his carriage in charge and was soon driving homeward with his sister
No one of the party noticed a young negro with a handkerchief bound around his head who followed them until the carriage turned into the gate and swept up the wide drive that led to Warwicks doorstep
Well Rena said Warwick when they found themselves alone you have arrived
Your debut into society is a little more spectacular than I should have wished but we must rise to the occasion and make the most of it
You are winning the first fruits of your opportunity
You are the most envied woman in Clarence at this particular moment and unless I am mistaken will be the most admired at the ball tonight
VI THE QUEEN OF LOVE AND BEAUTY Shortly after luncheon Rena had a visitor in the person of Mrs Newberry a vivacious young widow of the town who proffered her services to instruct Rena in the etiquette of the annual ball
Now my dear said Mrs Newberry the first thing to do is to get your coronation robe ready
It simply means a gown with a long train
You have a lovely white waist
Get right into my buggy and well go down town to get the cloth take it over to Mrs Marshalls and have her run you up a skirt this afternoon
Rena placed herself unreservedly in the hands of Mrs Newberry who introduced her to the best dressmaker of the town a woman of much experience in such affairs who improvised during the afternoon a gown suited to the occasion
Mrs Marshall had made more than a dozen ball dresses during the preceding month being a wise woman and understanding her business thoroughly she had made each one of them so that with a few additional touches it might serve for the Queen of Love and Beauty
This was her first direct order for the specific garment
Tryon escorted Rena to the ball which was held in the principal public hall of the town and attended by all the best people
The champion still wore the costume of the morning in place of evening dress save that long stockings and dancingpumps had taken the place of ridingboots
Rena went through the ordeal very creditably
Her shyness was palpable but it was saved from awkwardness by her native grace and good sense
She made up in modesty what she lacked in aplomb
Her months in school had not eradicated a certain selfconsciousness born of her secret
The braincells never lose the impressions of youth and Renas Patesville life was not far enough removed to have lost its distinctness of outline
Of the two the present was more of a dream the past was the more vivid reality
At school she had learned something from books and not a little from observation
She had been able to compare herself with other girls and to see wherein she excelled or fell short of them
With a sincere desire for improvement and a wish to please her brother and do him credit she had sought to make the most of her opportunities
Building upon a foundation of innate taste and intelligence she had acquired much of the selfpossession which comes from a knowledge of correct standards of deportment
She had moreover learned without difficulty for it suited her disposition to keep silence when she could not speak to advantage
A certain necessary reticence about the past added strength to a natural reserve
Thus equipped she held her own very well in the somewhat trying ordeal of the ball at which the fiction of queenship and the attendant ceremonies which were pretty and graceful made her the most conspicuous figure
Few of those who watched her move with easy grace through the measures of the dance could have guessed how nearly her heart was in her mouth during much of the time
Youre doing splendidly my dear said Mrs Newberry who had constituted herself Renas chaperone
I trust your Gracious Majesty is pleased with the homage of your devoted subjects said Tryon who spent much of his time by her side and kept up the character of knight in his speech and manner
Very much replied the Queen of Love and Beauty with a somewhat tired smile
It was pleasant but she would be glad she thought when it was all over
Keep up your courage whispered her brother
You are not only queen but the belle of the ball
I am proud of you
A dozen women here would give a year off the latter end of life to be in your shoes tonight
Rena felt immensely relieved when the hour arrived at which she could take her departure which was to be the signal for the breakingup of the ball
She was driven home in Tryons carriage her brother accompanying them
The night was warm and the drive homeward under the starlight in the open carriage had a soothing effect upon Renas excited nerves
The calm restfulness of the night the cool blue depths of the unclouded sky the solemn croaking of the frogs in a distant swamp were much more in harmony with her nature than the crowded brilliancy of the ballroom
She closed her eyes and leaning back in the carriage thought of her mother who she wished might have seen her daughter this night
A momentary pang of homesickness pierced her tender heart and she furtively wiped away the tears that came into her eyes
Goodnight fair Queen
exclaimed Tryon breaking into her reverie as the carriage rolled up to the doorstep and let your loyal subject kiss your hand in token of his fealty
May your Majesty never abdicate her throne and may she ever count me her humble servant and devoted knight
And now sister said Warwick when Tryon had been driven away now that the masquerade is over let us to sleep and tomorrow take up the serious business of life
Your day has been a glorious success
He put his arm around her and gave her a kiss and a brotherly hug
It is a dream she murmured sleepily only a dream
I am Cinderella before the clock has struck
Goodnight dear John
Goodnight Rowena
VII MID NEW SURROUNDINGS Warwicks residence was situated in the outskirts of the town
It was a fine old plantation house built in colonial times with a stately colonnade wide verandas and long windows with Venetian blinds
It was painted white and stood back several rods from the street in a charming setting of palmettoes magnolias and flowering shrubs
Rena had always thought her mothers house large but now it seemed cramped and narrow in comparison with this roomy mansion
The furniture was oldfashioned and massive
The great brass andirons on the wide hearth stood like sentinels proclaiming and guarding the dignity of the family
The spreading antlers on the wall testified to a mighty hunter in some past generation
The portraits of Warwicks wifes ancestors high featured proud men and women dressed in the fashions of a bygone agelooked down from tarnished gilt frames
It was all very novel to her and very impressive
When she ate off china with silver knives and forks that had come down as heirlooms escaping somehow the ravages and exigencies of the war timeWarwick told her afterwards how he had buried them out of reach of friend or foeshe thought that her brother must be wealthy and she felt very proud of him and of her opportunity
The servants of whom there were several in the house treated her with a deference to which her eight months in school had only partly accustomed her
At school she had been one of many to be served and had herself been held to obedience
Here for the first time in her life she was mistress and tasted the sweets of power
The household consisted of her brother and herself a cook a coachman a nurse and her brothers little son Albert
The child with a fine instinct had put out his puny arms to Rena at first sight and she had clasped the little man to her bosom with a motherly caress
She had always loved weak creatures
Kittens and puppies had ever found a welcome and a meal at Renas hands only to be chased away by Mis Molly who had had a wider experience
No shiftless poor white no halfwitted or hungry negro had ever gone unfed from Mis Mollys kitchen door if Rena were there to hear his plaint
Little Albert was pale and sickly when she came but soon bloomed again in the sunshine of her care and was happy only in her presence
Warwick found pleasure in their growing love for each other and was glad to perceive that the child formed a living link to connect her with his home
Dat chile suttnly do lub Miss Rena an dats a fac sho s you bawn remarked Lissa the cook to Mimy the nurse one day
Youll get yo nose put out er jint ef you dont min
I aint frettin honey laughed the nurse goodnaturedly
She was not at all jealous
She had the same wages as before and her labors were materially lightened by the aunts attention to the child
This gave Mimy much more time to flirt with Tom the coachman
It was a source of much gratification to Warwick that his sister seemed to adapt herself so easily to the new conditions
Her graceful movements the quiet elegance with which she wore even the simplest gown the easy authoritativeness with which she directed the servants were to him proofs of superior quality and he felt correspondingly proud of her
His feeling for her was something more than brotherly lovehe was quite conscious that there were degrees in brotherly love and that if she had been homely or stupid he would never have disturbed her in the stagnant life of the house behind the cedars
There had come to him from some source down the stream of time a rill of the Greek sense of proportion of fitness of beauty which is indeed but proportion embodied the perfect adaptation of means to ends
He had perceived more clearly than she could have appreciated it at that time the undeveloped elements of discord between Rena and her former life
He had imagined her lending grace and charm to his own household
Still another motive a purely psychological one had more or less consciously influenced him
He had no fear that the family secret would ever be discovered he had taken his precautions too thoroughly he thought for that and yet he could not but feel at times that if peradventureit was a conceivable hypothesisit should become known his fine social position would collapse like a house of cards
Because of this knowledge which the world around him did not possess he had felt now and then a certain sense of loneliness and there was a measure of relief in having about him one who knew his past and yet whose knowledge because of their common interest would not interfere with his present or jeopardize his future
For he had always been in a figurative sense a naturalized foreigner in the world of wide opportunity and Rena was one of his old compatriots whom he was glad to welcome into the populous loneliness of his adopted country
VIII THE COURTSHIP In a few weeks the echoes of the tournament died away and Renas life settled down into a pleasant routine which she found much more comfortable than her recent spectacular prominence
Her queenship while not entirely forgiven by the ladies of the town had gained for her a temporary social prominence
Among her own sex Mrs Newberry proved a warm and enthusiastic friend
Rumor whispered that the lively young widow would not be unwilling to console Warwick in the loneliness of the old colonial mansion to which his sister was a most excellent medium of approach
Whether this was true or not it is unnecessary to inquire for it is no part of this story except as perhaps indicating why Mrs Newberry played the part of the female friend without whom no woman is ever launched successfully in a small and conservative society
Her brothers standing gave her the right of social entry the tournament opened wide the door and Mrs Newberry performed the ceremony of introduction
Rena had many visitors during the month following the tournament and might have made her choice from among a dozen suitors but among them all her knight of the handkerchief found most favor
George Tryon had come to Clarence a few months before upon business connected with the settlement of his grandfathers estate
A rather complicated litigation had grown up around the affair various phases of which had kept Tryon almost constantly in the town
He had placed matters in Warwicks hands and had formed a decided friendship for his attorney for whom he felt a frank admiration
Tryon was only twentythree and his friends additional five years supplemented by a certain professional gravity commanded a great deal of respect from the younger man
When Tryon had known Warwick for a week he had been ready to swear by him
Indeed Warwick was a man for whom most people formed a liking at first sight
To this power of attraction he owed most of his successfirst with Judge Straight of Patesville then with the lawyer whose office he had entered at Clarence with the woman who became his wife and with the clients for whom he transacted business
Tryon would have maintained against all comers that Warwick was the finest fellow in the world
When he met Warwicks sister the foundation for admiration had already been laid
If Rena had proved to be a maiden lady of uncertain age and doubtful personal attractiveness Tryon would probably have found in her a most excellent lady worthy of all respect and esteem and would have treated her with profound deference and sedulous courtesy
When she proved to be a young and handsome woman of the type that he admired most he was capable of any degree of infatuation
His mother had for a long time wanted him to marry the orphan daughter of an old friend a vivacious blonde who worshiped him
He had felt friendly towards her but had shrunk from matrimony
He did not want her badly enough to give up his freedom
The war had interfered with his education and though fairly well instructed he had never attended college
In his own opinion he ought to see something of the world and have his youthful fling
Later on when he got ready to settle down if Blanche were still in the humor they might marry and sink to the humdrum level of other old married people
The fact that Blanche Leary was visiting his mother during his unexpectedly long absence had not operated at all to hasten his return to North Carolina
He had been having a very good time at Clarence and at the distance of several hundred miles was safe for the time being from any immediate danger of marriage
With Renas advent however he had seen life through different glasses
His heart had thrilled at first sight of this tall girl with the ivory complexion the rippling brown hair and the inscrutable eyes
When he became better acquainted with her he liked to think that her thoughts centred mainly in himself and in this he was not far wrong
He discovered that she had a short upper lip and what seemed to him an eminently kissable mouth
After he had dined twice at Warwicks subsequently to the tournamenthis lucky choice of Rena had put him at once upon a household footing with the familyhis views of marriage changed entirely
It now seemed to him the duty as well as the high and holy privilege of a young man to marry and manfully to pay his debt to society
When in Renas presence he could not imagine how he had ever contemplated the possibility of marriage with Blanche Learyshe was utterly entirely and hopelessly unsuited to him
For a fair man of vivacious temperament this stately dark girl was the ideal mate
Even his mother would admit this if she could only see Rena
To win this beautiful girl for his wife would be a worthy task
He had crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty since then she had ascended the throne of his heart
He would make her queen of his home and mistress of his life
To Rena this brief months courtship came as a new education
Not only had this fair young man crowned her queen and honored her above all the ladies in town but since then he had waited assiduously upon her had spoken softly to her had looked at her with shining eyes and had sought to be alone with her
The time soon came when to touch his hand in greeting sent a thrill through her framea time when she listened for his footstep and was happy in his presence
He had been bold enough at the tournament he had since become somewhat bashful and constrained
He must be in love she thought and wondered how soon he would speak
If it were so sweet to walk with him in the garden or along the shaded streets to sit with him to feel the touch of his hand what happiness would it not be to hear him say that he loved herto bear his name to live with him always
To be thus loved and honored by this handsome young man she could hardly believe it possible
He would never speakhe would discover her secret and withdraw
She turned pale at the thoughtah God
something would happenit was too good to be true
The Prince would never try on the glass slipper
Tryon first told his love for Rena one summer evening on their way home from church
They were walking in the moonlight along the quiet street which but for their presence seemed quite deserted
Miss WarwickRowena he said clasping with his right hand the hand that rested on his left arm I love you
Do youlove me
To Rena this simple avowal came with much greater force than a more formal declaration could have had
It appealed to her own simple nature
Indeed few women at such a moment criticise the form in which the most fateful words of lifebut oneare spoken
Words while pleasant are really superfluous
Her whispered Yes spoke volumes
They walked on past the house along the country road into which the street soon merged
When they returned an hour later they found Warwick seated on the piazza in a rockingchair smoking a fragrant cigar
Well children he observed with mock severity you are late in getting home from church
The sermon must have been extremely long
We have been attending an aftermeeting replied Tryon joyfully and have been discussing an old text Little children love one another and its corollary It is not good for man to live alone
John I am the happiest man alive
Your sister has promised to marry me
I should like to shake my brothers hand
Never does one feel so strongly the universal brotherhood of man as when one loves some other fellows sister
Warwick sprang from his chair and clasped Tryons extended hand with real emotion
He knew of no man whom he would have preferred to Tryon as a husband for his sister
My dear Georgemy dear sister he exclaimed I am very very glad
I wish you every happiness
My sister is the most fortunate of women
And I am the luckiest of men cried Tryon
I wish you every happiness repeated Warwick adding with a touch of solemnity as a certain thought never far distant occurred to him I hope that neither of you may ever regret your choice
Thus placed upon the footing of an accepted lover Tryons visits to the house became more frequent
He wished to fix a time for the marriage but at this point Rena developed a strange reluctance
Can we not love each other for a while
she asked
To be engaged is a pleasure that comes but once it would be a pity to cut it too short
It is a pleasure that I would cheerfully dispense with he replied for the certainty of possession
I want you all to myself and all the time
Things might happen
If I should die for instance before I married you Oh dont suppose such awful things she cried putting her hand over his mouth
He held it there and kissed it until she pulled it away
I should consider he resumed completing the sentence that my life had been a failure
If I should die she murmured I should die happy in the knowledge that you had loved me
In three weeks he went on I shall have finished my business in Clarence and there will be but one thing to keep me here
When shall it be
I must take you home with me
I will let you know she replied with a troubled sigh in a week from today
Ill call your attention to the subject every day in the mean time he asserted
I shouldnt like you to forget it
Renas shrinking from the irrevocable step of marriage was due to a simple and yet complex cause
Stated baldly it was the consciousness of her secret the complexity arose out of the various ways in which it seemed to bear upon her future
Our lives are so bound up with those of our fellow men that the slightest departure from the beaten path involves a multiplicity of small adjustments
It had not been difficult for Rena to conform her speech her manners and in a measure her modes of thought to those of the people around her but when this readjustment went beyond mere externals and concerned the vital issues of life the secret that oppressed her took on a more serious aspect with tragic possibilities
A discursive imagination was not one of her characteristics or the danger of a marriage of which perfect frankness was not a condition might well have presented itself before her heart had become involved
Under the influence of doubt and fear acting upon love the invisible bar to happiness glowed with a lambent flame that threatened dire disaster
Would he have loved me at all she asked herself if he had known the story of my past
Or having loved me could he blame me now for what I cannot help
There were two shoals in the channel of her life upon either of which her happiness might go to shipwreck
Since leaving the house behind the cedars where she had been brought into the world without her own knowledge or consent and had first drawn the breath of life by the involuntary contraction of certain muscles Rena had learned in a short time many things but she was yet to learn that the innocent suffer with the guilty and feel the punishment the more keenly because unmerited
She had yet to learn that the old Mosaic formula The sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children was graven more indelibly upon the heart of the race than upon the tables of Sinai
But would her lover still love her if he knew all
She had read some of the novels in the bookcase in her mothers hall and others at boarding school
She had read that love was a conqueror that neither life nor death nor creed nor caste could stay his triumphant course
Her secret was no legal bar to their union
If Rena could forget the secret and Tryon should never know it it would be no obstacle to their happiness
But Rena felt with a sinking of the heart that happiness was not a matter of law or of fact but lay entirely within the domain of sentiment
We are happy when we think ourselves happy and with a strange perversity we often differ from others with regard to what should constitute our happiness
Renas secret was the worm in the bud the skeleton in the closet
He says that he loves me
He DOES love me
Would he love me if he knew
She stood before an oval mirror brought from France by one of Warwicks wifes ancestors and regarded her image with a coldly critical eye
She was as little vain as any of her sex who are endowed with beauty
She tried to place herself in thus passing upon her own claims to consideration in the hostile attitude of society toward her hidden disability
There was no mark upon her brow to brand her as less pure less innocent less desirable less worthy to be loved than these proud women of the past who had admired themselves in this old mirror
I think a man might love me for myself she murmured pathetically and if he loved me truly that he would marry me
If he would not marry me then it would be because he didnt love me
Ill tell George my secret
If he leaves me then he does not love me
But this resolution vanished into thin air before it was fully formulated
The secret was not hers alone it involved her brothers position to whom she owed everything and in less degree the future of her little nephew whom she had learned to love so well
She had the choice of but two courses of action to marry Tryon or to dismiss him
The thought that she might lose him made him seem only more dear to think that he might leave her made her sick at heart
In one week she was bound to give him an answer he was more likely to ask for it at their next meeting
IX DOUBTS AND FEARS Renas heart was too heavy with these misgivings for her to keep them to herself
On the morning after the conversation with Tryon in which she had promised him an answer within a week she went into her brothers study where he usually spent an hour after breakfast before going to his office
He looked up amiably from the book before him and read trouble in her face
Well Rena dear he asked with a smile whats the matter
Is there anything you wantmoney or what
I should like to have Aladdins lampthough Id hardly need it that you might have no wish unsatisfied
He had found her very backward in asking for things that she needed
Generous with his means he thought nothing too good for her
Her success had gratified his pride and justified his course in taking her under his protection
Thank you John
You give me already more than I need
It is something else John
George wants me to say when I will marry him
I am afraid to marry him without telling him
If he should find out afterwards he might cast me off or cease to love me
If he did not know it I should be forever thinking of what he would do if he SHOULD find it out or if I should die without his having learned it I should not rest easy in my grave for thinking of what he would have done if he HAD found it out
Warwicks smile gave place to a grave expression at this somewhat comprehensive statement
He rose and closed the door carefully lest some one of the servants might overhear the conversation
More liberally endowed than Rena with imagination and not without a vein of sentiment he had nevertheless a practical side that outweighed them both
With him the problem that oppressed his sister had been in the main a matter of argument of selfconviction
Once persuaded that he had certain rights or ought to have them by virtue of the laws of nature in defiance of the customs of mankind he had promptly sought to enjoy them
This he had been able to do by simply concealing his antecedents and making the most of his opportunities with no troublesome qualms of conscience whatever
But he had already perceived in their brief intercourse that Renas emotions while less easily stirred touched a deeper note than his and dwelt upon it with greater intensity than if they had been spread over the larger field to which a more ready sympathy would have supplied so many points of accesshers was a deep and silent current flowing between the narrow walls of a self contained life his the spreading river that ran through a pleasant landscape
Warwicks imagination however enabled him to put himself in touch with her mood and recognize its bearings upon her conduct
He would have preferred her taking the practical point of view to bring her round to which he perceived would be a matter of diplomacy
How long have these weighty thoughts been troubling your small head
he asked with assumed lightness
Since he asked me last night to name our wedding day
My dear child continued Warwick you take too tragic a view of life
Marriage is a reciprocal arrangement by which the contracting parties give love for love care for keeping faith for faith
It is a matter of the future not of the past
What a poor soul it is that has not some secret chamber sacred to itself where one can file away the things others have no right to know as well as things that one himself would fain forget
We are under no moral obligation to inflict upon others the history of our past mistakes our wayward thoughts our secret sins our desperate hopes or our heartbreaking disappointments
Still less are we bound to bring out from this secret chamber the dusty record of our ancestry
Let the dead past bury its dead
George Tryon loves you for yourself alone it is not your ancestors that he seeks to marry
But would he marry me if he knew
she persisted
Warwick paused for reflection
He would have preferred to argue the question in a general way but felt the necessity of satisfying her scruples as far as might be
He had liked Tryon from the very beginning of their acquaintance
In all their intercourse which had been very close for several months he had been impressed by the young mans sunny temper his straightforwardness his intellectual honesty
Tryons deference to Warwick as the elder man had very naturally proved an attraction
Whether this friendship would have stood the test of utter frankness about his own past was a merely academic speculation with which Warwick did not trouble himself
With his sister the question had evidently become a matter of conscience a difficult subject with which to deal in a person of Renas temperament
My dear sister he replied why should he know
We havent asked him for his pedigree we dont care to know it
If he cares for ours he should ask for it and it would then be time enough to raise the question
You love him I imagine and wish to make him happy
It is the highest wish of the woman who loves
The enamored man seeks his own happiness the loving woman finds no sacrifice too great for the loved one
The fiction of chivalry made man serve woman the fact of human nature makes woman happiest when serving where she loves
Yes oh yes Rena exclaimed with fervor clasping her hands unconsciously
Im afraid hed be unhappy if he knew and it would make me miserable to think him unhappy
Well then said Warwick suppose we should tell him our secret and put ourselves in his power and that he should then conclude that he couldnt marry you
Do you imagine he would be any happier than he is now or than if he should never know
Ah no
she could not think so
One could not tear love out of ones heart without pain and suffering
There was a knock at the door
Warwick opened it to the nurse who stood with little Albert in her arms
Please suh said the girl with a curtsy de baby s ben oryin an frettin fer Miss Rena an I lowed she mought want me ter fetch im ef it wouldntsturb her
Give me the darling exclaimed Rena coming forward and taking the child from the nurse
It wants its auntie
Come to its auntie bless its little heart
Little Albert crowed with pleasure and put up his pretty mouth for a kiss
Warwick found the sight a pleasant one
If he could but quiet his sisters troublesome scruples he might erelong see her fondling beautiful children of her own
Even if Rena were willing to risk her happiness and he to endanger his position by a quixotic frankness the future of his child must not be compromised
You wouldnt want to make George unhappy Warwick resumed when the nurse retired
Very well would you not be willing for his sake to keep a secretyour secret and mine and that of the innocent child in your arms
Would you involve all of us in difficulties merely to secure your own peace of mind
Doesnt such a course seem just the least bit selfish
Think the matter over from that point of view and well speak of it later in the day
I shall be with George all the morning and I may be able by a little management to find out his views on the subject of birth and family and all that
Some men are very liberal and love is a great leveler
Ill sound him at any rate
He kissed the baby and left Rena to her own reflections to which his presentation of the case had given a new turn
It had never before occurred to her to regard silence in the light of selfsacrifice
It had seemed a sort of sin her brothers argument made of it a virtue
It was not the first time nor the last that right and wrong had been a matter of viewpoint
Tryon himself furnished the opening for Warwicks proposed examination
The younger man could not long remain silent upon the subject uppermost in his mind
I am anxious John he said to have Rowena name the happiest day of my lifeour wedding day
When the trial in Edgecombe County is finished I shall have no further business here and shall be ready to leave for home
I should like to take my bride with me and surprise my mother
Mothers thought Warwick are likely to prove inquisitive about their sons wives especially when taken unawares in matters of such importance
This seemed a good time to test the liberality of Tryons views and to put forward a shield for his sisters protection
Are you sure George that your mother will find the surprise agreeable when you bring home a bride of whom you know so little and your mother nothing at all
Tryon had felt that it would be best to surprise his mother
She would need only to see Rena to approve of her but she was so far prejudiced in favor of Blanche Leary that it would be wisest to present the argument after having announced the irrevocable conclusion
Rena herself would be a complete justification for the accomplished deed
I think you ought to know George continued Warwick without waiting for a reply to his question that my sister and I are not of an old family or a rich family or a distinguished family that she can bring you nothing but herself that we have no connections of which you could boast and no relatives to whom we should be glad to introduce you
You must take us for ourselves alonewe are new people
My dear John replied the young man warmly there is a great deal of nonsense about families
If a man is noble and brave and strong if a woman is beautiful and good and true what matters it about his or her ancestry
If an old family can give them these things then it is valuable if they possess them without it then of what use is it except as a source of empty pride which they would be better without
If all new families were like yours there would be no advantage in belonging to an old one
All I care to know of Rowenas family is that she is your sister and youll pardon me old fellow if I add that she hardly needs even youshe carries the stamp of her descent upon her face and in her heart
It makes me glad to hear you speak in that way returned Warwick delighted by the young mans breadth and earnestness
Oh I mean every word of it replied Tryon
Ancestors indeed for Rowena
I will tell you a family secret John to prove how little I care for ancestors
My maternal greatgreatgrandfather a hundred and fifty years ago was hanged drawn and quartered for stealing cattle across the Scottish border
How is that for a pedigree
Behold in me the lineal descendant of a felon
Warwick felt much relieved at this avowal
His own statement had not touched the vital point involved it had been at the best but a halftruth but Tryons magnanimity would doubtless protect Rena from any close inquiry concerning her past
It even occurred to Warwick for a moment that he might safely disclose the secret to Tryon but an appreciation of certain facts of history and certain traits of human nature constrained him to put the momentary thought aside
It was a great relief however to imagine that Tryon might think lightly of this thing that he need never know
Well Rena he said to his sister when he went home at noon Ive sounded George
What did he say
she asked eagerly
I told him we were people of no family and that we had no relatives that we were proud of
He said he loved you for yourself and would never ask you about your ancestry
Oh I am so glad
exclaimed Rena joyfully
This report left her very happy for about three hours or until she began to analyze carefully her brothers account of what had been said
Warwicks statement had not been specifiche had not told Tryon THE thing
Georges reply in turn had been a mere generality
The concrete fact that oppressed her remained unrevealed and her doubt was still unsatisfied
Rena was occupied with this thought when her lover next came to see her
Tryon came up the sanded walk from the gate and spoke pleasantly to the nurse a goodlooking yellow girl who was seated on the front steps playing with little Albert
He took the boy from her arms and she went to call Miss Warwick
Rena came out followed by the nurse who offered to take the child
Never mind Mimy leave him with me said Tryon
The nurse walked discreetly over into the garden remaining within call but beyond the hearing of conversation in an ordinary tone
Rena darling said her lover when shall it be
Surely you wont ask me to wait a week
Why thats a lifetime
Rena was struck by a brilliant idea
She would test her lover
Love was a very powerful force she had found it the greatest grandest sweetest thing in the world
Tryon had said that he loved her he had said scarcely anything else for several weeks surely nothing else worth remembering
She would test his love by a hypothetical question
You say you love me she said glancing at him with a sad thoughtfulness in her large dark eyes
How much do you love me
I love you all one can love
True love has no degrees it is all or nothing
Would you love me she asked with an air of coquetry that masked her concern pointing toward the girl in the shrubbery if I were Alberts nurse yonder
If you were Alberts nurse he replied with a joyous laugh he would have to find another within a week for within a week we should be married
The answer seemed to fit the question but in fact Tryons mind and Renas did not meet
That two intelligent persons should each attach a different meaning to so simple a form of words as Renas question was the best ground for her misgiving with regard to the marriage
But love blinded her
She was anxious to be convinced
She interpreted the meaning of his speech by her own thought and by the ardor of his glance and was satisfied with the answer
And now darling pleaded Tryon will you not fix the day that shall make me happy
I shall be ready to go away in three weeks
Will you go with me
Yes she answered in a tumult of joy
She would never need to tell him her secret now
It would make no difference with him so far as she was concerned and she had no right to reveal her brothers secret
She was willing to bury the past in forgetfulness now that she knew it would have no interest for her lover
X THE DREAM The marriage was fixed for the thirtieth of the month immediately after which Tryon and his bride were to set out for North Carolina
Warwick would have liked it much if Tryon had lived in South Carolina but the location of his North Carolina home was at some distance from Patesville with which it had no connection by steam or rail and indeed lay altogether out of the line of travel to Patesville
Rena had no acquaintance with people of social standing in North Carolina and with the added maturity and charm due to her improved opportunities it was unlikely that any former resident of Patesville who might casually meet her would see in the elegant young matron from South Carolina more than a passing resemblance to a poor girl who had once lived in an obscure part of the old town
It would of course be necessary for Rena to keep away from Patesville save for her mothers sake she would hardly be tempted to go back
On the twentieth of the month Warwick set out with Tryon for the county seat of the adjoining county to try one of the lawsuits which had required Tryons presence in South Carolina for so long a time
Their destination was a days drive from Clarence behind a good horse and the trial was expected to last a week
This week will seem like a year said Tryon ruefully the evening before their departure but Ill write every day and shall expect a letter as often
The mail goes only twice a week George replied Rena
Then I shall have three letters in each mail
Warwick and Tryon were to set out in the cool of the morning after an early breakfast
Rena was up at daybreak that she might preside at the breakfasttable and bid the travelers goodby
John said Rena to her brother in the morning I dreamed last night that mother was ill Dreams you know Rena answered Warwick lightly go by contraries
Yours undoubtedly signifies that our mother God bless her simple soul
is at the present moment enjoying her usual perfect health
She was never sick in her life
For a few months after leaving Patesville with her brother Rena had suffered tortures of homesickness those who have felt it know the pang
The severance of old ties had been abrupt and complete
At the school where her brother had taken her there had been nothing to relieve the strangeness of her surroundingsno schoolmate from her own town no relative or friend of the family near by
Even the compensation of human sympathy was in a measure denied her for Rena was too fresh from her prisonhouse to doubt that sympathy would fail before the revelation of the secret the consciousness of which oppressed her at that time like a nightmare
It was not strange that Rena thus isolated should have been prostrated by homesickness for several weeks after leaving Patesville
When the paroxysm had passed there followed a dull pain which gradually subsided into a resignation as profound in its way as had been her longing for home
She loved she suffered with a quiet intensity of which her outward demeanor gave no adequate expression
From some ancestral source she had derived a strain of the passive fatalism by which alone one can submit uncomplainingly to the inevitable
By the same token when once a thing had been decided it became with her a finality which only some extraordinary stress of emotion could disturb
She had acquiesced in her brothers plan for her there was no withdrawing her homesickness was an incidental thing which must be endured as patiently as might be until time should have brought a measure of relief
Warwick had made provision for an occasional letter from Patesville by leaving with his mother a number of envelopes directed to his address
She could have her letters written inclose them in these envelopes and deposit them in the post office with her own hand
Thus the place of Warwicks residence would remain within her own knowledge and his secret would not be placed at the mercy of any wandering Patesvillian who might perchance go to that part of South Carolina
By this simple means Rena had kept as closely in touch with her mother as Warwick had considered prudent any closer intercourse was not consistent with their present station in life
The night after Warwick and Tryon had ridden away Rena dreamed again that her mother was ill
Better taught people than she in regions more enlightened than the South Carolina of that epoch are disturbed at times by dreams
Mis Molly had a profound faith in them
If God in ancient times had spoken to men in visions of the night what easier way could there be for Him to convey his meaning to people of all ages
Science which has shattered many an idol and destroyed many a delusion has made but slight inroads upon the shadowy realm of dreams
For Mis Molly to whom science would have meant nothing and psychology would have been a meaningless term the land of dreams was carefully mapped and bounded
Each dream had some special significance or was at least susceptible of classification under some significant head
Dreams as a general rule went by contraries but a dream three times repeated was a certain portent of the thing defined
Renas few years of schooling at Patesville and her months at Charleston had scarcely disturbed these hoary superstitions which lurk in the dim corners of the brain
No lady in Clarence perhaps would have remained undisturbed by a vivid dream three times repeated of some event bearing materially upon her own life
The first repetition of a dream was decisive of nothing for two dreams meant no more than one
The power of the second lay in the suspense the uncertainty to which it gave rise
Two doubled the chance of a third
The day following this second dream was an anxious one for Rena
She could not for an instant dismiss her mother from her thoughts which were filled too with a certain selfreproach
She had left her mother alone if her mother were really ill there was no one at home to tend her with loving care
This feeling grew in force until by nightfall Rena had become very unhappy and went to bed with the most dismal forebodings
In this state of mind it is not surprising that she now dreamed that her mother was lying at the point of death and that she cried out with heartrending pathos Rena my darlin why did you forsake yor pore old mother
Come back to me honey Ill die ef I dont see you soon
The stress of subconscious emotion engendered by the dream was powerful enough to wake Rena and her mothers utterance seemed to come to her with the force of a fateful warning and a great reproach
Her mother was sick and needed her and would die if she did not come
She felt that she must see her motherit would be almost like murder to remain away from her under such circumstances
After breakfast she went into the business part of the town and inquired at what time a train would leave that would take her toward Patesville
Since she had come away from the town a railroad had been opened by which the long river voyage might be avoided and making allowance for slow trains and irregular connections the town of Patesville could be reached by an allrail route in about twelve hours
Calling at the postoffice for the family mail she found there a letter from her mother which she tore open in great excitement
It was written in an unpracticed hand and badly spelled and was in effect as follows MY DEAR DAUGHTERI take my pen in hand to let you know that I am not very well
I have had a kind of misery in my side for two weeks with palpitations of the heart and I have been in bed for three days
Im feeling mighty poorly but Dr Green says that Ill get over it in a few days
Old Aunt Zilphy is staying with me and looking after things tolerably well
I hope this will find you and John enjoying good health
Give my love to John and I hope the Lord will bless him and you too
Cousin Billy Oxendine has had a rising on his neck and has had to have it lanced
Mary B has another young one a boy this time
Old man Tom Johnson was killed last week while trying to whip black Jim Brown who lived down on the Wilmington Road
Jim has run away
There has been a big freshet in the river and it looked at one time as if the new bridge would be washed away
Frank comes over every day or two and asks about you
He says to tell you that he dont believe you are coming back any more but you are to remember him and that foolishness he said about bringing you back from the end of the world with his mule and cart
Hes very good to me and brings over shavings and kindlingwood and made me a new wellbucket for nothing
Its a comfort to talk to him about you though I havent told him where you are living
I hope this will find you and John both well and doing well
I should like to see you but if its the Lords will that I shouldnt I shall be thankful anyway that you have done what was the best for yourselves and your children and that I have given you up for your own good
Your affectionate mother MARY WALDEN
Rena shed tears over this simple letter which to her excited imagination merely confirmed the warning of her dream
At the date of its writing her mother had been sick in bed with the symptoms of a serious illness
She had no nurse but a purblind old woman
Three days of progressive illness had evidently been quite sufficient to reduce her parent to the condition indicated by the third dream
The thought that her mother might die without the presence of any one who loved her pierced Renas heart like a knife and lent wings to her feet
She wished for the enchanted horse of which her brother had read to her so many years before on the front piazza of the house behind the cedars that she might fly through the air to her dying mothers side
She determined to go at once to Patesville
Returning home she wrote a letter to Warwick inclosing their mothers letter and stating that she had dreamed an alarming dream for three nights in succession that she had left the house in charge of the servants and gone to Patesville and that she would return as soon as her mother was out of danger
To her lover she wrote that she had been called away to visit a sickbed and would return very soon perhaps by the time he got back to Clarence
These letters Rena posted on her way to the train which she took at five oclock in the afternoon
This would bring her to Patesville early in the morning of the following day
XI A LETTER AND A JOURNEY War has been called the court of last resort
A lawsuit may with equal aptness be compared to a battlethe parallel might be drawn very closely all along the line
First we have the casus belli the cause of action then the various protocols and proclamations and general orders by way of pleas demurrers and motions then the preliminary skirmishes at the trial table and then the final struggle in which might is quite as likely to prevail as right victory most often resting with the strongest battalions and truth and justice not seldom overborne by the weight of odds upon the other side
The lawsuit which Warwick and Tryon had gone to try did not however reach this ultimate stage but after a three days engagement resulted in a treaty of peace
The case was compromised and settled and Tryon and Warwick set out on their homeward drive
They stopped at a farm house at noon and while at table saw the stage coach from the town they had just left bound for their own destination
In the mailbag under the drivers seat were Renas two letters they had been delivered at the town in the morning and immediately remailed to Clarence in accordance with orders left at the postoffice the evening before
Tryon and Warwick drove leisurely homeward through the pines all unconscious of the fateful squares of white paper moving along the road a few miles before them which a mothers yearning and a daughters love had thrown like the apple of discord into the narrow circle of their happiness
They reached Clarence at four oclock
Warwick got down from the buggy at his office
Tryon drove on to his hotel to make a hasty toilet before visiting his sweetheart
Warwick glanced at his mail tore open the envelope addressed in his sisters handwriting and read the contents with something like dismay
She had gone away on the eve of her wedding her lover knew not where to be gone no one knew how long on a mission which could not be frankly disclosed
A dim foreboding of disaster flashed across his mind
He thrust the letter into his pocket with others yet unopened and started toward his home
Reaching the gate he paused a moment and then walked on past the house
Tryon would probably be there in a few minutes and he did not care to meet him without first having had the opportunity for some moments of reflection
He must fix upon some line of action in this emergency
Meanwhile Tryon had reached his hotel and opened his mail
The letter from Rena was read first with profound disappointment
He had really made concessions in the settlement of that lawsuithad yielded several hundred dollars of his just dues in order that he might get back to Rena three days earlier
Now he must cool his heels in idleness for at least three days before she would return
It was annoying to say the least
He wished to know where she had gone that he might follow her and stay near her until she should be ready to come back
He might ask Warwick no she might have had some good reason for not having mentioned her destination
She had probably gone to visit some of the poor relations of whom her brother had spoken so frankly and she would doubtless prefer that he should not see her amid any surroundings but the best
Indeed he did not know that he would himself care to endanger by suggestive comparisons the fine aureole of superiority that surrounded her
She represented in her adorable person and her pure heart the finest flower of the finest race that God had ever madethe supreme effort of creative power than which there could be no finer
The flower would soon be his why should he care to dig up the soil in which it grew
Tryon went on opening his letters
There were several bills and circulars and then a letter from his mother of which he broke the seal MY DEAREST GEORGEThis leaves us well
Blanche is still with me and we are impatiently awaiting your return
In your absence she seems almost like a daughter to me
She joins me in the hope that your lawsuits are progressing favorably and that you will be with us soon



On your way home if it does not keep you away from us too long would it not be well for you to come by way of Patesville and find out whether there is any prospect of our being able to collect our claim against old Mr Duncan McSwaynes estate
You must have taken the papers with you along with the rest for I do not find them here
Things ought to be settled enough now for people to realize on some of their securities
Your grandfather always believed the note was good and meant to try to collect it but the war interfered
He said to me before he died that if the note was ever collected he would use the money to buy a wedding present for your wife
Poor father
he is dead and gone to heaven but I am sure that even there he would be happier if he knew the note was paid and the money used as he intended
If you go to Patesville call on my cousin Dr Ed
Green and tell him who you are
Give him my love
I havent seen him for twenty years
He used to be very fond of the ladies a very gallant man
He can direct you to a good lawyer no doubt
Hoping to see you soon Your loving mother ELIZABETH TRYON
P S Blanche joins me in love to you
This affectionate and motherly letter did not give Tryon unalloyed satisfaction
He was glad to hear that his mother was well but he had hoped that Blanche Leary might have finished her visit by this time
The reasonable inference from the letter was that Blanche meant to await his return
Her presence would spoil the fine romantic flavor of the surprise he had planned for his mother it would never do to expose his bride to an unannounced meeting with the woman whom he had tacitly rejected
There would be one advantage in such a meeting the comparison of the two women would be so much in Renas favor that his mother could not hesitate for a moment between them
The situation however would have elements of constraint and he did not care to expose either Rena or Blanche to any disagreeable contingency
It would be better to take his wife on a wedding trip and notify his mother before he returned home of his marriage
In the extremely improbable case that she should disapprove his choice after having seen his wife the ice would at least have been broken before his arrival at home
By Jove
he exclaimed suddenly striking his knee with his hand why shouldnt I run up to Patesville while Renas gone
I can leave here at five oclock and get there some time tomorrow morning
I can transact my business during the day and get back the day after tomorrow for Rena might return ahead of time just as we did and I shall want to be here when she comes Id rather wait a year for a legal opinion on a doubtful old note than to lose one day with my love
The train goes in twenty minutes
My bag is already packed
Ill just drop a line to George and tell him where Ive gone
He put Renas letter into his breast pocket and turning to his trunk took from it a handful of papers relating to the claim in reference to which he was going to Patesville
These he thrust into the same pocket with Renas letter he wished to read both letter and papers while on the train
It would be a pleasure merely to hold the letter before his eyes and look at the lines traced by her hand
The papers he wished to study for the more practical purpose of examining into the merits of his claim against the estate of Duncan McSwayne
When Warwick reached home he inquired if Mr Tryon had called
No suh answered the nurse to whom he had put the question he aint ben here yet suh
Warwick was surprised and much disturbed
De baby s ben cryin for Miss Rena suggested the nurse an I spec hed like to see you suh
Shall I fetch im
Yes bring him to me
He took the child in his arms and went out upon the piazza
Several porch pillows lay invitingly near
He pushed them toward the steps with his foot sat down upon one and placed little Albert upon another
He was scarcely seated when a messenger from the hotel came up the walk from the gate and handed him a note
At the same moment he heard the long shriek of the afternoon train leaving the station on the opposite side of the town
He tore the envelope open anxiously read the note smiled a sickly smile and clenched the paper in his hand unconsciously
There was nothing he could do
The train had gone there was no telegraph to Patesville and no letter could leave Clarence for twentyfour hours
The best laid schemes go wrong at timesthe stanchest ships are sometimes wrecked or skirt the breakers perilously
Life is a sea full of strange currents and uncharted reefswhoever leaves the traveled path must run the danger of destruction
Warwick was a lawyer however and accustomed to balance probabilities
He may easily be in Patesville a day or two without meeting her
She will spend most of her time at mothers bedside and he will be occupied with his own affairs
If Tryon should meet herwell he was very much in love and he had spoken very nobly of birth and blood
Warwick would have preferred nevertheless that Tryons theories should not be put to this particular test
Renas scruples had so far been successfully combated the question would be opened again and the situation unnecessarily complicated if Tryon should meet Rena in Patesville
Will he or will he not
he asked himself
He took a coin from his pocket and spun it upon the floor
Heads he sees her tails he does not
The coin spun swiftly and steadily leaving upon the eye the impression of a revolving sphere
Little Albert left for a moment to his own devices had crept behind his father and was watching the whirling disk with great pleasure
He felt that he would like to possess this interesting object
The coin began to move more slowly and was wabbling to its fall when the child stretched forth his chubby fist and caught it ere it touched the floor
XII TRYON GOES TO PATESVILLE Tryon arrived in the early morning and put up at the Patesville Hotel a very comfortable inn
After a bath breakfast and a visit to the barbershop he inquired of the hotel clerk the way to the office of Dr Green his mothers cousin
On the corner sir answered the clerk by the markethouse just over the drugstore
The doctor drove past here only half an hour ago
Youll probably catch him in his office
Tryon found the office without difficulty
He climbed the stair but found no one in except a young colored man seated in the outer office who rose promptly as Tryon entered
No suh replied the man to Tryons question he aint hyuh now
Hes gone out to see a patient suh but hell be back soon
Wont you set down in de private office an wait fer im suh
Tryon had not slept well during his journey and felt somewhat fatigued
Through the open door of the next room he saw an inviting armchair with a window at one side and upon the other a table strewn with papers and magazines
Yes he answered Ill wait
He entered the private office sank into the armchair and looked out of the window upon the square below
The view was mildly interesting
The old brick markethouse with the tower was quite picturesque
On a wagonscale at one end the public weighmaster was weighing a load of hay
In the booths under the wide arches several old negro women were frying fish on little charcoal stoves the odor would have been appetizing to one who had not breakfasted
On the shady side stood half a dozen twowheeled carts loaded with lightwood and drawn by diminutive steers or superannuated army mules branded on the flank with the cabalistic letters C S A which represented a vanished dream or U S A which as any negro about the markethouse would have borne witness signified a very concrete fact
Now and then a lady or gentleman passed with leisurely stepno one ever hurried in Patesvilleor some poor white sandhiller slouched listlessly along toward store or barroom
Tryon mechanically counted the slabs of gingerbread on the nearest marketstall and calculated the cubical contents of several of the meagre loads of wood
Having exhausted the view he turned to the table at his elbow and picked up a medical journal in which he read first an account of a marvelous surgical operation
Turning the leaves idly he came upon an article by a Southern writer upon the perennial race problem that has vexed the country for a century
The writer maintained that owing to a special tendency of the negro blood however diluted to revert to the African type any future amalgamation of the white and black races which foolish and wicked Northern negrophiles predicted as the ultimate result of the new conditions confronting the South would therefore be an ethnological impossibility for the smallest trace of negro blood would inevitably drag down the superior race to the level of the inferior and reduce the fair Southland already devastated by the hand of the invader to the frightful level of Hayti the awful example of negro incapacity
To forefend their beloved land now doubly sanctified by the blood of her devoted sons who had fallen in the struggle to maintain her liberties and preserve her property it behooved every true Southron to stand firm against the abhorrent tide of radicalism to maintain the supremacy and purity of his all pervading allconquering race and to resist by every available means the threatened domination of an inferior and degraded people who were set to rule hereditary freemen ere they had themselves scarce ceased to be slaves
When Tryon had finished the article which seemed to him a wellconsidered argument albeit a trifle bombastic he threw the book upon the table
Finding the armchair wonderfully comfortable and feeling the fatigue of his journey he yielded to a drowsy impulse leaned his head on the cushioned back of the chair and fell asleep
According to the habit of youth he dreamed and pursuant to his own individual habit he dreamed of Rena
They were walking in the moonlight along the quiet road in front of her brothers house
The air was redolent with the perfume of flowers
His arm was around her waist
He had asked her if she loved him and was awaiting her answer in tremulous but confident expectation
She opened her lips to speak
The sound that came from them seemed to be Is Dr Green in
No
Ask him when he comes back please to call at our house as soon as he can
Tryon was in that state of somnolence in which one may dream and yet be aware that one is dreamingthe state where one during a dream dreams that one pinches ones self to be sure that one is not dreaming
He was therefore aware of a ringing quality about the words he had just heard that did not comport with the shadowy converse of a dreaman incongruity in the remark too which marred the harmony of the vision
The shock was sufficient to disturb Tryons slumber and he struggled slowly back to consciousness
When fully awake he thought he heard a light footfall descending the stairs
Was there some one here
he inquired of the attendant in the outer office who was visible through the open door
Yas suh replied the boy a young cullud oman wuz in jes now axin fer de doctuh
Tryon felt a momentary touch of annoyance that a negro woman should have intruded herself into his dream at its most interesting point
Nevertheless the voice had been so real his imagination had reproduced with such exactness the dulcet tones so dear to him that he turned his head involuntarily and looked out of the window
He could just see the flutter of a womans skirt disappearing around the corner
A moment later the doctor came bustling in a plump rosy man of fifty or more with a frank open countenance and an air of genial good nature
Such a doctor Tryon fancied ought to enjoy a wide popularity
His mere presence would suggest life and hope and healthfulness
My dear boy exclaimed the doctor cordially after Tryon had introduced himself Im delighted to meet youor any one of the old blood
Your mother and I were sweethearts long ago when we both wore pinafores and went to see our grandfather at Christmas and I met her more than once and paid her more than one compliment after she had grown to be a fine young woman
Youre like her
too but not quite so handsome youve more of what I suppose to be the Tryon favor though I never met your father
So one of old Duncan McSwaynes notes went so far as that
Well well I dont know where you wont find them
One of them turned up here the other day from New York
The man you want to see he added later in the conversation is old Judge Straight
Hes getting somewhat stiff in the joints but he knows more law and more about the McSwayne estate than any other two lawyers in town
If anybody can collect your claim Judge Straight can
Ill send my boy Dave over to his office
Dave he called to his attendant run over to Judge Straights office and see if hes there
There was a freshet here a few weeks ago he want on when the colored man had departed and they had to open the floodgates and let the water out of the mill pond for if the dam had broken as it did twenty years ago it would have washed the pillars from under the judges office and let it down in the creek and Jedge Straight aint in de office jes now suh reported the doctors man Dave from the head of the stairs
Did you ask when hed be back
No suh you didnt tell me ter suh
Well now go back and inquire
The niggers he explained to Tryon are getting mighty trifling since theyve been freed
Before the war that boy would have been around there and back before you could say Jack Robinson now the lazy rascal takes his time just like a white man
Dave returned more promptly than from his first trip
Jedge Straights dere now suh he said
Hes done come in
Ill take you right around and introduce you said the doctor running on pleasantly like a babbling brook
I dont know whether the judge ever met your mother or not but he knows a gentleman when he sees one and will be glad to meet you and look after your affair
See to the patients Dave and say Ill be back shortly and dont forget any messages left for me
Look sharp now
You know your failing
They found Judge Straight in his office
He was seated by the rear window and had fallen into a gentle dozethe air of Patesville was conducive to slumber
A visitor from some bustling city might have rubbed his eyes on any but a marketday and imagined the whole town asleep that the people were somnambulists and did not know it
The judge an old hand roused himself so skillfully at the sound of approaching footsteps that his visitors could not guess but that he had been wide awake
He shook hands with the doctor and acknowledged the introduction to Tryon with a rare oldfashioned courtesy which the young man thought a very charming survival of the manners of a past and happier age
No replied the judge in answer to a question by Dr Green I never met his mother I was a generation ahead of her
I was at school with her father however fifty years agofifty years ago
No doubt that seems to you a long time young gentleman
It is a long time sir replied Tryon
I must live more than twice as long as I have in order to cover it
A long time and a troubled time sighed the judge
I could wish that I might see this unhappy land at peace with itself before I die
Things are in a sad tangle I cant see the way out
But the worst enemy has been slain in spite of us
We are well rid of slavery
But the negro we still have with us remarked the doctor for here comes my man Dave
What is it Dave
he asked sharply as the negro stuck his head in at the door
Doctuh Green he said I fuhgot ter tell you suh dat dat young oman wuz at de office agin jes befo you come in an said fer you to go right down an see her mammy ez soon ez you could
Ah yes and youve just remembered it
Im afraid youre entirely too forgetful for a doctors office
You forgot about old Mrs Latimer the other day and when I got there she had almost choked to death
Now get back to the office and remember the next time you forget anything Ill hire another boy remember that
That boys head he remarked to his companions after Dave had gone reminds me of nothing so much as a dried gourd with a handful of cowpeas rattling around it in lieu of gray matter
An old woman out in Redbank got a fishbone in her throat the other day and nearly choked to death before I got there
A white woman sir came very near losing her life because of a lazy trifling negro
I should think you would discharge him sir suggested Tryon
What would be the use
rejoined the doctor
All negroes are alike except that now and then theres a pretty woman along the borderline
Take this patient of mine for instanceIll call on her after dinner her case is not seriousthirty years ago she would have made any man turn his head to look at her
You know who I mean dont you judge
Yes
I think so said the judge promptly
Ive transacted a little business for her now and then
I dont know whether youve seen the daughter or notIm sure you havent for the past year or so for shes been away
But shes in town now and by Jove the girl is really beautiful
And Im a judge of beauty
Do you remember my wife thirty years ago judge
She was a very handsome woman Ed replied the other judicially
If I had been twenty years younger I should have cut you out
You mean you would have tried
But as I was saying this girl is a beauty I reckon we might guess where she got some of it eh Judge
Human nature is human nature but its a dd shame that a man should beget a child like that and leave it to live the life open for a negro
If she had been born white the young fellows would be tumbling over one another to get her
Her mother would have to look after her pretty closely as things are if she stayed here but she disappeared mysteriously a year or two ago and has been at the North Im told passing for white
Shell probably marry a Yankee he wont know any better and it will serve him rightshes only too white for them
She has a very striking figure something on the Greek order stately and slowmoving
She has the manners of a lady too a beautiful woman if she is a nigger
I quite agree with you Ed remarked the judge dryly that the mother had better look closely after the daughter
Ah no judge replied the other with a flattered smile my admiration for beauty is purely abstract
Twentyfive years ago when I was younger When you were young corrected the judge
When you and I were younger continued the doctor ingeniouslytwentyfive years ago I could not have answered for myself
But I would advise the girl to stay at the North if she can
Shes certainly out of place around here
Tryon found the subject a little tiresome and the doctors enthusiasm not at all contagious
He could not possibly have been interested in a colored girl under any circumstances and he was engaged to be married to the most beautiful white woman on earth
To mention a negro woman in the same room where he was thinking of Rena seemed little short of profanation
His friend the doctor was a jovial fellow but it was surely doubtful taste to refer to his wife in such a conversation
He was very glad when the doctor dropped the subject and permitted him to go more into detail about the matter which formed his business in Patesville
He took out of his pocket the papers concerning the McSwayne claim and laid them on the judges desk
Youll find everything there sirthe note the contract and some correspondence that will give you the hang of the thing
Will you be able to look over them today
I should like he added a little nervously to go back tomorrow
What
exclaimed Dr Green vivaciously insult our town by staying only one day
It wont be long enough to get acquainted with our young ladies
Patesville girls are famous for their beauty
But perhaps theres a loadstone in South Carolina to draw you back
Ah you change color
To my mind theres nothing finer than the ingenuous blush of youth
But well spare you if youll answer one questionis it serious
Im to be married in two weeks sir answered Tryon
The statement sounded very pleasant in spite of the slight embarrassment caused by the inquiry
Good boy
rejoined the doctor taking his arm familiarlythey were both standing now
You ought to have married a Patesville girl but you people down towards the eastern counties seldom come this way and we are evidently too late to catch you
Ill look your papers over this morning said the judge and when I come from dinner will stop at the court house and examine the records and see whether theres anything we can get hold of
If youll drop in around three or four oclock I may be able to give you an opinion
Now George exclaimed the doctor well go back to the office for a spell and then Ill take you home with me to luncheon
Tryon hesitated
Oh you must come
Mrs Green would never forgive me if I didnt bring you
Strangers are rare birds in our society and when they come we make them welcome
Our enemies may overturn our institutions and try to put the bottom rail on top but they cannot destroy our Southern hospitality
There are so many carpetbaggers and other social vermin creeping into the South with the Yankees trying to force the niggers on us that its a genuine pleasure to get acquainted with another real Southern gentleman whom one can invite into ones house without fear of contamination and before whom one can express his feelings freely and be sure of perfect sympathy
XIII AN INJUDICIOUS PAYMENT When Judge Straights visitors had departed he took up the papers which had been laid loosely on the table as they were taken out of Tryons breast pocket and commenced their perusal
There was a note for five hundred dollars many years overdue but not yet outlawed by lapse of time a contract covering the transaction out of which the note had grown and several letters and copies of letters modifying the terms of the contract
The judge had glanced over most of the papers and was getting well into the merits of the case when he unfolded a letter which read as follows MY DEAREST GEORGE I am going away for about a week to visit the bedside of an old friend who is very ill and may not live
Do not be alarmed about me for I shall very likely be back by the time you are
Yours lovingly ROWENA WARWICK
The judge was unable to connect this letter with the transaction which formed the subject of his examination
Age had dimmed his perceptions somewhat and it was not until he had finished the letter and read it over again and noted the signature at the bottom a second time that he perceived that the writing was in a womans hand that the ink was comparatively fresh and that the letter was dated only a couple of days before
While he still held the sheet in his hand it dawned upon him slowly that he held also one of the links in a chain of possible tragedy which he himself he became uncomfortably aware had had a hand in forging
It is the Walden womans daughter as sure as fate
Her name is Rena
Her brother goes by the name of Warwick
She has come to visit her sick mother
My young client Greens relation is her loveris engaged to marry heris in town and is likely to meet her
The judge was so absorbed in the situation thus suggested that he laid the papers down and pondered for a moment the curious problem involved
He was quite aware that two races had not dwelt together side by side for nearly three hundred years without mingling their blood in greater or less degree he was old enough and had seen curious things enough to know that in this mingling the current had not always flowed in one direction
Certain old decisions with which he was familiar old scandals that had crept along obscure channels old facts that had come to the knowledge of an old practitioner who held in the hollow of his hand the honor of more than one family made him know that there was dark blood among the white peoplenot a great deal and that very much diluted and so long as it was sedulously concealed or vigorously denied or lost in the mists of tradition or ascribed to a foreign or an aboriginal strain having no perceptible effect upon the racial type
Such people were for the most part merely on the ragged edge of the white world seldom rising above the level of overseers or slavecatchers or sheriffs officers who could usually be relied upon to resent the drop of black blood that tainted them and with the zeal of the proselyte to visit their hatred of it upon the unfortunate blacks that fell into their hands
One curse of negro slavery was and one part of its baleful heritage is that it poisoned the fountains of human sympathy
Under a system where men might sell their own children without social reprobation or loss of prestige it was not surprising that some of them should hate their distant cousins
There were not in Patesville half a dozen persons capable of thinking Judge Straights thoughts upon the question before him and perhaps not another who would have adopted the course he now pursued toward this anomalous family in the house behind the cedars
Well here we are again as the clown in the circus remarks murmured the judge
Ten years ago in a moment of sentimental weakness and of quixotic loyalty to the memory of an old friend who by the way had not cared enough for his own children to take them away from the South as he might have done or to provide for them handsomely as he perhaps meant to doI violated the traditions of my class and stepped from the beaten path to help the misbegotten son of my old friend out of the slough of despond in which he had learned in some strange way that he was floundering
Ten years later the ghost of my good deed returns to haunt me and makes me doubt whether I have wrought more evil than good
I wonder he mused if he will find her out
The judge was a man of imagination he had read many books and had personally outlived some prejudices
He let his mind run on the various phases of the situation
If he found her out would he by any possibility marry her
It is not likely he answered himself
If he made the discovery here the facts would probably leak out in the town
It is something that a man might do in secret but only a hero or a fool would do openly
The judge sighed as he contemplated another possibility
He had lived for seventy years under the old regime
The young man was a gentleman so had been the girls father
Conditions were changed but human nature was the same
Would the young mans love turn to disgust and repulsion or would it merely sink from the level of worship to that of desire
Would the girl denied marriage accept anything less
Her mother hadbut conditions were changed
Yes conditions were changed so far as the girl was concerned there was a possible future for her under the new order of things but white people had not changed their opinion of the negroes except for the worse
The general belief was that they were just as inferior as before and had moreover been spoiled by a disgusting assumption of equality driven into their thick skulls by Yankee malignity bent upon humiliating a proud though vanquished foe
If the judge had had sons and daughters of his own he might not have done what he now proceeded to do
But the old mans attitude toward society was chiefly that of an observer and the narrow stream of sentiment left in his heart chose to flow toward the weaker party in this unequal conflict a young woman fighting for love and opportunity against the ranked forces of society against immemorial tradition against pride of family and of race
It may be the unwisest thing I ever did he said to himself turning to his desk and taking up a quill pen and may result in more harm than good but I was always from childhood in sympathy with the under dog
There is certainly as much reason in my helping the girl as the boy for being a woman she is less able to help herself
He dipped his pen into the ink and wrote the following lines MADAMIf you value your daughters happiness keep her at home for the next day or two
This note he dried by sprinkling it with sand from a box near at hand signed with his own name and with a fine courtesy addressed to Mrs Molly Walden
Having first carefully sealed it in an envelope he stepped to the open door and spied playing marbles on the street near by a group of negro boys one of whom the judge called by name
Here Billy he said handing the boy the note take this to Mis Molly Walden
Do you know where she livesdown on Front Street in the house behind the cedars
Yas suh I knows de place
Make haste now
When you come back and tell me what she says Ill give you ten cents
On second thoughts I shall be gone to lunch so heres your money he added handing the lad the bit of soiled paper by which the United States government acknowledged its indebtedness to the bearer in the sum of ten cents
Just here however the judge made his mistake
Very few mortals can spare the spring of hope the motive force of expectation
The boy kept the note in his hand winked at his companions who had gathered as near as their awe of the judge would permit and started down the street
As soon as the judge had disappeared Billy beckoned to his friends who speedily overtook him
When the party turned the corner of Front Street and were safely out of sight of Judge Straights office the capitalist entered the grocery store and invested his unearned increment in gingerbread
When the ensuing saturnalia was over Billy finished the game of marbles which the judge had interrupted and then set out to execute his commission
He had nearly reached his objective point when he met upon the street a young white lady whom he did not know and for whom the path being narrow at that point he stepped out into the gutter
He reached the house behind the cedars went round to the back door and handed the envelope to Mis Molly who was seated on the rear piazza propped up by pillows in a comfortable rockingchair
Lawsamassy
she exclaimed weakly what is it
Its a lettuh mam answered the boy whose expanding nostrils had caught a pleasant odor from the kitchen and who was therefore in no hurry to go away
Whos it fur
she asked
Its fuh you mam replied the lad
An whos it from
she inquired turning the envelope over and over and examining it with the impotent curiosity of one who cannot read
Fm ole Jedge Straight mam
He tole me ter fetch it ter you
Is you got a roasted tater you could gimme mam
Shorely chile
Ill have Aunt Zilphy fetch you a piece of tater pone if youll hol on a minute
She called to Aunt Zilphy who soon came hobbling out of the kitchen with a large square of the delicacya flat cake made of mashed sweet potatoes mixed with beaten eggs sweetened and flavored to suit the taste and baked in a Dutch oven upon the open hearth
The boy took the gratuity thanked her and turned to go
Mis Molly was still scanning the superscription of the letter
I wonder she murmured what old Judge Straight can be writin to me about
Oh boy
Yas m answered the messenger looking back
Can you read writin
No m
All right
Never mind
She laid the letter carefully on the chimney piece of the kitchen
I reckon its somethin mo bout the taxes she thought or maybe somebody wants to buy one er my lots
Renall be back terreckly an she kin read it an find out
Im glad my childen have ben to school
They never could have got where they are now if they hadnt
XIV A LOYAL FRIEND Mention has been made of certain addressed envelopes which John Warwick on the occasion of his visit to Patesville had left with his illiterate mother by the use of which she might communicate with her children from time to time
On one occasion Mis Molly having had a letter written took one of these envelopes from the chest where she kept her most valued possessions and was about to inclose the letter when some one knocked at the back door
She laid the envelope and letter on a table in her bedroom and went to answer the knock
The wind blowing across the room through the open windows picked up the envelope and bore it into the street
Mis Molly on her return missed it looked for it and being unable to find it took another envelope
An hour or two later another gust of wind lifted the bit of paper from the ground and carried it into the open door of the cooper shop
Frank picked it up and observing that it was clean and unused read the superscription
In his conversations with Mis Molly which were often about Renathe subject uppermost in both their mindshe had noted the mystery maintained by Mis Molly about her daughters whereabouts and had often wondered where she might be
Frank was an intelligent fellow and could put this and that together
The envelope was addressed to a place in South Carolina
He was aware from some casual remark of Mis Mollys that Rena had gone to live in South Carolina
Her sons name was John that he had changed his last name was more than likely
Frank was not long in reaching the conclusion that Rena was to be found near the town named on the envelope which he carefully preserved for future reference
For a whole year Frank had yearned for a smile or a kind word from the only woman in the world
Peter his father had rallied him somewhat upon his moodiness after Renas departure
Now s de time boy fer you ter be lookin roun fer some nice gal er yo own color watll preciate you an wont be shamed er you
Youre wastin time boy wastin time shootin at a mark outer yo range
But Frank said nothing in reply and afterwards the old man who was not without discernment respected his sons mood and was silent in turn while Frank fed his memory with his imagination and by their joint aid kept hope alive
Later an opportunity to see her presented itself
Business in the cooper shop was dull
A barrel factory had been opened in the town and had wellnigh paralyzed the coopers trade
The best mechanic could hardly compete with a machine
One man could now easily do the work of Peters shop
An agent appeared in town seeking laborers for one of the railroads which the newly organized carpetbag governments were promoting
Upon inquiry Frank learned that their destination was near the town of Clarence South Carolina
He promptly engaged himself for the service and was soon at work in the neighborhood of Warwicks home
There he was employed steadily until a certain holiday upon which a grand tournament was advertised to take place in a neighboring town
Work was suspended and foremen and laborers attended the festivities
Frank had surmised that Rena would be present on such an occasion
He had more than guessed too that she must be looked for among the white people rather than among the black
Hence the interest with which he had scanned the grand stand
The result has already been recounted
He had recognized her sweet face he had seen her enthroned among the proudest and best
He had witnessed and gloried in her triumph
He had seen her cheek flushed with pleasure her eyes lit up with smiles
He had followed her carriage had made the acquaintance of Mimy the nurse and had learned all about the family
When finally he left the neighborhood to return to Patesville he had learned of Tryons attentions and had heard the servants gossip with reference to the marriage of which they knew the details long before the principals had approached the main fact
Frank went away without having received one smile or heard one word from Rena but he had seen her she was happy he was content in the knowledge of her happiness
She was doubtless secure in the belief that her secret was unknown
Why should he by revealing his presence sow the seeds of doubt or distrust in the garden of her happiness
He sacrificed the deepest longing of a faithful heart and went back to the cooper shop lest perchance she might accidentally come upon him some day and suffer the shock which he had sedulously spared her
I would n want ter skeer her he mused er make her feel bad an dats wat Id mos lackly do ef she seed me
Shell be better off wid me outn de road
Shell marry dat rich wite genteman he wont never know de diffencean be a wite lady ez she would a ben ef some ole witch had n changed her in her cradle
But maybe some time shell member de little nigger wat use ter nuss her wen she woz a chile an fished her outn de ole canal an would a died fer her ef it would a done any good
Very generously too and with a fine delicacy he said nothing to Mis Molly of his having seen her daughter lest she might be disquieted by the knowledge that he shared the family secretno great mystery now this pitiful secret but more far reaching in its consequences than any bloodcurdling crime
The taint of black blood was the unpardonable sin from the unmerited penalty of which there was no escape except by concealment
If there be a dainty reader of this tale who scorns a lie and who writes the story of his life upon his sleeve for all the world to read let him uncurl his scornful lip and come down from the pedestal of superior morality to which assured position and wide opportunity have lifted him and put himself in the place of Rena and her brother upon whom God had lavished his best gifts and from whom society would have withheld all that made these gifts valuable
To undertake what they tried to do required great courage
Had they possessed the sneaking cringing treacherous character traditionally ascribed to people of mixed bloodthe character which the blessed institutions of a free slaveholding republic had been well adapted to foster among them had they been selfish enough to sacrifice to their ambition the mother who gave them birth society would have been placated or humbugged and the voyage of their life might have been one of unbroken smoothness
When Rena came back unexpectedly at the behest of her dream Frank heard again the music of her voice felt the joy of her presence and the benison of her smile
There was however a subtle difference in her bearing
Her words were not less kind but they seemed to come from a remoter source
She was kind as the sun is warm or the rain refreshing she was especially kind to Frank because he had been good to her mother
If Frank felt the difference in her attitude he ascribed it to the fact that she had been white and had taken on something of the white attitude toward the negro and Frank with an equal unconsciousness clothed her with the attributes of the superior race
Only her drop of black blood he conceived gave him the right to feel toward her as he would never have felt without it and if Rena guessed her faithful devotees secret the same reason saved his worship from presumption
A smile and a kind word were little enough to pay for a lifes devotion
On the third day of Renas presence in Patesville Frank was driving up Front Street in the early afternoon when he nearly fell off his cart in astonishment as he saw seated in Dr Greens buggy which was standing in front of the Patesville Hotel the young gentleman who had won the prize at the tournament and who as he had learned was to marry Rena
Frank was quite certain that she did not know of Tryons presence in the town
Frank had been over to Mis Mollys in the morning and had offered his services to the sick woman who had rapidly become convalescent upon her daughters return
Mis Molly had spoken of some camphor that she needed
Frank had volunteered to get it
Rena had thanked him and had spoken of going to the drugstore during the afternoon
It was her intention to leave Patesville on the following day
Ef dat man sees her in dis town said Frank to himself derell be trouble
She dont know HES here an Ill bet he dont know SHES here
Then Frank was assailed by a very strong temptation
If as he surmised the joint presence of the two lovers in Patesville was a mere coincidence a meeting between them would probably result in the discovery of Renas secret
If shes found out argued the tempter shell come back to her mother and you can see her every day
But Franks love was not of the selfish kind
He put temptation aside and applied the whip to the back of his mule with a vigor that astonished the animal and moved him to unwonted activity
In an unusually short space of time he drew up before Mis Mollys back gate sprang from the cart and ran up to Mis Molly on the porch
Is Miss Rena here
he demanded breathlessly
No Frank she went up town bout an hour ago to see the doctor an git me some camphor gum
Frank uttered a groan rushed from the house sprang into the cart and goaded the terrified mule into a gallop that carried him back to the market house in half the time it had taken him to reach Mis Mollys
I wonder what in the worl s the matter with Frank mused Mis Molly in vague alarm
Ef he hadnt ben in such a hurry Id a axed him to read Judge Straights letter
But Renall be home soon
When Frank reached the doctors office he saw Tryon seated in the doctors buggy which was standing by the window of the drugstore
Frank ran upstairs and asked the doctors man if Miss Walden had been there
Yas replied Dave she wuz here a little wile ago an said she wuz gwine downstairs ter de drugsto
I would n be sprise ef youd fin her dere now
XV MINE OWN PEOPLE The drive by which Dr Green took Tryon to his own house led up Front Street about a mile to the most aristocratic portion of the town situated on the hill known as Haymount or more briefly The Hill
The Hill had lost some of its former glory however for the blight of a four years war was everywhere
After reaching the top of this wooded eminence the road skirted for some little distance the brow of the hill
Below them lay the picturesque old town a mass of vivid green dotted here and there with gray roofs that rose above the treetops
Two long ribbons of streets stretched away from the Hill to the faint red line that marked the high bluff beyond the river at the farther side of the town
The markethouse tower and the slender spires of half a dozen churches were sharply outlined against the green background
The face of the clock was visible but the hours could have been read only by eyes of phenomenal sharpness
Around them stretched ruined walls dismantled towers and crumbling earthworksfootprints of the god of war one of whose temples had crowned this height
For many years before the rebellion a Federal arsenal had been located at Patesville
Seized by the state troops upon the secession of North Carolina it had been held by the Confederates until the approach of Shermans victorious army whereupon it was evacuated and partially destroyed
The work of destruction begun by the retreating garrison was completed by the conquerors and now only ruined walls and broken cannon remained of what had once been the chief ornament and pride of Patesville
The front of Dr Greens spacious brick house which occupied an ideally picturesque site was overgrown by a network of clinging vines contrasting most agreeably with the mellow red background
A low brick wall also overrun with creepers separated the premises from the street and shut in a wellkept flower garden in which Tryon who knew something of plants noticed many rare and beautiful specimens
Mrs Green greeted Tryon cordially
He did not have the doctors memory with which to fill out the ladys cheeks or restore the lustre of her hair or the sparkle of her eyes and thereby justify her husbands claim to be a judge of beauty but her kindhearted hospitality was obvious and might have made even a plain woman seem handsome
She and her two fair daughters to whom Tryon was duly presented looked with much favor upon their handsome young kinsman for among the people of Patesville perhaps by virtue of the prevalence of Scottish blood the ties of blood were cherished as things of value and never forgotten except in case of the unworthyan exception by the way which one need hardly go so far to seek
The Patesville people were not exceptional in the weaknesses and meannesses which are common to all mankind but for some of the finer social qualities they were conspicuously above the average
Kindness hospitality loyalty a chivalrous deference to womenall these things might be found in large measure by those who saw Patesville with the eyes of its best citizens and accepted their standards of politics religion manners and morals
The doctor after the introductions excused himself for a moment
Mrs Green soon left Tryon with the young ladies and went to look after luncheon
Her first errand however was to find the doctor
Is he well off Ed
she asked her husband
Lots of land and plenty of money if he is ever able to collect it
He has inherited two estates
Hes a goodlooking fellow she mused
Is he married
There you go again replied her husband shaking his forefinger at her in mock reproach
To a woman with marriageable daughters all roads lead to matrimony the centre of a womans universe
All men must be sized up by their matrimonial availability
No he isnt married
Thats nice she rejoined reflectively
I think we ought to ask him to stay with us while he is in town dont you
Hes not married rejoined the doctor slyly but the next best thinghes engaged
Come to think of it said the lady Im afraid we wouldnt have the room to spare and the girls would hardly have time to entertain him
But well have him up several times
I like his looks
I wish you had sent me word he was coming Id have had a better luncheon
Make him a salad rejoined the doctor and get out a bottle of the best claret
Thank God the Yankees didnt get into my wine cellar
The young man must be treated with genuine Southern hospitalityeven if he were a Mormon and married ten times over
Indeed he would not Edthe idea
Im ashamed of you
Hurry back to the parlor and talk to him
The girls may want to primp a little before luncheon we dont have a young man every day
Beauty unadorned replied the doctor is adorned the most
My profession qualifies me to speak upon the subject
They are the two handsomest young women in Patesville and the daughters of the most beautiful Dont you dare to say the word interrupted Mrs Green with placid good nature
I shall never grow old while I am living with a big boy like you
But I must go and make the salad
At dinner the conversation ran on the family connections and their varying fortunes in the late war
Some had died upon the battlefield and slept in unknown graves some had been financially ruined by their faith in the lost cause having invested their all in the securities of the Confederate Government
Few had anything left but land and land without slaves to work it was a drug in the market
I was offered a thousand acres the other day at twentyfive cents an acre remarked the doctor
The owner is so landpoor that he cant pay the taxes
They have taken our negroes and our liberties
It may be better for our grandchildren that the negroes are free but its confoundedly hard on us to take them without paying for them
They may exalt our slaves over us temporarily but they have not broken our spirit and cannot take away our superiority of blood and breeding
In time we shall regain control
The negro is an inferior creature God has marked him with the badge of servitude and has adjusted his intellect to a servile condition
We will not long submit to his domination
I give you a toast sir The AngloSaxon race may it remain forever as now the head and front of creation never yielding its rights and ready always to die if need be in defense of its liberties
With all my heart sir replied Tryon who felt in this company a thrill of that pleasure which accompanies conscious superioritywith all my heart sir if the ladies will permit me
We will join you they replied
The toast was drunk with great enthusiasm
And now my dear George exclaimed the doctor to change one good subject for another tell us who is the favored lady
A Miss Rowena Warwick sir replied Tryon vividly conscious of four pairs of eyes fixed upon him but apart from the momentary embarrassment welcoming the subject as the one he would most like to speak upon
A good strong old English name observed the doctor
The heroine of Ivanhoe
exclaimed Miss Harriet
Warwick the Kingmaker
said Miss Mary
Is she tall and fair and dignified and stately
She is tall dark rather than fair and full of tender grace and sweet humility
She should have been named Rebecca instead of Rowena rejoined Miss Mary who was well up in her Scott
Tell us something about her people asked Mrs Greento which inquiry the young ladies looked assent
In this meeting of the elect of his own class and kin Warwick felt a certain strong illumination upon the value of birth and blood
Finding Rena among people of the best social standing the subsequent intimation that she was a girl of no family had seemed a small matter to one so much in love
Nevertheless in his present company he felt a decided satisfaction in being able to present for his future wife a clean bill of social health
Her brother is the most prominent lawyer of Clarence
They live in a fine old family mansion and are among the best people of the town
Quite right my boy assented the doctor
None but the best are good enough for the best
You must bring her to Patesville some day
But bless my life
he exclaimed looking at his watch I must be going
Will you stay with the ladies awhile or go back down town with me
I think I had better go with you sir
I shall have to see Judge Straight
Very well
But you must come back to supper and well have a few friends in to meet you
You must see some of the best people
The doctors buggy was waiting at the gate
As they were passing the hotel on their drive down town the clerk came out to the curbstone and called to the doctor
Theres a man here doctor whos been taken suddenly ill Can you come in a minute
I suppose Ill have to
Will you wait for me here George or will you drive down to the office
I can walk the rest of the way
I think Ill wait here doctor answered Tryon
Ill step up to my room a moment
Ill be back by the time youre ready
It was while they were standing before the hotel before alighting from the buggy that Frank Fowler passing on his cart saw Tryon and set out as fast as he could to warn Mis Molly and her daughter of his presence in the town
Tryon went up to his room returned after a while and resumed his seat in the buggy where he waited fifteen minutes longer before the doctor was ready
When they drew up in front of the office the doctors man Dave was standing in the doorway looking up the street with an anxious expression as though struggling hard to keep something upon his mind
Anything wanted Dave
asked the doctor
Dat young omans ben heah agin suh an wants ter see you bad
Shes in de drugstore dere now suh
Bless Gawd
he added to himself fervently I membered dat
Dis yer recommembance er mine is gwine ter git me inter trouble ef I don look out an dats a fac sho
The doctor sprang from the buggy with an agility remarkable in a man of sixty
Just keep your seat George he said to Tryon until I have spoken to the young woman and then well go across to Straights
Or if youll drive along a little farther you can see the girl through the window
Shes worth the trouble if you like a pretty face
Tryon liked one pretty face moreover tinted beauty had never appealed to him
More to show a proper regard for what interested the doctor than from any curiosity of his own he drove forward a few feet until the side of the buggy was opposite the drugstore window and then looked in
Between the colored glass bottles in the window he could see a young woman a tall and slender girl like a lily on its stem
She stood talking with the doctor who held his hat in his hand with as much deference as though she were the proudest dame in town
Her face was partly turned away from the window but as Tryons eye fell upon her he gave a great start
Surely no two women could be so much alike
The height the graceful droop of the shoulders the swanlike poise of the head the well turned little earsurely no two women could have them all identical
But pshaw
the notion was absurd it was merely the reflex influence of his mornings dream
She moved slightly it was Renas movement
Surely he knew the gown and the style of hair dressing
She rested her hand lightly on the back of a chair
The ring that glittered on her finger could be none other than his own
The doctor bowed
The girl nodded in response and turning left the store
Tryon leaned forward from the buggyseat and kept his eye fixed on the figure that moved across the floor of the drugstore
As she came out she turned her face casually toward the buggy and there could no longer be any doubt as to her identity
When Renas eyes fell upon the young man in the buggy she saw a face as pale as death with starting eyes in which love which once had reigned there had now given place to astonishment and horror
She stood a moment as if turned to stone
One appealing glance she gavea look that might have softened adamant
When she saw that it brought no answering sign of love or sorrow or regret the color faded from her cheek the light from her eye and she fell fainting to the ground
XVI THE BOTTOM FALLS OUT The first effect of Tryons discovery was figuratively speaking to knock the bottom out of things for him
It was much as if a boat on which he had been floating smoothly down the stream of pleasure had sunk suddenly and left him struggling in deep waters
The full realization of the truth which followed speedily had for the moment reversed his mental attitude toward her and love and yearning had given place to anger and disgust
His agitation could hardly have escaped notice had not the doctors attention and that of the crowd that quickly gathered been absorbed by the young woman who had fallen
During the time occupied in carrying her into the drugstore restoring her to consciousness and sending her home in a carriage Tryon had time to recover in some degree his selfpossession
When Rena had been taken home he slipped away for a long walk after which he called at Judge Straights office and received the judges report upon the matter presented
Judge Straight had found the claim in his opinion a good one he had discovered property from which in case the claim were allowed the amount might be realized
The judge who had already been informed of the incident at the drugstore observed Tryons preoccupation and guessed shrewdly at its cause but gave no sign
Tryon left the matter of the note unreservedly in the lawyers hands with instructions to communicate to him any further developments
Returning to the doctors office Tryon listened to that genial gentlemans comments on the accident his own concern in which he by a great effort was able to conceal
The doctor insisted upon his returning to the Hill for supper
Tryon pleaded illness
The doctor was solicitous felt his pulse examined his tongue pronounced him feverish and prescribed a sedative
Tryon sought refuge in his room at the hotel from which he did not emerge again until morning
His emotions were varied and stormy
At first he could see nothing but the fraud of which he had been made the victim
A negro girl had been foisted upon him for a white woman and he had almost committed the unpardonable sin against his race of marrying her
Such a step he felt would have been criminal at any time it would have been the most odious treachery at this epoch when his people had been subjugated and humiliated by the Northern invaders who had preached negro equality and abolished the wholesome laws decreeing the separation of the races
But no Southerner who loved his poor downtrodden country or his race the proud AngloSaxon race which traced the clear stream of its blood to the cavaliers of England could tolerate the idea that even in distant generations that unsullied current could be polluted by the blood of slaves
The very thought was an insult to the white people of the South
For Tryons liberality of which he had spoken so nobly and so sincerely had been confined unconsciously and as a matter of course within the boundaries of his own race
The Southern mind in discussing abstract questions relative to humanity makes always consciously or unconsciously the mental reservation that the conclusions reached do not apply to the negro unless they can be made to harmonize with the customs of the country
But reasoning thus was not without effect upon a mind by nature reasonable above the average
Tryons race impulse and social prejudice had carried him too far and the swing of the mental pendulum brought his thoughts rapidly back in the opposite direction
Tossing uneasily on the bed where he had thrown himself down without undressing the air of the room oppressed him and he threw open the window
The cool night air calmed his throbbing pulses
The moonlight streaming through the window flooded the room with a soft light in which he seemed to see Rena standing before him as she had appeared that afternoon gazing at him with eyes that implored charity and forgiveness
He burst into tears bitter tears that strained his heartstrings
He was only a youth
She was his first love and he had lost her forever
She was worse than dead to him for if he had seen her lying in her shroud before him he could at least have cherished her memory now even this consolation was denied him
The town clockwhich so long as it was wound up regularly recked nothing of love or hate joy or sorrowsolemnly tolled out the hour of midnight and sounded the knell of his lost love
Lost she was as though she had never been as she had indeed had no right to be
He resolutely determined to banish her image from his mind
See her again he could not it would be painful to them both it could be productive of no good to either
He had felt the power and charm of love and no ordinary shook could have loosened its hold but this catastrophe which had so rudely swept away the groundwork of his passion had stirred into new life all the slumbering pride of race and ancestry which characterized his caste
How much of this sensitive superiority was essential and how much accidental how much of it was due to the eversuggested comparison with a servile race how much of it was ignorance and selfconceit to what extent the boasted purity of his race would have been contaminated by the fair woman whose image filled his memoryof these things he never thought
He was not influenced by sordid considerations he would have denied that his course was controlled by any narrow prudence
If Rena had been white pure white for in his creed there was no compromise he would have braved any danger for her sake
Had she been merely of illegitimate birth he would have overlooked the bar sinister
Had her people been simply poor and of low estate he would have brushed aside mere worldly considerations and would have bravely sacrificed convention for love for his liberality was not a mere form of words
But the one objection which he could not overlook was unhappily the one that applied to the only woman who had as yet moved his heart
He tried to be angry with her but after the first hour he found it impossible
He was a man of too much imagination not to be able to put himself in some measure at least in her placeto perceive that for her the step which had placed her in Tryons world was the working out of natures great law of self preservation for which he could not blame her
But for the sheerest accidentno rather but for a providential interferencehe would have married her and might have gone to the grave unconscious that she was other than she seemed
The clock struck the hour of two
With a shiver he closed the window undressed by the moonlight drew down the shade and went to bed
He fell into an unquiet slumber and dreamed again of Rena
He must learn to control his waking thoughts his dreams could not be curbed
In that realm Renas image was for many a day to remain supreme
He dreamed of her sweet smile her soft touch her gentle voice
In all her fair young beauty she stood before him and then by some hellish magic she was slowly transformed into a hideous black hag
With agonized eyes he watched her beautiful tresses become mere wisps of coarse wool wrapped round with dingy cotton strings he saw her clear eyes grow bloodshot her ivory teeth turn to unwholesome fangs
With a shudder he awoke to find the cold gray dawn of a rainy day stealing through the window
He rose dressed himself went down to breakfast then entered the writingroom and penned a letter which after reading it over he tore into small pieces and threw into the waste basket
A second shared the same fate
Giving up the task he left the hotel and walked down to Dr Greens office
Is the doctor in
he asked of the colored attendant
No suh replied the man hes gone ter see de young cullud gal wat fainted wen de doctah was wid you yistiddy
Tryon sat down at the doctors desk and hastily scrawled a note stating that business compelled his immediate departure
He thanked the doctor for courtesies extended and left his regards for the ladies
Returning
to the hotel he paid his bill and took a hack for the wharf from which a boat was due to leave at nine oclock
As the hack drove down Front Street Tryon noted idly the houses that lined the street
When he reached the sordid district in the lower part of the town there was nothing to attract his attention until the carriage came abreast of a row of cedartrees beyond which could be seen the upper part of a large house with dormer windows
Before the gate stood a horse and buggy which Tryon thought he recognized as Dr Greens
He leaned forward and addressed the driver
Can you tell me who lives there
Tryon asked pointing to the house
A callud oman suh the man replied touching his hat
Mis Molly Walden an her daughter Rena
The vivid impression he received of this house and the spectre that rose before him of a pale brokenhearted girl within its gray walls weeping for a lost lover and a vanished dream of happiness did not argue well for Tryons future peace of mind
Renas image was not to be easily expelled from his heart for the laws of nature are higher and more potent than merely human institutions and upon anything like a fair field are likely to win in the long ran
XVII TWO LETTERS Warwick awaited events with some calmness and some philosophyhe could hardly have had the one without the other and it required much philosophy to make him wait a week in patience for information upon a subject in which he was so vitally interested
The delay pointed to disaster
Bad news being expected delay at least put off the evil day
At the end of the week he received two lettersone addressed in his own hand writing and postmarked Patesville N C the other in the handwriting of George Tryon
He opened the Patesville letter which ran as follows MY DEAR SONFrank is writing this letter for me
I am not well but thank the Lord I am better than I was
Rena has had a heap of trouble on account of me and my sickness
If I could of dreamt that I was going to do so much harm I would of died and gone to meet my God without writing one word to spoil my girls chances in life but I didnt know what was going to happen and I hope the Lord will forgive me
Frank knows all about it and so I am having him write this letter for me as Rena is not well enough yet
Frank has been very good to me and to Rena
He was down to your place and saw Rena there and never said a word about it to nobody not even to me because he didnt want to do Rena no harm
Frank is the best friend I have got in town because he does so much for me and dont want nothing in return
He tells me not to put this in about him but I want you to know it
And now about Rena
She come to see me and I got better right away for it was longing for her as much as anything else that made me sick and I was mighty mizzable
When she had been here three days and was going back next day she went up town to see the doctor for me and while she was up there she fainted and fell down in the street and Dr Green sent her home in his buggy and come down to see her
He couldnt tell what was the matter with her but she has been sick ever since and out of her head some of the time and keeps on calling on somebody by the name of George which was the young white man she told me she was going to marry
It seems he was in town the day Rena was took sick for Frank saw him up street and run all the way down here to tell me so that she could keep out of his way while she was still up town waiting for the doctor and getting me some camphor gum for my camphor bottle
Old Judge Straight must have knowed something about it for he sent me a note to keep Rena in the house but the little boy he sent it by didnt bring it till Rena was already gone up town and as I couldnt read of course I didnt know what it said
Dr Green heard Rena running on while she was out of her head and I reckon he must have suspicioned something for he looked kind of queer and went away without saying nothing
Frank says she met this man on the street and when he found out she wasnt white he said or done something that broke her heart and she fainted and fell down
I am writing you this letter because I know you will be worrying about Rena not coming back
If it wasnt for Frank I hardly know how I could write to you
Frank is not going to say nothing about Renas passing for white and meeting this man and neither am I and I dont suppose Judge Straight will say nothing because he is our good friend and Dr Green wont say nothing about it because Frank says Dr Greens cook Nancy says this young man named George stopped with him and was some cousin or relation to the family and they wouldnt want people to know that any of their kin was thinking about marrying a colored girl and the white folks have all been mad since J
B Thompson married his black housekeeper when she got religion and wouldnt live with him no more
All the rest of the connection are well
I have just been in to see how Rena is
She is feeling some better I think and says give you her love and she will write you a letter in a few days as soon as she is well enough
She bust out crying while she was talking but I reckon that is better than being out of her head
I hope this may find you well and that this man of Renas wont say nor do nothing down there to hurt you
He has not wrote to Rena nor sent her no word
I reckon he is very mad
Your affectionate mother MARY WALDEN
This letter while confirming Warwicks fears relieved his suspense
He at least knew the worst unless there should be something still more disturbing in Tryons letter which he now proceeded to open and which ran as follows JOHN WARWICK ESQ
Dear SirWhen I inform you as you are doubtless informed ere the receipt of this that I saw your sister in Patesville last week and learned the nature of those antecedents of yours and hers at which you hinted so obscurely in a recent conversation you will not be surprised to learn that I take this opportunity of renouncing any pretensions to Miss Warwicks hand and request you to convey this message to her since it was through you that I formed her acquaintance
I think perhaps that few white men would deem it necessary to make an explanation under the circumstances and I do not know that I need say more than that no one considering where and how I met your sister would have dreamed of even the possibility of what I have learned
I might with justice reproach you for trifling with the most sacred feelings of a mans heart but I realize the hardship of your position and hers and can make allowances
I would never have sought to know this thing I would doubtless have been happier had I gone through life without finding it out but having the knowledge I cannot ignore it as you must understand perfectly well
I regret that she should be distressed or disappointedshe has not suffered alone
I need scarcely assure you that I shall say nothing about this affair and that I shall keep your secret as though it were my own
Personally I shall never be able to think of you as other than a white man as you may gather from the tone of this letter and while I cannot marry your sister I wish her every happiness and remain Yours very truly GEORGE TRYON
Warwick could not know that this formal epistle was the last of a dozen that Tryon had written and destroyed during the week since the meeting in Patesvillehot blistering letters cold cutting letters scornful crushing letters
Though none of them was sent except this last they had furnished a safetyvalve for his emotions and had left him in a state of mind that permitted him to write the foregoing
And now while Rena is recovering from her illness and Tryon from his love and while Fate is shuffling the cards for another deal a few words may be said about the past life of the people who lived in the rear of the flower garden in the quaint old house beyond the cedars and how their lives were mingled with those of the men and women around them and others that were gone
For connected with our kind we must be if not by our virtues then by our vicesif not by our services at least by our needs
XVIII UNDER THE OLD REGIME For many years before the civil war there had lived in the old house behind the cedars a free colored woman who went by the name of Molly Waldenher rightful name for her parents were freeborn and legally married
She was a tall woman straight as an arrow
Her complexion in youth was of an old ivory tint which at the period of this story time had darkened measurably
Her black eyes now faded had once sparkled with the fire of youth
High cheekbones straight black hair and a certain dignified reposefulness of manner pointed to an aboriginal descent
Tradition gave her to the negro race
Doubtless she had a strain of each with white blood very visibly predominating over both
In Louisiana or the West Indies she would have been called a quadroon or more loosely a creole in North Carolina where fine distinctions were not the rule in matters of color she was sufficiently differentiated when described as a bright mulatto
Mollys free birth carried with it certain advantages even in the South before the war
Though degraded from its high estate and shorn of its choicest attributes the word freedom had nevertheless a cheerful sound and described a condition that left even to colored people who could claim it some liberty of movement and some control of their own persons
They were not citizens yet they were not slaves
No negro save in books ever refused freedom many of them ran frightful risks to achieve it
Mollys parents were of the class more numerous in North Carolina than elsewhere known as old issue free negroes which took its rise in the misty colonial period when race lines were not so closely drawn and the population of North Carolina comprised many Indians runaway negroes and indentured white servants from the seaboard plantations who mingled their blood with great freedom and small formality
Free colored people in North Carolina exercised the right of suffrage as late as 1835 and some of them in spite of galling restrictions attained to a considerable degree of prosperity and dreamed of a still brighter future when the growing tyranny of the slave power crushed their hopes and crowded the free people back upon the black mass just beneath them
Mis Mollys father had been at one time a man of some means
In an evil hour with an overweening confidence in his fellow men he indorsed a note for a white man who in a moment of financial hardship clapped his colored neighbor on the back and called him brother
Not poverty but wealth is the most potent leveler
In due time the indorser was called upon to meet the maturing obligation
This was the beginning of a series of financial difficulties which speedily involved him in ruin
He died prematurely a disappointed and disheartened man leaving his family in dire poverty
His widow and surviving children lived on for a little while at the house he had owned just outside of the town on one of the main traveled roads
By the wayside near the house there was a famous deep well
The slim barefoot girl with sparkling eyes and voluminous hair who played about the yard and sometimes handed water in a gourd to travelers did not long escape critical observation
A gentleman drove by one day stopped at the well smiled upon the girl and said kind words
He came again more than once and soon while scarcely more than a child in years Molly was living in her own house hers by deed of gift for her protector was rich and liberal
Her mother nevermore knew want
Her poor relations could always find a meal in Mollys kitchen
She did not flaunt her prosperity in the worlds face she hid it discreetly behind the cedar screen
Those who wished could know of it for there were few secrets in Patesville those who chose could as easily ignore it
There were few to trouble themselves about the secluded life of an obscure woman of a class which had no recognized place in the social economy
She worshiped the ground upon which her lord walked was humbly grateful for his protection and quite as faithful as the forbidden marriage vow could possibly have made her
She led her life in material peace and comfort and with a certain amount of dignity
Of her false relation to society she was not without some vague conception but the moral point involved was so confused with other questions growing out of slavery and caste as to cause her as a rule but little uneasiness and only now and then in the moments of deeper feeling that come sometimes to all who live and love did there break through the mists of ignorance and prejudice surrounding her a flash of light by which she saw so far as she was capable of seeing her true position which in the clear light of truth no special pleading could entirely justify
For she was free she had not the slaves excuse
With every inducement to do evil and few incentives to do well and hence entitled to charitable judgment she yet had freedom of choice and therefore could not wholly escape blame
Let it be said in further extenuation that no other woman lived in neglect or sorrow because of her
She robbed no one else
For what life gave her she returned an equivalent and what she did not pay her children settled to the last farthing
Several years before the war when Mis Mollys daughter Rena was a few years old death had suddenly removed the source of their prosperity
The household was not left entirely destitute
Mis Molly owned her home and had a store of gold pieces in the chest beneath her bed
A small piece of real estate stood in the name of each of the children the income from which contributed to their maintenance
Larger expectations were dependent upon the discovery of a promised will which never came to light
Mis Molly wore black for several years after this bereavement until the teacher and the preacher following close upon the heels of military occupation suggested to the colored people new standards of life and character in the light of which Mis Molly laid her mourning sadly and shamefacedly aside
She had eaten of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge
After the war she formed the habit of churchgoing and might have been seen now and then with her daughter in a retired corner of the gallery of the white Episcopal church
Upon the ground floor was a certain pew which could be seen from her seat where once had sat a gentleman whose pleasures had not interfered with the practice of his religion
She might have had a better seat in a church where a Northern missionary would have preached a sermon better suited to her comprehension and her moral needs but she preferred the other
She was not white alas
she was shut out from this seeming paradise but she liked to see the distant glow of the celestial city and to recall the days when she had basked in its radiance
She did not sympathize greatly with the new era opened up for the emancipated slaves she had no ideal love of liberty she was no broader and no more altruistic than the white people around her to whom she had always looked up and she sighed for the old days because to her they had been the good days
Now not only was her king dead but the shield of his memory protected her no longer
Molly had lost one child and his grave was visible from the kitchen window under a small clump of cedars in the rear of the twoacre lot
For even in the towns many a household had its private cemetery in those old days when the living were close to the dead and ghosts were not the mere chimeras of a sick imagination but real though unsubstantial entities of which it was almost disgraceful not to have seen one or two
Had not the Witch of Endor called up the shade of Samuel the prophet
Had not the spirit of Mis Mollys dead son appeared to her as well as the ghostly presence of another she had loved
In 1855 Mis Mollys remaining son had grown into a tall slender lad of fifteen with his fathers patrician features and his mothers Indian hair and no external sign to mark him off from the white boys on the street
He soon came to know however that there was a difference
He was informed one day that he was black
He denied the proposition and thrashed the child who made it
The scene was repeated the next day with a variationhe was himself thrashed by a larger boy
When he had been beaten five or six times he ceased to argue the point though to himself he never admitted the charge
His playmates might call him black the mirror proved that God the Father of all had made him white and God he had been taught made no mistakeshaving made him white He must have meant him to be white
In the hall or parlor of his mothers house stood a quaintly carved black walnut bookcase containing a small but remarkable collection of books which had at one time been used in his hours of retreat and relaxation from business and politics by the distinguished gentleman who did not give his name to Mis Mollys childrento whom it would have been a valuable heritage could they have had the right to bear it
Among the books were a volume of Fieldings complete works in fine print set in double columns a set of Bulwers novels a collection of everything that Walter Scottthe literary idol of the Southhad ever written Beaumont and Fletchers plays cheek by jowl with the history of the virtuous Clarissa Harlowe the Spectator and Tristram Shandy Robinson Crusoe and the Arabian Nights
On these secluded shelves Roderick Random Don Quixote and Gil Blas for a long time ceased their wanderings the Pilgrims Progress was suspended Miltons mighty harmonies were dumb and Shakespeare reigned over a silent kingdom
An illustrated Bible with a wonderful Apocrypha was flanked on one side by Volneys Ruins of Empire and on the other by Paines Age of Reason for the collector of the books had been a man of catholic taste as well as of inquiring mind and no one who could have criticised his reading ever penetrated behind the cedar hedge
A history of the French Revolution consorted amiably with a homespun chronicle of North Carolina rich in biographical notices of distinguished citizens and inscriptions from their tombstones upon reading which one might well wonder why North Carolina had not long ago eclipsed the rest of the world in wealth wisdom glory and renown
On almost every page of this monumental work could be found the most ardent panegyrics of liberty side by side with the slavery statistics of the Statean incongruity of which the learned author was deliciously unconscious
When John Walden was yet a small boy he had learned all that could be taught by the faded mulatto teacher in the long shiny black frock coat whom local public opinion permitted to teach a handful of free colored children for a pittance barely enough to keep soul and body together
When the boy had learned to read he discovered the library which for several years had been without a reader and found in it the portal of a new world peopled with strange and marvelous beings
Lying prone upon the floor of the shaded front piazza behind the fragrant garden he followed the fortunes of Tom Jones and Sophia he wept over the fate of Eugene Aram he penetrated with Richard the Lionheart into Saladins tent with Gil Blas into the robbers cave he flew through the air on the magic carpet or the enchanted horse or tied with Sindbad to the rocs leg
Sometimes he read or repeated the simpler stories to his little sister sitting wideeyed by his side
When he had read all the booksindeed long before he had read them allhe too had tasted of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge contentment took its flight and happiness lay far beyond the sphere where he was born
The blood of his white fathers the heirs of the ages cried out for its own and after the manner of that blood set about getting the object of its desire
Near the corner of Mackenzie Street just one block north of the Patesville markethouse there had stood for many years before the war on the verge of the steep bank of Beaver Creek a small frame office building the front of which was level with the street while the rear rested on long brick pillars founded on the solid rock at the edge of the brawling stream below
Here for nearly half a century Archibald Straight had transacted legal business for the best people of Northumberland County
Full many a lawsuit had he won lost or settled many a spendthrift had he saved from ruin and not a few families from disgrace
Several times honored by election to the bench he had so dispensed justice tempered with mercy as to win the hearts of all good citizens and especially those of the poor the oppressed and the socially disinherited
The rights of the humblest negro few as they might be were as sacred to him as those of the proudest aristocrat and he had sentenced a man to be hanged for the murder of his own slave
An oldfashioned man tall and spare of figure and bowed somewhat with age he was always correctly clad in a long frock coat of broadcloth with a high collar and a black stock
Courtly in address to his social equals superiors he had none he was kind and considerate to those beneath him
He owned a few domestic servants no one of whom had ever felt the weight of his hand and for whose ultimate freedom he had provided in his will
In the longdrawnout slavery agitation he had taken a keen interest rather as observer than as participant
As the heat of controversy increased his lack of zeal for the peculiar institution led to his defeat for the bench by a more active partisan
His was too just a mind not to perceive the arguments on both sides but on the whole he had stood by the ancient landmarks content to let events drift to a conclusion he did not expect to see the institutions of his fathers would probably last his lifetime
One day Judge Straight was sitting in his office reading a recently published pamphlet presenting an elaborate proslavery argument based upon the hopeless intellectual inferiority of the negro and the physical and moral degeneration of mulattoes who combined the worst qualities of their two ancestral raceswhen a barefooted boy walked into the office straw hat in hand came boldly up to the desk at which the old judge was sitting and said as the judge looked up through his goldrimmed glasses Sir I want to be a lawyer
God bless me
exclaimed the judge
It is a singular desire from a singular source and expressed in a singular way
Who the devil are you sir that wish so strange a thing as to become a lawyereverybodys servant
And everybodys master sir replied the lad stoutly
That is a matter of opinion and open to argument rejoined the judge amused and secretly flattered by this tribute to his profession though there may be a grain of truth in what you say
But what is your name Mr
Wouldbelawyer
John Walden sir answered the lad
John WaldenWalden
mused the judge
What Walden can that be
Do you belong in town
Yes sir
Humph
I cant imagine who you are
Its plain that you are a lad of good blood and yet I dont know whose son you can be
What is your fathers name
The lad hesitated and flushed crimson
The old gentleman noted his hesitation
It is a wise son he thought that knows his own father
He is a bright lad and will have this question put to him more than once
Ill see how he will answer it
The boy maintained an awkward silence while the old judge eyed him keenly
My fathers dead he said at length in a low voice
Im Mis Molly Waldens son
He had expected of course to tell who he was if asked but had not foreseen just the form of the inquiry and while he had thought more of his race than of his illegitimate birth he realized at this moment as never before that this question too would be always with him
As put now by Judge Straight it made him wince
He had not read his fathers books for nothing
God bless my soul
exclaimed the judge in genuine surprise at this answer and you want to be a lawyer
The situation was so much worse than he had suspected that even an old practitioner casehardened by years of life at the trial table and on the bench was startled for a moment into a comical sort of consternation so apparent that a lad less stouthearted would have weakened and fled at the sight of it
Yes sir
Why not
responded the boy trembling a little at the knees but stoutly holding his ground
He wants to be a lawyer and he asks me why not
muttered the judge speaking apparently to himself
He rose from his chair walked across the room and threw open a window
The cool morning air brought with it the babbling of the stream below and the murmur of the mill near by
He glanced across the creek to the ruined foundation of an old house on the low ground beyond the creek
Turning from the window he looked back at the boy who had remained standing between him and the door
At that moment another lad came along the street and stopped opposite the open doorway
The presence of the two boys in connection with the book he had been reading suggested a comparison
The judge knew the lad outside as the son of a leading merchant of the town
The merchant and his wife were both of old families which had lived in the community for several generations and whose blood was presumably of the purest strain yet the boy was sallow with amorphous features thin shanks and stooping shoulders
The youth standing in the judges office on the contrary was straight shapely and wellgrown
His eye was clear and he kept it fixed on the old gentleman with a look in which there was nothing of cringing
He was no darker than many a white boy bronzed by the Southern sun his hair and eyes were black and his features of the highbred cleancut order that marks the patrician type the world over
What struck the judge most forcibly however was the lads resemblance to an old friend and companion and client
He recalled a certain conversation with this old friend who had said to him one day Archie Im coming in to have you draw my will
There are some children for whom I would like to make ample provision
I cant give them anything else but money will make them free of the world
The judges friend had died suddenly before carrying out this good intention
The judge had taken occasion to suggest the existence of these children and their fathers intentions concerning them to the distant relatives who had inherited his friends large estate
They had chosen to take offense at the suggestion
One had thought it in shocking bad taste another considered any mention of such a subject an insult to his cousins memory
A third had said with flashing eyes that the woman and her children had already robbed the estate of enough that it was a pity the little niggers were not slavesthat they would have added measurably to the value of the property
Judge Straights manner indicated some disapproval of their attitude and the settlement of the estate was placed in other hands than his
Now this son with his fathers face and his fathers voice stood before his fathers friend demanding entrance to the golden gate of opportunity which society barred to all who bore the blood of the despised race
As he kept on looking at the boy who began at length to grow somewhat embarrassed under this keen scrutiny the judges mind reverted to certain laws and judicial decisions that he had looked up once or twice in his lifetime
Even the law the instrument by which tyranny riveted the chains upon its victims had revolted now and then against the senseless and unnatural prejudice by which a race ascribing its superiority to right of blood permitted a mere suspicion of servile blood to outweigh a vast preponderance of its own
Why indeed should he not be a lawyer or anything else that a man might be if it be in him
asked the judge speaking rather to himself than to the boy
Sit down he ordered pointing to a chair on the other side of the room
That he should ask a colored lad to be seated in his presence was of itself enough to stamp the judge as eccentric
You want to be a lawyer he went on adjusting his spectacles
You are aware of course that you are a negro
I am white replied the lad turning back his sleeve and holding out his arm and I am free as all my people were before me
The old lawyer shook his head and fixed his eyes upon the lad with a slightly quizzical smile
You are black
he said and you are not free
You cannot travel without your papers you cannot secure accommodations at an inn you could not vote if you were of age you cannot be out after nine oclock without a permit
If a white man struck you you could not return the blow and you could not testify against him in a court of justice
You are black my lad and you are not free
Did you ever hear of the Dred Scott decision delivered by the great wise and learned Judge Taney
No sir answered the boy
It is too long to read rejoined the judge taking up the pamphlet he had laid down upon the lads entrance but it says in substance as quoted by this author that negroes are beings of an inferior order and altogether unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations in fact so inferior that they have no rights which the white man is bound to respect and that the negro may justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit
That is the law of this nation and that is the reason why you cannot be a lawyer
It may all be true replied the boy but it dont apply to me
It says the negro
A negro is black I am white and not black
Black as ink my lad returned the lawyer shaking his head
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin says the poet
Somewhere sometime you had a black ancestor
One drop of black blood makes the whole man black
Why shouldnt it be the other way if the white blood is so much superior
inquired the lad
Because it is more convenient as it isand more profitable
It is not right maintained the lad
God bless me
exclaimed the old gentleman he is invading the field of ethics
He will be questioning the righteousness of slavery next
Im afraid you wouldnt make a good lawyer in any event
Lawyers go by the lawsthey abide by the accomplished fact to them whatever is is right
The laws do not permit men of color to practice law and public sentiment would not allow one of them to study it
I had thought said the lad that I might pass for white
There are white people darker than I am
Ah well that is another matter but The judge stopped for a moment struck by the absurdity of his arguing such a question with a mulatto boy
He really must be falling into premature dotage
The proper thing would be to rebuke the lad for his presumption and advise him to learn to take care of horses or make boots or lay bricks
But again he saw his old friend in the lads face and again he looked in vain for any sign of negro blood
The least earmark would have turned the scale but he could not find it
That is another matter he repeated
Here you have started as black and must remain so
But if you wish to move away and sink your past into oblivion the case might be different
Let us see what the law is you might not need it if you went far enough but it is well enough to be within itliberty is sweeter when founded securely on the law
He took down a volume bound in legal calf and glanced through it
The color line is drawn in North Carolina at four generations removed from the negro there have been judicial decisions to that effect
I imagine that would cover your case
But let us see what South Carolina may say about it he continued taking another book
I think the law is even more liberal there
Ah this is the place The term mulatto he read is not invariably applicable to every admixture of African blood with the European nor is one having all the features of a white to be ranked with the degraded class designated by the laws of this State as persons of color because of some remote taint of the negro race
Juries would probably be justified in holding a person to be white in whom the admixture of African blood did not exceed one eighth
And even where color or feature are doubtful it is a question for the jury to decide by reputation by reception into society and by their exercise of the privileges of the white man as well as by admixture of blood
Then I need not be black
the boy cried with sparkling eyes
No replied the lawyer you need not be black away from Patesville
You have the somewhat unusual privilege it seems of choosing between two races and if you are a lad of spirit as I think you are it will not take you long to make your choice
As you have all the features of a white man you would at least in South Carolina have simply to assume the place and exercise the privileges of a white man
You might of course do the same thing anywhere as long as no one knew your origin
But the matter has been adjudicated there in several cases and on the whole I think South Carolina is the place for you
Theyre more liberal there perhaps because they have many more blacks than whites and would like to lessen the disproportion
From this time on said the boy I am white
Softly softly my Caucasian fellow citizen returned the judge chuckling with quiet amusement
You are white in the abstract before the law
You may cherish the fact in secret but I would not advise you to proclaim it openly just yet
You must wait until you go awayto South Carolina
And can I learn to be a lawyer sir
asked the lad
It seems to me that you ought to be reasonably content for one day with what you have learned already
You cannot be a lawyer until you are white in position as well as in theory nor until you are twentyone years old
I need an office boy
If you are willing to come into my office sweep it keep my books dusted and stay here when I am out I do not care
To the rest of the town you will be my servant and still a negro
If you choose to read my books when no one is about and be white in your own private opinion I have no objection
When you have made up your mind to go away perhaps what you have read may help you
But mum s the word
If I hear a whisper of this from any other source out you go neck and crop
I am willing to help you make a man of yourself but it can only be done under the rose
For two years John Walden openly swept the office and surreptitiously read the law books of old Judge Straight
When he was eighteen he asked his mother for a sum of money kissed her good by and went out into the world
When his sister then a pretty child of seven cried because her big brother was going away he took her up in his arms gave her a silver dime with a hole in it for a keepsake hugged her close and kissed her
Nev min sis he said soothingly
Be a good little gal an some o these days Ill come back to see you and bring you somethin fine
In after years when Mis Molly was asked what had become of her son she would reply with sad complacency Hes gone over on the other side
As we have seen he came back ten years later
Many years before when Mis Molly then a very young woman had taken up her residence in the house behind the cedars the gentleman heretofore referred to had built a cabin on the opposite corner in which he had installed a trusted slave by the name of Peter Fowler and his wife Nancy
Peter was a good mechanic and hired his time from his master with the provision that Peter and his wife should do certain work for Mis Molly and serve as a sort of protection for her
In course of time Peter who was industrious and thrifty saved enough money to purchase his freedom and that of his wife and their one child and to buy the little house across the street with the cooper shop behind it
After they had acquired their freedom Peter and Nancy did no work for Mis Molly save as they were paid for it and as a rule preferred not to work at all for the woman who had been practically their mistress it made them seem less free
Nevertheless the two households had remained upon good terms even after the death of the man whose will had brought them together and who had remained Peters patron after he had ceased to be his master
There was no intimate association between the two families
Mis Molly felt herself infinitely superior to Peter and his wifescarcely less superior than her poor white neighbors felt themselves to Mis Molly
Mis Molly always meant to be kind and treated Peter and Nancy with a certain goodnatured condescension
They resented this never openly or offensively but always in a subconscious sort of way even when they did not speak of it among themselvesmuch as they had resented her mistressship in the old days
For after all they argued in spite of her airs and graces her white face and her fine clothes was she not a negro even as themselves
and since the slaves had been freed was not one negro as good as another
Peters son Frank had grown up with little Rena
He was several years older than she and when Rena was a small child Mis Molly had often confided her to his care and he had watched over her and kept her from harm
When Frank became old enough to go to work in the cooper shop Rena then six or seven had often gone across to play among the clean white shavings
Once Frank while learning the trade had let slip a sharp steel tool which flying toward Rena had grazed her arm and sent the red blood coursing along the white flesh and soaking the muslin sleeve
He had rolled up the sleeve and stanched the blood and dried her tears
For a long time thereafter her mother kept her away from the shop and was very cold to Frank
One day the little girl wandered down to the bank of the old canal
It had been raining for several days and the water was quite deep in the channel
The child slipped and fell into the stream
From the open window of the cooper shop Frank heard a scream
He ran down to the canal and pulled her out and carried her all wet and dripping to the house
From that time he had been restored to favor
He had watched the girl grow up to womanhood in the years following the war and had been sorry when she became too old to play about the shop
He never spoke to her of loveindeed he never thought of his passion in such a light
There would have been no legal barrier to their union there would have been no frightful menace to white supremacy in the marriage of the negro and the octoroon the drop of dark blood bridged the chasm
But Frank knew that she did not love him and had not hoped that she might
His was one of those rare souls that can give with small hope of return
When he had made the scar upon her arm by the same token she had branded him her slave forever when he had saved her from a watery grave he had given his life to her
There are depths of fidelity and devotion in the negro heart that have never been fathomed or fully appreciated
Now and then in the kindlier phases of slavery these qualities were brightly conspicuous and in them if wisely appealed to lies the strongest hope of amity between the two races whose destiny seems bound up together in the Western world
Even a dumb brute can be won by kindness
Surely it were worth while to try some other weapon than scorn and contumely and hard words upon people of our common race the human race which is bigger and broader than Celt or Saxon barbarian or Greek Jew or Gentile black or white for we are all children of a common Father forget it as we may and each one of us is in some measure his brothers keeper
XIX GOD MADE US ALL Rena was convalescent from a twoweeks illness when her brother came to see her
He arrived at Patesville by an early morning train before the town was awake and walked unnoticed from the station to his mothers house
His meeting with his sister was not without emotion he embraced her tenderly and Rena became for a few minutes a very Niobe of grief
Oh it was cruel cruel
she sobbed
I shall never get over it
I know it my dear replied Warwick soothinglyI know it and Im to blame for it
If I had never taken you away from here you would have escaped this painful experience
But do not despair all is not lost
Tryon will not marry you as I hoped he might while I feared the contrary but he is a gentleman and will be silent
Come back and try again
No John
I couldnt go through it a second time
I managed very well before when I thought our secret was unknown but now I could never be sure
It would be borne on every wind for aught I knew and every rustling leaf might whisper it
The law you said made us white but not the law nor even love can conquer prejudice
HE spoke of my beauty my grace my sweetness
I looked into his eyes and believed him
And yet he left me without a word
What would I do in Clarence now
I came away engaged to be married with even the day set I should go back forsaken and discredited even the servants would pity me
Little Albert is pining for you suggested Warwick
We could make some explanation that would spare your feelings
Ah do not tempt me John
I love the child and am grieved to leave him
Im grateful too John for what you have done for me
I am not sorry that I tried it
It opened my eyes and I would rather die of knowledge than live in ignorance
But I could not go through it again John I am not strong enough
I could do you no good I have made you trouble enough already
Get a mother for AlbertMrs Newberry would marry you secret and all and would be good to the child
Forget me John and take care of yourself
Your friend has found you out through mehe may have told a dozen people
You think he will be silentI thought he loved me and he left me without a word and with a look that told me how he hated and despised me
I would not have believed iteven of a white man
You do him an injustice said her brother producing Tryons letter
He did not get off unscathed
He sent you a message
She turned her face away but listened while he read the letter
He did not love me she cried angrily when he had finished or he would not have cast me offhe would not have looked at me so
The law would have let him marry me
I seemed as white as he did
He might have gone anywhere with me and no one would have stared at us curiously no one need have known
The world is widethere must be some place where a man could live happily with the woman he loved
Yes Rena there is and the world is wide enough for you to get along without Tryon
For a day or two she went on I hoped he might come back
But his expression in that awful moment grew upon me haunted me day and night until I shuddered at the thought that I might ever see him again
He looked at me as though I were not even a human being
I do not love him any longer John I would not marry him if I were white or he were as I am
He did not love meor he would have acted differently
He might have loved me and have left mehe could not have loved me and have looked at me so
She was weeping hysterically
There was little he could say to comfort her
Presently she dried her tears
Warwick was reluctant to leave her in Patesville
Her childish happiness had been that of ignorance she could never be happy there again
She had flowered in the sunlight she must not pine away in the shade
If you wont come back with me Rena Ill send you to some school at the North where you can acquire a liberal education and prepare yourself for some career of usefulness
You may marry a better man than even Tryon
No she replied firmly I shall never marry any man and Ill not leave mother again
God is against it Ill stay with my own people
God has nothing to do with it retorted Warwick
God is too often a convenient stalking horse for human selfishness
If there is anything to be done so unjust so despicable so wicked that human reason revolts at it there is always some smug hypocrite to exclaim It is the will of God
God made us all continued Rena dreamily and for some good purpose though we may not always see it
He made some people white and strong and masterful andheartless
He made others black and homely and poor and weak And a lot of others poor white and shiftless smiled Warwick
He made us too continued Rena intent upon her own thought and He must have had a reason for it
Perhaps He meant us to bring the others together in his own good time
A man may make a new place for himselfa woman is born and bound to hers
God must have meant me to stay here or He would not have sent me back
I shall accept things as they are
Why should I seek the society of people whose friendshipand love one little word can turn to scorn
I was right John I ought to have told him
Suppose he had married me and then had found it out
To Renas argument of divine foreordination Warwick attached no weight whatever
He had seen Gods heel planted for four long years upon the land which had nourished slavery
Had God ordained the crime that the punishment might follow
It would have been easier for Omnipotence to prevent the crime
The experience of his sister had stirred up a certain bitterness against white peoplea feeling which he had put aside years ago with his dark blood but which sprang anew into life when the fact of his own origin was brought home to him so forcibly through his sisters misfortune
His sworn friend and promised brotherin law had thrown him over promptly upon the discovery of the hidden drop of dark blood
How many others of his friends would do the same if they but knew of it
He had begun to feel a little of the spiritual estrangement from his associates that he had noticed in Rena during her life at Clarence
The fact that several persons knew his secret had spoiled the fine flavor of perfect security hitherto marking his position
George Tryon was a man of honor among white men and had deigned to extend the protection of his honor to Warwick as a man though no longer as a friend to Rena as a woman but not as a wife
Tryon however was only human and who could tell when their paths in life might cross again or what future temptation Tryon might feel to use a damaging secret to their disadvantage
Warwick had cherished certain ambitions but these he must now put behind him
In the obscurity of private life his past would be of little moment in the glare of a political career ones antecedents are public property and too great a reserve in regard to ones past is regarded as a confession of something discreditable
Frank too knew the secret a good faithful fellow even where there was no obligation of fidelity he ought to do something for Frank to show their appreciation of his conduct
But what assurance was there that Frank would always be discreet about the affairs of others
Judge Straight knew the whole story and old men are sometimes garrulous
Dr Green suspected the secret he had a wife and daughters
If old Judge Straight could have known Warwicks thoughts he would have realized the fulfillment of his prophecy
Warwick who had builded so well for himself had weakened the structure of his own life by trying to share his good fortune with his sister 
Listen Rena he said with a sudden impulse well go to the North or WestIll go with youfar away from the South and the Southern people and start life over again
It will be easier for you it will not be hard for meI am young and have means
There are no strong ties to bind me to the South
I would have a larger outlook elsewhere
And what about our mother
asked Rena
It would be necessary to leave her behind they both perceived clearly enough unless they were prepared to surrender the advantage of their whiteness and drop back to the lower rank
The mother bore the mark of the Ethiopiannot pronouncedly but distinctly neither would Mis Molly in all probability care to leave home and friends and the graves of her loved ones
She had no mental resources to supply the place of these she was moreover too old to be transplanted she would not fit into Warwicks scheme for a new life
I left her once said Rena and it brought pain and sorrow to all three of us
She is not strong and I will not leave her here to die alone
This shall be my home while she lives and if I leave it again it shall be for only a short time to go where I can write to her freely and hear from her often
Dont worry about me JohnI shall do very well
Warwick sighed
He was sincerely sorry to leave his sister and yet he saw that for the time being her resolution was not to be shaken
He must bide his time
Perhaps in a few months she would tire of the old life
His door would be always open to her and he would charge himself with her future
Well then he said concluding the argument well say no more about it for the present
Ill write to you later
I was afraid that you might not care to go back just now and so I brought your trunk along with me
He gave his mother the baggagecheck
She took it across to Frank who during the day brought the trunk from the depot
Mis Molly offered to pay him for the service but he would accept nothing
Lawd no Mis Molly I did n hafter go outn my way ter git dat trunk
I had a load er sperrit bairls ter haul ter de still an de depot wuz right on my way back
Itd be robbin you ter take pay fer a little thing lack dat
My son Johns here said Mis Molly an he wants to see you
Come into the settinroom
We dont want folks to know hes in town but you know all our secrets an we can trust you like one er the family
Im glad to see you again Frank said Warwick extending his hand and clasping Franks warmly
Youve grown up since I saw you last but it seems you are still our good friend
Our very good friend interjected Rena
Frank threw her a grateful glance
Yas suh he said looking Warwick over with a friendly eye an you is growed some too
I seed you you know down dere where you live but I did n let on fer you an Mis Rena wuz wite as anybody an eveybody said you wuz good ter cullud folks an heped em in deir lawsuits an one way er nuther an I wuz jes plum glad ter see you gettin long so fine dat I wuz certain sho an no mistake about it
Thank you Frank and I want you to understand how much I appreciate How much we all appreciate corrected Rena
Yes how much we all appreciate and how grateful we all are for your kindness to mother for so many years
I know from her and from my sister how good youve been to them
Lawd suh
returned Frank deprecatingly youre makin a mountain outn a molehill
I aint done nuthin ter speak ofnot half ez much ez I would a done
I wuz glad ter do wat little I could fer frienships sake
We value your friendship Frank and well not forget it
No Frank added Rena we will never forget it and you shall always be our good friend
Frank left the room and crossed the street with swelling heart
He would have given his life for Rena
A kind word was doubly sweet from her lips no service would be too great to pay for her friendship
When Frank went out to the stable next morning to feed his mule his eyes opened wide with astonishment
In place of the decrepit oneeyed army mule he had put up the night before a fat sleek specimen of vigorous mulehood greeted his arrival with the sonorous hehaw of lusty youth
Hanging on a peg near by was a set of fine new harness and standing under the adjoining shed as he perceived a handsome new cart
Well well
exclaimed Frank ef I did n mos know whar dis mule an dis kyart an dis harness come from Id low dere d ben witcheraf er cunjin wukkin here
But oh my dat is a fine muleI mos wush I could keep im
He crossed the road to the house behind the cedars and found Mis Molly in the kitchen
Mis Molly he protested I aint done nuthin ter deserve dat mule
Wat little I done fer you want done fer pay
Id ruther not keep dem things
Fer goodness sake Frank
exclaimed his neighbor with a wellsimulated air of mystification what are you talkin about
You knows wat Im talkin about Mis Molly you knows well ernuff Im talkin about dat fine mule an kyart an harness over dere in my stable
How should I know anything about em
she asked
Now Mis Molly
You folks is jes tryin ter fool me an make me take somethin fer nuthin
I lef my ole mule an kyart an harness in de stable las night an dis mawnin dey re gone an new ones in deir place
Cose you knows whar dey come from
Well now Frank sence you mention it I did see a witch flyin roun here las night on a broom stick an it peared ter me she lit on yor barn an I spose she turned yor old things into new ones
I wouldnt bother my mind about it if I was you for she may turn em back any night you know an you might as well have the use of em in the mean while
Dats all foolishness Mis Molly an Im gwine ter fetch dat mule right over here an tell yo son ter gimme my ole one back
My sons gone she replied an I dont know nothin about yor old mule
And what would I do with a mule anyhow
I aint got no barn to put him in
I suspect you dont care much for us after all Frank said Rena reproachfullyshe had come in while they were talking
You meet with a piece of good luck and youre afraid of it lest it might have come from us
Now Miss Rena you oughtnt ter say dat expostulated Frank his reluctance yielding immediately
Ill keep de mule an de kyart an de harnessfac Ill have ter keep em cause I aint got no others
But dey re gwine ter be yon ez much ez mine
Wenever you wants anything hauled er wants yo lot ploughed er anything dats yo mule an Im yo man an yo mammys
So Frank went back to the stable where he feasted his eyes on his new possessions fed and watered the mule and curried and brushed his coat until it shone like a lookingglass
Now dat remarked Peter at the breakfast table when informed of the transaction is somethin lack rale wite folks
No real white person had ever given Peter a mule or a cart
He had rendered one of them unpaid service for half a lifetime and had paid for the other half and some of them owed him substantial sums for work performed
But to him that hath shall be givenWarwick paid for the mule and the real white folks got most of the credit
XX DIGGING UP ROOTS When the first great shock of his discovery wore off the fact of Renas origin lost to Tryon some of its initial repugnanceindeed the repugnance was not to the woman at all as their past relations were evidence but merely to the thought of her as a wife
It could hardly have failed to occur to so reasonable a man as Tryon that Renas case could scarcely be unique
Surely in the past centuries of free manners and easy morals that had prevailed in remote parts of the South there must have been many white persons whose origin would not have borne too microscopic an investigation
Family trees not seldom have a crooked branch or to use a more apposite figure many a flock has its black sheep
Being a man of lively imagination Tryon soon found himself putting all sorts of hypothetical questions about a matter which he had already definitely determined
If he had married Rena in ignorance of her secret and had learned it afterwards would he have put her aside
If knowing her history he had nevertheless married her and she had subsequently displayed some trait of character that would suggest the negro could he have forgotten or forgiven the taint
Could he still have held her in love and honor
If not could he have given her the outward seeming of affection or could he have been more than coldly tolerant
He was glad that he had been spared this ordeal
With an effort he put the whole matter definitely and conclusively aside as he had done a hundred times already
Returning to his home after an absence of several months in South Carolina it was quite apparent to his mothers watchful eye that he was in serious trouble
He was absentminded monosyllabic sighed deeply and often and could not always conceal the traces of secret tears
For Tryon was young and possessed of a sensitive soula source of happiness or misery as the Fates decree
To those thus dowered the heights of rapture are accessible the abysses of despair yawn threateningly only the dull monotony of contentment is denied
Mrs Tryon vainly sought by every gentle art a woman knows to win her sons confidence
What is the matter George dear
she would ask stroking his hot brow with her small cool hand as he sat moodily nursing his grief
Tell your mother George
Who else could comfort you so well as she
Oh its nothing mothernothing at all he would reply with a forced attempt at lightness
Its only your fond imagination you best of mothers
It was Mrs Tryons turn to sigh and shed a clandestine tear
Until her son had gone away on this trip to South Carolina he had kept no secrets from her his heart had been an open book of which she knew every page now some painful story was inscribed therein which he meant she should not read
If she could have abdicated her empire to Blanche Leary or have shared it with her she would have yielded gracefully but very palpably some other influence than Blanches had driven joy from her sons countenance and lightness from his heart
Miss Blanche Leary whom Tryon found in the house upon his return was a demure pretty little blonde with an amiable disposition a talent for society and a pronounced fondness for George Tryon
A poor girl of an excellent family impoverished by the war she was distantly related to Mrs Tryon had for a long time enjoyed that ladys favor and was her choice for Georges wife when he should be old enough to marry
A woman less interested than Miss Leary would have perceived that there was something wrong with Tryon
Miss Leary had no doubt that there was a woman at the bottom of itfor about what else should youth worry but love
or if ones love affairs run smoothly why should one worry about anything at all
Miss Leary in the nineteen years of her mundane existence had not been without mild experiences of the heart and had hovered for some time on the verge of disappointment with respect to Tryon himself
A sensitive pride would have driven more than one woman away at the sight of the man of her preference sighing like a furnace for some absent fair one
But Mrs Tryon was so cordial and insisted so strenuously upon her remaining that Blanches love which was strong conquered her pride which was no more than a reasonable young woman ought to have who sets success above mere sentiment
She remained in the house and bided her opportunity
If George practically ignored her for a time she did not throw herself at all in his way
She went on a visit to some girls in the neighborhood and remained away a week hoping that she might be missed
Tryon expressed no regret at her departure and no particular satisfaction upon her return
If the house was duller in her absence he was but dimly conscious of the difference
He was still fighting a battle in which a susceptible heart and a reasonable mind had locked horns in a wellnigh hopeless conflict
Reason commonsense the instinctive readymade judgments of his training and environment the deepseated prejudices of race and castecommanded him to dismiss Rena from his thoughts
His stubborn heart simply would not let go
XXI A GILDED OPPORTUNITY Although the whole fabric of Renas new life toppled and fell with her lovers defection her sympathies broadened by culture and still more by her recent emotional experience did not shrink as would have been the case with a more selfish soul to the mere limits of her personal sorrow great as this seemed at the moment
She had learned to love and when the love of one man failed her she turned to humanity as a stream obstructed in its course overflows the adjacent country
Her early training had not directed her thoughts to the darker people with whose fate her own was bound up so closely but rather away from them
She had been taught to despise them because they were not so white as she was and had been slaves while she was free
Her life in her brothers home by removing her from immediate contact with them had given her a different point of viewone which emphasized their shortcomings and thereby made vastly clearer to her the gulf that separated them from the new world in which she lived so that when misfortune threw her back upon them the reaction brought her nearer than before
Where once she had seemed able to escape from them they were now it appeared her inalienable race
Thus doubly equipped she was able to view them at once with the mental eye of an outsider and the sympathy of a sister she could see their faults and judge them charitably she knew and appreciated their good qualities
With her quickened intelligence she could perceive how great was their need and how small their opportunity and with this illumination came the desire to contribute to their help
She had not the breadth or culture to see in all its ramifications the great problem which still puzzles statesmen and philosophers but she was conscious of the wish and of the power in a small way to do something for the advancement of those who had just set their feet upon the ladder of progress
This newborn desire to be of service to her rediscovered people was not long without an opportunity for expression
Yet the Fates willed that her future should be but another link in a connected chain she was to be as powerless to put aside her recent past as she had been to escape from the influence of her earlier life
There are sordid souls that eat and drink and breed and die and imagine they have lived
But Renas life since her great awakening had been that of the emotions and her temperament made of it a continuous life
Her successive states of consciousness were not detachable but united to form a single if not an entirely harmonious whole
To her sensitive spirit today was born of yesterday tomorrow would be but the offspring of to day
One day along toward noon her mother received a visit from Mary B Pettifoot a second cousin who lived on Back Street only a short distance from the house behind the cedars
Rena had gone out so that the visitor found Mis Molly alone
I heared you say Cousin Molly said Mary B
no one ever knew what the B in Marys name stood forit was a mere ornamental flourish that Rena was talkin bout teachin school
Ive got a good chance fer her ef she keers ter take it
My cousin Jeff Wain rived in town this monin fm way down in Sampson County ter git a teacher fer the nigger school in his deestric
I spose he mought a got one fm roun Newbern er Goldsboro er some er them places eas but he lowed hed like to visit some er his kin an ole friens an so kill two birds with one stone
I seed a strange mulatter man with a bay hoss an a new buggy drivin by here this monin early from down tods the river rejoined Mis Molly
I wonder if that wuz him
Did he have on a linen duster
asked Mary B
Yas an peared to be a very well sot up man replied Mis Molly  bout thirtyfive years old I should reckon
That wuz him assented Mary B
Hes got a fine hoss an buggy an a gol watch an chain an a big plantation an lots er hosses an mules an cows an hawgs
He raise fifty bales er cotton las year an hes ben ter the legislatur
 My gracious
exclaimed Mis Molly struck with awe at this catalogue of the strangers possessions he was evidently worth more than a great many rich white peopleall white people in North Carolina in those days were either rich or poor the distinction being one of caste rather than of wealth
Is he married
she inquired with interest
Nosingle
You mought low it was quare that he should n be married at his age but he was crossed in love oncetMary B heaved a selfconscious sighan has stayed single ever sence
That wuz ten years ago but as some husbans is longlived an there ain no mo chance fer im now than there wuz then I reckon some nice gal mought stan a good show er ketchin im ef shed play her kyards right
To Mis Molly this was news of considerable importance
She had not thought a great deal of Renas plan to teach she considered it lowering for Rena after having been white to go among the negroes any more than was unavoidable
This opportunity however meant more than mere employment for her daughter
She had felt Renas disappointment keenly from the practical point of view and blaming herself for it held herself all the more bound to retrieve the misfortune in any possible way
If she had not been sick Rena would not have dreamed the fateful dream that had brought her to Patesville for the connection between the vision and the reality was even closer in Mis Mollys eyes than in Renas
If the mother had not sent the letter announcing her illness and confirming the dream Rena would not have ruined her promising future by coming to Patesville
But the harm had been done and she was responsible ignorantly of course but none the less truly and it only remained for her to make amends as far as possible
Her highest ambition since Rena had grown up had been to see her married and comfortably settled in life
She had no hope that Tryon would come back
Rena had declared that she would make no further effort to get away from her people and furthermore that she would never marry
To this latter statement Mis Molly secretly attached but little importance
That a woman should go single from the cradle to the grave did not accord with her experience in life of the customs of North Carolina
She respected a grief she could not entirely fathom yet did not for a moment believe that Rena would remain unmarried
Youd better fetch him roun to see me May B she said an lets see what he looks like
Im perticlar bout my gal
She says she aint goin to marry nobody but of cose we know thats all foolishness
Ill fetch him roun this evenin bout three oclock said the visitor rising
I mus hurry back now an keep him compny
Tell Rena ter put on her bes bib an tucker for Mr Wain is perticlar too an Ive already ben braggin bout her looks
When Mary B at the appointed hour knocked at Mis Mollys front doorthe visit being one of ceremony she had taken her cousin round to the Front Street entrance and through the flower gardenMis Molly was prepared to receive them
After a decent interval long enough to suggest that she had not been watching their approach and was not overeager about the visit she answered the knock and admitted them into the parlor
Mr Wain was formally introduced and seated himself on the ancient haircloth sofa under the framed fashionplate while Mary B sat by the open door and fanned herself with a palmleaf fan
Mis Mollys impression of Wain was favorable
His complexion was of a light brownnot quite so fair as Mis Molly would have preferred but any deficiency in this regard or in the matter of the strangers features which while not unpleasing leaned toward the broad mulatto type was more than compensated in her eyes by very straight black hair and as soon appeared a great facility of complimentary speech
On his introduction Mr Wain bowed low assumed an air of great admiration and expressed his extreme delight in making the acquaintance of so distinguishedlooking a lady
Youre flattrin me Mr Wain returned Mis Molly with a gratified smile
But you want to meet my daughter befo you commence thowin bokays
Excuse my leavin youIll go an fetch her
She returned in a moment followed by Rena
Mr Wain low me to intoduce you to my daughter Rena
Rena this is May B
s cousin on her pappys side whos come up from Sampson to git a schoolteacher
Rena bowed gracefully
Wain stared a moment in genuine astonishment and then bent himself nearly double keeping his eyes fixed meanwhile upon Renas face
He had expected to see a pretty yellow girl but had been prepared for no such radiant vision of beauty as this which now confronted him
Doesdoes you mean ter say Mis Walden datdat dis young lady is yo own daughter
he stammered rallying his forces for action
Why not Mr
Wain
asked Mis Molly bridling with mock resentment
Do you mean ter low that she wuz changed in her cradle er is she too goodlookin to be my daughter
My deah Mis Walden
it ud be wastin wods fer me ter say dat dey ain no young lady too good lookin ter be yo daughter but youre lookin so young yosef dat Id ruther take her fer yo sister
Yas rejoined Mis Molly with animation they aint many years between us
I wuz ruther young myself when she wuz bon
An moover Wain went on it takes me a minute er so ter git my min use ter thinkin er Mis Rena as a cullud young lady
I mought a seed her a hunded times an Id a never dreamt but wat she wuz a wite young lady fm one er de bes families
Yas Mr Wain replied Mis Molly complacently all three er my childen wuz white an one of em has ben on the other side fer many long years
Rena has ben to school an has traveled an has had chancesbetter chances than anybody roun here knows
Shes jes de lady Im lookin fer ter teach ou school rejoined Wain with emphasis
Wid her schoolin an my riccommen she kin git a fus class cetifikit an draw foty dollars a month an a lady er her color kin keep a lot er little niggers straighter n a darker lady could
We jus got ter have her ter teach ou schoolef we kin git her
Renas interest in the prospect of employment at her chosen work was so great that she paid little attention to Wains compliments
Mis Molly led Mary B away to the kitchen on some pretext and left Rena to entertain the gentleman
She questioned him eagerly about the school and he gave the most glowing accounts of the elegant school house the bright pupils and the congenial society of the neighborhood
He spoke almost entirely in superlatives and after making due allowance for what Rena perceived to be a temperamental tendency to exaggeration she concluded that she would find in the school a worthy field of usefulness and in this polite and goodnatured though somewhat wordy man a coadjutor upon whom she could rely in her first efforts for she was not overconfident of her powers which seemed to grow less as the way opened for their exercise
Do you think Im competent to teach the school
she asked of the visitor after stating some of her qualifications
Oh dere s no doubt about it Miss Rena replied Wain who had listened with an air of great wisdom though secretly aware that he was too ignorant of letters to form a judgment you kin teach de school all right an could ef you didnt know half ez much
You wont have no trouble managin de childen nuther
Ef any of em gits onruly jes call on me fer hep an Ill make em walk Spanish
Im chuhman er de school committee an Ill lam de hide offn any scholar dat don behave
You kin trus me fer dat sho ez Im asettin here
Then said Rena Ill undertake it and do my best
Im sure youll not be too exacting
Yo bes Miss Renall be de bes dey is
Don you worry ner fret
Dem niggers wont have no other teacher after deyve once laid eyes on you Ill guarantee dat
Dere wont be no trouble not a bit
Well Cousin Molly said Mary B to Mis Molly in the kitchen how does the plan strike you
Ef Renas satisfied I am replied Mis Molly
But youd better say nothin about ketchin a beau or any such foolishness er else shed be just as likely not to go nigh Sampson County
Befo Cousin Jeff goes back confided Mary B Id like ter give im a party but my house is too small
I wuz wonderin she added tentatively ef I could n borry yo house
Shorely May B Im intrested in Mr Wain on Renas account an its as little as I kin do to let you use my house an help you git things ready
The date of the party was set for Thursday night as Wain was to leave Patesville on Friday morning taking with him the new teacher
The party would serve the double purpose of a compliment to the guest and a farewell to Rena and it might prove the precursor the mother secretly hoped of other festivities to follow at some later date
XXII IMPERATIVE BUSINESS One Wednesday morning about six weeks after his return home Tryon received a letter from Judge Straight with reference to the note left with him at Patesville for collection
This communication properly required an answer which might have been made in writing within the compass of ten lines
No sooner however had Tryon read the letter than he began to perceive reasons why it should be answered in person
He had left Patesville under extremely painful circumstances vowing that he would never return and yet now the barest pretext by which no one could have been deceived except willingly was sufficient to turn his footsteps thither again
He explained to his motherwith a vagueness which she found somewhat puzzling but ascribed to her own feminine obtuseness in matters of businessthe reasons that imperatively demanded his presence in Patesville
With an early start he could drive there in one dayhe had an excellent roadster a light buggy and a recent rain had left the road in good conditiona day would suffice for the transaction of his business and the third day would bring him home again
He set out on his journey on Thursday morning with this programme very clearly outlined
Tryon would not at first have admitted even to himself that Renas presence in Patesville had any bearing whatever upon his projected visit
The matter about which Judge Straight had written might it was clear be viewed in several aspects
The judge had written him concerning the one of immediate importance
It would be much easier to discuss the subject in all its bearings and clean up the whole matter in one comprehensive personal interview
The importance of this business then seemed very urgent for the first few hours of Tryons journey
Ordinarily a careful driver and merciful to his beast his eagerness to reach Patesville increased gradually until it became necessary to exercise some selfrestraint in order not to urge his faithful mare beyond her powers and soon he could no longer pretend obliviousness of the fact that some attraction stronger than the whole amount of Duncan McSwaynes note was urging him irresistibly toward his destination
The old town beyond the distant river his heart told him clamorously held the object in all the world to him most dear
Memory brought up in vivid detail every moment of his brief and joyous courtship each tender word each enchanting smile every fond caress
He lived his past happiness over again down to the moment of that fatal discovery
What horrible fate was it that had involved himnay that had caught this sweet delicate girl in such a blind alley
A wild hope flashed across his mind perhaps the ghastly story might not be true perhaps after all the girl was no more a negro than she seemed
He had heard sad stories of white children born out of wedlock abandoned by sinful parents to the care or adoption of colored women who had reared them as their own the childrens future basely sacrificed to hide the parents shame
He would confront this reputed mother of his darling and wring the truth from her
He was in a state of mind where any sort of a fairy tale would have seemed reasonable
He would almost have bribed some one to tell him that the woman he had loved the woman he still loved he felt a thrill of lawless pleasure in the confession was not the descendant of slaves that he might marry her and not have before his eyes the gruesome fear that some one of their children might show even the faintest mark of the despised race
At noon he halted at a convenient hamlet fed and watered his mare and resumed his journey after an hours rest
By this time he had well nigh forgotten about the legal business that formed the ostensible occasion for his journey and was conscious only of a wild desire to see the woman whose image was beckoning him on to Patesville as fast as his horse could take him
At sundown he stopped again about ten miles from the town and cared for his now tired beast
He knew her capacity however and calculated that she could stand the additional ten miles without injury
The mare set out with reluctance but soon settled resignedly down into a steady jog
Memory had hitherto assailed Tryon with the vision of past joys
As he neared the town imagination attacked him with still more moving images
He had left her this sweet flower of womankindwhite or not God had never made a fairerhe had seen her fall to the hard pavement with he knew not what resulting injury
He had left her tender framethe touch of her fingertips had made him thrill with happiness to be lifted by strange hands while he with heartless pride had driven deliberately away without a word of sorrow or regret
He had ignored her as completely as though she had never existed
That he had been deceived was true
But had he not aided in his own deception
Had not Warwick told him distinctly that they were of no family and was it not his own fault that he had not followed up the clue thus given him
Had not Rena compared herself to the childs nurse and had he not assured her that if she were the nurse he would marry her next day
The deception had been due more to his own blindness than to any lack of honesty on the part of Rena and her brother
In the light of his present feelings they seemed to have been absurdly outspoken
He was glad that he had kept his discovery to himself
He had considered himself very magnanimous not to have exposed the fraud that was being perpetrated upon society it was with a very comfortable feeling that he now realized that the matter was as profound a secret as before
She ought to have been born white he muttered adding weakly I would to God that I had never found her out
Drawing near the bridge that crossed the river to the town he pictured to himself a pale girl with sorrowful tearstained eyes pining away in the old gray house behind the cedars for love of him dying perhaps of a broken heart
He would hasten to her he would dry her tears with kisses he would express sorrow for his cruelty
The tired mare had crossed the bridge and was slowly toiling up Front Street she was near the limit of her endurance and Tryon did not urge her
They might talk the matter over and if they must part part at least they would in peace and friendship
If he could not marry her he would never marry any one else it would be cruel for him to seek happiness while she was denied it for having once given her heart to him she could never he was sureso instinctively fine was her natureshe could never love any one less worthy than himself and would therefore probably never marry
He knew from a Clarence acquaintance who had written him a letter that Rena had not reappeared in that town
If he should discoverthe chance was one in a thousandthat she was white or if he should find it too hard to leave herah well
he was a white man one of a race born to command
He would make her white no one beyond the old town would ever know the difference
If perchance their secret should be disclosed the world was wide a man of courage and ambition inspired by love might make a career anywhere
Circumstances made weak men strong men mould circumstances to do their bidding
He would not let his darling die of grief whatever the price must be paid for her salvation
She was only a few rods away from him now
In a moment he would see her he would take her tenderly in his arms and heart to heart they would mutually forgive and forget and strengthened by their love would face the future boldly and bid the world do its worst
XXIII THE GUEST OF HONOR The evening of the party arrived
The house had been thoroughly cleaned in preparation for the event and decorated with the choicest treasures of the garden
By eight oclock the guests had gathered
They were all mulattoesall people of mixed blood were called mulattoes in North Carolina
There were dark mulattoes and bright mulattoes
Mis Mollys guests were mostly of the bright class most of them more than half white and few of them less
In Mis Mollys small circle straight hair was the only palliative of a dark complexion
Many of the guests would not have been casually distinguishable from white people of the poorer class
Others bore unmistakable traces of Indian ancestryfor Cherokee and Tuscarora blood was quite widely diffused among the free negroes of North Carolina though wellnigh lost sight of by the curious custom of the white people to ignore anything but the negro blood in those who were touched by its potent current
Very few of those present had been slaves
The free colored people of Patesville were numerous enough before the war to have their own society and human enough to despise those who did not possess advantages equal to their own and at this time they still looked down upon those who had once been held in bondage
The only black man present occupied a chair which stood on a broad chest in one corner and extracted melody from a fiddle to which a whole generation of the best people of Patesville had danced and made merry
Uncle Needham seldom played for colored gatherings but made an exception in Mis Mollys case she was not white but he knew her past if she was not the rose she had at least been near the rose
When the company had gathered Mary B as mistress of ceremonies whispered to Uncle Needham who tapped his violin sharply with the bow
Ladies an gentemens take yo padners fer a Fuhginny reel
Mr Wain as the guest of honor opened the ball with his hostess
He wore a broadcloth coat and trousers a heavy glittering chain across the spacious front of his white waistcoat and a large red rose in his buttonhole
If his boots were slightly run down at the heel so trivial a detail passed unnoticed in the general splendor of his attire
Upon a close or hostile inspection there would have been some features of his ostensibly goodnatured facethe shifty eye the full and slightly drooping lower lipwhich might have given a student of physiognomy food for reflection
But whatever the latent defects of Wains character he proved himself this evening a model of geniality presuming not at all upon his reputed wealth but winning golden opinions from those who came to criticise of whom of course there were a few the company being composed of human beings
When the dance began Wain extended his large soft hand to Mary B yellow buxom thirty with white and even teeth glistening behind her full red lips
A younger sister of Mary B
s was paired with Billy Oxendine a funny little tailor a great gossip and therefore a favorite among the women
Mis Molly graciously consented after many protestations of lack of skill and want of practice to stand up opposite Homer Pettifoot Mary B
s husband a tall man with a slight stoop a bald crown and full dreamy eyesa man of much imagination and a large fund of anecdote
Two other couples completed the set others were restrained by bashfulness or religious scruples which did not yield until later in the evening
The perfumed air from the garden without and the cut roses within mingled incongruously with the alien odors of musk and hair oil of which several young barbers in the company were especially redolent
There was a play of sparkling eyes and glancing feet
Mary B danced with the languorous grace of an Eastern odalisque Mis Molly with the mincing hesitating step of one long out of practice
Wain performed saltatory prodigies
This was a golden opportunity for the display in which his soul found delight
He introduced variations hitherto unknown to the dance
His skill and suppleness brought a glow of admiration into the eyes of the women and spread a cloud of jealousy over the faces of several of the younger men who saw themselves eclipsed
Rena had announced in advance her intention to take no active part in the festivities
I dont feel like dancing mammaI shall never dance again
Well now Rena answered her mother of cose youre too dignified sence youve ben sociatin with white folks to be hoppin roun an kickin up like May B an these other yaller gals but of cose too you cant slight the compny entirely even ef it aint jest exacly our party youll have to pay em some little attention specially Mr Wain sence youre goin down yonder with im
Rena conscientiously did what she thought politeness required
She went the round of the guests in the early part of the evening and exchanged greetings with them
To several requests for dances she replied that she was not dancing
She did not hold herself aloof because of pride any instinctive shrinking she might have felt by reason of her recent association with persons of greater refinement was offset by her still more newly awakened zeal for humanity they were her people she must not despise them
But the occasion suggested painful memories of other and different scenes in which she had lately participated
Once or twice these memories were so vivid as almost to overpower her
She slipped away from the company and kept in the background as much as possible without seeming to slight any one
The guests as well were dimly conscious of a slight barrier between Mis Mollys daughter and themselves
The time she had spent apart from these friends of her youth had rendered it impossible for her ever to meet them again upon the plane of common interests and common thoughts
It was much as though one having acquired the vernacular of his native country had lived in a foreign land long enough to lose the language of his childhood without acquiring fully that of his adopted country
Miss Rowena Warwick could never again become quite the Rena Walden who had left the house behind the cedars no more than a year and a half before
Upon this very difference were based her noble aspirations for usefulnessone must stoop in order that one may lift others
Any other young woman present would have been importuned beyond her powers of resistance
Renas reserve was respected
When supper was announced somewhat early in the evening the dancers found seats in the hall or on the front piazza
Aunt Zilphy assisted by Mis Molly and Mary B passed around the refreshments which consisted of fried chicken buttered biscuits poundcake and eggnog
When the first edge of appetite was taken off the conversation waxed animated
Homer Pettifoot related with minute detail an old threadbare hunting lie dating in slightly differing forms from the age of Nimrod about finding twentyfive partridges sitting in a row on a rail and killing them all with a single buckshot which passed through twentyfour and lodged in the body of the twentyfifth from which it was extracted and returned to the shot pouch for future service
This story was followed by a murmur of incredulityof course the thing was possible but Homers faculty for exaggeration was so well known that any statement of his was viewed with suspicion
Homer seemed hurt at this lack of faith and was disposed to argue the point but the sonorous voice of Mr Wain on the other side of the room cut short his protestations in much the same way that the rising sun extinguishes the light of lesser luminaries
I wuz a member er de fus legislatur after de wah Wain was saying
When I went up fm Sampson in de fall I had to pass though Smithfiel I got in town in de afternoon an put up at de bes hotel
De lanlod did n have no spicion but what I wuz a white man an he gimme a room an I had supper an breakfas an went on ter Rolly nex mornin

De po man acshully bust inter tears continued Mr Wain magnanimously an I felt so sorry fer imhe wuz a po white man tryin ter git up in de worldat I hauled out my purse an gin im ten dollars an he peared monstous glad ter git it
 How goodhearted
How kin
murmured the ladies
It done credit to yo feelins
 Dont blieve a word er dem lies muttered one young man to another sarcastically
He could n pass fer white lessn it wuz a mighty dark night
Upon this glorious evening of his life Mr Jefferson Wain had one distinctly hostile critic of whose presence he was blissfully unconscious
Frank Fowler had not been invited to the party his family did not go with Mary B
s set
Rena had suggested to her mother that he be invited but Mis Molly had demurred on the ground that it was not her party and that she had no right to issue invitations
It is quite likely that she would have sought an invitation for Frank from Mary B but Frank was black and would not harmonize with the rest of the company who would not have Mis Mollys reasons for treating him well
She had compromised the matter by stepping across the way in the afternoon and suggesting that Frank might come over and sit on the back porch and look at the dancing and share in the supper
Frank was not without a certain honest pride
He was sensitive enough too not to care to go where he was not wanted
He would have curtly refused any such maimed invitation to any other place
But would he not see Rena in her best attire and might she not perhaps in passing speak a word to him
Thank y Mis Molly he replied Ill probly come over
Youre a big fool boy observed his father after Mis Molly had gone back across the street ter be stickin roun dem yaller niggers cross de street an slobbrin an slavrin over em an hangin roun deir back do wuss n ef dey wuz wite folks
Id see em dead fus
Frank himself resisted the temptation for half an hour after the music began but at length he made his way across the street and stationed himself at the window opening upon the back piazza
When Rena was in the room he had eyes for her only but when she was absent he fixed his attention mainly upon Wain
With jealous clairvoyance he observed that Wains eyes followed Rena when she left the room and lit up when she returned
Frank had heard that Rena was going away with this man and he watched Wain closely liking him less the longer he looked at him
To his fancy Wains style and skill were affectation his goodnature mere hypocrisy and his glance at Rena the eye of the hawk upon his quarry
He had heard that Wain was unmarried and he could not see how this being so he could help wishing Rena for a wife
Frank would have been content to see her marry a white man who would have raised her to a plane worthy of her merits
In this mans shifty eye he read the liarhis wealth and standing were probably as false as his seeming goodhumor
Is that you Frank
said a soft voice near at hand
He looked up with a joyful thrill
Rena was peering intently at him as if trying to distinguish his features in the darkness
It was a bright moonlight night but Frank stood in the shadow of the piazza
Yas m its me Miss Rena
Yo mammy said I could come over an see youall dance
You ain ben out on de flo at all ternight
 No Frank I dont care for dancing
I shall not dance tonight
This answer was pleasing to Frank
If he could not hope to dance with her at least the men inside at least this snake in the grass from down the countryshould not have that privilege
But you must have some supper Frank said Rena
Ill bring it myself
No Miss Rena I don keer fer nothinI did n come over ter eatraly I didnt
Nonsense Frank theres plenty of it
I have no appetite and you shall have my portion
She brought him a slice of cake and a glass of eggnog
When Mis Molly a minute later came out upon the piazza Frank left the yard and walked down the street toward the old canal
Rena had spoken softly to him she had fed him with her own dainty hands
He might never hope that she would see in him anything but a friend but he loved her and he would watch over her and protect her wherever she might be
He did not believe that she would ever marry the grinning hypocrite masquerading back there in Mis Mollys parlor but the man would bear watching
Mis Molly had come to call her daughter into the house
Rena she said Mr Wain wants ter know if you wont dance just one dance with him
Yas Rena pleaded Mary B who followed Miss Molly out to the piazza jes one dance
I dont think youre treatin my compny jes right Cousin Rena
Youre goin down there with im added her mother an it d be just as well to be on friendly terms with im
Wain himself had followed the women
Sholy Miss Rena youre gwine ter honah me wid one dance
Id go way fm dis paty sad at heat ef I had n stood up oncet wid de young lady er de house
As Rena weakly persuaded placed her hand on Wains arm and entered the house a buggy coming up Front Street paused a moment at the corner and then turning slowly drove quietly up the nameless bystreet concealed by the intervening cedars until it reached a point from which the occupant could view through the open front window the interior of the parlor
XXIV SWING YOUR PARTNERS Moved by tenderness and thoughts of selfsacrifice which had occupied his mind to the momentary exclusion of all else Tryon had scarcely noticed as be approached the house behind the cedars a strain of lively music to which was added as he drew still nearer the accompaniment of other festive sounds
He suddenly awoke however to the fact that these signs of merriment came from the house at which he had intended to stop he had not meant that Rena should pass another sleepless night of sorrow or that he should himself endure another needless hour of suspense
He drew rein at the corner
Shocked surprise a nascent anger a vague alarm an insistent curiosity urged him nearer
Turning the mare into the side street and keeping close to the fence he drove ahead in the shadow of the cedars until he reached a gap through which he could see into the open door and windows of the brightly lighted hall
There was evidently a ball in progress
The fiddle was squeaking merrily so a tune that he remembered wellit was associated with one of the most delightful evenings of his life that of the tournament ball
A mellow negro voice was calling with a rhyming accompaniment the figures of a quadrille
Tryon with parted lips and slowly hardening heart leaned forward from the buggy seat gripping the rein so tightly that his nails cut into the opposing palm
Above the clatter of noisy conversation rose the fiddlers voice Swing yo padners doan be shy Look yo lady in de eye
Thow yo ahm aroun huh wais Take yo timedey ain no hase
To the middle of the floor in full view through an open window advanced the woman who all day long had been the burden of his thoughtsnot pale with grief and holloweyed with weeping but flushed with pleasure around her waist the arm of a burly grinning mulatto whose face was offensively familiar to Tryon
With a muttered curse of concentrated bitterness Tryon struck the mare a sharp blow with the whip
The sensitive creature spirited even in her great weariness resented the lash and started off with the bit in her teeth
Perceiving that it would be difficult to turn in the narrow roadway without running into the ditch at the left Tryon gave the mare rein and dashed down the street scarcely missing as the buggy crossed the bridge a man standing abstractedly by the old canal who sprang aside barely in time to avoid being run over
Meantime Rena was passing through a trying ordeal
After the first few bars the fiddler plunged into a wellknown air in which Rena keenly susceptible to musical impressions recognized the tune to which as Queen of Love and Beauty she had opened the dance at her entrance into the world of life and love for it was there she had met George Tryon
The combination of music and movement brought up the scene with great distinctness
Tryon peering angrily through the cedars had not been more conscious than she of the external contrast between her partners on this and the former occasion
She perceived too as Tryon from the outside had not the difference between Wains wordy flattery only saved by his cousins warning from pointed and fulsome adulation and the tenderly graceful compliment couched in the romantic terms of chivalry with which the knight of the handkerchief had charmed her ear
It was only by an immense effort that she was able to keep her emotions under control until the end of the dance when she fled to her chamber and burst into tears
It was not the cruel Tryon who had blasted her love with his deadly look that she mourned but the gallant young knight who had worn her favor on his lance and crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty
Tryons stay in Patesville was very brief
He drove to the hotel and put up for the night
During many sleepless hours his mind was in a turmoil with a very different set of thoughts from those which had occupied it on the way to town
Not the least of them was a profound selfcontempt for his own lack of discernment
How had he been so blind as not to have read long ago the character of this wretched girl who had bewitched him
Tonight his eyes had been openedhe had seen her with the mask thrown off a true daughter of a race in which the sensuous enjoyment of the moment took precedence of taste or sentiment or any of the higher emotions
Her few months of boarding school her brief association with white people had evidently been a mere veneer over the underlying negro and their effects had slipped away as soon as the intercourse had ceased
With the monkeylike imitativeness of the negro she had copied the manners of white people while she lived among them and had dropped them with equal facility when they ceased to serve a purpose
Who but a negro could have recovered so soon from what had seemed a terrible bereavementshe herself must have felt it at the time for otherwise she would not have swooned
A woman of sensibility as this one had seemed to be should naturally feel more keenly and for a longer time than a man an injury to the affections but he a son of the ruling race had been miserable for six weeks about a girl who had so far forgotten him as already to plunge headlong into the childish amusements of her own ignorant and degraded people
What more indeed he asked himself savagelywhat more could be expected of the baseborn child of the plaything of a gentlemans idle hour who to this ignoble origin added the blood of a servile race
And he George Tryon had honored her with his love he had very nearly linked his fate and joined his blood to hers by the solemn sanctions of church and state
Tryon was not a devout man but he thanked God with religious fervor that he had been saved a second time from a mistake which would have wrecked his whole future
If he had yielded to the momentary weakness of the past nightthe outcome of a sickly sentimentality to which he recognized now in the light of reflection that he was entirely too pronehe would have regretted it soon enough
The black streak would have been sure to come out in some form sooner or later if not in the wife then in her children
He saw clearly enough in this hour of revulsion that with his temperament and training such a union could never have been happy
If all the world had been ignorant of the dark secret it would always have been in his own thoughts or at least never far away
Each fault of hers that the close daily association of husband and wife might revealthe most flawless of sweethearts do not pass scathless through the long test of matrimonyevery wayward impulse of his children every defect of mind morals temper or health would have been ascribed to the dark ancestral strain
Happiness under such conditions would have been impossible
When Tryon lay awake in the early morning after a few brief hours of sleep the business which had brought him to Patesville seemed in the cold light of reason so ridiculously inadequate that he felt almost ashamed to have set up such a pretext for his journey
The prospect too of meeting Dr Green and his family of having to explain his former sudden departure and of running a gauntlet of inquiry concerning his marriage to the aristocratic Miss Warwick of South Carolina the fear that some one at Patesville might have suspected a connection between Renas swoon and his own flightthese considerations so moved this impressionable and impulsive young man that he called a bellboy demanded an early breakfast ordered his horse paid his reckoning and started upon his homeward journey forthwith
A certain distrust of his own sensibility which he felt to be curiously inconsistent with his most positive convictions led him to seek the river bridge by a roundabout route which did not take him past the house where a few hours before he had seen the last fragment of his idol shattered beyond the hope of repair
The party broke up at an early hour since most of the guests were workingpeople and the travelers were to make an early start next day
About nine in the morning Wain drove round to Mis Mollys
Renas trunk was strapped behind the buggy and she set out in the company of Wain for her new field of labor
The school term was only two months in length and she did not expect to return until its expiration
Just before taking her seat in the buggy Rena felt a sudden sinking of the heart
Oh mother she whispered as they stood wrapped in a close embrace Im afraid to leave you
I left you once and it turned out so miserably
Itll turn out better this time honey replied her mother soothingly
Goodby child
Take care of yoself an yor money and write to yor mammy
One kiss all round and Rena was lifted into the buggy
Wain seized the reins and under his skillful touch the pretty mare began to prance and curvet with restrained impatience
Wain could not resist the opportunity to show off before the party which included Mary B
s entire family and several other neighbors who had gathered to see the travelers off
Goodby ter Patesville
Goodby folkses all
he cried with a wave of his disengaged hand
Goodby mother
Goodby all
cried Rena as with tears in her heart and a brave smile on her face she left her home behind her for the second time
When they had crossed the river bridge the travelers came to a long stretch of rising ground from the summit of which they could look back over the white sandy road for nearly a mile
Neither Rena nor her companion saw Frank Fowler behind the chinquapin bush at the foot of the hill nor the gaze of mute love and longing with which he watched the buggy mount the long incline
He had not been able to trust himself to bid her farewell
He had seen her go away once before with every prospect of happiness and come back a dove with a wounded wing to the old nest behind the cedars
She was going away again with a man whom he disliked and distrusted
If she had met misfortune before what were her prospects for happiness now
The buggy paused at the top of the hill and Frank shading his eyes with his hand thought he could see her turn and look behind
Look back dear child towards your home and those who love you
For who knows more than this faithful worshiper what threads of the past Fate is weaving into your future or whether happiness or misery lies before you
XXV BALANCE ALL The road to Sampson County lay for the most part over the pineclad sandhillsan alternation of gentle rises and gradual descents with now and then a swamp of greater or less extent
Long stretches of the highway led through the virgin forest for miles unbroken by a clearing or sign of human habitation
They traveled slowly with frequent pauses in shady places for the weather was hot
The journey made leisurely required more than a day and might with slight effort be prolonged into two
They stopped for the night at a small village where Wain found lodging for Rena with an acquaintance of his and for himself with another while a third took charge of the horse the accommodation for travelers being limited
Renas appearance and manners were the subject of much comment
It was necessary to explain to several curious white people that Rena was a woman of color
A white woman might have driven with Wain without attracting remarkmost white ladies had negro coachmen
That a woman of Renas complexion should eat at a negros table or sleep beneath a negros roof was a seeming breach of caste which only black blood could excuse
The explanation was never questioned
No white person of sound mind would ever claim to be a negro
They resumed their journey somewhat late in the morning
Rena would willingly have hastened for she was anxious to plunge into her new work but Wain seemed disposed to prolong the pleasant drive and beguiled the way for a time with stories of wonderful things he had done and strange experiences of a somewhat checkered career
He was shrewd enough to avoid any subject which would offend a modest young woman but too obtuse to perceive that much of what he said would not commend him to a person of refinement
He made little reference to his possessions concerning which so much had been said at Patesville and this reticence was a point in his favor
If he had not been so much upon his guard and Rena so much absorbed by thoughts of her future work such a drive would have furnished a person of her discernment a very fair measure of the mans character
To these distractions must be added the entire absence of any idea that Wain might have amorous designs upon her and any shortcomings of manners or speech were excused by the broad mantle of charity which Rena in her newfound zeal for the welfare of her people was willing to throw over all their faults
They were the victims of oppression they were not responsible for its results
Toward the end of the second day while nearing their destination the travelers passed a large white house standing back from the road at the foot of a lane
Around it grew widespreading trees and wellkept shrubbery
The fences were in good repair
Behind the house and across the road stretched extensive fields of cotton and waving corn
They had passed no other place that showed such signs of thrift and prosperity
Oh what a lovely place
exclaimed Rena
That is yours isnt it
No we aint got to my house yet he answered
Dat house blongs ter de riches people roun here
Dat house is over in de nex county
Were right close to de line now
Shortly afterwards they turned off from the main highway they had been pursuing and struck into a narrower road to the left
De main road explained Wain goes on to Clinton bout five miles er mo away
Dis one were turnin inter now will take us to my place which is bout three miles futher on
Well git dere now in an hour er so
Wain lived in an old plantation house somewhat dilapidated and surrounded by an air of neglect and shiftlessness but still preserving a remnant of dignity in its outlines and comfort in its interior arrangements
Rena was assigned a large room on the second floor
She was somewhat surprised at the makeup of the household
Wains mother an old woman much darker than her sonkept house for him
A sister with two children lived in the house
The element of surprise lay in the presence of two small children left by Wains wife of whom Rena now heard for the first time
He had lost his wife he informed Rena sadly a couple of years before
Yas Miss Rena she sighed de Lawd give her an de Lawd tuck her away
Blessed be de name er de Lawd
He accompanied this sententious quotation with a wicked look from under his halfclosed eyelids that Rena did not see
The following morning Wain drove her in his buggy over to the county town where she took the teachers examination
She was given a seat in a room with a number of other candidates for certificates but the fact leaking out from some remark of Wains that she was a colored girl objection was quietly made by several of the wouldbe teachers to her presence in the room and she was requested to retire until the white teachers should have been examined
An hour or two later she was given a separate examination which she passed without difficulty
The examiner a gentleman of local standing was dimly conscious that she might not have found her exclusion pleasant and was especially polite
It would have been strange indeed if he had not been impressed by her sweet face and air of modest dignity which were all the more striking because of her social disability
He fell into conversation with her became interested in her hopes and aims and very cordially offered to be of service if at any time he might in connection with her school
You have the satisfaction he said of receiving the only firstgrade certificate issued today
You might teach a higher grade of pupils than you will find at Sandy Run but let us hope that you may in time raise them to your own level
Which I doubt very much he muttered to himself as she went away with Wain
What a pity that such a woman should be a nigger
If she were anything to me though I should hate to trust her anywhere near that saddlecolored scoundrel
Hes a thoroughly bad lot and will bear watching
Rena however was serenely ignorant of any danger from the accommodating Wain
Absorbed in her own thoughts and plans she had not sought to look beneath the surface of his somewhat overdone politeness
In a few days she began her work as teacher and sought to forget in the service of others the dull sorrow that still gnawed at her heart
XXVI THE SCHOOLHOUSE IN THE WOODS Blanche Leary closely observant of Tryons moods marked a decided change in his manner after his return from his trip to Patesville
His former moroseness had given way to a certain defiant lightness broken now and then by an involuntary sigh but maintained so well on the whole that his mother detected no lapses whatever
The change was characterized by another feature agreeable to both the women Tryon showed decidedly more interest than ever before in Miss Learys society
Within a week he asked her several times to play a selection on the piano displaying as she noticed a decided preference for gay and cheerful music and several times suggesting a change when she chose pieces of a sentimental cast
More than once during the second week after his return he went out riding with her she was a graceful horsewoman perfectly at home in the saddle and appearing to advantage in a riding habit
She was aware that Tryon watched her now and then with an eye rather critical than indulgent
He is comparing me with some other girl she surmised
I seem to stand the test very well
I wonder who the other is and what was the trouble
Miss Leary exerted all her powers to interest and amuse the man she had set out to win and who seemed nearer than ever before
Tryon to his pleased surprise discovered in her mind depths that he had never suspected
She displayed a singular affinity for the tastes that were hishe could not of course know how carefully she had studied them
The old wound recently reopened seemed to be healing rapidly under conditions more conducive than before to perfect recovery
No longer indeed was he pursued by the picture of Rena discovered and unmaskedthis he had definitely banished from the realm of sentiment to that of reason
The haunting image of Rena loving and beloved amid the harmonious surroundings of her brothers home was not so readily displaced
Nevertheless he reached in several weeks a point from which he could consider her as one thinks of a dear one removed by the hand of death or smitten by some incurable ailment of mind or body
Erelong he fondly believed the recovery would be so far complete that he could consign to the tomb of pleasant memories even the most thrilling episodes of his illstarred courtship
George said Mrs Tryon one morning while her son was in this cheerful mood Im sending Blanche over to Major McLeods to do an errand for me
Would you mind driving her over
The road may be rough after the storm last night and Blanche has an idea that no one drives so well as you
Why yes mother Ill be glad to drive Blanche over
I want to see the major myself
They were soon bowling along between the pines behind the handsome mare that had carried Tryon so well at the Clarence tournament
Presently he drew up sharply
A tree has fallen squarely across the road he exclaimed
We shall have to turn back a little way and go around
They drove back a quarter of a mile and turned into a byroad leading to the right through the woods
The solemn silence of the pine forest is soothing or oppressive according to ones mood
Beneath the cool arcade of the tall overarching trees a deep peace stole over Tryons heart
He had put aside indefinitely and forever an unhappy and impossible love
The pretty and affectionate girl beside him would make an ideal wife
Of her family and blood he was sure
She was his mothers choice and his mother had set her heart upon their marriage
Why not speak to her now and thus give himself the best possible protection against stray flames of love
Blanche he said looking at her kindly
Yes George
Her voice was very gentle and slightly tremulous
Could she have divined his thought
Love is a great clairvoyant
Blanche dear I A clatter of voices broke upon the stillness of the forest and interrupted Tryons speech
A sudden turn to the left brought the buggy to a little clearing in the midst of which stood a small log schoolhouse
Out of the schoolhouse a swarm of colored children were emerging the suppressed energy of the school hour finding vent in vocal exercise of various sorts
A group had already formed a ring and were singing with great volume and vigor Miss Jane she loves sugar an tea Miss Jane she loves candy
Miss Jane she can whirl all around An kiss her love quite handy
De oak grows tall De pine grows slim So rise you up my true love An let me come in
What a funny little darkey
exclaimed Miss Leary pointing to a diminutive lad who was walking on his hands with his feet balanced in the air
At sight of the buggy and its occupants this sable acrobat still retaining his inverted position moved toward the newcomers and reversing himself with a sudden spring brought up standing beside the buggy
Hoddy Mars Geoge
he exclaimed bobbing his head and kicking his heel out behind in approved plantation style
Hello Plato replied the young man what are you doing here
Gwine ter school Mars Geoge replied the lad larnin ter read an write suh lack de wite folks
Wat you callin dat wite man marster fur
whispered a tall yellow boy to the acrobat addressed as Plato
You don blong ter him no mo youre free an ain got sense ernuff ter know it
Tryon threw a small coin to Plato and holding another in his hand suggestively smiled toward the tall yellow boy who looked regretfully at the coin but stood his ground he would call no man master not even for a piece of money
During this little colloquy Miss Leary had kept her face turned toward the schoolhouse
What a pretty girl
she exclaimed
There she added as Tryon turned his head toward her you are too late
She has retired into her castle
Oh Plato
Yas missis replied Plato who was prancing round the buggy in great glee on the strength of his acquaintance with the white folks
Is your teacher white
No mam she aint wite shes black
She looks lack shes wite but shes black
Tryon had not seen the teachers face but the incident had jarred the old wound Miss Learys description of the teacher together with Platos characterization had stirred lightly sleeping memories
He was more or less abstracted during the remainder of the drive and did not recur to the conversation that had been interrupted by coming upon the schoolhouse
The teacher glancing for a moment through the open door of the schoolhouse had seen a handsome young lady staring at herMiss Leary had a curiously intent look when she was interested in anything with no intention whatever to be rude and beyond the lady the back and shoulder of a man whose face was turned the other way
There was a vague suggestion of something familiar about the equipage but Rena shrank from this close scrutiny and withdrew out of sight before she had had an opportunity to identify the vague resemblance to something she had known
Miss Leary had missed by a hairsbreadth the psychological moment and felt some resentment toward the little negroes who had interrupted her lovers train of thought
Negroes have caused a great deal of trouble among white people
How deeply the shadow of the Ethiopian had fallen upon her own happiness Miss Leary of course could not guess
XXVII AN INTERESTING ACQUAINTANCE A few days later Rena looked out of the window near her desk and saw a low basket phaeton drawn by a sorrel pony driven sharply into the clearing and drawn up beside an oak sapling
The occupant of the phaeton a tall handsome wellpreserved lady in middle life with slightly gray hair alighted briskly from the phaeton tied the pony to the sapling with a hitchingstrap and advanced to the schoolhouse door
Rena wondered who the lady might be
She had a benevolent aspect however and came forward to the desk with a smile not at all embarrassed by the wideeyed inspection of the entire school
How do you do
she said extending her hand to the teacher
I live in the neighborhood and am interested in the colored peoplea good many of them once belonged to me
I heard something of your school and thought I should like to make your acquaintance
It is very kind of you indeed murmured Rena respectfully
Yes continued the lady I am not one of those who sit back and blame their former slaves because they were freed
They are free nowit is all decided and settledand they ought to be taught enough to enable them to make good use of their freedom
But really my dearyou mustnt feel offended if I make a mistakeI am going to ask you something very personal
She looked suggestively at the gaping pupils
The school may take the morning recess now announced the teacher
The pupils filed out in an orderly manner most of them stationing themselves about the grounds in such places as would keep the teacher and the white lady in view
Very few white persons approved of the colored schools no other white person had ever visited this one
Are you really colored
asked the lady when the children had withdrawn
A year and a half earlier Rena would have met the question by some display of selfconsciousness
Now she replied simply and directly
Yes maam I am colored
The lady who had been studying her as closely as good manners would permit sighed regretfully
Well its a shame
No one would ever think it
If you chose to conceal it no one would ever be the wiser
What is your name child and where were you brought up
You must have a romantic history
Rena gave her name and a few facts in regard to her past
The lady was so much interested and put so many and such searching questions that Rena really found it more difficult to suppress the fact that she had been white than she had formerly had in hiding her African origin
There was about the girl an air of real refinement that pleased the ladythe refinement not merely of a fine nature but of contact with cultured people a certain reserve of speech and manner quite inconsistent with Mrs Tryons experience of colored women
The lady was interested and slightly mystified
A generous impulsive spirither sons own mothershe made minute inquiries about the school and the pupils several of whom she knew by name
Rena stated that the two months term was nearing its end and that she was training the children in various declamations and dialogues for the exhibition at the close
I shall attend it declared the lady positively
Im sure you are doing a good work and its very noble of you to undertake it when you might have a very different future
If I can serve you at any time dont hesitate to call upon me
I live in the big white house just before you turn out of the Clinton road to come this way
Im only a widow but my son George lives with me and has some influence in the neighborhood
He drove by here yesterday with the lady he is going to marry
It was she who told me about you
Was it the name or some subtle resemblance in speech or feature that recalled Tryons image to Renas mind
It was not so far awaythe image of the loving Tryonthat any powerful witchcraft was required to call it up
His mother was a widow Rena had thought in happier days that she might be such a kind lady as this
But the cruel Tryon who had left herhis mother would be some hard cold proud woman who would regard a negro as but little better than a dog and who would not soil her lips by addressing a colored person upon any other terms than as a servant
She knew too that Tryon did not live in Sampson County though the exact location of his home was not clear to her
And where are you staying my dear
asked the good lady
Im boarding at Mrs Wains answered Rena
Mrs
Wains
Yes they live in the old Campbell place
Oh yesAunt Nancy
Shes a good enough woman but we dont think much of her son Jeff
He married my Amanda after the warshe used to belong to me and ought to have known better
He abused her most shamefully and had to be threatened with the law
She left him a year or so ago and went away I havent seen her lately
Well goodby child Im coming to your exhibition
If you ever pass my house come in and see me
The good lady had talked for half an hour and had brought a ray of sunshine into the teachers monotonous life heretofore lighted only by the uncertain lamp of high resolve
She had satisfied a pardonable curiosity and had gone away without mentioning her name
Rena saw Plato untying the pony as the lady climbed into the phaeton
Who was the lady Plato
asked the teacher when the visitor had driven away
Dat uz my ole mistiss mam returned Plato proudly ole Mis Liza
Mis Liza who
asked Rena
Mis Liza Tryon
I use ter blong ter her
Dat uz her son my young Mars Geoge wat driv pas hyuh yistiddy wid is sweetheart
XXVIII THE LOST KNIFE Rena had found her task not a difficult one so far as discipline was concerned
Her pupils were of a docile race and school to them had all the charm of novelty
The teacher commanded some awe because she was a stranger and some perhaps because she was white for the theory of blackness as propounded by Plato could not quite counter balance in the young African mind the evidence of their own senses
She combined gentleness with firmness and if these had not been sufficient she had reserves of character which would have given her the mastery over much less plastic material than these ignorant but eager young people
The work of instruction was simple enough for most of the pupils began with the alphabet which they acquired from Websters bluebacked spelling book the palladium of Southern education at that epoch
The much abused carpetbaggers had put the spellingbook within reach of every child of school age in North Carolinaa fact which is often overlooked when the carpetbaggers are held up to public odium
Even the devil should have his due and is not so black as he is painted
At the time when she learned that Tryon lived in the neighborhood Rena had already been subjected for several weeks to a trying ordeal
Wain had begun to persecute her with marked attentions
She had at first gone to board at his houseor by courtesy with his mother
For a week or two she had considered his attentions in no other light than those of a member of the school committee sharing her own zeal and interested in seeing the school successfully carried on
In this character Wain had driven her to the town for her examination he had busied himself about putting the schoolhouse in order and in various matters affecting the conduct of the school
He had jocularly offered to come and whip the children for her and had found it convenient to drop in occasionally ostensibly to see what progress the work was making
Dese childen he would observe sonorously in the presence of the school oughter be monstous glad ter have de chance er settin under yo instruction Miss Rena
Im sho evebody in dis neighbohood preciates de privlege er havin you in ou mids
Though slightly embarrassing to the teacher these public demonstrations were endurable so long as they could be regarded as mere official appreciation of her work
Sincerely in earnest about her undertaking she had plunged into it with all the intensity of a serious nature which love had stirred to activity
A pessimist might have sighed sadly or smiled cynically at the notion that a poor weak girl with a dangerous beauty and a sensitive soul and troubles enough of her own should hope to accomplish anything appreciable toward lifting the black mass still floundering in the mud where slavery had left it and where emancipation had found itthe mud in which for aught that could be seen to the contrary her little feet too were hopelessly entangled
It might have seemed like expecting a man to lift himself by his bootstraps
But Rena was no philosopher either sad or cheerful
She could not even have replied to this argument that races must lift themselves and the most that can be done by others is to give them opportunity and fair play
Hers was a simpler reasoningthe logic by which the world is kept going onward and upward when philosophers are at odds and reformers are not forthcoming
She knew that for every child she taught to read and write she opened if ever so little the door of opportunity and she was happy in the consciousness of performing a duty which seemed all the more imperative because newly discovered
Her zeal indeed for the time being was like that of an early Christian who was more willing than not to die for his faith
Rena had fully and firmly made up her mind to sacrifice her life upon this altar
Her absorption in the work had not been without its reward for thereby she had been able to keep at a distance the spectre of her lost love
Her dreams she could not control but she banished Tryon as far as possible from her waking thoughts
When Wains attentions became obviously personal Renas new vestal instinct took alarm and she began to apprehend his character more clearly
She had long ago learned that his pretensions to wealth were a sham
He was nominal owner of a large plantation it is true but the land was worn out and mortgaged to the limit of its security value
His reputed droves of cattle and hogs had dwindled to a mere handful of lean and listless brutes
Her clear eye when once set to take Wains measure soon fathomed his shallow selfish soul and detected or at least divined behind his mask of goodnature a lurking brutality which filled her with vague distrust needing only occasion to develop it into active apprehensionoccasion which was not long wanting
She avoided being alone with him at home by keeping carefully with the women of the house
If she were left aloneand they soon showed a tendency to leave her on any pretext whenever Wain came nearshe would seek her own room and lock the door
She preferred not to offend Wain she was far away from home and in a measure in his power but she dreaded his compliments and sickened at his smile
She was also compelled to hear his relations sing his praises
My son Jeff old Mrs Wain would say is de bes man you ever seed
His fus wife had de easies time an de happies time er ary woman in dis settlement
Hes grieve fer her a long time but I reckon hes gittin over it an de nex oman wat marries himll git a box er pyo gol ef I does say it as is his own mammy
Rena had thought Wain rather harsh with his household except in her immediate presence
His mother and sister seemed more or less afraid of him and the children often anxious to avoid him
One day he timed his visit to the schoolhouse so as to walk home with Rena through the woods
When she became aware of his purpose she called to one of the children who was loitering behind the others Wait a minute Jenny
Im going your way and you can walk along with me
Wain with difficulty hid a scowl behind a smiling front
When they had gone a little distance along the road through the woods he clapped his hand upon his pocket
I declare ter goodness he exclaimed ef I aint dropped my pocketknife
I thought I felt somethin slip though dat hole in my pocket jes by the big pine stump in the schoolhouse yad
Jinny chile run back an hunt fer my knife an Ill give yer five cents ef yer find it
Me an Miss Renall walk on slow tel you ketches us
Rena did not dare to object though she was afraid to be alone with this man
If she could have had a moment to think she would have volunteered to go back with Jenny and look for the knife which although a palpable subterfuge on her part would have been one to which Wain could not object but the child dazzled by the prospect of reward had darted back so quickly that this way of escape was cut off
She was evidently in for a declaration of love which she had taken infinite pains to avoid
Just the form it would assume she could not foresee
She was not long left in suspense
No sooner was the child well out of sight than Wain threw his arms suddenly about her waist and smilingly attempted to kiss her
Speechless with fear and indignation she tore herself from his grasp with totally unexpected force and fled incontinently along the forest path
Wainwho to do him justice had merely meant to declare his passion in what he had hoped might prove a not unacceptable fashionfollowed in some alarm expostulating and apologizing as he went
But he was heavy and Rena was light and fear lent wings to her feet
He followed her until he saw her enter the house of Elder Johnson the father of several of her pupils after which he sneaked uneasily homeward somewhat apprehensive of the consequences of his abrupt wooing which was evidently open to an unfavorable construction
When an hour later Rena sent one of the Johnson children for some of her things with a message explaining that the teacher had been invited to spend a few days at Elder Johnsons Wain felt a pronounced measure of relief
For an hour he had even thought it might be better to relinquish his pursuit
With a fatuousness born of vanity however no sooner had she sent her excuse than he began to look upon her visit to Johnsons as a mere exhibition of coyness which together with her conduct in the woods was merely intended to lure him on
Right upon the heels of the perturbation caused by Wains conduct Rena discovered that Tryon lived in the neighborhood that not only might she meet him any day upon the highway but that he had actually driven by the schoolhouse
That he knew or would know of her proximity there could be no possible doubt since she had freely told his mother her name and her home
A hot wave of shame swept over her at the thought that George Tryon might imagine she were following him throwing herself in his way and at the thought of the construction which he might place upon her actions
Caught thus between two emotional fires at the very time when her school duties owing to the approaching exhibition demanded all her energies Rena was subjected to a physical and mental strain that only youth and health could have resisted and then only for a short time
XXIX PLATO EARNS HALF A DOLLAR Tryons first feeling when his mother at the dinnertable gave an account of her visit to the schoolhouse in the woods was one of extreme annoyance
Why of all created beings should this particular woman be chosen to teach the colored school at Sandy Run
Had she learned that he lived in the neighborhood and had she sought the place hoping that he might consent to renew on different terms relations which could never be resumed upon their former footing
Six weeks before he would not have believed her capable of following him but his last visit to Patesville had revealed her character in such a light that it was difficult to predict what she might do
It was however no affair of his
He was done with her he had dismissed her from his own life where she had never properly belonged and he had filled her place or would soon fill it with another and worthier woman
Even his mother a woman of keen discernment and delicate intuitions had been deceived by this girls specious exterior
She had brought away from her interview of the morning the impression that Rena was a fine pure spirit born out of place through some freak of Fate devoting herself with heroic selfsacrifice to a noble cause
Well he had imagined her just as pure and fine and she had deliberately with a negros low cunning deceived him into believing that she was a white girl
The pretended confession of the brother in which he had spoken of the humble origin of the family had been consciously or unconsciously the most disingenuous feature of the whole miserable performance
They had tried by a show of frankness to satisfy their own consciencesthey doubtless had enough of white blood to give them a rudimentary trace of such a moral organand by the same act to disarm him against future recriminations in the event of possible discovery
How was he to imagine that persons of their appearance and pretensions were tainted with negro blood
The more he dwelt upon the subject the more angry he became with those who had surprised his virgin heart and deflowered it by such low trickery
The man who brought the first negro into the British colonies had committed a crime against humanity and a worse crime against his own race
The father of this girl had been guilty of a sin against society for which othersfor which he George Tryon must pay the penalty
As slaves negroes were tolerable
As freemen they were an excrescence an alien element incapable of absorption into the body politic of white men
He would like to send them all back to the Africa from which their forefathers had comeunwillingly enough he would admit and he would like especially to banish this girl from his own neighborhood not indeed that her presence would make any difference to him except as a humiliating reminder of his own folly and weakness with which he could very well dispense
Of this state of mind Tryon gave no visible manifestation beyond a certain taciturnity so much at variance with his recent liveliness that the ladies could not fail to notice it
No effort upon the part of either was able to affect his mood and they both resigned themselves to await his lordships pleasure to be companionable
For a day or two Tryon sedulously kept away from the neighborhood of the schoolhouse at Sandy Rim
He really had business which would have taken him in that direction but made a detour of five miles rather than go near his abandoned and discredited sweetheart
But George Tryon was wisely distrustful of his own impulses
Driving one day along the road to Clinton he overhauled a diminutive black figure trudging along the road occasionally turning a handspring by way of diversion
Hello Plato called Tryon do you want a lift
Hoddy Mars Geoge
Kin I ride wid you
Jump up
Plato mounted into the buggy with the agility to be expected from a lad of his acrobatic accomplishments
The two almost immediately fell into conversation upon perhaps the only subject of common interest between them
Before the town was reached Tryon knew so far as Plato could make it plain the estimation in which the teacher was held by pupils and parents
He had learned the hours of opening and dismissal of the school where the teacher lived her habits of coming to and going from the schoolhouse and the road she always followed
Does she go to church or anywhere else with Jeff Wain Plato
asked Tryon
No suh she don go nowhar wid nobody excepn ole Elder Johnson er Mis Johnson an de childen
She use ter stop at Mis Wains but shes stayin wid Elder Johnson now
She alluz makes some er de childen go home wid er fm school said Plato proud to find in Mars Geoge an appreciative listenersometimes one an sometimes anudder
Is ben home wid er twice ann itll be my tun agin befo long
Plato remarked Tryon impressively as they drove into the town do you think you could keep a secret
Yas Mars Geoge ef you says I shill
Do you see this fiftycent piece
Tryon displayed a small piece of paper money crisp and green in its newness
Yas Mars Geoge replied Plato fixing his eyes respectfully on the governments promise to pay
Fifty cents was a large sum of money
His acquaintance with Mars Geoge gave him the privilege of looking at money
When he grew up he would be able in good times to earn fifty cents a day
I am going to give this to you Plato
Platos eyes opened wide as saucers
Me Mars Geoge
he asked in amazement
Yes Plato
Im going to write a letter while Im in town and want you to take it
Meet me here in half an hour and Ill give you the letter
Meantime keep your mouth shut
Yas Mars Geoge replied Plato with a grin that distended that organ unduly
That he did not keep it shut may be inferred from the fact that within the next half hour he had eaten and drunk fifty cents worth of candy gingerpop and other available delicacies that appealed to the youthful palate
Having nothing more to spend and the high prices prevailing for some time after the war having left him capable of locomotion Plato was promptly on hand at the appointed time and place
Tryon placed a letter in Platos hand still sticky with molasses candyhe had inclosed it in a second cover by way of protection
Give that letter he said to your teacher dont say a word about it to a living soul bring me an answer and give it into my own hand and you shall have another half dollar
Tryon was quite aware that by a surreptitious correspondence he ran some risk of compromising Rena
But he had felt as soon as he had indulged his first opportunity to talk of her an irresistible impulse to see her and speak to her again
He could scarcely call at her boardingplace what possible proper excuse could a young white man have for visiting a colored woman
At the schoolhouse she would be surrounded by her pupils and a private interview would be as difficult with more eyes to remark and more tongues to comment upon it
He might address her by mail but did not know how often she sent to the nearest postoffice
A letter mailed in the town must pass through the hands of a postmaster notoriously inquisitive and evilminded who was familiar with Tryons handwriting and had ample time to attend to other peoples business
To meet the teacher alone on the road seemed scarcely feasible according to Platos statement
A messenger then was not only the least of several evils but really the only practicable way to communicate with Rena
He thought he could trust Plato though miserably aware that he could not trust himself where this girl was concerned
The letter handed by Tryon to Plato and by the latter delivered with due secrecy and precaution ran as follows DEAR MISS WARWICKYou may think it strange that I should address you after what has passed between us but learning from my mother of your presence in the neighborhood I am constrained to believe that you do not find my proximity embarrassing and I cannot resist the wish to meet you at least once more and talk over the circumstances of our former friendship
From a practical point of view this may seem superfluous as the matter has been definitely settled
I have no desire to find fault with you on the contrary I wish to set myself right with regard to my own actions and to assure you of my good wishes
In other words since we must part I would rather we parted friends than enemies
If nature and society or Fate to put it another wayhave decreed that we cannot live together it is nevertheless possible that we may carry into the future a pleasant though somewhat sad memory of a past friendship
Will you not grant me one interview
I appreciate the difficulty of arranging it I have found it almost as hard to communicate with you by letter
I will suit myself to your convenience and meet you at any time and place you may designate
Please answer by bearer who I think is trustworthy and believe me whatever your answer may be Respectfully yours G T The next day but one Tryon received through the mail the following reply to his letter GEORGE TRYON ESQ
Dear SirI have requested your messenger to say that I will answer your letter by mail which I shall now proceed to do
I assure you that I was entirely ignorant of your residence in this neighborhood or it would have been the last place on earth in which I should have set foot
As to our past relations they were ended by your own act
I frankly confess that I deceived you I have paid the penalty and have no complaint to make
I appreciate the delicacy which has made you respect my brothers secret and thank you for it
I remember the whole affair with shame and humiliation and would willingly forget it
As to a future interview I do not see what good it would do either of us
You are white and you have given me to understand that I am black
I accept the classification however unfair and the consequences however unjust one of which is that we cannot meet in the same parlor in the same church at the same table or anywhere in social intercourse upon a steamboat we would not sit at the same table we could not walk together on the street or meet publicly anywhere and converse without unkind remark
As a white man this might not mean a great deal to you as a woman shut out already by my color from much that is desirable my good name remains my most valuable possession
I beg of you to let me alone
The best possible proof you can give me of your good wishes is to relinquish any desire or attempt to see me
I shall have finished my work here in a few days
I have other troubles of which you know nothing and any meeting with you would only add to a burden which is already as much as I can bear
To speak of parting is superfluous we have already parted
It were idle to dream of a future friendship between people so widely different in station
Such a friendship if possible in itself would never be tolerated by the lady whom you are to marry with whom you drove by my schoolhouse the other day
A gentleman so loyal to his race and its traditions as you have shown yourself could not be less faithful to the lady to whom he has lost his heart and his memory in three short months
No Mr Tryon our romance is ended and better so
We could never have been happy
I have found a work in which I may be of service to others who have fewer opportunities than mine have been
Leave me in peace I beseech you and I shall soon pass out of your neighborhood as I have passed out of your life and hope to pass out of your memory
Yours very truly ROWENA WALDEN
XXX AN UNUSUAL HONOR To Renas highstrung and sensitive nature already under very great tension from her past experience the ordeal of the next few days was a severe one
On the one hand Jeff Wains infatuation had rapidly increased in view of her speedy departure
From Mrs Tryons remark about Wains wife Amanda and from things Rena had since learned she had every reason to believe that this wife was living and that Wain must be aware of the fact
In the light of this knowledge Wains former conduct took on a blacker significance than upon reflection she had charitably clothed it with after the first flush of indignation
That he had not given up his design to make love to her was quite apparent and with Amanda alive his attentions always offensive since she had gathered their import became in her eyes the expression of a villainous purpose of which she could not speak to others and from which she felt safe only so long as she took proper precautions against it
In a week her school would be over and then she would get Elder Johnson or some one else than Wain to take her back to Patesville
True she might abandon her school and go at once but her work would be incomplete she would have violated her contract she would lose her salary for the month explanations would be necessary and would not be forthcoming
She might feign sicknessindeed it would scarcely be feigning for she felt far from well she had never since her illness quite recovered her former vigorbut the inconvenience to others would be the same and her selfsacrifice would have had at its very first trial a lame and impotent conclusion
She had as yet no fear of personal violence from Wain but under the circumstances his attentions were an insult
He was evidently bent upon conquest and vain enough to think he might achieve it by virtue of his personal attractions
If he could have understood how she loathed the sight of his narrow eyes with their puffy lids his thick tobaccostained lips his doubtful teeth and his unwieldy person Wain a monument of conceit that he was might have shrunk even in his own estimation to something like his real proportions
Rena believed that to defend herself from persecution at his hands it was only necessary that she never let him find her alone
This however required constant watchfulness
Relying upon his own powers and upon a womans weakness and aversion to scandal from which not even the purest may always escape unscathed and convinced by her former silence that he had nothing serious to fear Wain made it a point to be present at every public place where she might be
He assumed in conversation with her which she could not avoid and stated to others that she had left his house because of a previous promise to divide the time of her stay between Elder Johnsons house and his own
He volunteered to teach a class in the Sundayschool which Rena conducted at the colored Methodist church and when she remained to service occupied a seat conspicuously near her own
In addition to these public demonstrations which it was impossible to escape or it seemed with so thick skinned an individual as Wain even to discourage she was secretly and uncomfortably conscious that she could scarcely stir abroad without the risk of encountering one of two men each of whom was on the lookout for an opportunity to find her alone
The knowledge of Tryons presence in the vicinity had been almost as much as Rena could bear
To it must be added the consciousness that he too was pursuing her to what end she could not tell
After his letter to her brother and the feeling therein displayed she found it necessary to crush once or twice a wild hope that her secret being still unknown save to a friendly few he might return and claim her
Now such an outcome would be impossible
He had become engaged to another womanthis in itself would be enough to keep him from her if it were not an index of a vastly more serious barrier a proof that he had never loved her
If he had loved her truly he would never have forgotten her in three short monthsthree long months they had heretofore seemed to her for in them she had lived a lifetime of experience
Another impassable barrier lay in the fact that his mother had met her and that she was known in the neighborhood
Thus cut off from any hope that she might be anything to him she had no wish to meet her former lover no possible good could come of such a meeting and yet her fluttering heart told her that if he should come as his letter foreshadowed that he mightif he should come the loving George of old with soft words and tender smiles and specious talk of friendshipah
then her heart would break
She must not meet himat any cost she must avoid him
But this heaping up of cares strained her endurance to the breakingpoint
Toward the middle of the last week she knew that she had almost reached the limit and was haunted by a fear that she might break down before the week was over
Now her really fine nature rose to the emergency though she mustered her forces with a great effort
If she could keep Wain at his distance and avoid Tryon for three days longer her school labors would be ended and she might retire in peace and honor
Miss Rena said Plato to her on Tuesday aint it bout time I wuz gwine home wid you agin
You may go with me tomorrow Plato answered the teacher
After school Plato met an anxious eyed young man in the woods a short distance from the schoolhouse
Well Plato what news
Is gwine ter see her home termorrer Mars Geoge
Tomorrow
replied Tryon how very fortunate
I wanted you to go to town tomorrow to take an important message for me
Im sorry Platoyou might have earned another dollar
To lie is a disgraceful thing and yet there are times when to a lovers mind love dwarfs all ordinary laws
Plato scratched his head disconsolately but suddenly a bright thought struck him
Cant I go ter town fer you atter Ive seed her home Mars Geoge
No Im afraid it would be too late returned Tryon doubtfully
Den Ill haf ter ax er ter lemme go nex day said Plato with resignation
The honor might be postponed or if necessary foregone the opportunity to earn a dollar was the chance of a lifetime and must not be allowed to slip
No Plato rejoined Tryon shaking his head I shouldnt want to deprive you of so great a pleasure
Tryon was entirely sincere in this characterization of Platos chance he would have given many a dollar to be sure of Platos place and Platos welcome
Renas letter had reinflamed his smouldering passion only opposition was needed to fan it to a white heat
Wherein lay the great superiority of his position if he was denied the right to speak to the one person in the world whom he most cared to address
He felt some dim realization of the tyranny of caste when he found it not merely pressing upon an inferior people who had no right to expect anything better but barring his own way to something that he desired
He meant her no harmbut he must see her
He could never marry her nowbut he must see her
He was conscious of a certain relief at the thought that he had not asked Blanche Leary to be his wife
His hand was unpledged
He could not marry the other girl of course but they must meet again
The rest he would leave to Fate which seemed reluctant to disentangle threads which it had woven so closely
I think Plato that I see an easier way out of the difficulty
Your teacher I imagine merely wants some one to see her safely home
Dont you think if you should go part of the way that I might take your place for the rest while you did my errand
Why sholy Mars Geoge you could take keer er her better n I couldbetter n anybody could cose you could
Mars Geoge was white and rich and could do anything
Plato was proud of the fact that he had once belonged to Mars Geoge
He could not conceive of any one so powerful as Mars Geoge unless it might be God of whom Plato had heard more or less and even here the comparison might not be quite fair to Mars Geoge for Mars Geoge was the younger of the two
It would undoubtedly be a great honor for the teacher to be escorted home by Mars Geoge
The teacher was a great woman no doubt and looked white but Mars Geoge was the real article
Mars Geoge had never been known to go with a black woman before and the teacher would doubtless thank Plato for arranging that so great an honor should fall upon her
Mars Geoge had given him fifty cents twice and would now give him a dollar
Noble Mars Geoge
Fortunate teacher
Happy Plato
Very well Plato
I think we can arrange it so that you can kill the two rabbits at one shot
Suppose that we go over the road that she will take to go home
They soon arrived at the schoolhouse
School had been out an hour and the clearing was deserted
Plato led the way by the road through the woods to a point where amid somewhat thick underbrush another path intersected the road they were following
Now Plato said Tryon pausing here this would be a good spot for you to leave the teacher and for me to take your place
This path leads to the main road and will take you to town very quickly
I shouldnt say anything to the teacher about it at all but when you and she get here drop behind and run along this path until you meet meIll be waiting a few yards down the roadand then run to town as fast as your legs will carry you
As soon as you are gone Ill come out and tell the teacher that Ive sent you away on an errand and will myself take your place
You shall have a dollar and Ill ask her to let you go home with her the next day
But you mustnt say a word about it Plato or you wont get the dollar and Ill not ask the teacher to let you go home with her again
All right Mars Geoge I aint gwine ter say no mo dn ef de cat had my tongue
XXXI IN DEEP WATERS Rena was unusually fatigued at the close of her school on Wednesday afternoon
She had been troubled all day with a headache which beginning with a dull pain had gradually increased in intensity until every nerve was throbbing like a trip hammer
The pupils seemed unusually stupid
A discouraging sense of the insignificance of any part she could perform towards the education of three million people with a school term of two months a year hung over her spirit like a pall
As the object of Wains attentions she had begun to feel somewhat like a wild creature who hears the pursuers on its track and has the fear of capture added to the fatigue of flight
But when this excitement had gone too far and had neared the limit of exhaustion came Tryons letter with the resulting surprise and consternation
Rena had keyed herself up to a heroic pitch to answer it but when the inevitable reaction came she was overwhelmed with a sickening sense of her own weakness
The things which in another sphere had constituted her strength and shield were now her undoing and exposed her to dangers from which they lent her no protection
Not only was this her position in theory but the pursuers were already at her heels
As the day wore on these dark thoughts took on an added gloom until when the hour to dismiss school arrived she felt as though she had not a friend in the world
This feeling was accentuated by a letter which she had that morning received from her mother in which Mis Molly spoke very highly of Wain and plainly expressed the hope that her daughter might like him so well that she would prefer to remain in Sampson County
Plato brighteyed and alert was waiting in the schoolyard until the teacher should be ready to start
Having warned away several smaller children who had hung around after school as though to share his prerogative of accompanying the teacher Plato had swung himself into the low branches of an oak at the edge of the clearing from which he was hanging by his legs head downward
He dropped from this reposeful attitude when the teacher appeared at the door and took his place at her side
A premonition of impending trouble caused the teacher to hesitate
She wished that she had kept more of the pupils behind
Something whispered that danger lurked in the road she customarily followed
Plato seemed insignificantly small and weak and she felt miserably unable to cope with any difficult or untoward situation
Plato she suggested I think well go round the other way tonight if you dont mind
Visions of Mars Geoge disappointed of a dollar unearned and unspent flitted through the narrow brain which some one with the irony of ignorance or of knowledge had mocked with the name of a great philosopher
Plato was not an untruthful lad but he seldom had the opportunity to earn a dollar
His imagination spurred on by the instinct of selfinterest rose to the emergency
Is feared you mought git snakebit gwine roun dat way Miss Rena
My brer Jim killt a watermoccasin down dere yistiddy bout ten feet long
Rena had a horror of snakes with which the swamp by which the other road ran was infested
Snakes were a vivid reality her presentiment was probably a mere depression of spirits due to her condition of nervous exhaustion
A cloud had come up and threatened rain and the wind was rising ominously
The old way was the shorter she wanted above all things to get to Elder Johnsons and go to bed
Perhaps sleep would rest her tired brainshe could not imagine herself feeling worse unless she should break down altogether
She plunged into the path and hastened forward so as to reach home before the approaching storm
So completely was she absorbed in her own thoughts that she scarcely noticed that Plato himself seemed preoccupied
Instead of capering along like a playful kitten or puppy he walked by her side unusually silent
When they had gone a short distance and were approaching a path which intersected their road at something near a right angle the teacher missed Plato
He had dropped behind a moment before now he had disappeared entirely
Her vague alarm of a few moments before returned with redoubled force
Plato
she called Plato
There was no response save the soughing of the wind through the swaying treetops
She stepped hastily forward wondering if this were some childish prank
If so it was badly timed and she would let Plato feel the weight of her displeasure
Her forward step had brought her to the junction of the two paths where she paused doubtfully
The route she had been following was the most direct way home but led for quite a distance through the forest which she did not care to traverse alone
The intersecting path would soon take her to the main road where she might find shelter or company or both
Glancing around again in search of her missing escort she became aware that a man was approaching her from each of the two paths
In one she recognized the eager and excited face of George Tryon flushed with anticipation of their meeting and yet grave with uncertainty of his reception
Advancing confidently along the other path she saw the face of Jeff Wain drawn as she imagined in her anguish with evil passions which would stop at nothing
What should she do
There was no sign of Platofor aught she could see or hear of him the earth might have swallowed him up
Some deadly serpent might have stung him
Some wandering rabbit might have tempted him aside
Another thought struck her
Plato had been very quietthere had been something on his conscienceperhaps he had betrayed her
But to which of the two men and to what end
The problem was too much for her overwrought brain
She turned and fled
A wiser instinct might have led her forward
In the two conflicting dangers she might have found safety
The road after all was a public way
Any number of persons might meet there accidentally
But she saw only the darker side of the situation
To turn to Tryon for protection before Wain had by some overt act manifested the evil purpose which she as yet only suspected would be she imagined to acknowledge a previous secret acquaintance with Tryon thus placing her reputation at Wains mercy and to charge herself with a burden of obligation toward a man whom she wished to avoid and had refused to meet
If on the other hand she should go forward to meet Wain he would undoubtedly offer to accompany her homeward
Tryon would inevitably observe the meeting and suppose it prearranged
Not for the world would she have him think sowhy she should care for his opinion she did not stop to argue
She turned and fled and to avoid possible pursuit struck into the underbrush at an angle which she calculated would bring her in a few rods to another path which would lead quickly into the main road
She had run only a few yards when she found herself in the midst of a clump of prickly shrubs and briars
Meantime the storm had burst the rain fell in torrents
Extricating herself from the thorns she pressed forward but instead of coming out upon the road found herself penetrating deeper and deeper into the forest
The storm increased in violence
The air grew darker and darker
It was near evening the clouds were dense the thick woods increased the gloom
Suddenly a blinding flash of lightning pierced the darkness followed by a sharp clap of thunder
There was a crash of falling timber
Terrorstricken Rena flew forward through the forest the underbrush growing closer and closer as she advanced
Suddenly the earth gave way beneath her feet and she sank into a concealed morass
By clasping the trunk of a neighboring sapling she extricated herself with an effort and realized with a horrible certainty that she was lost in the swamp
Turning she tried to retrace her steps
A flash of lightning penetrated the gloom around her and barring her path she saw a huge black snake harmless enough in fact but to her excited imagination frightful in appearance
With a wild shriek she turned again staggered forward a few yards stumbled over a projecting root and fell heavily to the earth
When Rena had disappeared in the underbrush Tryon and Wain had each instinctively set out in pursuit of her but owing to the gathering darkness the noise of the storm and the thickness of the underbrush they missed not only Rena but each other and neither was aware of the others presence in the forest
Wain kept up the chase until the rain drove him to shelter
Tryon after a few minutes realized that she had fled to escape him and that to pursue her would be to defeat rather than promote his purpose
He desisted therefore and returning to the main road stationed himself at a point where he could watch Elder Johnsons house and having waited for a while without any signs of Rena concluded that she had taken refuge in some friendly cabin
Turning homeward disconsolately as night came on he intercepted Plato on his way back from town and pledged him to inviolable secrecy so effectually that Plato when subsequently questioned merely answered that he had stopped a moment to gather some chinquapins and when he had looked around the teacher was gone
Rena not appearing at suppertime nor for an hour later the elder somewhat anxious made inquiries about the neighborhood and finding his guest at no place where she might be expected to stop became somewhat alarmed
Wains house was the last to which he went
He had surmised that there was some mystery connected with her leaving Wains but had never been given any definite information about the matter
In response to his inquiries Wain expressed surprise but betrayed a certain selfconsciousness which did not escape the elders eye
Returning home he organized a search party from his own family and several near neighbors and set out with dogs and torches to scour the woods for the missing teacher
A couple of hours later they found her lying unconscious in the edge of the swamp only a few rods from a welldefined path which would soon have led her to the open highway
Strong arms lifted her gently and bore her home
Mrs Johnson undressed her and put her to bed administering a homely remedy of which whiskey was the principal ingredient to counteract the effects of the exposure
There was a doctor within five miles but no one thought of sending for him nor was it at all likely that it would have been possible to get him for such a case at such an hour
Renas illness however was more deeply seated than her friends could imagine
A tired body in sympathy with an overwrought brain had left her peculiarly susceptible to the nervous shock of her forest experience
The exposure for several hours in her wet clothing to the damps and miasma of the swamp had brought on an attack of brain fever
The next morning she was delirious
One of the children took word to the schoolhouse that the teacher was sick and there would be no school that day
A number of curious and sympathetic people came in from time to time and suggested various remedies several of which old Mrs Johnson with catholic impartiality administered to the helpless teacher who from delirium gradually sunk into a heavy stupor scarcely distinguishable from sleep
It was predicted that she would probably be well in the morning if not it would then be time to consider seriously the question of sending for a doctor
XXXII THE POWER OF LOVE After Tryons failure to obtain an interview with Rena through Platos connivance he decided upon a different course of procedure
In a few days her school term would be finished
He was not less desirous to see her was indeed as much more eager as opposition would be likely to make a very young man who was accustomed to having his own way and whose heart as he had discovered was more deeply and permanently involved than he had imagined
His present plan was to wait until the end of the school then when Rena went to Clinton on the Saturday or Monday to draw her salary for the month he would see her in the town or if necessary would follow her to Patesville
No power on earth should keep him from her long but he had no desire to interfere in any way with the duty which she owed to others
When the school was over and her work completed then he would have his innings
Writing letters was too unsatisfactory a method of communicationhe must see her face to face
The first of his three days of waiting had passed when about ten oclock on the morning of the second day which seemed very long in prospect while driving along the road toward Clinton he met Plato with a rabbit trap in his hand
Well Plato he asked why are you absent from the classic shades of the academy today
Hoddy Mars Geoge
Wat wuz dat you say
Why are you not at school today
Ain got no teacher Mars Geoge
Teachers gone
Gone
exclaimed Tryon with a sudden leap of the heart
Gone where
What do you mean
Teacher got los in de swamp night befo las cause Plato want dere ter show her de way outn de woods
Elder Johnson foun er wid dawgs and tawches an fotch her home an put her ter bed
No school yistiddy
She wuz outn her haid las night an dis mawnin she wuz gone
Gone where
Dey don nobody know whar suh
Leaving Plato abruptly Tryon hastened down the road toward Elder Johnsons cabin
This was no time to stand on punctilio
The girl had been lost in the woods in the storm amid the thunder and lightning and the pouring rain
She was sick with fright and exposure and he was the cause of it all
Bribery corruption and falsehood had brought punishment in their train and the innocent had suffered while the guilty escaped
He must learn at once what had become of her
Reaching Elder Johnsons house he drew up by the front fence and gave the customary halloa which summoned a woman to the door
Goodmorning he said nodding unconsciously with the careless politeness of a gentleman to his inferiors
Im Mr Tryon
I have come to inquire about the sick teacher
Why suh the woman replied respectfully she got los in de woods night befo las an she wuz outn her min most er de time yistiddy
Las night she must a got out er bed an run away wen eveybody wuz soun asleep fer dis mawnin she wuz gone an none er us knows whar she is
Has any search been made for her
Yas suh my husban an de childen has been huntin roun all de mawnin an hes gone ter borry a hoss now ter go futher
But Lawd knows dey ain no tellin whar shed go lessn she got her min back sence she lef
Tryons mare was in good condition
He had money in his pocket and nothing to interfere with his movements
He set out immediately on the road to Patesville keeping a lookout by the roadside and stopping each person he met to inquire if a young woman apparently ill had been seen traveling along the road on foot
No one had met such a traveler
When he had gone two or three miles he drove through a shallow branch that crossed the road
The splashing of his horses hoofs in the water prevented him from hearing a low groan that came from the woods by the roadside
He drove on making inquiries at each farmhouse and of every person whom he encountered
Shortly after crossing the branch he met a young negro with a cartload of tubs and buckets and piggins and asked him if he had seen on the road a young white woman with dark eyes and hair apparently sick or demented
The young man answered in the negative and Tryon pushed forward anxiously
At noon he stopped at a farmhouse and swallowed a hasty meal
His inquiries here elicited no information and he was just leaving when a young man came in late to dinner and stated in response to the usual question that he had met some two hours before a young woman who answered Tryons description on the Lillington road which crossed the main road to Patesville a short distance beyond the farmhouse
He had spoken to the woman
At first she had paid no heed to his question
When addressed a second time she had answered in a rambling and disconnected way which indicated to his mind that there was something wrong with her
Tryon thanked his informant and hastened to the Lillington road
Stopping as before to inquire he followed the woman for several hours each mile of the distance taking him farther away from Patesville
From time to time he heard of the woman
Toward nightfall he found her
She was white enough with the sallowness of the sandhill poor white
She was still young perhaps but poverty and a hard life made her look older than she ought
She was not fair and she was not Rena
When Tryon came up to her she was sitting on the doorsill of a miserable cabin and held in her hand a bottle the contents of which had never paid any revenue tax
She had walked twenty miles that day and had beguiled the tedium of the journey by occasional potations which probably accounted for the incoherency of speech which several of those who met her had observed
When Tryon drew near she tendered him the bottle with tipsy cordiality
He turned in disgust and retraced his steps to the Patesville road which he did not reach until nightfall
As it was too dark to prosecute the search with any chance of success he secured lodging for the night intending to resume his quest early in the morning
XXXIII A MULE AND A CART Frank Fowlers heart was filled with longing for a sight of Renas face
When she had gone away first on the illfated trip to South Carolina her absence had left an aching void in his life he had missed her cheerful smile her pleasant words her graceful figure moving about across the narrow street
His work had grown monotonous during her absence the clatter of hammer and mallet that had seemed so merry when punctuated now and then by the strains of her voice became a mere humdrum rapping of wood upon wood and iron upon iron
He had sought work in South Carolina with the hope that be might see her
He had satisfied this hope and had tried in vain to do her a service but Fate had been against her her castle of cards had come tumbling down
He felt that her sorrow had brought her nearer to him
The distance between them depended very much upon their way of looking at things
He knew that her experience had dragged her through the valley of humiliation
His unselfish devotion had reacted to refine and elevate his own spirit
When he heard the suggestion after her second departure that she might marry Wain he could not but compare himself with this new aspirant
He Frank was a man an honest mana better man than the shifty scoundrel with whom she had ridden away
She was but a woman the best and sweetest and loveliest of all women but yet a woman
After a few short years of happiness or sorrow little of joy perhaps and much of sadness which had begun alreadythey would both be food for worms
White people with a deeper wisdom perhaps than they used in their own case regarded Rena and himself as very much alike
They were certainly both made by the same God in much the same physical and mental mould they breathed the same air ate the same food spoke the same speech loved and hated laughed and cried lived and would die the same
If God had meant to rear any impassable barrier between people of contrasting complexions why did He not express the prohibition as He had done between other orders of creation
When Rena had departed for Sampson County Frank had reconciled himself to her absence by the hope of her speedy return
He often stepped across the street to talk to Mis Molly about her
Several letters had passed between mother and daughter and in response to Franks inquiries his neighbor uniformly stated that Rena was well and doing well and sent her love to all inquiring friends
But Frank observed that Mis Molly when pressed as to the date of Renas return grew more and more indefinite and finally the mother in a burst of confidential friendship told Frank of all her hopes with reference to the stranger from down the country
Yas Frank she concluded itll be her own fault ef she dont become a lady of proputty fer Mr Wain is rich an owns a big plantation an hires a lot of hands and is a big man in the county
Hes crazy to git her an it all lays in her own hans
Frank did not find this news reassuring
He believed that Wain was a liar and a scoundrel
He had nothing more than his intuitions upon which to found this belief but it was none the less firm
If his estimate of the mans character were correct then his wealth might be a fiction pure and simple
If so the truth should be known to Mis Molly so that instead of encouraging a marriage with Wain she would see him in his true light and interpose to rescue her daughter from his importunities
A day or two after this conversation Frank met in the town a negro from Sampson County made his acquaintance and inquired if he knew a man by the name of Jeff Wain
Oh Jeff Wain
returned the countryman slightingly yas I knows im an don know no good of im
One er dese yer biggity braggin niggerstalks lack he own de whole county an aint wuth no mo dn I isjes a big bladder wid a handful er shot rattlin roun in it
Had a wife when I wuz dere an beat her an bused her so she had ter run away
This was alarming information
Wain had passed in the town as a single man and Frank had had no hint that he had ever been married
There was something wrong somewhere
Frank determined that he would find out the truth and if possible do something to protect Rena against the obviously evil designs of the man who had taken her away
The barrel factory had so affected the coopers trade that Peter and Frank had turned their attention more or less to the manufacture of small woodenware for domestic use
Franks mule was eating off its own head as the saying goes
It required but little effort to persuade Peter that his son might take a load of buckets and tubs and piggins into the country and sell them or trade them for country produce at a profit
In a few days Frank had his stock prepared and set out on the road to Sampson County
He went about thirty miles the first day and camped by the roadside for the night resuming the journey at dawn
After driving for an hour through the tall pines that overhung the road like the stately arch of a cathedral aisle weaving a carpet for the earth with their brown spines and cones and soothing the ear with their ceaseless murmur Frank stopped to water his mule at a point where the white sandy road widening as it went sloped downward to a clearrunning branch
On the right a baytree bending over the stream mingled the heavy odor of its flowers with the delicate perfume of a yellow jessamine vine that had overrun a clump of saplings on the left
From a neighboring tree a silverthroated mockingbird poured out a flood of riotous melody
A group of minnows startled by the splashing of the mules feet darted away into the shadow of the thicket their quick passage leaving the amber water filled with laughing light
The mule drank long and lazily while over Frank stole thoughts in harmony with the peaceful scenethoughts of Rena young and beautiful her friendly smile her pensive dark eyes
He would soon see her now and if she had any cause for fear or unhappiness he would place himself at her servicefor a day a week a month a year a lifetime if need be
His reverie was broken by a slight noise from the thicket at his left
I wonder who dat is
he muttered
It souns mighty quare ter say de leas
He listened intently for a moment but heard nothing further
It must a ben a rabbit er somethin scampin though de woods
Glong dere Caesar
As the mule stepped forward the sound was repeated
This time it was distinctly audible the long low moan of some one in sickness or distress
Dat aint no rabbit said Frank to himself
Deres somethin wrong dere
Stan here Caesar till I look inter dis matter
Pulling out from the branch Frank sprang from the saddle and pushed his way cautiously through the outer edge of the thicket
Good Lawd
he exclaimed with a start its a womana wite woman
The slender form of a young woman lay stretched upon the ground in a small open space a few yards in extent
Her face was turned away and Frank could see at first only a tangled mass of dark brown hair matted with twigs and leaves and cockleburs and hanging in wild profusion around her neck
Frank stood for a moment irresolute debating the serious question whether he should investigate further with a view to rendering assistance or whether he should put as great a distance as possible between himself and this victim as she might easily be of some violent crime lest he should himself be suspected of ita not unlikely contingency if he were found in the neighborhood and the woman should prove unable to describe her assailant
While he hesitated the figure moved restlessly and a voice murmured Mamma oh mamma
The voice thrilled Frank like an electric shock
Trembling in every limb he sprang forward toward the prostrate figure
The woman turned her head and he saw that it was Rena
Her gown was torn and dusty and fringed with burs and briars
When she had wandered forth half delirious pursued by imaginary foes she had not stopped to put on her shoes and her little feet were blistered and swollen and bleeding
Frank knelt by her side and lifted her head on his arm
He put his hand upon her brow it was burning with fever
Miss Rena
Rena
dont you know me
She turned her wild eyes on him suddenly
Yes I know you Jeff Wain
Go away from me
Go away
Her voice rose to a scream she struggled in his grasp and struck at him fiercely with her clenched fists
Her sleeve fell back and disclosed the white scar made by his own hand so many years before
Youre a wicked man she panted
Dont touch me
I hate you and despise you
Frank could only surmise how she had come here in such a condition
When she spoke of Wain in this manner he drew his own conclusions
Some deadly villainy of Wains had brought her to this pass
Anger stirred his nature to the depths and found vent in curses on the author of Renas misfortunes
Damn him
he groaned
Ill have his hearts blood fer dis ter de las drop
Rena now laughed and put up her arms appealingly
George she cried in melting tones dear George do you love me
How much do you love me
Ah you dont love me
she moaned Im black you dont love me you despise me
Her voice died away into a hopeless wail
Frank knelt by her side his faithful heart breaking with pity great tears rolling untouched down his dusky cheeks
Oh my honey my darlin he sobbed Frank loves you better n all de worl
Meantime the sun shone on as brightly as before the mockingbird sang yet more joyously
A gentle breeze sprang up and wafted the odor of bay and jessamine past them on its wings
The grand triumphal sweep of natures onward march recked nothing of lifes little tragedies
When the first burst of his grief was over Frank brought water from the branch bathed Renas face and hands and feet and forced a few drops between her reluctant lips
He then pitched the cartload of tubs buckets and piggins out into the road and gathering dried leaves and pine straw spread them in the bottom of the cart
He stooped lifted her frail form in his arms and laid it on the leafy bed
Cutting a couple of hickory withes he arched them over the cart and gathering an armful of jessamine quickly wove it into an awning to protect her from the sun
She was quieter now and seemed to fall asleep
Go ter sleep honey he murmured caressingly go ter sleep an Frankll take you home ter yo mammy
Toward noon he was met by a young white man who peered inquisitively into the canopied cart
Hello
exclaimed the stranger whove you got there
A sick woman suh
Why shes white as Im a sinner
he cried after a closer inspection
Look ahere nigger what are you doin with this white woman
Shes not wite bossshes a bright mulatter
Yas mighty bright continued the stranger suspiciously
Where are you goin with her
Im takin her ter Patesville ter her mammy
The stranger passed on
Toward evening Frank heard hounds baying in the distance
A fox weary with running brush drooping crossed the road ahead of the cart
Presently the hounds straggled across the road followed by two or three hunters on horseback who stopped at sight of the strangely canopied cart
They stared at the sick girl and demanded who she was
I dont blieve shes black at all declared one after Franks brief explanation
This nigger has a bad eyehes up ter some sort of devilment
What ails the girl
 Pears ter be some kind of a fever replied Frank adding diplomatically I dont know whether its ketchin er noshes ben out er her head most er de time
They drew off a little at this
I reckon its all right said the chief spokesman
The hounds were baying clamorously in the distance
The hunters followed the sound and disappeared m the woods
Frank drove all day and all night stopping only for brief periods of rest and refreshment
At dawn from the top of the long white hill he sighted the river bridge below
At sunrise he rapped at Mis Mollys door
Upon rising at dawn Tryons first step after a hasty breakfast was to turn back toward Clinton
He had wasted half a day in following the false scent on the Lillington road
It seemed after reflection unlikely that a woman seriously ill should have been able to walk any considerable distance before her strength gave out
In her delirium too she might have wandered in a wrong direction imagining any road to lead to Patesville
It would be a good plan to drive back home continuing his inquiries meantime and ascertain whether or not she had been found by those who were seeking her including many whom Tryons inquiries had placed upon the alert
If she should prove still missing he would resume the journey to Patesville and continue the search in that direction
She had probably not wandered far from the highroad even in delirium she would be likely to avoid the deep woods with which her illness was associated
He had retraced more than half the distance to Clinton when he overtook a covered wagon
The driver when questioned said that he had met a young negro with a mule and a cart in which lay a young woman white to all appearance but claimed by the negro to be a colored girl who had been taken sick on the road and whom he was conveying home to her mother at Patesville
From a further description of the cart Tryon recognized it as the one he had met the day before
The woman could be no other than Rena
He turned his mare and set out swiftly on the road to Patesville
If anything could have taken more complete possession of George Tryon at twentythree than love successful and triumphant it was love thwarted and denied
Never in the few brief delirious weeks of his courtship had he felt so strongly drawn to the beautiful sister of the popular lawyer as he was now driven by an aching heart toward the same woman stripped of every adventitions advantage and placed by custom beyond the pale of marriage with men of his own race
Custom was tyranny
Love was the only law
Would God have made hearts to so yearn for one another if He had meant them to stay forever apart
If this girl should die it would be he who had killed her by his cruelty no less surely than if with his own hand he had struck her down
He had been so dazzled by his own superiority so blinded by his own glory that he had ruthlessly spurned and spoiled the image of God in this fair creature whom he might have had for his own treasure whom please God he would yet have at any cost to love and cherish while they both should live
There were difficultiesthey had seemed insuperable but love would surmount them
Sacrifices must be made but if the world without love would be nothing then why not give up the world for love
He would hasten to Patesville
He would find her he would tell her that he loved her that she was all the world to him that he had come to marry her and take her away where they might be happy together
He pictured to himself the joy that would light up her face he felt her soft arms around his neck her tremulous kisses upon his lips
If she were ill his love would woo her back to healthif disappointment and sorrow had contributed to her illness joy and gladness should lead to her recovery
He urged the mare forward if she would but keep up her present pace he would reach Patesville by nightfall
Dr Green had just gone down the garden path to his buggy at the gate
Mis Molly came out to the back piazza where Frank weary and haggard sat on the steps with Homer Pettifoot and Billy Oxendine who hearing of Renas return had come around after their days work
Rena wants to see you Frank said Mis Molly with a sob
He walked in softly reverently and stood by her bedside
She turned her gentle eyes upon him and put out her slender hand which he took in his own broad palm
Frank she murmured my good friend my best friendyou loved me best of them all
The tears rolled untouched down his cheeks
Id a died fer you Miss Rena he said brokenly
Mary B threw open a window to make way for the passing spirit and the red and golden glory of the setting sun triumphantly ending his daily course flooded the narrow room with light
Between sunset and dark a traveler seated in a dusty buggy drawn by a tired horse crossed the long river bridge and drove up Front Street
Just as the buggy reached the gate in front of the house behind the cedars a woman was tying a piece of crape upon the doorknob
Pale with apprehension Tryon sat as if petrified until a tall sidewhiskered mulatto came down the garden walk to the front gate
Whos dead
demanded Tryon hoarsely scarcely recognizing his own voice
A young cullud oman sah answered Homer Pettifoot touching his hat Mis Molly Waldens daughter Rena
