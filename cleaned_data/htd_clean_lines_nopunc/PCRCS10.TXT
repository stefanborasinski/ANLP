POLLY OF THE CIRCUS BY MARGARET MAYO To My KLEINE MUTTER Chapter I The band of the Great American Circus was playing noisily
The performance was in full swing
Beside a shabby trunk in the womens dressing tent sat a young wistfulfaced girl chin in hand unheeding the chatter of the women about her or the picturesque disarray of the surrounding objects
Her eyes had been so long accustomed to the glitter and tinsel of circus fineries that she saw nothing unusual in a picture that might have held a painter spellbound
Circling the inside of the tent and forming a double line down the centre were partially unpacked trunks belching forth impudent masses of satins laces artificial hair paper flowers and paste jewels
The scent of moist earth mingled oddly with the perfumed odours of the garments heaped on the grass
Here and there high circles of lights threw a strong steady glare upon the halfclad figure of a robust acrobat or the thin drooping shoulders of a less stalwart sister
Temporary ropes stretched from one pole to another were laden with bright coloured stockings gaudy spangled gowns or dusty street clothes discarded by the performers before slipping into their circus attire
There were no nails or hooks so hats and veils were pinned to the canvas walls
The furniture was limited to one camp chair in front of each trunk the till of which served as a tray for the paints powders and other essentials of makeup
A pail of water stood by the side of each chair so that the performers might wash the delicately shaded tights handkerchiefs and other small articles not to be entrusted to the slow careless process of the village laundry
Some of these had been washed tonight and hung to dry on the lines between the dusty street garments
Women whose turns came late sat about halfclothed reading crocheting or sewing while others added pencilled eyebrows powder or rouge to their already exaggerated makeups
Here and there a child was putting her sawdust baby to sleep in the till of her trunk before beginning her part in the evenings entertainment
Young and old went about their duties with a systematic businesslike air and even the little knot of excited women near Pollyit seemed that one of the men had upset a circus traditionkept a sharp lookout for their turns
What do you think about it Polly
asked a handsome brunette as she surveyed herself in the costume of a Roman charioteer
About what
asked Polly vacantly
Leave Poll alone shes in one of her trances
called a motherly goodnatured woman whose trunk stood next to Pollys and whose business was to support a son and three daughters upon stalwart shoulders both figuratively and literally
Well I aint in any trance answered the dark girl and I think its pretty tough for him to take up with a rank outsider and expect us to warm up to her as though hed married one of our own folks
She tossed her head the pride of class distinction welling high in her ample bosom
He aint asking us to warm up to her contradicted Mademoiselle Eloise a pale light haired sprite who had arrived late and was making undignified efforts to get out of her clothes by way of her head
She was Pollys understudy and next in line for the star place in the bill
Well Barker has put her into the Leap of Death stunt aint he
continued the brunette 
Course that aint a regular circus act she added somewhat mollified and so far shes had to dress with the freaks but the next thing we know hell be ringin her in on a regular stunt and be puttin her in to dress with US
No danger of that sneered the blonde Barker is too old a stager to mix up his sheep and his goats
Polly had again lost the thread of the conversation
Her mind had gone roving to the night when the frightened girl about whom they were talking had made her first appearance in the circus lot clinging timidly to the hand of the man who had just made her his wife
Her eyes had met Pollys with a look of appeal that had gone straight to the childs simple heart
A few nights later the newcomer had allowed herself to be strapped into the cumbersome Leap of Death machine which hurled itself through space at each performance and flung itself down with force enough to break the neck of any unskilled rider
Courage and steady nerve were the requisites for the job so the manager had said but any physician would have told him that only a trained acrobat could long endure the nervous strain the muscular tension and the physical rack of such an ordeal
What matter
The few dollars earned in this way would mean a great deal to the mother whom the girls marriage had left desolate
Polly had looked on hungrily the night that the mother had taken the daughter in her arms to say farewell in the little country town where the circus had played before her marriage
She could remember no womans arms about HER for it was fourteen years since tender hands had carried her mother from the performers tent into the moonlit lot to die
The baby was so used to seeing Mumsie throw herself wearily on the ground after coming out of the big top exhausted that she crept to the womans side as usual that night and gazed laughingly into the sightless eyes gurgling and prattling and stroking the unresponsive face
There were tears from those who watched but no word was spoken
Clown Toby and the big boss canvasman Jim had always taken turns amusing and guarding little Polly while her mother rode in the ring
So Toby now carried the babe to another side of the lot and Jim bore the lifeless body of the mother to the distant ticketwagon now closed for the night and laid it upon the sellers cot
Its allus like this in the end he murmured as he drew a piece of canvas over the white face and turned away to give orders to the men who were beginning to load the props used earlier in the performance
When the show moved on that night it was Jims strong arms that lifted the mite of a Polly close to his stalwart heart and climbed with her to the high seat on the head wagon
Uncle Toby was entrusted with the brown satchel in which the mother had always carried Pollys scanty wardrobe
It seemed to these two men that the eyes of the woman were fixed steadily upon them
Barker the manager a large noisy goodnatured fellow at first mumbled something about the kid being excess baggage but his objections were only halfhearted for like the others he was already under the hypnotic spell of the babys round confiding eyes and he eventually contented himself with an occasional reprimand to Toby who was now sometimes late on his cues
Polly wondered at these times why the old mans stories were so suddenly cut short just as she was so comfy in the soft grass at his feet
The boys who used to look sharp because of their boss at loading time now learned that they might loiter so long as Muvver Jim was hikin it round for the kid
It was Polly who had dubbed big Jim Muvver and the sobriquet had stuck to him in spite of his six feet two and shoulders that an athlete might have envied
Little by little Toby grew more stooped and small lines of anxiety crept into the brownish circles beneath Jims eyes the lips that had once shut so firmly became tender and tremulous but neither of the men would willingly have gone back to the old emptiness
It was a red letter day in the circus when Polly first managed to climb up on the pole of an unhitched wagon and from there to the back of a friendly Shetland pony
Jim and Toby had been neglectin her eddication they declared and from that time on the blood of Pollys ancestors was given full encouragement
Barker was quick to grasp the advantage of adding the kid to the daily parade
She made her first appearance in the streets upon something very like a Newfoundland dog guarded from the rear by Jim and from the fore by a whitefaced clown who was thought to be all the funnier because he twisted his neck so much
From the street parade to Pollys first appearance in the big top had seemed a short while to Jim and Toby
They were proud to see her circling the ring in bright colours and to hear the cheers of the people but a sense of loss was upon them
I always said shed do it cried Barker who now took upon himself the credit of Pollys triumph
And what a triumph it was
Polly danced as serenely on Bingos back as she might have done on the concert boards
She swayed gracefully with the music
Her tiny sandals twinkled as she stood first upon one foot and then upon the other
Uncle Toby forgot to use many of his tricks that night and Jim left the loading of the wagons to take care of itself while he hovered near the entrance anxious and breathless
The performers crowded around the girl with outstretched hands and congratulations as she came out of the ring to cheers and applause
But Big Jim stood apart
He was thinking of the buttons that his clumsy fingers used to force into the stiff starchy holes too small for them and of the pigtails so stubborn at the ends and Toby was remembering the little shoes that had once needed to be laced in the cold dark mornings and the strings that were always snapping
Something had gone
They were not philosophers to reason like Emerson that for everything we lose we gain something they were simple souls these two they could only feel
Chapter II WHILE Polly sat in the dressing tent listening indifferently to the chatter about the Leap of Death girl Jim waited in the lot outside opening and shutting a small leather bag which he had bought for her that day
He was as blind to the picturesque outdoor life as she to her indoor surroundings for he too had been with the circus since his earliest recollection
The grass enclosure where he waited was shut in by a circle of tents and wagons
The great red property vans were waiting to be loaded with the costumes and tackle which were constantly being brought from the big top where the evening performance was now going on
The gay striped curtains at the rear of the tent were looped back to give air to the panting musicians who sat just inside
Through the opening a glimpse of the audience might be had tier upon tier fanning and shifting uneasily
Near the main tent stood the long low dressing top with the women performers stowed away in one end the ring horses in the centre and the men performers in the other end
A temporary curtain was hung between the main and the dressing tent to shut out the curious mob that tried to peep in at the back lot for a glimpse of things not to be seen in the ring
Coloured streamers fastened to the roofs of the tents waved and floated in the night air and beckoned to the townspeople on the other side to make haste to get their places forget their cares and be children again
Over the tops of the tents the lurid light of the distant red fire shot into the sky accompanied by the cries of the peanut butchers the popcorn boys the lemonade venderssic and the exhortations of the sideshow spieler whose flying banners bore the painted reproductions of his freaks
Here and there stood unhitched chariots half filled trunks trapeze tackle paper hoops stake pullers or other properties necessary to the show
Torches flamed at the tent entrances while oil lamps and lanterns gave light for the loading of the wagons
There was a constant stream of life shooting in and out from the dressing tent to the big top as gaily decked men women and animals came or went
Drowsy dogs were stretched under the wagons waiting their turn to be dressed as lions or bears
The wise old goose with his modest grey mate pecked at the green grass or turned his head from side to side watching the singing clown who rolled up the painted carcass and long neck of the imitation giraffe from which two property men had just slipped their legs still encased in stripes
Ambitious canvasmen and grooms were exercising feet in air in the hope of some day getting into the performers ring
Property men stole a minutes sleep in the soft warm grass while they waited for more tackle to load in the wagons
Children of the performers were swinging on the tent ropes chattering monkeys sat astride the Shetland ponies awaiting their entrance to the ring
The shrieks of the hyenas in the distant animal tent the roaring of the lions and the trumpeting of the elephants mingled with the incessant clamour of the band
And back of all this pointing upward in mute protest rose a solemn church spire white and majestic against a vast panorama of blue moonlit hills that encircled the whole lurid picture
Jims eyes turned absently toward the church as he sat fumbling with the lock of the little brown satchel
He had gone from store to store in the various towns where they had played looking for something to inspire wonder in the heart of a miss newly arrived at her sixteenth year
Only the desperation of a last moment had forced him to decide upon the imitation alligator bag which he now held in his hand
It looked small and mean to him as the moment of presentation approached and he was glad that the saleswoman in the little country store had suggested the addition of ribbons and laces which he now drew from the pocket of his corduroys
He placed his red and blue treasures very carefully in the bottom of the satchel and remembered with regret the strand of coral beads which he had so nearly bought to go with them
He opened the large property trunk by his side and took from it a laundry box which held a little tan coat that was to be Tobys contribution to the birthday surprise
He was big hearted enough to be glad that Tobys gift seemed finer and more useful than his
It was only when the Leap of Death act preceding Pollys turn was announced that the big fellow gave up feasting his eyes on the satchel and coat and hid them away in the big property trunk
She would be out in a minute and these wonders were not to be revealed to her until the close of the nights performance
Jim put down the lid of the trunk and sat upon it feeling like a criminal because he was hiding something from Polly
His consciousness of guilt was increased as he recalled how often she had forbidden Toby and himself to rush into reckless extravagances for her sake and how she had been more nearly angry than he had ever seen her when they had put their months salaries together to buy her the spangled dress for her first appearance
It had taken a great many apologies and promises as to their future behaviour to calm her and now they had again disobeyed her
It would be a great relief when tonights ordeal was over
Jim watched Polly uneasily as she came from the dressing tent and stopped to gaze at the nearby church steeple
The incongruity of the slang that soon came from her delicately formed lips was lost upon him as she turned her eyes toward him
Say Jim she said with a Western drawl thems a funny lot of guys what goes to them church places aint they
Most everybody has got some kind of a bug Jim assented I guess they dont do much harm
 Member the time you took me into one of them places to get me out a the rain the Sunday our wagon broke down
Well that bunch WE butted into wouldnt a give Sells Brothers no cause for worry with that show a theirn would they Jim
She looked at him with withering disgust
Say wasnt that the punkiest stunt that fellow in black was doin on the platform
You said Joe was only ten minutes gettin the tire onto our wheel but say you take it from me Jim if I had to wait another ten minutes as long as that one Id be too old to go on aridin
Jim  lowed some church shows might be better than that un but Polly said he could have her end of the bet and summed up by declaring it no wonder that the yaps in these towns was daffy about circuses if they didnt have nothin better an church shows to go to
One of the grooms was entering the lot with Pollys horse
She stooped to tighten one of her sandals and as she rose Jim saw her sway slightly and put one hand to her head
He looked at her sharply remembering her faintness in the parade that morning
You aint feeling right he said uneasily
You just bet I am Polly answered with an independent toss of her head
This is the night were goin to make them rubes in there sit up aint it Bingo
she added placing one arm affectionately about the neck of the big white horse that stood waiting near the entrance
You bin ridin too reckless lately said Jim sternly as he followed her
I dont like it
There aint no need of your puttin in all them extra stunts
Your act is good enough without em
Nobody else ever done em an nobodyd miss em if you left em out
Polly turned with a triumphant ring in her voice
The music was swelling for her entrance
You aint my MOTHER Jim youre my GRANDmother she taunted and with a crack of her whip she was away on Bingos back
Its the spirit of the dead one thats got into her Jim mumbled as he turned away still seeing the flash in the departing girls eyes
Chapter III Polly and Bingo always made the audience sit up when they swept into the ring
She was so young so gaily clad so light and joyous in all her poses
She seemed scarcely to touch the back of the white horse as they dashed round the ring in the glare of the tent lights
The other performers went through their work mechanically while Polly rode for they knew the audience was watching her only
As for Polly her work had never lost its first interest
Jim may have been right when he said that the spirit of the dead mother had got into her but it must have been an unsatisfied spirit unable to fulfil its ambition in the body that once held it for it sometimes played strange pranks with Polly
Tonight her eyes shone and her lips were parted in anticipation as she leaped lightly over the many coloured streamers of the wheel of silken ribbons held by Barker in the centre of the ring and by Toby and the tumblers on the edge of the bank
With each change of her act the audience cheered and frantically applauded
The band played faster Bingos pace increased the end of her turn was coming
The tumblers arranged themselves around the ring with paper hoops Bingo was fairly racing
She went through the first hoop with a crash of tearing paper and cheers from the audience
Heigh Bingo
she shouted as she bent her knees to make ready for the final leap
Bingos neck was stretched
He had never gone so fast before
Barker looked uneasy
Toby forgot to go on with his accustomed tricks
Jim watched anxiously from the entrance
The paper of one hoop was still left unbroken
The attendant turned his eyes to glance at the oncoming girl the hoop shifted slightly in his clumsy hand as Polly leapt straight up from Bingos back trusting to her first calculation
Her forehead struck the edge of the hoop
She clutched wildly at the air
Bingo galloped on and she fell to the ground striking her head against the ironbound stake at the edge of the ring
Everything stopped
There was a gasp of horror the musicians dropped their instruments Bingo halted and looked back uneasily she lay unconscious and seemingly lifeless
A great cry went up in the tent
Panic stricken men women and children began to clamber down from their seats while others nearest the ground attempted to jump into the ring
Barker still grasping his long whip rushed to the girls side and shouted wildly to Toby Say something you
Get em back
Old Toby turned his white face to the crowd his features worked convulsively but he could not speak
His grief was so grotesque that the few who saw him laughed hysterically
He could not even go to Polly his feet seemed pinned to the earth
Jim rushed into the tent at the first cry of the audience
He lifted the limp form tenderly and kneeling in the ring held her bruised head in his hands
Cant you get a doctor
he shouted desperately to Barker
Heres the doctor
some one called and a stranger came toward them
He bent over the seemingly lifeless form his fingers on the tiny wrist his ear to the heart
Well sir
Jim faltered for he had caught the puzzled look in the doctors eyes as his deft hand pressed the cruelly wounded head
I cant tell just yet said the doctor
She must be taken away
Where can we take her
asked Jim a look of terror in his great troubled eyes
The parsonage is the nearest house said the doctor
I am sure the pastor will be glad to have her there until we can find out how badly she is hurt
In an instant Barker was back in the centre of the ring
He announced that Pollys injuries were slight called the attention of the audience to the wonderful concert to take place and bade them make ready for the thrilling chariot race which would end the show
Jim blind with despair lifted the light burden and staggered out of the tent while the band played furiously and the people fell back into their seats
The Roman chariots thundered and clattered around the outside of the ring the audience cheered the winner of the race and for the moment Polly was forgotten
Chapter IV THE blare of the circus band had been a sore temptation to Mandy Jones all afternoon and evening
Again and again it had dragged her from her work to the study window from which she could see the wonders so tantalisingly near
Mandy was housekeeper for the Rev
John Douglas but the unwashed supper dishes did not trouble her as she watched the lumbering elephants the restless lions the longnecked giraffes and the striped zebras that came and went in the nearby circus lot
And yet in spite of her own curiosity she could not forgive her vagrant worse half Hasty who had been lured from duty early in the day
She had once dubbed him Hasty in a spirit of derision and the name had clung to him
The sarcasm seemed doubly appropriate tonight for he had been away since ten that morning and it was now past nine
The young pastor for a time had enjoyed Mandys tirades against her husband but when she began calling shrilly out of the window to chance acquaintances for news of him he slipped quietly into the next room to finish tomorrows sermon
Mandy renewed her operations at the window with increased vigour when the pastor had gone
She was barely saved from pitching head foremost into the lot by the timely arrival of Deacon Strongs daughter who managed with difficulty to connect the excited womans feet with the floor
Foh de Lor sake
Mandy gasped as she stood panting for breath and blinking at the pretty young applefaced Julia I was suah most gone dat time
Then followed another outburst against the delinquent Hasty
But the deacons daughter did not hear her eyes were already wandering anxiously to the lights and the tinsel of the little world beyond the window
This was not the first time today that Mandy had found herself talking to space
There had been a steady stream of callers at the parsonage since eleven that morning but she had long ago confided to the pastor that she suspected their reasons
Dey comes in here atrackin up my floors she said and aaskin why you don stop de circus from ashowin nex to de church and den acranin afar necks out de winder till I cant get no housework done
Thats only human nature Douglas had answered with a laugh but Mandy had declared that she knew another name for it and had mumbled something about hypocritters as she seized her broom and began to sweep imaginary tracks from in front of the door
Many times she had made up her mind to let the next caller know just what she thought of hypocritters but her determination was usually weakened by her still greater desire to excite increased wonder in the faces of her visitors
Divided between these two inclinations she gazed at Julia now the shining eyes of the deacons daughter conquered and she launched forth into an eager description of how she had just seen a wondeful striped anamule with a powful long neck walk right out of the tent and how he had come apart afore her very eyes and two men had slipped right out a his insides
Mandy was so carried away by her own eloquence and so busy showing Julia the sights beyond the window that she did not hear Miss Perkins the thinlipped spinster who entered followed by the Widow Willoughby dragging her sevenyearold son Willie by the hand
The women were protesting because their choir practice of What Shall the Harvest Be
had been interrupted by the unrequested acompanimentsic of the hoochie coochie from the nearby circus band
Its scandalous
Miss Perkins snapped
Scandalous
And SOMEBODY ought to stop it
She glanced about with an unmistakable air of grievance at the closed doors feeling that the pastor was undoubtedly behind one of them when he ought to be out taking action against the things that her soul abominated
Well Im sure IVE done all that I could piped the widow with a meek martyred air
She was always martyred
She considered it an appropriate attitude for a widow
He cant blame ME if the choir is out of key tomorrow
Mercy me
interrupted the spinster if there isnt Julia Strong aleaning right out of that window alooking at the circus and her pa a deacon of the church and this the house of the pastor
Its shocking
I must go to her
Ma let me see too begged Willie as he tugged at his mothers skirts
Mrs Willoughby hesitated
Miss Perkins was certainly taking a long while for her argument with Julia
The glow from the red powder outside the window was positively alarming
Dear me
she said I wonder if there can be a fire
And with this pretext for investigation she too joined the little group at the window
A few moments later when Douglas entered for a fresh supply of paper the backs of the company were toward him
He crossed to the study table without disturbing his visitors and smiled to himself at the eager way in which they were hanging out of the window
Douglas was a sturdy young man of eight and twenty frank and boyish in manner confident and lighthearted in spirit
He had seemed too young to the deacons when he was appointed to their church and his keen enjoyment of outdoor games and other healthful sports robbed him of a certain dignity in their eyes
Some of the women of the congregation had been inclined to side with the deacons for it hurt their vanity that the pastor found so many other interests when he might have been sitting in dark stuffy rooms discussing theology with them but Douglas had been either unconscious of or indifferent to their resentment and had gone on his way with a cheery nod and an unconquerable conviction of right that had only left them floundering
He intended to quit the room now unnoticed but was unfortunate enough to upset a chair as he turned from the table
This brought a chorus of exclamations from the women who chattering rushed quickly toward him
What do you think of my naughty boy Willie
simpered the widow
He dragged me quite to the window
Douglas glanced amusedly first at the five footsix widow and then at the helpless red haired urchin by her side but he made no comment beyond offering a chair to each of the women
Our choir practice had to be entirely discontinued declared Miss Perkins sourly as she accepted the proffered chair adjusted her skirts for a stay and glanced defiantly at the parson who had dutifully seated himself near the table
I am sure I have as true an ear as anybody whimpered the widow with an injured air but I defy ANY ONE to lead What Shall the Harvest Be
to an accompaniment like THAT
She jerked her hand in the direction of the window
The band was again playing the hoochie coochie
Never mind about the choir practice said Douglas with a smile
It is SOUL not SKILL that our congregation needs in its music
As for that music out there it is NOT without its compensations
Why the small boys would rather hear that band than the finest church organ in the world
And the SMALL BOYS would rather see the circus than to hear you preach most likely snapped Miss Perkins
It was adding insult to injury for him to try to CONSOLE her
Of course they would and so would some of the grownups if theyd only tell the truth about it said Douglas laughing
What
exclaimed Miss Perkins
Why not
asked Douglas
I am sure I dont know what they do inside the tents but the parade looked very promising
The PARADE
the two women echoed in one breath
Did YOU see the parade
Yes indeed said Douglas enthusiastically
But it didnt compare with the one I saw at the age of eight
He turned his head to one side and looked into space with a reminiscent smile
The widows redhaired boy crept close to him
The Shetland ponies seemed as small as mice he continued dreamily the elephants huge as mountains the great calliope wafted my soul to the very skies and I followed that parade right into the circus lot
Did you seed inside de tent
Willie asked eagerly
I didnt have enough money for that Douglas answered frankly
He turned to the small boy and pinched his ear
There was sad disappointment in the youngsters face but he brightened again when the parson confessed that he peeped
A parson peeping
cried the thinlipped Miss Perkins
I was not a parson then corrected Douglas goodnaturedly
You were GOING to be persisted the spinster
I had to be a boy first in spite of that fact
The sudden appearance of Hasty proved a diversion
He was looking very sheepish
Hyar he is Mars John look at him
said Mandy
Hasty where have you been all day
demanded Douglas severely
Hasty fumbled with his hat and sparred for time
Did yo say whars I been sah
Dats what he done ast yo Mandy prompted threateningly
I bin ceived Mars John declared Hasty solemnly
Mandy snorted incredulously
Douglas waited
A gemmen in de circus done tole me dis mawnin dat ef I carry water fo de elphants hell let me in de circus fo nuffin an I make a greement wid him
Mars John did yo ebber seed an elphant drink
he asked rolling his eyes
John shook his head
Well sah he jes put dat trunk ahisn into de pail jes once answishwater gone
Douglas laughed and Mandy muttered sullenly
Well sah continued Hasty I tote water fo dem elphants all day long an when I cum roun to see de circus de gemmen wont let me in
An when I try to crawl under de tent dey pulls me out by de laigs an beats me
He looked from one to the other expecting sympathy
Serves you right was Mandys unfeeling reply
If yos so anxious to be atotin water jes yo come along outside and tote some fo Mandy
I cant do no mo carryin Mandy protested Hasty
Ise hurted in mah arm
What hurt yo
Tiger
A tiger
exclaimed the women in unison
Done chawed it mos off he declared solemnly
Deacon Elverson he seed it an he says Is hurt bad
Deacon Elverson
cried the spinster
Was Deacon Elverson at the circus
He was in de lot atryin to look in same as me Hasty answered innocently
Youd better take Hasty into the kitchen said Douglas to Mandy with a dry smile hes talking too much for a wounded man
Mandy disappeared with the disgraced Hasty advising him with fine scorn to get de tiger to chew off his laigs sos he wouldnt have to walk no mo
The women gazed at each other with lips closed tightly
Elversons behaviour was beyond their power of expression
Miss Perkins turned to the pastor as though he were somehow to blame for the deacons backsliding but before she could find words to argue the point the timid little deacon appeared in the doorway utterly unconscious of the hostile reception that Hasty had prepared for him
He glanced nervously from one set face to the other then coughed behind his hat Were all very much interested in the circus said Douglas
Cant you tell us about it
I just went into the lot to look for my son stammered the deacon
I feared Peter had strayed
Why deacon said Mrs Willoughby
I just stopped by your house and saw Mrs Elverson putting Peter to bed
The deacon was saved from further embarrassment by an exclamation from Julia who had stayed at the window
Oh look something has happened
she cried
Theres a crowd
They are coming this way
Douglas crossed quickly to Julias side and saw an excited mob collecting before the entrance to the main tent
He had time to discover no more before Mandy burst in at the door panting with excitement and rolling her large whiterimmed eyeballs
Mars John a little circus girl done fall off her hoss
she cried
Dr Hartley say can dey bring her in heah
Of course said Douglas hurrying outside
There were horrified exclamations from the women who were aghast at the idea of a circus rider in the parsonage
In their helpless indignation they turned upon the little deacon feeling intuitively that he was enjoying the drama
Elverson was retreating toward the door when he was suddenly thrust aside by Douglas
In the young pastors arms was a white spangled burden of humanity her slender arm hung lifeless over his shoulder
The silk stocking was torn from one bruised ankle her hair fell across her face veiling it from the unfriendly glances of the women
Douglas passed out of sight up the stairway without looking to the right or left followed by the doctor
Mandy reached the front door in time to push back a crowd of intruders
She had barely closed the door when it was thrust open by Jim
Where is she
he demanded
Go way fum here
cried Mandy as her eyes unconsciously sought the stairs
Jim followed the direction of her glance and cleared the steps at a bound
Mandy pursued him muttering angrily
Deacon Elverson too was about to follow when a grim reminder from Miss Perkins brought him around and he made for the door instead
He started back on opening it for standing on the threshold was a clown in his grotesque makeup his white clothes were partially concealed by a large travelling ulster held together by one button
In one hand he carried a small leather satchel in the other a girls sailor hat a little tan coat was thrown across his arm
The giggles of the boy hiding behind his mothers skirt were the only greetings received by the trembling old man in the doorway
He glanced uncertainly from one unfriendly face to the other waiting for a word of invitation to enter but none came
Excuse me he said I just brought some of her little things
Shed better put on her coat when she goes out
Its gettin kinder chilly
He looked again into the blank faces still no one spoke
He stepped forward trembling with anxiety
A sudden fear clutched at his heart the muscles of his face worked pitifully the red painted lips began to quiver
It aint It aint that is it
he faltered unable to utter the word that filled him with horror
Even Miss Perkins was momentarily touched by the anguish in the old mans voice
I guess you will find the person you are looking for upstairs she answered tartly and flounced out of the house calling to Julia and the others to follow her and declaring that she would soon let folks know how the parson had brought a circus ridin girl into the parsonage
The painted clown stood alone looking from one wall to the other then he crossed the room and placed the alligator satchel and the little coat and hat on the study table
He was careful not to wrinkle the coat for this was Pollys birthday gift
Jim and he had planned to have sandwiches and soda pop on the top of the big wagon when they offered their treasures tonight but now the wagons would soon be leavingand where was Polly
He turned to ask this question as Mandy came down the stairs
Well if dar aint anudder one she cried
Never mind Mandy said Douglas who was just behind her carrying a small water pitcher and searching for a bottle of brandy which had been placed in the medicine chest for emergencies
You can take these upstairs he told her when he had filled the pitcher with water and found the liquor
Mandy looked threateningly at Toby then reluctantly went on her way
Douglas turned to the old man pleasantly
His was the first greeting that Toby had received and he at last found voice to ask whether Polly was badly hurt
The doctor hasnt told us yet said Douglas kindly
Im her Uncle Tobynot her REAL uncle the old man explained but thats what she calls me
I couldnt come out right away because Im on in the concert
Could I see her now please
Heres the doctor said Douglas as Hartley came down the stairs followed by Jim
Well doctor not bad I hope
Yes rather bad said the doctor adding quickly as he saw the suffering in Tobys face but dont be alarmed
Shes going to get well
How long will it be before we can have her backbefore she can ride again
asked Jim gruffly as he stood apart twisting his brown worn hat in his hands
Probably several months said the doctor
No bones are broken but the ligaments of one ankle are torn and she received a bad blow on the head
It will be some time before she recovers consciousness
What are we goin to do Jim
asked Toby helplessly
You neednt worry well take good care of her here said Douglas seeing desperation written on their faces
Here
They looked at him incredulously And this was a parson
Where are her parents
the doctor asked looking at Jim and Toby
She aint got no parents cept Toby an me replied Jim
Weve took care of her ever since she was a baby
Oh I see said the doctor
Well one of youd better stay here until she can be moved
Thats the trouble we cant said Toby hanging his head
You see sir circus folks is like soldiers
No matter what happens the show has to go on and we got to be in our places
Well well shell be safe enough here said the doctor
It is a fortunate thing that Mr Douglas can manage this
Our town hospital burned down a few months ago and weve been rather puzzled as to what to do with such cases
He took his leave with a cheery Good night and a promise to look in upon the little patient later
Jim shuffled awkwardly toward the pastor
Its mighty good of you to do this he mumbled but she aint goin to be no charity patient
Me and Toby is goin to look after her keep
Her wants will be very few Douglas answered kindly
You neednt trouble much about that
I mean it said Jim savagely
He met Douglass glance of surprise with a determined look for he feared that his chance of being useful to Polly might be slipping out of his life
You mustnt mind Jim the clown pleaded at the pastors elbow
You see pain gets some folks different from others and it always kinder makes him savage
Oh thats all right Douglas answered quickly
His own life had been so lonely that he could understand the selfish yearning in the big mans heart
You must do what you think best about these things Mandy and I will look after the rest
Jim hung his head feeling somehow that the pastor had seen straight into his heart and discovered his petty weakness
He was about to turn toward the door when it was thrown open by Barker
Where is she
shouted the manager looking from one to the other
She cant come said Jim in a low steady voice for he knew the storm of opposition with which Barker would meet the announcement
Cant come
shrieked Barker
Of course shell come
I cant get along without her
Shes GOT to come
He looked at Jim who remained silent and firm
WHY aint she comin
he asked feeling himself already defeated
Shes hurt bad was Jims laconic reply
The devil she is
said Barker looking at Douglas for confirmation
Is that right
She wont be able to travel for some time said Douglas
Mr Barker is our manager Toby explained as he edged his way to the pastors side
Some time
Barker looked at Douglas as though he were to blame for their misfortune
Well you just bet she will he declared menacingly
See here Barker dont you talk to him like that said Jim facing the manager
Hes darned square even if he is a parson
Barker turned away
He was not a badhearted man but he was irritated and upset at losing the star feature of his bill
Aint this my dodgasted luck
he muttered to himself as his eye again travelled to the boss canvasman
You get out a here Jim he shouted an start them wagons
The shows got to go on Poll or no Poll
He turned with his hand on the doorknob and jerked out a grudging thanks to the pastor
Its all fired good of you to take her in he said but its tough to lose her
Good night
He banged the door and clattered down the steps
Jim waited
He was trying to find words in which to tell his gratitude
None came and he turned to go with a short goodbye
Good night Jim said the pastor
He crossed the room and took the big fellows hand
Much obliged Jim answered gruffly
It was his only polite phrase and he had taught Polly to say it
Douglas waited until Jim had passed down the steps then turned to Toby who still lingered near the table
Youll tell her how it was me and Jim had to leave her without sayin goodbye wont you sir
Toby pleaded
Yes indeed Douglas promised
Ill jes put this little bit o money into her satchel
He picked up the little brown bag that was to have been Pollys birthday gift
Me an Jim will be sendin her more soon
Youre going to miss her Im afraid Douglas said feeling an irresistible desire to gain the old mans confidence
Lord bless you yes sir Toby answered turning upon him eagerly
Me an Jim has been father an mother and jes about everythin to that little one
She want much biggern a handful of peanuts when we begun aworryin about her
Well Mandy will do the worrying now Douglas laughed
Shes been dying for a chance to mother somebody all along
Why she even tried it on me
I noticed as how some of those church people seemed to look kinder queer at me said Toby and I been awonderin if mebbe they might feel the same about her
Oh theyre all right Douglas assured him theyll be her friends in no time
Shes fit for em sir Toby pleaded
Shes good clean into the middle of her heart
Im sure of it Douglas answered
Ive heard how some church folks feels towards us circus people sir and I jes wanted ye to know that there aint finer families or better mothers or fathers or grandfathers or grandmothers anywhere than we got among us
Why that girls mother rode the horses afore her and her mother afore that and her grandmother and grandfather afore that an there aint nobody whats cared more for their good name and their childrens good name an her people has
You see sir circus folks is all like that theys jes like one big family they tends to their business and takes good care o theirselvesthey has to or they couldnt do their work
Its cause Im leavin her with you that Im sayin all this the old man apologised
Im glad you told me Toby Douglas answered kindly
Ive never known much about circus folks
I guess Id better be goin Toby faltered as his eyes roved hungrily toward the stairway
Ill send you our route and mebbe youll be lettin us know how she is
Indeed I will Douglas assured him heartily
You might tell her well write ever day or so he added
Ill tell her Douglas promised earnestly
Good night
The old man hesitated unwilling to go but unable to find further pretext for staying
Good night Toby
Douglas extended his hand toward the bent figure that was about to shuffle past him
The withered hand of the whitefaced clown rested in the strong grasp of the pastor and his pale little eyes sought the face of the stalwart man before him a numb desolation was growing in his heart the object for which he had gone on day by day was being left behind and he must stumble forth into the night alone
Its hard to leave her he mumbled but the show has got to go on
The door shut out the bent old figure
Douglas stood for some time where Toby had left him still thinking of his prophetic words
His revery was broken by the sounds of the departing wagons the low muttered curses of the drivers the shrieking and roaring of the animals as the circus train moved up the distant hill
The show has got to go on he repeated as he crossed to his study table and seated himself for work in the dim light of the oldfashioned lamp
He put out one hand to draw the sheets of his interrupted sermon toward him but instead it fell upon a small sailor hat
He twisted the hat absently in his fingers not yet realising the new order of things that was coming into his life
Mandy tiptoed softly down the stairs
She placed one pudgy forefinger on her lips and rolled her large eyes skyward
Dat sure am an angel chile straight from Hebben she whispered
She done got a face jes like a little flower
Straight from heaven Douglas repeated as she crossed softly to the table and picked up the satchel and coat
You can leave the lamp MandyI must finish tomorrows sermon
She turned at the threshold and shook her head rather sadly as she saw the imprint of the days cares on the young pastors face
Yo mus be powful tired she said
No no not at all
Good night Mandy
She closed the door behind her and Douglas was alone
He gazed absently at the pages of his unfinished sermon as he tapped his idle pen on the desk
The show has got to go on he repeated and far up the hillside with the slow moving wagons Jim and Toby looked with unseeing eyes into the dim starlit distance and echoed the thought The show has got to go on
Chapter V THE church bells were ringing their first warning for the morning service when Mandy peeped into the spare bedroom for the second time and glanced cautiously at the wisp of hair that bespoke a feminine head somewhere between the covers and the little white pillow on the four poster bed
There was no sound from the sleeper so Mandy ventured across the room on tiptoe and raised the shades
The drooping boughs of Autumn foliage lay shimmering against the window panes and through them might be seen the grey outline of the church
Mandy glanced again toward the bed to make sure that the burst of sunlight had not wakened the invalid then crossed to a small rickety chair laden with the discarded finery of the little circus rider
Lawdy sakes
she cried holding up a spangled dress admiringly
Aint dat beautiful
She drew near the mirror attempting to see the reflection of the tinsel and chiffon against her very ample background of gingham and avoirdupois
Youd sure be a swell nigger wid dat on Honey she chuckled to herself
Wouldnt dem deacons holler if dey done see dat
The picture of the deacons astonishment at such a spectacle so grew upon Mandy that she was obliged to cover her generous mouth to shut in her convulsive laughter lest it awaken the little girl in the bed
She crossed to the oldfashioned bureau which for many months had stood unused against the wall
The drawer creaked as she opened it to lay away the gay spangled gown
Itll be a mighty long time afore she puts on dem tings agin she said with a doubtful shake of her large round head
Then she went back to the chair and picked up Pollys sandals and examined the beadwork with a great deal of interest
Lawdy lawdy
she cried as she compared the size of the sandals to that of her own rough worn shoes
She was again upon the point of exploding with laughter as the church bell added a few final and more emphatic clangs to its warning
She turned with a start motioning a vain warning out of the window for the bell to be silent but the little sleeper was already stirring uneasily on her pillow
One soft arm was thrown languidly over her head
The large blue eyes opened and closed dreamily as she murmured the words of the clown song that Jim and Toby had taught her years ago Ting ling Thats what the bells sing Mandy reached the side of the bed as the girls eyes opened a second time and met hers with a blank stare of astonishment
A tiny frown came into the small white forehead
Whats the matter
she asked faintly trying to find something familiar in the black face before her
Hush child hush Mandy whispered jes you lie puffickly still
Dats only de furs bell aringin
First bell
the girl repeated as her eyes travelled quickly about the strange walls and the unfamiliar fittings of the room
This aint the show
she cried suddenly
Lor bless you no dis aint no show Mandy answered and she laughed reassuringly
Then where am I
Polly asked half breathless with bewilderment
Nebber you mind bout dat was Mandys unsatisfactory reply
But I DO mind protested Polly trying to raise herself to a sitting position
Wheres the bunch
De wat
asked Mandy in surprise
The bunchJim and Toby and the rest of the push
Lor bless you
Mandy exclaimed
Deys done gone long wid de circus hours ago
Gone
Show gone
Polly cried in amazement
Then what am I doing here
Hole on dar honey
hole on
Mandy cautioned
Dont you cite yosef
Let me alone
Polly put aside the arm that was trying to place a shawl around her
I got to get out ahere
Youse got plenty o time for dat Mandy answered
yes yo wait awhile
I cant wait and I wont
Polly shrieked almost beside herself with anxiety
I got to get to the next burgWakefield aint it
What time is it
Let me alone
Let me go
she cried struggling desperately
The door opened softly and the young pastor stood looking down at the picture of the frail whitefaced child and her black determined captor
Here here
Whats all this about
he asked in a firm tone though evidently amused
Who are you
returned the girl as she shoved herself quickly back against the pillows and drew the covers close under her chin looking at him oddly over their top
She done been cuttin up somefin awful Mandy explained as she tried to regain enough breath for a new encounter
Cutting up
You surprise me Miss Polly he said with mock seriousness
How do you know Im Polly
the little rebel asked her eyes gleaming large and desperate above the friendly covers
If you will be VERY good and keep very quiet I will try to tell you he said as he crossed to the bed
I wont be quiet not for nobody Polly objected with a bold disregard of double negatives
I got to get a move
If you aint goin to help me you neednt butt in
I am afraid I cant help you to go just yet Douglas replied
He was beginning to perceive that there were tasks before him other than the shaping of Pollys character
What are you trying to do to me anyhow
she asked as she shot a glance of suspicion from the pastor to Mandy
What am I up against
Dont yuh be scared honey Mandy reassured her
Yous jes as safe here as you done been in de circus
Safer we hope Douglas added with a smile
Are you two bug
Polly questioned as she turned her head from one side to the other and studied them with a new idea
Well you cant get none the best of me
I can get away all right and I will too
She made a desperate effort to put one foot to the floor but fell back with a cry of pain
Dar dar Mandy murmured putting the pillow under the poor cramped neck and smoothing the tangled hair from Pollys forehead
Yuh done hurt yosef for suah dis time
The pastor had taken a step toward the bed
His look of amusement had changed to one of pity
You see Miss Polly you have had a very bad fall and you cant get away just yet nor see your friends until you are better
Its only a scratch Polly whimpered
I can do my work I got to
One more feeble effort and she succumbed with a faint Jimminy Crickets
Uncle Toby told me that you were a very good little girl Douglas said as he drew up a chair and sat down by her side confident by the expression on her face that at last he was master of the situation
Do you think he would like you to behave like this
I sure am on the blink she sighed as she settled back wearily upon the pillow
Youll be all right soon Douglas answered cheerily
Mandy and I will help the time to go
I recollect now Polly faltered without hearing him
It was the last hoop
Jim seemed to have a hunch I was goin to be in for trouble when I went into the ring
Bingo must a felt it too
He kept apullin and ajerkin from the start
I got myself together to make the last jump anI cant remember no more
Her head drooped and her eyes closed
I wouldnt try just now if I were you Douglas answered tenderly
Its my WHEEL aint it
Polly questioned after a pause
Yoah what chile
Mandy exclaimed as she turned from the table where she had been rolling up the unused bandages left from the doctors call the night before
I say its my creeper my paddle Polly explained trying to locate a few of her many pains
Gee but that hurts
She tried to bend her ankle
Is it punctured
Only sprained Douglas answered striving to control his amusement at the expression on Mandys puzzled face
Better not talk any more about it
Aint anything the matter with my tongue is there
she asked turning her head to one side and studying him quizzically
I dont think there is he replied goodnaturedly
How did I come to fall in here anyhow
she asked as she studied the walls of the unfamiliar room
We brought you here
Its a swell place she conceded grudgingly
We are comfortable he admitted as a tell tale smile again hovered about his lips
He was thinking of the changes that he must presently make in Miss Pollys vocabulary
Is this the big top
she asked
Thewhat
he stammered
The main tent she explained
Well no not exactly
Its going to be your room now Miss Polly
My room
Gee
Think a that
she gasped as the possibility of her actually having a room all of her own took hold of her mind
Much obliged she said with a nod feeling that something was expected of her
She knew no other phrase of gratitude than the one Muvver Jim and Toby had taught her to say to the manager when she received from him the first stick of red and white striped candy
Youre very welcome Douglas answered with a ring of genuine feeling in his voice
Awful quiet aint it
she ventured after a pause
Guess thats what woke me up
Douglas laughed goodnaturedly at the thought of quiet as a disturber and added that he feared it might at first be rather dull for her but that Jim and Toby would send her news of the circus and that she could write to them as soon as she was better
Ill have to be a heap better an I ever was fore I can write much Polly drawled with a whimsical little smile
I will write for you the pastor volunteered understanding her plight
You will
For the first time he saw a show of real pleasure in her eyes
Every day Douglas promised solemnly
And you will show me how
Indeed I will
How long am I in for
she asked
The doctor can tell better about that when he comes
The doctor
Soits as bad as that eh
Oh that need not frighten you Douglas answered consolingly
I aint frightened she bridled quickly I aint never scared of nothin
Its only cause they need me in the show that Im akickin
Oh they will get along all right he said reassuringly
Get along
Polly flashed with sudden resentment
Get along WITHOUT MY ACT
It was apparent from her look of astonishment that Douglas had completely lost whatever ground he had heretofore gained in her respect
Say have you seen that show
She waited for his answer with pity and contempt
No admitted John weakly
Well I should say you aint or you wouldnt make no crack like that
Im the whole thing in that push she said with an air of self complacency and with me down and out that show will be on the bum for fair
I beg your pardon was all Douglas could say confused by the sudden volley of unfamiliar words
Youre kiddin me she said turning her head to one side as was her wont when assailed by suspicion you MUST a seen me ride
No Miss Polly I have never seen a circus Douglas told her halfregretfully a sense of his deep privation stealing upon him
What
cried Polly incredulously
Lordy no chile he aint nebber seed none ob dem tings Mandy interrupted as she tried to arrange a few shortstemmed posies in a variegated bouquet
Well what do you think of that
Polly gasped
Youre the first rube I ever saw that hadnt
She was looking at him as though he were a curiosity
So Im a rube
Douglas shook his head with a sad little smile and goodnaturedly agreed that he had sometimes feared as much
Thats what we always calls a guy like you she explained ingenuously and added hopefully Well you MUST a seen our paradeall the pikers see thatIT dont cost nothin
Im afraid I must also plead guilty to the charge of being a piker Douglas admitted halfsheepishly for I did see the parade
Well I was the one on the white horse right behind the lion cage she began excitedly
You remember
Its a little confused in my mind he caught her look of amazement just AT PRESENT he stammered feeling her wrath again about to descend upon him
Well Im the twentyfour sheet stand she explained
Sheet
Mandy shrieked from her corner
Yesthe billboardsthe pictures Polly said growing impatient at their persistent stupidity
She sure am a funny talkin thing
mumbled Mandy to herself as she clipped the withered leaves from a plant near the window
You are dead sure they know I aint comin on
Polly asked with a lingering suspicion in her voice
Dead sure and Douglas smiled to himself as he lapsed into her vernacular
There was a moments pause
Polly realised for the first time that she must actually readjust herself to a new order of things
Her eyes again roved about the room
It was a cheerful place in which to be imprisonedeven Polly could not deny that
The broad window at the back with its white and pink chintz curtains on the inside and its frame of ivy on the outside spoke of singing birds and sunshine all day long
Everything from the white ceiling to the sweetsmelling matting that covered the floor was spotlessly clean the canebottomed rocker near the curved windowseat with its pretty pillows told of days when a convalescent might look in comfort at the garden beneath the counterpane with its oldfashioned rose pattern the little white tidies on the back of each chair and Mandy crooning beside the window all helped to make a homelike picture
She wondered what Jim and Toby would say if they could see her now sitting like a queen in the midst of her soft coverlets with no need to raise even a finger to wait upon herself
Aint it the limit
she sighed and with that Jim and Toby seemed to drift farther away
She began to see their life apart from hers
She could picture Jim with his head in his hands
She could hear his sharp orders to the men
He was always short with the others when anything went wrong with her
Ill bet Muvver Jims in the dumps she murmured as a cloud stole across the flowerlike face then the tired muscles relaxed and she ceased to rebel
Muvver Jim
Douglas repeated feeling that he must recall her to a knowledge of his presence
Thats what I calls him Polly explained but the fellows calls him Big Jim
You might not think Jim could be a good mother just to look at him but he is only sometimes you cant tell him things you could a real mother she added half sadly
And your real mother went away when you were very young
No she didnt go AWAY No
There was a puzzled note in the pastors voice
She went out Polly corrected
Out
he echoed blankly
Yesfinished Lights out
Oh an accident
Douglas understood at last
I dont like to talk about it
Polly raised herself on her elbow and looked at him solemnly as though about to impart a bit of forbidden family history
It was this look in the round eyes that had made Jim so often declare that the kid knew everything
Why motherd a been ashamed if shed a knowed how she wound up
She was the best rider of her time everybody says so but she cashed in by fallin off a skate what didnt have no more ginger an a kitten
If you can beat that
She gazed at him with her lips pressed tightly together evidently expecting some startling expression of wonder
And your father
Douglas asked rather lamely being at a loss for any adequate comment upon a tragedy which the child before him was too desolate even to understand
Oh DADS finish was all right
He got hisn in a lions cage where he worked
There was nothing slow about his end
She looked up for his approval
For de Lords sake
Mandy groaned as the wonder of the childs conversation grew upon her
And now Im down and out Polly concluded with a sigh
But THIS is nothing serious said the pastor trying to cheer her
Its serious ENOUGH with a whole show a dependin on you
Maybe you dont know how it feels to have to knock off work
Oh yes I do Douglas answered quickly
I was ill a while ago myself
I had to be in bed day after day thinking of dozens of things that I ought to be doing
Was you ever floored
Polly asked with a touch of unbelief as she studied the fine healthy physique at the side of her bed 
Deed he was chile Mandy cried feeling that her opportunity had now arrived an I had the wors time akeepin him in bed
He act jes like you did
Did he
Polly was delighted to find that the pastor had nothin on her as she would have put it
You ought to have heard him continued Mandy made eloquent by Pollys show of interest 
What will dose poor folks do
he kept asayin
yes yo lie where yo is I tole him
Dem poor folks will be better off dan dey would be acomin to yoah funeral
 Poor folks
Polly questioned
Do you give money to folks
We are always itchin to get it AWAY from em
Before Douglas could think of words with which to defend his disapproved methods Mandy had continued eagerly An den on Sunday when he cant go to church and preach She got no further
A sharp exclamation brought both Mandy and Douglas to attention
Preach
Polly almost shouted
She looked at him with genuine alarm this time
That will do Mandy Douglas commanded feeling an unwelcome drama gathering about his head
Great Barnum and Bailey
Polly exclaimed looking at him as though he were the very last thing in the world she had ever expected to see
Are you a skypilot
Thats what he am chile
Mandy slipped the words in slyly for she knew that they were against the pastors wishes but she was unable to restrain her mischievous impulse to sow the seeds of curiosity that would soon bear fruit in the inquisitive mind of the little invalid
Will you get onto me alandin into a mixup like this
She continued to study the uncomfortable man at her side
I never thought Id be atalkinto one of you guys
Whats your name
Douglas
He spoke shortly
Aint you got no handle to it
If you mean my Christian name its John
Well that sounds like a skypilot all right
But you dont look like I sposed they did
Why not
I always sposed skypilots was old and grouchylike
Youre amost as good lookin as our strong man
I done tole him he was too goodlookin to be an unmarried parson Mandy chuckled more and more amused at the pastors discomfort
Looks dont play a very important part in my work Douglas answered curtly
Mandys confidential snickers made him doubly anxious to get to a less personal topic
Well they count for a whole lot with us
She nodded her head decidedly
How long you been showin in this town anyhow
About a year Douglas answered with something of a sigh
A year
she gasped
In a burg like this
You must have an awful lot of laughs in your act to keep em acomin that long
She was wise in the ways of professional success
Not many Im afraid
He wondered for the first time if this might be the reason for his rather indifferent success
Do you give them the same stuff or have you got a rep
A rep
he repeated in surprise
Sure repertorydifferent actsentries some calls em
Uncle Tobys got twentyseven entries
It makes a heap of difference in the big towns where you have a run
Oh I understand Douglas answered in a tone of relief
Well I try to say something new each Sunday
What kind of spiels do you give em
she inquired with growing interest
I try to help my people to get on better terms with themselves and to forget their weekday troubles
He had never had occasion to define his efforts so minutely
Well thats jes the same as us Polly told him with an air of condescension only circuses draws more people an churches
YOURS does seem to be a more popular form of entertainment Douglas answered drily
He was beginning to feel that there were many tricks in the entertainment trade which he had not mastered
And after all what was his preaching but an effort at entertainment
If he failed to hold his congregation by what he was saying his listeners grew drowsy and his sermon fell short of its desired effect
It was true that his position and hers had points of similarity
She was apparently successful as for himself he could not be sure
He knew he tried very hard and that sometimes a tired mother or a sad faced child looked up at him with a smile that made the service seem worth while
Polly mistook the pastors revery for envy and her tender heart was quick to find consolation for him
You aint got all the worst of it she said
If we tried to play a dump like this for six months wed starve to death
You certainly must give em a great show she added surveying him with growing interest
It doesnt make much difference about the show Douglas began but he was quickly interrupted
Thats right its jes the same with a circus
One year ye give em the rottenest kind of a thing and they eat it up the next year you hand em a knockout and its a frost
Is that the way it is with a church show
Much the same Douglas admitted half amusedly halfregretfully
Very often when I work the hardest I seem to do the least good
I guess our troubles is pretty much alike
Polly nodded with a motherly air of condescension
Only there aint so much danger in your act
Im not so sure about that he laughed
Well you take my tip she leaned forward as though about to impart a very valuable bit of information
Dont you never go in for ridin
There aint no act on earth so hard as a ridin act
The rest of the bunch has got it easy alongside of us
Take the fellows on the trapeze
They always get their tackle up in jes the same place
Take the balancin acts there aint no difference in their layouts
Take any of em as depends on regular props and they aint got much chance agoin wrong
But say when yer have ter do a ridin act there aint never no two times alike
If your horse is feelin good the ground is stumbly if the ground aint on the blink the horse is wobbly
Thers always somethin wrong somewheres and yer aint never knowin how its goin ter end especially when you got to do a careful act like mine
Theres a girl Eloise in our bunch what does a SHOWY act on a horse what Barker calls Barbarian
She goes on in my place sometimes and say them rubes applauds her as much as me an her stunts is baby tricks alongside o mine
Its enough to make you sick o art
She shook her head dolefully then sat up with renewed interest
You see mine is careful balancin an all that an you got ter know your horse an your ground for that
Now you get wise ter what Im atellin yer and dont you NEVER go into ANYTHIN what depends on ANYTHIN else
Thank you Polly I wont
Douglas somehow felt that he was very much indebted to her
I seen a church show once Polly said suddenly
You did
Douglas asked with new interest
Yes she answered closing her lips and venturing no further comment
Did you like it
he questioned after a pause
Couldnt make nothin out of itI dont care much for readin
Oh it isnt ALL reading he corrected
Well the guy I saw read all of hisn
He got the whole thing right out of a book
Oh that was only his text laughed Douglas
Text
Yes
And later he tried to interpret to his congrega Easy
Easy
she interrupted come again with that will you
He told them the meaning of what he read
Well I dont know what he told em but it didnt mean anythin to me
But maybe your show is bettern his was she added trying to pacify him
Douglas was undecided whether to feel amused or grateful for Pollys everincreasing sympathy
Before he could trust his twitching lips to answer she had put another question to him
Are you goin to do a stunt while I am here
I preach every Sunday if thats what you mean I preach this morning
Is this Sunday
she asked sitting up with renewed energy and looking about the room as though everything had changed colour
Yes
And YOU GOT A MATINEE
she exclaimed incredulously
We have services he corrected gently
WE rest up on SUNDAYS she said in a tone of deep commiseration
Oh I see he answered feeling it no time to enter upon another discussion as to the comparative advantages of their two professions
What are you goin ter spiel about today
About Ruth and Naomi
Ruth and who
Naomi he repeated
Naomi she echoed tilting her head from side to side as she listened to the soft cadences of the word
I never heard that name afore
It ud look awful swell on a billboard wouldnt it
Its a Bible name honey Mandy said eager to get into the conversation
Dars a balful picture bout her
I seed it
I LIKE to look at PICTURES Polly answered tentatively
Mandy crossed the room to fetch the large Bible with its steel engravings
We got a girl named Ruth in our Leap of Death stunt
Some of the folks is kinder down on er but I aint
She might have told Douglas more of her forlorn little friend but just then Mandy came to the bed hugging a large oldfashioned Bible and Douglas helped to place the ponderous book before the invalid
See honey dar dey is the old woman said pointing to the picture of Ruth and Naomi
Thems crackerjacks aint they
Polly gasped and her eyes shone with wonder
Which one s Ruth
Dis one said Mandy pointing with her thumb
Why theyre dressed just like our chariot drivers
What does it say about em
You can read it for yourself Douglas answered gently
There was something pathetic in the eagerness of the starved little mind
Well I aint much on readinOUT LOUD she faltered growing suddenly conscious of her deficiencies
Read it for me will you
Certainly and he drew his chair nearer to the bed
One strong hand supported the other half of the Bible and his head was very near to hers as his deep full voice pronounced the solemn words in which Ruth pleaded so many years before 
Entreat me not to leave thee  he read  or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge
Thy people shall be my people and thy God my God
 He stopped to ponder over the poetry of the lines
Kind o pretty aint it
Polly said softly
She felt awkward and constrained and a little overawed
There are far more beautiful things than that Douglas assured her enthusiastically as the echo of many such rang in his ears
There are
And her eyes opened wide with wonder
Yes indeed he replied pitying more and more the starvation of mind and longing to bring to it floods of light and enrichment
I guess Id LIKE to hear YOU spiel and she fell to studying him solemnly
You would
he asked eagerly
Is there any more to that story
she asked ignoring his question
Yes indeed
Would you read me a little more
She was very humble now
Where thou diest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part me and thee
 Their eyes met
There was a long pause
Suddenly the sharp sweet notes of the church bell brought John Douglas to his feet with a start of surprise
Have you got to go
Polly asked regretfully
Yes I must but Ill read the rest from the church
Open the window Mandy
And he passed out of the door and quickly down the stairs
Chapter VI WHEN John Douglass uncle offered to educate his nephew for the ministry the boy was less enthusiastic than his mother
He did not remonstrate however for it had been the custom of generations for at least one son of each Douglas family to preach the gospel of Calvinism and his fathers career as an architect and landscape gardener had not left him much capital
Douglas senior had been recognised as an artist by the few who understood his talents but there is small demand for the builder of picturesque houses in the little business towns of the Middle West and at last he passed away leaving his son only the burden of his financial failure and an ardent desire to succeed at the profession in which his father had fared so badly
The hopeless defeated look on the departed mans face had always haunted the boy who was artist enough to feel his fathers genius intuitively and human enough to resent the injustice of his fate
Douglass mother had suffered so much because of the impractical efforts of her husband that she discouraged the early tendencies of the son toward drawing and mathematics and tried to direct his thoughts toward creeds and Bible history
When he went away for his collegiate course she was less in touch with him and he was able to steal time from his athletics to devote to his art
He spent his vacations in a neighbouring city before a drawing board in the office of a distinguished architect his fathers friend
Douglas was not a brilliant divinity student and he was relieved when at last he received his degree in theology and found himself appointed to a small church in the Middle West
His step was very bright the morning he first went up the path that led to his new home
His artistic sense was charmed by the picturesque approach to the church and parsonage
The view toward the treeencircled spire was unobstructed for the church had been built on the outskirts of the town to allow for a growth that had not materialised
He threw up his head and gazed at the blue hills with their background of soft slowmoving clouds
The smell of the fresh earth the bursting of the buds the forming of new life set him thrilling with a joy that was very near to pain
He stopped half way up the path and considered the advantages of a new front to the narrow eaved cottage and when his foot touched the first step of the vinecovered porch he was far more concerned about a new portico than with any thought of his first sermon
His speculations were abruptly cut short by Mandy who bustled out of the door with a wide smile of welcome on her black face and an unmistakable ambition to take him immediately under her motherly wing
She was much concerned because the church people had not met the new pastor at the station and brought him to the house
Upon learning that Douglas had purposely avoided their escort preferring to come to his new home the first time alone she made up her mind that she was going to like him
Mandy had long been a fixture in the parsonage
She and her worse half Hasty Jones had come to know and discuss the weaknesses of the many clergymen who had come and gone the deacons and the congregation both individually and collectively
She confided to Hasty that she didnt blame de new parson fer not wantin to mix up wid dat ar crowd
In the study that night when she and Hasty helped Douglas to unpack his many boxes of books they were as eager as children about the drawings and pictures which he showed them
His mind had gone beyond the parsonage front now and he described to them the advantage of adding an extra ten feet to the church spire
Mandy felt herself almost an artist when she and Hasty bade the pastor good night for she was still quivering from the contagion of Douglass enthusiasm
Here at last was a master who could do something besides find fault with her
I jest wan to be on de groun de firs time dat Mars Douglas and dat ere Deacon Strong clinches she said to Hasty as they locked the doors and turned out the hall light
Did yuh done see his jaw
she whispered
He look laughin enough NOW but jes yuh wait till he done set datere jaw a hisn and afar aint nobody whats goin ter unsot it
Maybe dar aint goin ter be no clinchin said Hasty hoping for Mandys assurance to the contrary
What
shrieked Mandy
Wid dat ere sneakin Widow Willoughby already atellin de deacons how to start de new parson agoin proper
Now why yous always apickin onto dat ere widow
asked Hasty already enjoying the explosion which he knew his defence of the widow was sure to excite
I don like no woman whats allus braggin bout her clean floors answered Mandy shortly
She turned out the last light and tiptoed upstairs trying not to disturb the pastor
John Douglas was busy already with pencil and paper making notes of the plans for the church and parsonage which he would perfect later on
Alas for Douglass day dreams
It was not many weeks before he understood with a heavy heart that the deacons were far too dull and uninspired to share his faith in beauty as an aid to mans spiritual uplift
We think weve done pretty well by this church said Deacon Strong who was the business head the political boss and the moral mentor of the small towns affairs
Just you worry along with the preachin young man and well attend to the buyin and buildin operations
Douglass mind was too active to content itself wholly with the writing of sermons and the routine of formal pastoral calls
He was a keen humanitarian so little by little he came to be interested in the heart stories and disappointments of many of the village unfortunates some of whom were outside his congregation
The mentally sick the despondent who needed words of hope and courage more than dry talks on theology found in him an ever ready friend and adviser and these came to love and depend on him
But he was never popular with the creed bound element of the church
Mandy had her wish about being on the spot the first time that the parsons jaw squared itself at Deacon Strong
The deacon had called at the parsonage to demand that Douglas put a stop to the boys playing baseball in the adjoining lot on Sunday
Douglas had been unable to see the deacons point of view
He declared that baseball was a healthy and harmless form of exercise that the air was meant to be breathed and that the boys who enjoyed the game on Sunday were principally those who were kept indoors by work on other days
The close of the interview was unsatisfactory both to Douglas and the deacon
Dey kinder made me cold an prickly all up an down de back Mandy said later when she described their talk to Hasty
Dat ere deacon don know nuffin bout gittin roun de parson
She tossed her head with a feeling of superiority
She knew the way
Make him forget himself with a laugh
Excite his sympathy with some village underdog
Chapter VII MANDY had secretly enjoyed the commotion caused by the little circusrider being left in the parsonage at first because of her inborn love of mischief and later because Polly had become second in her heart only to the pastor
She went about her work crooning softly during the days of Pollys convalescence
The deep steady voice of the pastor reading aloud in the pretty window overhead was company
She would often climb the stairs to tell them some bit of village gossip and leave them laughing at a quaint comment about some inquisitive sister of the church who had happened to incur her displeasure
As spring came on Douglas carried Polly down to the sunlit garden beneath the window and Mandy fluttered about arranging the cushions with motherly solicitude
More days slipped by and Polly began to creep through the little softleaved trees at the back of the church and to look for the deep blue sweetscented violets
When she was able Douglas took her with him to visit some of the outlying houses of the poor
Her womans instinct was quick to perceive many small needs in their lives that he had overlooked and to suggest simple inexpensive joys that made them her devoted friends
Their evenings were divided between making plans for these unfortunates and reading aloud from the Bible or other books
When Polly gained courage Douglas sometimes persuaded her to read to himand the little corrections that he made at these times soon became noticeable in her manner of speech
She was so eager so starved for knowledge that she drank it as fast as he could give it
It was during their talks about grammar that Mandy generally fell asleep in her rocker her unfinished sewing still in her lap
When a letter came from Jim and Toby it was always shared equally by Mandy and Hasty Polly and the pastor
But at last a letter came from Jim only and Douglas who was asked to read it faltered and stopped after the first few words
Its no use my tryin to keep it from you any longer Poll the letter began we aint got Toby with us no more
He didnt have no accident it wasnt that
He just seemed kinder sick and ailin like ever since the night we had to leave you behind
I used to get him warm drinks and things and try to pull im through but he was always achillin and aachin
If it wasnt one thing the matter it was another
I done all I knowed youd awanted me to an the rest of the folks was mighty white to him too
I guess they kinder felt how lonesome he was
He couldnt get no more laughs in the show so Barker had to put on another man with him
That kinder hurt him tooI sposean showed him the way that things was agoin
It was just after that he wrote the parson atellin him to never let you come back
He seemed to a got an idee in his head that you was happier where you was
He wouldnt let me tell ye bout his feelin so rocky cause he thought it might mebbe make you come back
Shes diffrunt from us he was allus asayin
I never spected to keep er
 Douglas stopped
Polly was waiting her face white and drawn
He had not told her of Tobys letter because with it had come a request to say nothin to the kid
He felt that Polly was controlling herself with an effort until he should reach the end of Jims letter so he hurried on
The parsons promise didnt get to him none too quick he read
That seemed to be what he was waitin for
He give up the night it come and I got him a little room in a hotel after the show and let one of the other fellers get the stuff out o town sos I could stay with him up to the finish
It come round mornin
There wasnt much to ithe just seemed tired and peaceful like
Im glad he wrote what he did he said meanin the parson
She knows she allus knows he whispered meanin you Poll and then he was on his way
Hed already give me what was saved up for you and Im sendin it along with this A blue money order for two hundred and fifty dollars had fluttered from the envelope when Douglas opened it
I got everythin ready afore I went on the next day an I went up and saw the little spot on the hill where they was goin to stow him
It looked kinder nice and the diggers wife said shed put some flowers on to it now and then
It was YOU what made me think o that Poll cause it seemed to me what you would a done you was always so daffy about flowers you and him
I guess this letters too long for me to be asayin much about the show but the Leap aDeath girl got hern last week
She wasnt strong enough for the job nohow
I done what I could for her outside the show cause I knowed how you was always afeelin bout her
I guess the LeapaDeaths husband is goin to jump his job soon if he gets enough saved up cause him and Barker cant hit it off no more
We got a good deal o trouble among the animals too
None o the snakes is sheddin like they ought to and Jumbos acarryin a sixteen foot bandage around that trunk a hisn cause he got too fresh with Trixys grub the other night and the new giraffes got the croup in that sevenfoot neck o hisn
I guess youll think I got the pip for fair this time so Ill just get onto myself now and cut this short
Ill be writin you agin when we hit Morgantown
Your old Muvver Jim
Douglas laid the letter gently on the table his hand still resting upon it
He looked helplessly at the little shrunken figure in the opposite chair
Polly had made no sound but her head had slipped lower and lower and she now sat very quietly with her face in her hands
She had been taught by Toby and Jim never to whimper
What a plucky lot they are thought Douglas as he considered these three lonely souls each accepting whatever fate brought with no rebellion or even surprise
It was a strange world of stoics in which these children of the amusement arena fought and lost
They came and went like phantoms with as little consciousness of their own best interests as of the great moving powers of the world about them
They felt no throes of envy no bitterness
They loved and worked and went their way
For once the pastor was powerless in the presence of grief
Both he and Mandy left the room quietly feeling that Polly wished to be spared the outburst of tears that a sympathetic word might bring upon her
They allowed her to remain alone for a time then Mandy entered softly with a tender good night and Douglas followed her cheerily as though nothing at all had happened
It was many weeks before Polly again became a companion to Douglas and Mandy but they did not intrude upon her grief
They waited patiently for the time when youth should again assert itself and bring back their laughing mate to them
Chapter VIII When Polly understood that Toby was ACTUALLY GONE it seemed to her that she could never laugh again
She had been too young to realise the inevitableness of death when it came to her mother and now she could scarcely believe that Toby would never never come back to her
She felt that she must be able to DRAG him back that she could not go on without him
She wanted to tell him how grateful she was for all his care of her
She thought of the thousand little things that she might have done for him
She longed to recall every impatient word to him
His gentle reproachful eyes were always haunting her
You must come back Toby
she cried
You must
It was only when body and mind had worn themselves out with yearning that a numbness at last crept over her and out of this grew a gradual consciousness of things about her and a returning sense of her obligation to others
She tried to answer in her old smiling way and to keep her mind upon what they were saying instead of letting it wander away to the past
Douglas and Mandy were overjoyed to see the colour creeping back to her cheeks
She joined the pastor again in his visits to the poor
The women of the town would often see them passing and would either whisper to each other shrug their shoulders or lift their eyebrows with smiling insinuations but Polly and the pastor were too much absorbed in each other to take much notice of what was going on about them
They had not gone for their walk today because Mandy had needed Polly to help make ready for the social to be held in the Sunday schoolroom tonight
Early in the afternoon Polly had seen Douglas shut himself up in the study and she was sure that he was writing so when the village children stopped in on the way from school for Mandys newmade cookies she used her customary trick to get them away
Tagyoure it
she cried and then dashed out the back door pursued by the laughing screaming youngsters
Mandy followed the children to the porch and stood looking after them as the mad little band scurried about the back yard darted in and out amongst the trees then up the side of the wooded hill just beyond the church
The leaves once more were red and yellow on the trees but today the air was warm and the children were wearing their summer dresses
Pollys lithe girlish figure looked almost tall by comparison with the children about her
She wore a plain simple gown of white which Mandy had helped her to make
It had been cut ankle length for Polly was now seventeen
Her quaint oldfashioned manner her serious eyes and her trick of knotting her heavy brown hair low on her neck made her seem older
Mandy waited until the children had disappeared over the hill then began bustling about looking for the stepladder which Hasty had left under the vines of the porch
It had been a busy day at the parsonage
A social always meant perturbation for Mandy
She called sharply to Hasty as he came down the path which made a short cut to the village Sos youse back is you
she asked sarcastically
Sure Ise back answered Hasty good naturedly as he sank upon an empty box that had held some things for the social and pretended to wipe the perspiration from his forehead
Masse John done send you to de post office two hours ago said Mandy as she took the letters and papers from his hand
Five minutes is plenty ob time for any nigger to do dat job
I done been detained Hasty drawled
Youse always tained when dars any work agoin on Mandy snapped at him
Whars Miss Polly
Hasty asked ignoring Mandys reference to work
Nebber you mind bout Miss Polly
She dont want you
Jes you done fetch that stepladder into de Sundayschoolroom
But I wants her Hasty insisted
Ise been on very ticular business what she ought to know bout
Business
she repeated
What kind ob business
I got to fix de Sundayschoolroom said Hasty as he perceived her growing curiosity
You come heah nigger
Mandy called determined that none of the village doings should escape her
Out wid it
Well its bout de circus Hasty answered
seating himself again on the box
Deys showin in Wakefield tonight and next month deys comin here
Dat same circus what Miss Polly used to be wid
Mandys eyes grew large with curiosity
De very same and Hasty nodded mysteriously
How you know dat
Mandy was uncertain whether to believe him 
Cause das a big red wagon downtown wid de name ob de show painted on it
Its de advertisin one what goes ahead wid all de pictures what dey pastes up
And you been hangin roun dat wagon
I done thought Miss Polly might want to know
See here lazy nigger don you go puttin no circus notions into Miss Pollys head
She don care no more bout dem things since her Uncle Toby done die
She done been satisfied right whar she am
Jes you let her be
I aint done nothin Hasty protested
Nebber do do nothin growled Mandy
Go long now and get awork
Mos four oclock and dat Sundayschoolroom aint ready yet
Hasty picked up the empty box and the step ladder and went out through the gate
He had barely disappeared when a peal of laughter was heard from the hillside and before Mandy could get out of the way the youngsters came tumbling down the path again
Lawsy lawsy she gasped as Polly circled around her dodging the children
Youse cheeks is red as pineys honey
Tag
youre it
Polly cried as she touched the widows auburnhaired offspring on the sleeve
There was much wailing when Willie passed the tag to little Jennie the smallest girl in the crowd
I wont play no more she sobbed  cause Is always it
To comfort her Polly began to sing an old circus song that the children had learned to love and the little ones huddled about her in a circle to hear of the wonderful Van Amberg who used to walk right into the lions cage and put his head in the lions mouth
The children were in a state of nerves that did credit to Polly as an entertainer when Hasty broke in upon the song
When you get a minute I want ter tell yer somethin
I have one right now
And turning to the eager mites at her side Polly told them to run along into the grove and that shed come pretty soon to teach them a new game
The youngsters went screaming and laughing on their way and she breathed a sigh of relief as she threw herself down on the rustic seat that encircled the elm tree
What is it Hasty
she asked suspecting that he was in trouble with Mandy
Its bout de circus Hasty informed her bluntly
The circus
She rose and crossed to him quickly
Its in Wakefielden nex month its acomin here
Here
Polly gasped
I thought youd want ter know said Hasty little surprised at her lack of enthusiasm
Yes of course
She turned away and pretended to look at the flowers
Don yous tell Mandy I been talkin bout dat circus said Hasty uneasily
He was beginning to fear that he had made a mistake but before Polly could answer Mandy came out of the house carrying baskets and food which Hasty was to take to the Sundayschoolroom
She looked at the girls troubled face and drooping shoulders in surprise
What make you look so serious Honey
Just thinking said Polly absently
My
Don you look fine in your new dress
She was anxious to draw the girl out of her reverie
Do you like it
Polly asked eagerly forgetting her depression of a moment before
Do you think Mr John will like it
Masse John
Mercy me
He nebber takes no notice ob dem things
I done got a bran spankin new allapaca one time an do you think HE ebber seed it
Lawsy no
We might jes well be goin roun like Mudder Eve for all dat man know
Polly looked disappointed
But udder folks sees Mandy continued comfortingly an you certainly look mighty fine
Why yous just as good now as you was afore you got hurled
Yes Im well now and able to work again
There was no enthusiasm in her tone for Hastys news had made her realise how unwelcome the old life would be to her
Work
You does work all de time
My stars
de help you is to Massa John
Do you think so
Do I help him Do I
Of course you does
You tells him things to do in Sundayschool what the chillun like an you learns him to laugh and joy himself an a lot of things what nobody else could alearned im
You mustnt say learned him  Polly corrected you must say taught him
You cant learn anybody anything
You can only teach them
Lordy sakes
I didnt know dat
She rolled her large eyes at her young instructress and saw that Polly looked very serious
Shes gwine ter have anudder one a dem ticlar spells thought Mandy and she made ready to protest
See here aint you nebber She was interrupted by a quick Have you never from Polly
It dun make no difference what you say Mandy snapped so long as folks understands you
She always grew restive under these ordeals but Pollys firm controlled manner generally conquered
Oh yes it does answered Polly
I used to think it didnt but it does
You have to say things in a certain way or folks look down on you
Is satisfied de way I be declared Mandy as she plumped herself down on the garden bench and began to fidget with resentment
The way I am Polly persisted sweetly
See here chile is day why you been asettin up nights an keepin de light burnin
You mustnt say setting up you must say sitting up
Hens set So do I interrupted Mandy Is doin it NOW
For a time she preserved an injured silence then turned upon Polly vehemently
If I had to think ob all dat ere foolishness eber time I open my mouth Id done been tonguetied afore I was born
I could teach you in no time volunteered Polly eagerly
I dont want to be teached protested Mandy doggedly
Hast Jones says Is too smart anyhow
Men dont like women knowin too much it skeers em
Is good enough for my old man and I aint atryin to get nobody elses Mandy wound up flatly
But hed like you all the better persisted Polly laughing
I don WANT to be liked no better by NO nigger snapped Mandy
Is a busy woman I is
She made for the house then curiosity conquered her and she came back to Pollys side
See here honey whose been larnin you all dem nonsense
I learn from Mr Douglas
I remember all the things he tells me and at night I write them down and say them over
Do you see this Mandy
She took a small red book from her belt and put it into Mandys black chubby fists
I see some writin if dats what you mean Mandy answered helplessly
These are my donts Polly confided as she pointed enthusiastically to worn pages of finely written notes
Youse WHAT chile
The things I mustnt do or say
An youse been losin yoah beauty sleep for dem tings
Mandy looked incredulous
I dont want Mr John to feel ashamed of me she said with growing pride
Well youd catch Mandy asettin up for Oh oh
What did I tell you Mandy
Polly pointed reproachfully to the reminder in the little red book
It was a fortunate thing that Willie interrupted the lesson at this point for Mandys temper was becoming very uncertain
The children had grown weary waiting for Polly and Willie had been sent to fetch her
Polly offered to help Mandy with the decorations but Willie won the day and she was running away hand in hand with him when Douglas came out of the house
Wait a minute
he called
My how fine you look
He turned Polly about and surveyed the new gown admiringly
He did see it
He did see it
cried Polly gleefully
Of course I did
I always notice everything dont I Mandy
You suah am improvin since Miss Polly come Mandy grunted
Come Willie
called the girl and ran out laughing through the trees
Whats this
Douglas took the small book from Mandys awkward fingers and began to read Hens set  He frowned
Oh dems jes Miss Pollys donts  interrupted Mandy disgustedly
Her donts
She done been setsitsettin up nights tryin to learn what you done tole her stuttered Mandy
Dear little Polly he murmured then closed the book and put it into his pocket
Chapter IX DOUGLAS was turning toward the house when the Widow Willoughby came through the wicker gate to the left of the parsonage carrying bunting for the social
She was followed by Miss Perkins with a bucket of pickles which Mandy promptly placed on top of Mrs Elversons ice cream
The women explained that they had come to put the finishing touches to the decorations
If anything was needed to increase Mandys dislike of the widow it was this announcement
Mrs Willoughby was greatly worried because her children had not been home since the afternoon school session
Upon learning that they were with Polly she plainly showed her displeasure and Douglas dispatched Mandy for them
She saw that her implied distrust of Polly had annoyed him and she was about to apologise when two of the deacons arrived on the scene also carrying baskets and parcels for the social
Strong led the way
He always led the way and always told Elverson what to think
They had been talking excitedly as they neared the parsonage for Strong disapproved of the recent changes which the pastor had made in the church service
He and Douglas had clashed more than once since the baseball argument and the deacon had realised more and more that he had met a will quite as strong as his own
His failure to bend the parson to his way of thinking was making him irritable and taking his mind from his business
Can you beat that
he would exclaim as he turned away from some disagreement with Douglas his temper ruffled for the day
Polly was utterly unconscious of the unfriendly glances cast in her direction as she came running into the garden leading the widows two children
She nodded gaily to Julia Strong who was coming through the gate then hurried to Mrs Willoughby begging that the children be allowed to remain a little longer
She was making up a new game she said and needed Willie and Jennie for the set
My children do not play in promiscuous games said the widow icily
Oh but this isnt proproproPolly stammered
Its a new game
You put two here and two here and I dont care to know
The widow turned away and pretended to talk to Julia
Oh
gasped Polly stunned by the widows rebuff
She stood with bowed head in the centre of the circle
The blood flew from her cheeks then she turned to go
Douglas stepped quickly to her side
Wait a minute he said
She paused all eyes were turned upon them
Is this a game that grown ups can play
Why yes of course
Good
Then Ill make up your set
I need a little amusement just now
Excuse me he added turning to the deacons
Then he ran with her out through the trees
The deacons and the women stared at each other aghast
Well what do you think of that
said Mrs Willoughby as the flying skirts of the girl and the black figure of the man disappeared up the path
I think its scandalous if you are talking to me said Miss Perkins
The idea of a full grown parson arunnin off to play childrens games with a circus ridin girl
She isnt such a child sneered Julia
Its ENOUGH to make folks talk put in Mrs Willoughby with a sly look at the deacons
And me awaitin to discuss the new church service bellowed Strong
And me awaiting to give him Mrs Elversons message piped Elverson
The church bore all this in silence so long as that girl was sick snapped Miss Perkins
But now shes perfectly well and still ahanging on
No wonder folks are talking
Whos talking
thundered Strong
Didnt you know
simpered Mrs Willoughby not knowing herself nor caring so long as the suspicion grew
Know what
yelled the excited deacon
Mrs Willoughby floundered
Miss Perkins rushed into the breach
Well if I was deacon of this church it seems to me Id know something about whats going on in it
What IS goin on
shrieked the now desperate deacon
The women looked at him pityingly exchanged knowing glances then shook their heads at his hopeless stupidity
Strong was not accustomed to criticism
He prided himself upon his acuteness and was above all vain about his connection with the church
He looked from one woman to the other
He was seething with helpless rage
The little deacon at his side coughed nervously
Strongs pent up wrath exploded
Why didnt YOU tell me Elverson that people was atalkin he roared in the frightened mans ear
Elverson sputtered and stammered but nothing definite came of the sounds so Strong again turned to Miss Perkins What is going on
he demanded
The spinster shrugged her shoulders and lifted her eyes heavenward knowing that nothing could so madden the deacon as this mysterious inference of things too terrible to mention
She was right
Strong uttered a desperate Bah
and began pacing up and down the garden with reckless strides
Mrs Willoughby watched him with secret delight and when he came to a halt she wriggled to his side with simpering sweetness
What COULD folks say
she asked
A minister and a young circus riding girl living here like this with no one to She found no words at this point and Strong now thoroughly roused declared that the congregation should have no further cause for gossip and went out quickly in search of Douglas
When Strong was gone Elverson looked at the set faces of the women and attempted a weak apology for the pastor
I dare say the young man was very lonelyverybefore she came
Lonely
snapped Miss Perkins
Well if HE was LONELY I didnt know it
The deacon excused himself nervously and went to join Strong
The women gathered up their buntings and retired with bland smiles to the Sundayschool room feeling that they had accomplished enough for the time being
Strong and Elverson crossed the yard still in search of the pastor
They turned at the sound of fluttering leaves and beheld Douglas hatless tearing down the path
Strong called to him but Douglas darted quickly behind the hedge
The deacons looked at one another in speechless astonishment
Presently the silence was broken by the distant voice of Polly counting from one to one hundred
The secret was out
The pastor a leader of the church was playing hideandseek
Mr
Douglas
shouted Strong when his breath had returned
Hush hush
whispered Douglas looking over the hedge
He peeped cautiously about him then came toward the men with a sigh of relief
Its all right
She has gone the other way
Itll be a good thing for you if she never comes back said Strong and Douglass quick ear caught an unpleasant meaning in his tone
Whats that
the pastor asked in a low steady voice
We dont like some of the things that are going on here and I want to talk to you about em
Very well but see if you cant talk in a lower key
Never mind about the key shouted Strong angrily
But I DO mind
Something in his eyes made the deacon lower his voice
We want to know how much longer that girl is goin to stay here
Indeed
And why
The colour was leaving Douglass face and his jaw was becoming very square
Because shes been here long enough
I dont agree with you there
Well it dont make no difference whether you do or not
Shes got to go
Go
echoed Douglas
Yes sirebob
Weve made up our minds to that
And who do you mean by we
The members of this congregation replied Strong impatiently
Am I to understand that YOU are speaking for THEM
There was a deep frown between the young pastors eyes
He was beginning to be perplexed
Yes and as deacon of this church
Then as deacon of this church you tell the congregation for me that that is MY affair
Your affair
shouted Strong
When that girl is living under the churchs roof eating the churchs bread
Just one moment
You dont quite understand
I am minister of this church and for that position I receive or am supposed to receive a salary to live on and this parsonage rent free to live in
Any guests that I may have here are MY guests and NOT guests of the church
Remember that please
There was an embarrassing silence
The deacons recalled that the pastors salary WAS slightly in arrears
Elverson coughed meekly
Strong started
You keep out of this Elverson
he cried
Im running this affair and I aint forgetting my duty nor the parsons
I shall endeavour to do MY duty as I see it answered Douglas turning away and dismissing the matter
Your duty is to your church thundered Strong
Youre right about that Deacon Strong answered Douglas wheeling about sharply and my duty to the church is reason enough for my acting exactly as I am doing in this case
Is your duty to the church the ONLY reason you keep that girl here
No there are other reasons
I thought so
Youve heard her storyyou MUST have heard
She was left with me by an old clown who belonged in the circus where she worked
Before he died he asked me to look after her
She has no one else
I shall certainly do so
That was when she was hurt
Shes well now and able to go back where she came from
Do you expect us to have our young folks associatin with a circus ridin girl
So thats it
cried the pastor with a pitying look
You think this child is unfit for your homes because she was once in a circus
For some reason circus to you spells crime
You call yourself a Christian Deacon Strong and yet you insist that I send a good innocent girl back to a life which you say is sinful
Im ashamed of you StrongIm ashamed of you
That talk dont do no good with me roared Strong
He was desperate at being accused of an unchristian attitude
I aint askin you to send her back to the circus
I dont care WHERE you send her
Get her away from HERE thats all
Not so long as she wishes to stay
You wont
Strong saw that he must try a new attack
He came close to Douglas and spoke with a marked insinuation
If you was a friend to the girl you wouldnt want the whole congregation apointin fingers at her
What do you mean
I mean that youre living here alone with her and it looks badbad for the girl and bad for YOUand folks is talkin
Are you trying to tell me that my people are evilminded enough to think that I Douglas stopped
He could not frame the question
I dont believe it he concluded shortly
Youll be MADE to believe it if you dont get rid of that girl
Do YOU believe it
He turned upon the little man at his side
Do you believe it Elverson
Elverson had been so accustomed to Strong monopolising the conversation that he had become hopelessly lost as the discussion went on and the sudden appeal to him all but paralysed his power of speech
He was still gurgling and sputtering when Strong interrupted impatiently
It makes no difference whether we believe it or not
Were going to do our duty by the church and that girl must leave or Or I must
Douglas pieced out Strongs phrase for himself
That threat doesnt frighten me at all deacon
After what you have said I should refuse to remain in this church the deacon stepped forward eagerlywere it not that I realise more than ever before how much you need me how much you ignorant narrow minded creatures need to be taught the meaning of true Christianity
The deacon was plainly disappointed
Is it possible
gasped Elverson weakly
Well what are you going to do about it
asked Strong when he could trust himself to speak again
I shall do what is best for Miss Polly said the pastor quietly but firmly
He turned away to show that the interview was at an end
Strong followed him
Douglas pointed to the gate with a meaning not to be mistaken
Good afternoon deacon
Strong hesitated
He looked at the pastor then at the gate then at the pastor again
Ill go he shouted but it aint the end
He slammed the gate behind him
Quite so quite so chirped Elverson not having the slightest idea of what he was saying
He saw the frigid expression on the pastors face he coughed behind his hat and followed Strong
Chapter X Douglas dropped wearily onto the rustic bench
He sat with drooped head and unseeing eyes
He did not hear Polly as she scurried down the path her arms filled with autumn leaves
She glanced at him dropped the brightcoloured foliage and slipped quickly to the nearest tree
One two three for Mr John she cried as she patted the huge brown trunk
Is that you Polly
he asked absently
Now its your turn to catch me she said lingering near the tree
The pastor was again lost in thought
Arent you going to play any more
There was a shade of disappointment in her voice
She came slowly to his side
Sit here Polly he answered gravely pointing to a place on the bench
I want to talk to you
Now Ive done something wrong she pouted
She gathered up her garlands and brought them to a place near his feet ignoring the seat at his side
You might just as well tell me and get it over
You couldnt do anything wrong he answered looking down at her
Oh yes I couldand Ive done itI can see it in your face
What is it
What have you there
he asked trying to gain time and not knowing how to broach the subject that in justice to her must be discussed
Some leaves to make garlands for the social Polly answered more cheerfully
Would you mind holding this
She gave him one end of a string of leaves
Where are the children
Gone home
You like the children very much dont you Polly
Douglas was striving for a path that might lead them to the subject that was troubling him
Oh no I dont LIKE them I LOVE them
She looked at him with tender eyes
Youre the greatest baby of all
A puzzled line came between his eyes as he studied her more closely
And yet youre not such a child are you Polly
Youre quite grown up almost a young lady
He looked at her from a strange unwelcome point of view
She was all of that as she sat at his feet yearning and slender and fair at the turning of her seventeenth year
I wonder how you would like to go way
Her eyes met his in terror
Away to a great school he added quickly flinching from the very first hurt that he had inflicted where there are a lot of other young ladies
Is it a place where you would be
She looked up at him anxiously
She wondered if his show was about to move on
Im afraid not Douglas answered smiling in spite of his heavy heart
I wouldnt like any place without you she said decidedly and seemed to consider the subject dismissed
But if it was for your GOOD Douglas persisted
It could never be for my good to leave you
But just for a little while he pleaded
How was she ever to understand
How could he take from her the sense of security that he had purposely taught her to feel in his house
Not even for a moment Polly answered with a decided shake of her head
But you must get ahead in your studies he argued
She looked at him anxiously
She was beginning to be alarmed at his persistence
Maybe Ive been playing too many periscous games
Not periscous Polly promiscuous
Promiscuous she repeated haltingly
What does that mean
Indiscriminate
He rubbed his forehead as he saw the puzzled look on her face
Mixed up he explained more simply
Our game wasnt mixed up
She was thinking of the one to which the widow had objected
Is it promiscuous to catch somebody
It depends upon whom you catch he answered with a dry whimsical smile
Well I dont catch anybody but the children
She looked up at him with serious inquiring eyes
Never mind Polly
Your games arent promiscuous
She did not hear him
She was searching for her book
Is this what you are looking for
he asked drawing the missing article from his pocket
Oh
cried Polly with a flush of embarrassment
Mandy told you
Youve been working a long time on that
I thought I might help you if I learned everything you told me she answered timidly
But I dont suppose I could
I can never tell you how much you help me Polly
Do I
she cried eagerly
I can help more if you will only let me
I can teach a bigger class in Sundayschool now
I got to the book of Ruth today
You did
He pretended to be astonished
He was anxious to encourage her enthusiasm
Um hum
She answered solemnly
A dreamy look came into her eyes
Do you remember the part that you read to me the first day I came
He nodded
He was thinking how carefree they were that day
How impossible such problems as the present one would have seemed then
I know every bit of what you read by heart
Its our next Sundayschool lesson
So it is
Do you think now that it would be best for me to go away
She looked up into his troubled face
Well see well see he murmured then tried to turn her mind toward other things
Come now lets find out whether you DO know your Sundayschool lesson
How does it begin
There was no answer
She had turned away with trembling lips
And Ruth saidhe took her two small hands and drew her face toward him meaning to prompt her
Entreat me not to leave thee she pleaded
Her eyes met his
His face was close to hers
The small features before him were quivering with emotion
She was so frail so helpless so easily within his grasp
His muscles grew tense and his lips closed firmly
He was battling with an impulse to draw her toward him and comfort her in the shelter of his strong brave arms
They shant
he cried starting toward her
Polly drew back overawed
Her soul had heard and seen the things revealed to each of us only once
She would never again be a child
Douglas braced himself against the back of the bench
What was the rest of the lesson
he asked in a firm hard voice
I cant say it now Polly murmured
Her face was averted her white lids fluttered and closed
Nonsense of course you can
Come come Ill help you
Douglas spoke sharply
He was almost vexed with her and with himself for the weakness that was so near overcoming them
And Ruth said Entreat me not to leave thee   Or to return from following after thee
 She was struggling to keep back the tears 
For whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge
Thy people shall be my people and thy God my  She stopped
Thats right go on said Douglas striving to control the unsteadiness in his own voice
Where thou diest will I die her arms went out blindly
Oh you wont send me away will you
she sobbed
I dont want to learn anything else justexceptfrom you
She covered her face and slipped a little broken heap at his feet
In an instant the pastors strong arms were about her his stalwart body was supporting her
You shant go away
I wont let youI wont
Do you hear me Polly
I wont
Her breath was warm against his cheek
He could feel her tears her arms about him as she clung to him helplessly sobbing and quivering in the shelter of his strong embrace
You are never going to leave menever
A new purpose had come into his life the realisation of a new necessity and he knew that the fight which he must henceforth make for this child was the same that he must make for himself
Chapter XI Ise goin into de Sundayschoolroom to take off dat ere widows finishin touches said Mandy as she came down the steps
All right
called Douglas
Take these with you perhaps they may help
He gathered up the garlands which Polly had left on the ground
His eyes were shining he looked younger than Mandy had ever seen him
Polly had turned her back at the sound of Mandys voice and crossed to the elm tree drying her tears of happiness and trying to control her newly awakened emotions
Douglas felt intuitively that she needed this moment for recovery so he piled the leaves and garlands high in Mandys arms then ran into the house with the light step of a boy
I got the setsitsettin room all tidied up said Mandy as she shot a sly glance at Polly
Thats good Polly answered facing Mandy at last and dimpling and blushing guiltily
Mos de sociable folks will mos likely be hangin roun de parsonage tonight stead ob stayin in de Sundayschoolroom whar dey belongs
Las time dat ere Widow Willoughby done set aroun all ebenin atellin de parson as how folks could jes eat offn her kitchen floor an I ups an tells her as how folks could pick up a good squar meal offn MANDYS floor too
Guess shell be mighty careful what she says afore Mandy tonight
She chuckled as she disappeared down the walk to the Sundayschool room
Polly stood motionless where Mandy had left her
She hardly knew which way to turn
She was happy yet afraid
She felt like sinking upon her knees and begging God to be good to her to help her
She who had once been so independent so selfreliant now felt the need of direction from above
She was no longer master of her own soul something had gone from her something that would never never come again
While she hesitated Hasty came through the gate looking anxiously over his shoulder
Well Hasty
she said for it was apparent that Hasty had something important on his mind
Its de big one from de circus he whispered excitedly
The big one
You know De one what brung you
You dont mean
Pollys question was answered by Jim himself who had followed Hasty quickly through the gate
Their arms were instantly about each other
Jim forgot Hasty and every one in the world except Polly and neither of them noticed the horrified Miss Perkins and the Widow Willoughby who had been crossing the yard on their way from the Sunday schoolroom with Julia
Youre just as big as ever said Polly when she could let go of Jim long enough to look at him
You havent changed a bit
Youve changed enough for both of us
He looked at the unfamiliar long skirts and the new way of doing her hair
Youre bigger Poll more grown up like
Oh Jim
She glanced admiringly at the new brown suit the rather startling tie and the neat little posy in Jims buttonhole
The fellows said Id have to slick up a bit if I was acomin to see you so as not to make you ashamed of me
Do you like em
he asked looking down approvingly at his new brown clothes
Very much
For the first time Jim noticed the unfamiliar manner of her speech
He began to feel selfconscious
A year ago she would have said You bet
He looked at her awkwardly
She hurried on Hasty told me you were showing in Wakefield
I knew youd come to see me
Hows Barker and all the boys
She stopped with a catch in her throat and added more slowly I suppose everythings different now that Toby is gone
Hed aliked to aseen you afore he cashed in Jim answered but maybe it was just as well he didnt
Youd hardly aknowed him toward the last he got so thin an peeked like
He wasnt the same after we lost you nobody was not even Bingo
Have you still got Bingo
she asked through her tears
Yep we got him drawled Jim but he aint much good no more
None of the other riders can get used to his gait like you was
There aint nobody with the show what can touch you ridin there never will be
Say mebbe you think Barker wont let out a yell when he sees yer comin back
Jim was jubilant now and he let out a little yell of his own at the mere thought of her return
He was too excited to notice the look on Pollys face
Toby had a notion before he died that you was never acomin back but I told him Id change all that once I seed yer and when Barker sent me over here today to look arter the advertisin he said he guessed youd had all you wanted a church folks
Jes you bring her along to Wakefield he said an tell her that her place is waitin for her and I will too
He turned upon Polly with sudden decision
Why I feel jes like pickin yer up in my arms and carryin you right off now
Wait Jim
She put one tiny hand on his arm to restrain him
I dont meannottodaymebbehe stammered uncertainly but well be back here ashowin next month
Dont look at me now Polly answered as the doglike eyes searched her face because I have to say something that is going to hurt you Jim
Youre comin aint yer Poll
The big face was wrinkled and careworn with trouble
No Jim she replied in a tone so low that he could scarcely hear her
You mean that you aint NEVER comin back
He tried to realise what such a decision might mean to him
No Jim
She answered tenderly for she dreaded the pain that she must cause the great goodhearted fellow
You mustnt care like that she pleaded seeing the blank desolation that had come into his face
It isnt because I dont love you just the same and it was good of Barker to keep my place for me but I cant go back
He turned away she clung to the rough brown sleeve
Why Jim when I lie in my little room up there at nightshe glanced toward the window above themand everything is peaceful and still I think how it used to be in the old days the awful noise and the rush of it all the cheerless wagons the mob in the tent the ring with its blazing lights the whirling round and round on Bingo and the hoops always the hoops till my head got dizzy and my eyes all dim and then the hurry after the show and the heat and the dust or the mud and the rain and the rumble of the wheels in the plains at night and the shrieks of the animals and then the parade the awful awful parade and I riding through the streets in tights Jim
Tights
She covered her face to shut out the memory
I couldnt go back to it Jim
I just couldnt
She turned away her face still hidden in her hands
He looked at her a long while in silence
I didnt know how youd come to feel about it he said doggedly
You arent ANGRY Jim
She turned to him anxiously her eyes pleading for his forgiveness
Angry
he echoed almost bitterly
I guess it couldnt ever come to that atween you an me
Ill be all right
He shrugged his great shoulders
Its just kinder sudden thats all
You see I never figured on givin yer up and when you said you wasnt comin back it kinder seemed as though I couldnt see nothin all my life but long dusty roads and nobody in em
But its all right now and Ill just be gettin along to the wagon
But Jim you havent seen Mr Douglas Polly protested trying to keep him with her until she could think of some way to comfort him
Ill look in on him comin back said Jim anxious to be alone with his disappointment
He was out of the gate before she could stop him
Hurry back wont you Jim
Ill be waiting for you
She watched him going quickly down the road his fists thrust into his brown coat pockets and his hat pulled over his eyes
He did not look back as he used to do to wave a parting farewell and she turned toward the house with a troubled heart
She had reached the lower step when Strong and Elverson approached her from the direction of the church
Was that feller here to take you back to the circus
demanded Strong
She opened her lips to reply but before she could speak Strong assured her that the congregation wouldnt do anything to stop her if she wished to go
He saw the blank look on her face
We aint tryin to pry into none of your private affairs he explained but my daughter saw you and that there feller a makin up to each other
If youre calculatin to run away with him youll save a heap of trouble for the parson by doin it quick
The parson
YOU cant blame the congregation for not wantin him to keep you here
You got sense enough to see how it looks
HED see it too if he wasnt just plain bullheaded
Well hed better get over his stubbornness right now if he dont well get another minister thats all
Another minister
You dont mean
It was clear enough now
She recalled Douglass troubled look of an hour ago
She remembered how he had asked if she couldnt go away
It was this that he meant when he promised not to give her up no matter what happened
In an instant she was at the deacons side pleading and terrified
You wouldnt get another minister
Oh please Deacon Strong listen to me listen
You were right about Jim he DID come to get me and I am going back to the circusonly you wont send Mr Douglas away you wont
Say you wont
She was searching his eyes for mercy
It wasnt HIS fault that I kept staying on
He didnt know how to get rid of me
He DID try he tried only today
So hes comin round sneered Strong
Yes yes and you wont blame him any more will you
she hurried on anxiously
Youll let him stay no matter what he does if I promise to go away and never never come back again
I aint holdin no grudge agin him Strong grumbled
He talks pretty rough sometimes but hes been a good enough minister
I aint forgettin that
Oh thank you Mr Strong thank you
Ill get my things it wont take a minute
She was running up the steps when a sudden thought stopped her
She returned quickly to Strong
Wed better not let him know just yet
You can tell him afterward
Tell him that I ran away Tell him that She was interrupted by Douglas who came from the house
Hello Strong back again
he asked in some surprise
Polly remained with her eyes fixed upon the deacon searching for some way of escape
The pastor approached she burst into nervous laughter
Whats the joke
Douglas asked
Its only a little surprise that the deacon and I are planning
She tried to control the catch in her voice
Youll know about it soon wont he deacon
Good afternoon Mr
Strong
She flew into the house laughing hysterically
Douglas followed her to the steps with a puzzled frown
It was unlike Polly to give way to her moods before others
Have you gentlemen changed your minds about the little girl staying on
he asked uneasily
Its all right now said Strong seating himself with a complacent air
All right
How so
questioned Douglas more and more puzzled by the deacons evident satisfaction
Because said Strong rising and facing the pastor because your circusridin gal is goin to leave you of her own accord
Have you been talking to that girl
asked Douglas sternly
I have said Strong holding his ground
See here deacon if youve been browbeating that child I may forget that Im a minister
The knuckles on Douglass large fists grew whiter
Shes goin I tell yer and it aint because of what I said either
Shes goin back to the circus
I dont believe you
You would abelieved me if youd seen the fellow that was just acallin on her and her ahuggin and akissin of him and apromisin that shed be awaitin for him here when he come back
You lie
cried Douglas taking a step toward the retreating deacon
Theres the fellow now cried Strong as he pointed to the gate
Suppose you ask him afore yer call me a liar
Douglas turned quickly and saw Jim approaching
His face lighted up with relief at the sight of the big lumbering fellow
How are yer Mr
Douglas
said Jim awkwardly
Youve seen Polly
asked Douglas shaking Jim cordially by the hand
Yes Ive seen her
The deacon here has an idea that Polly is going back to the circus with you
He nodded toward Strong almost laughing at the surprise in store for him
Back to the circus
asked Jim
Did she say anything to you about it
He was worried by the bewilderment in Jims manner
Before Jim could reply Polly who had reached the steps in time to catch the last few words slipped quickly between them
She wore her coat and hat and carried a small brown satchel
Of course I did didnt I Jim
she said turning her back upon the pastor and motioning to Jim not to answer
Douglas gazed at her in astonishment
What do you mean
he asked in a hoarse strained voice
He glanced at the coat and hat
Where are you going
Polly avoided his eyes and continued nervously to Jim
What made you come back
Why didnt you wait for me down the street
Now youve spoiled everything
She pretended to be very vexed with him
The big fellow looked puzzled
He tried to protest but she put a warning finger to her lips and pressed the little brown satchel into his hand
Its no use she went on hurriedly
We might as well tell them everything now
She turned to Douglas and pretended to laugh
You have found us out
The deacons were slightly uneasy the frown on Douglass forehead was deepening
Oh see how serious he looks she teased with a toss of her head toward the grimvisaged pastor
Is this some trick
he demanded sternly
Dont be angry she pleaded
Wish me luck
She held out one small hand he did not take it
She wavered then she felt the eyes of the deacons upon her
Courage returned and she spoke in a firm clear voice I am going to run away
Douglas stepped before her and studied her keenly
Run away
he exclaimed incredulously
Yes to the circus with Jim
You couldnt DO such a thing he answered excitedly
Why only a moment ago you told me you would never leave me
Oh but that was a moment ago she cried in a strained high voice
That was before Jim came
You see I didnt know HOW I felt until I saw Jim and heard all about my old friends how Barker is keeping my place for me and how they all want to see me
And I want to see them and to hear the music and the laughter and the clown songs Oh the clown songs
She waltzed about humming the snatch of melody that Mandy had heard the morning that Polly first woke in the parsonage
Ting ling
Thats how the bells ring Ting ling pretty young thing She paused her hands clasped behind her head and gazed at them with a brave little smile
Oh its going to be fine
Fine
You dont know what youre doing said Douglas
He seized her roughly by the arm
Pain was making him brutal
I wont LET you go
Do you hear me
I wontnot until youve thought it over
I have thought it over Polly answered meeting his eyes and trying to speak lightly
Her lips trembled
She could not bear for him to think her so ungrateful
She remembered his great kindness the many thoughtful acts that had made the past year so precious to her
Youve been awfully good to me Mr
John
She tried to choke back a sob
Ill never forget itnever
Ill always feel the same toward you
But you mustnt ask me to stay
I want to get back to them that knew me firstto my OWN
Circus folks arent cut out for parsons homes and I was born in the circus
I love itI love it
She felt her strength going and cried out wildly I want Bingo
I want to go round and round the ring
I want the lights and the music and the hoops
I want the shrieks of the animals and the rumble of the wheels in the plains at night
I want to ride in the big parade
I want to live and diejust dieas circus folks die
I want to go back
I want to go back
She put out one trembling hand to Jim and rushed quickly through the gate laughing and sobbing hysterically and calling to him to follow
Chapter XII LONELY days followed Pollys desertion of the parsonage
Mandy went about her duties very quietly feeling that the little comments which once amused the pastor had now become an interruption to thoughts in which she had no part
He would sit for hours with his head in his hands taking no notice of what passed before him
She tried to think of new dishes to tempt his appetite and shook her head sadly as she bore the untasted food back to the kitchen
She sometimes found a portfolio of drawings lying open upon his study table
She remembered the zeal with which he had planned to remodel the church and parsonage when he first came to them how his enthusiasm had gradually died for lack of encouragement and how he had at last put his books in a cupboard where they grew dusty from long neglect
She marvelled at their reappearance now but something in his set faraway look made her afraid to inquire
Thus she went on from day to day growing more impatient with Hasty and more silent with the pastor
Mandy needed humor and companionship to oil the wheels of her humdrum life there was no more laughter in the house and she began to droop
Polly had been away from the parsonage a month when the complacency of the village was again upset by the arrival of the Great American Circus
There were many callers at the parsonage that day for speculation was now at fever heat about the pastor
Would he try to see her
had he forgotten her
and what had he ever found in her
were a few of the many questions that the women were asking each other
Now that the cause of their envy was removed they would gladly have reinstated the pastor as their idol for like all truly feminine souls they could not bear to see a man unhappy without wishing to comfort him nor happy unless they were the direct cause of his state
How dare any man be happy without me
has been the cry of each woman since Eve was created to mate with Adam
Douglas had held himself more and more aloof from the day of Pollys disappearance
He expressed no opinion about the deacons or their recent disapproval of him
He avoided meeting them oftener than duty required and Strong felt so uncomfortable and tonguetied in his presence that he too was glad to make their talks as few as possible
Nothing was said about the pastors plans for the future or about his continued connection with the church and the inquisitive sisterhood was on the point of exploding from an over accumulation of unanswered questions
He delivered his sermons conscientiously called upon his poor listened to the sorrows real and fancied of his parishioners and shut himself up with his books or walked alone on the hill behind the church
He had been absent all day when Mandy looked out on the circus lot for the dozenth time and saw that the afternoon performance was closing
It had driven her to desperation to learn that Miss Polly was not in the parade that morning and to know that the pastor had made no effort to find out about her
For weeks both she and Hasty had hoped that the return of the circus might bring Polly back to them but now it was nearly night and there had been no word from her
Why didnt she come running in to see them as Mandy had felt so sure she would
Why had the pastor stayed away on the hills all day
Unanswered questions were always an abomination to Mandy so finally she drew a quarter from the knotted gingham rag that held her small wad of savings and told Hasty to go long to de show and find out bout Miss Polly
She was anxiously waiting for him when Deacon Strong knocked at the door for the second time that afternoon
Is Mr Douglas back yet
he asked
No sah he aint said Mandy very shortly
She felt that Strong and Elverson had been atryin to spy on de parson all day and she resented their visits more than she usually did
What time are you expectin him
I dont nebber spec Massa Douglas till I sees him
Strong grunted uncivilly and went down the steps
She saw from the window that he met Elverson in front of the church
Dey sure am ameanin trouble she mumbled
The band had stopped playing the last of the audience had straggled down the street
She opened the door and stood on the porch the house seemed to suffocate her
What was keeping Hasty
He came at last but Mandy could tell from his gait that he brought unwelcome news
Aint she dar
Shes wid em all right said Hasty
Yuh seed her
Naw I didnt done SEED her
What
She want in de show
What you jes tell me
Shes atrabbelin wid em Mandy but she didnt done ride
See heah Hasty Jones is dat ere chile sick
I don rightly know said Hasty
A great big man what wored clothes like a gemmen comed out wid a whip in his hand and says as how hes bliged to nounce anudder gal in Miss Pollys place
An den he says as how de udder gal was jes as good an den everybody look disappinted like an den out comes de udder gal on a hoss an do tricks an I aint heard no more bout Miss Polly
Why didnt you done ask somebody
Warnt nobody ter ask but de man what wuz hurryin everbody to get out of de tent
I done ast him but he say as didnt I git ma moneys worth
an den ebberbody laugh an he shove me long wid de rest of de folks an here I is
Shes sick dats what I says Mandy declared excitedly an somebodys got to do somethin
I done all I knowed drawled Hasty fearing that Mandy was regretting her twentyfivecent investment
Go long out an fix up dat ere kitchen fire was Mandys impatient reply
I got to keep dem vittels warm fer Massa John
She wished to be alone so that she could think of some way to get hold of Polly
Dat baby faced morninglory done got Mandy all wobbly bout de heart she declared to herself as she crossed to the window for a sight of the pastor
It was nearly dark when she saw him coming slowly down the path from the hill
She lighted the studylamp rearranged the cushions and tried to make the room look cheery for his entrance
He stopped in the hall and hung up his hat
There was momentary silence
Would he shut himself in his room for the night or would he come into the study
At last the door opened and Mandy hastened to place a chair for him
Ahs fraid youse mighty tired she said
Oh no answered Douglas absently
Mebbe youd like Mandy to be sarvin your supper in here tonight
Its more cheerfuller
The sideshowman was already beginning his spiel in the lot below
The lemonade venderssic and the popcorn sellers were heard crying their wares
Douglas did not answer her
She bustled from the room declaring she was jes goin ter bring him a morsel
He crossed to the window and looked out upon the circus lot
The flare of the torches and the red fire came up to meet his pale tense face
How like the picture of thirteen months ago he thought and old Tobys words came back to him The show has got to go on
Above the church steeple the moon was battling its way through the clouds
His eyes travelled from heaven to earth
There was a spirit of unreality in it all
Something made him mistrust himself his very existence
He longed to have done with dreams and speculation to feel something tangible warm and real within his grasp
I cant go on like this
he cried
I cant
He turned from the window and walked hurriedly up and down the room indoors or out he found no rest
He threw himself in the armchair near the table and sat buried in thought
Mandy came softly into the room
She was followed by Hasty who carried a tray laden with things that ought to have tempted any man
She motioned for Hasty to put the tray on the table and then began arranging the dishes
Hasty stole to the window and peeped out at the tempting flare of red fire
When Douglas discovered the presence of his two faithfuls he was touched with momentary contrition
He knew that he often neglected to chat with them now and he made an effort to say something that might restore the old feeling of comradeship
Have you had a hard day with the new gravel walk
he asked Hasty remembering that he had been laying a fresh path to the Sundayschool room
Hasty glanced uneasily at Mandy afraid either to lie or tell the truth about the disposition she had made of his afternoon
Jes you come eat yo supper Mandy called to Douglas
Don yous worry your head bout dat lazy husban ob mine
He ain goin ter work nuff
to hurt hisself
For an instant she had been tempted to let the pastor know how Hasty had gone to the circus and seen nothing of Polly but her motherly instinct won the day and she urged him to eat before disturbing him with her own anxieties
It was no use
He only toyed with his food he was clearly ill at ease and eager to be alone
She gave up trying to tempt his appetite and began to lead up in a roundabout way to the things which she wished to ask
Dars quite some racket out dar in de lot tonight she said Douglas did not answer
After a moment she went on Hasty didnt work on no walk today
Douglas looked at her quizzically while Hasty convinced that for reasons of her own she was going to get him into trouble was making frantic motions
He done gone to de circus she blurted out
Douglass face became suddenly grave
Mandy saw that she had touched an open wound
I jes couldnt stan it Massa John
I HAD to find out bout dat angel chile
There was a pause
She felt that he was waiting for her to go on
She didnt done ride today
He looked up with the eyes of a dumb persecuted animal
And de gemmen in de show didnt tell nobody whyjes speaked about de udder gal takin her place
Why DIDNT she ride
cried Douglas in an agony of suspense
Dats what I don know sah
Mandy began to cry
It was the first time in his experience that Douglas had ever known her to give way to any such weakness
He walked up and down the room uncertain what to do
Hasty came down from the window and tried to put one arm about Mandys shoulders
Leab me alone you nigga
she exclaimed trying to cover her tears with a show of anger that she did not feel then she rushed from the room followed by Hasty
The band was playing loudly the din of the night performance was increasing
Douglass nerves were strained to a point of breaking
He would not let himself go near the window
He stood by the side of the table his fists clenched and tried to beat back the impulse that was pulling him toward the door
Again and again he set his teeth
It was uncertainty that gnawed at him so
Was she ill
Could she need him
Was she sorry for having left him
Would she be glad if he went for her and brought her back with him
He recalled the hysterical note in her behaviour the day that she went away how she had pleaded only a few moments before Jim came never to be separated from him
Had she really cared for Jim and for the old life
Why had she never written
Was she ashamed
Was she sorry for what she had done
What could it mean
He threw his hands above his head with a gesture of despair
A moment later he passed out into the night
Chapter XIII JIM was slow tonight
The big show was nearly over yet many of the props used in the early part of the bill were still unloaded
He was tinkering absentmindedly with one of the wagons in the back lot and the men were standing about idly waiting for orders when Barker came out of the main tent and called to him sharply Hey there Jim
Whats your excuse to night
Excuse for what
Jim crossed slowly to Barker
The cook tent was started half an hour late and the side show top aint loaded yet
Your wagons is on the bum thats what
Number thirtyeight carries the cook tent and the blacksmith has been tinkering with it all day
Ask HIM what shape its in
Youre always stallin was Barkers sullen complaint
Its the wagons or the black smiths or anything but the truth
I know whats the matter all right
What do you mean by that
asked Jim sharply
I mean that all your times took up acarryin and afetchin for that girl what calls you Muvver Jim
 What have yer got to say about her
Jim eyed him with a threatening look
I got aplenty said Barker as he turned to snap his whip at the small boys who had stolen into the back lot to peek under the rear edge of the big top
Shes been about as much good as a sick cat since she come back
You saw her act last night
Yes answered Jim doggedly
Wasnt it punk
She didnt show at ALL this afternoonsaid she was sick
And me with all them people inside what knowed her waitin ter see er
Give her a little time Jim pleaded
She aint rode for a year
Time
shouted Barker
How much does she want
Shes been back a month and instead o bracin up shes agettin worse
Theres only one thing for me to do
Whats that
asked Jim uneasily
Im goin ter call her and call her hard
Look here Barker and Jim squared his shoulders as he looked steadily at the other man youre boss here and I takes orders from you but if I catches you abusin Poll your bein boss wont make no difference
You cant bluff me shouted Barker
I aint bluffin Im only TELLIN yer said Jim very quietly
Well you TELL her to get onto her job
If she dont she quits thats all
He hurried into the ring
Jim took one step to follow him then stopped and gazed at the ground with thoughtful eyes
He too had seen the change in Polly
He had tried to rouse her it was no use
She had looked at him blankly
If she would only complain he said to himself
If she would only get mad anything anything to wake her
But she did not complain
She went through her daily routine very humbly and quietly
She sometimes wondered how Jim could talk so much about her work but before she could answer the question her mind drifted back to other days to a garden and flowers and Jim stole away unmissed and left her with folded hands and wide staring eyes gazing into the distance
The memory of these times made Jim helpless tonight
He had gone on hoping from day to day that Barker might not notice the letdown in her work and now the blow had fallen
How could he tell her
One of the acts came tumbling out of the main tent
There was a moments confusion as clowns acrobats and animals passed each other on their way to and from the ring then the lot cleared again and Polly came slowly from the dressing tent
She looked very different from the little girl whom Jim had led away from the parsons garden in a simple white frock one month before
Her thin pensive face contrasted oddly with her glittering attire
Her hair was knotted high on her head and intertwined with flowers and jewels
Her slender neck seemed scarcely able to support its burden
Her short full skirt and low cut bodice were ablaze with white and coloured stones
Whats on Jim
she asked
The Leap o Death
 You got plenty a time
Pollys mind went back to the girl who answered that call a year ago
Her spirit seemed very near tonight
The band stopped playing
Barker made his grandiloquent announcement about the wonderful act about to be seen and her eyes wandered to the distant church steeple
The moonlight seemed to shun it tonight
It looked cold and grim and dark
She wondered whether the solemn bell that once called its flock to worship had become as mute as her own dead heart
She did not hear the whirr of the great machine inside the tent as it plunged through space with its girl occupant
These things were a part of the daily routine part of the strange vague dream through which she must stumble for the rest of her life
Jim watched her in silence
Her face was turned from him
She had forgotten his presence
Star gazin Poll
he asked at length dreading to disturb her revery
I guess I was Jim
She turned to him with a little forced smile
He longed to save her from Barkers threatened rebuke
How yer feelin tonight
Im all right she answered cheerfully Anythin yer want
Want
she turned upon him with startled eyes
There was so much that she wanted that the mere mention of the word had opened a well of pain in her heart
I mean can I do anythin for you
Oh of course not
She remembered how little ANY ONE could do
What is it Poll
he begged but she only turned away and shook her head with a sigh
He followed her with anxious eyes
What made yer cut out the show today
Was it because you didnt want ter ride afore folks what knowed yer
Ride afore HIM mebbe
HIM
Her face was white
Jim feared she might swoon
You dont mean that he was Oh no he answered quickly of course not
Parsons dont come to places like this one
I was only figurin that yer didnt want OTHER folks to see yer and to tell him how you was ridin
She did not answer
Was that it Poll
he urged
I dont know
She stared into space
Was it
I guess it was she said after a long time
I knowed it he cried
I was a fool to abrung you back
Yer dont belong with us no more
Oh dont Jim
dont
Dont make me feel Im in the way here too
Here too
He looked at her in astonishment
Yer wasnt in HIS way was yer Poll
Yes Jim
She saw his look of unbelief and continued hurriedly
Oh I tried not to be
I tried so hard
He used to read me verses out of a Bible about my way being his way and my people his people but it isnt so Jim
Your way is the way you are born and your people are the people you are born with and you cant change it Jim no matter how hard you try
YOU was changin it he answered savagely
You was gettin jes like them people
It was me what took yer away and spoiled it all
You oughtnt to a come
What made yer after yer said yer wouldnt
She did not answer
Strange things were going through the mind of the slowwitted Jim
He braced himself for a difficult question
Will yer answer me somethin straight
he asked
Why of course she said as she met his gaze
Do you love the parson Poll
She started
Is that it
Her lids fluttered and closed she caught her breath quickly her lips apart then looked far into the distance
Yes Jim Im afraidthats it
The little figure drooped and she stood before him with lowered eyes unarmed
Jim looked at her helplessly then shook his big stupid head
Aint that hell
It seemed such a short time to Jim since he had picked her up a cooing babe at her dead mothers side
He watched the tender averted face
Things had turned out so differently from what he had planned
And he didnt care about youlike that
he asked after a pause
No not in that way
She was anxious to defend the pastor from even the thought of such a thing
He was good and kind always but he didnt care THAT WAY
Hes not like that
I guess Ill have a talk with him said Jim and he turned to go
Talk
she cried
He stopped and looked at her in astonishment
It was the first time that he had ever heard that sharp note in her voice
Her tiny figure was stiffened with decision
Her eyes were blazing
If you ever DARE to speak to himabout me youll never see me again
Jim was perplexed
I mean it Jim
Ive made my choice and Ive come back to you
If you ever try to fix up things between him and me Ill run awayreally and truly awayand youll never never get me back
He shuffled awkwardly to her side and reached apologetically for the little clenched fist
He held it in his big rough hand toying nervously with the tiny fingers
I wouldnt do nothin that you wasnt awantin Poll
I was just a tryin to help yer only II never seem to know how
She turned to him with teardimmed eyes and rested her hands on his great broad shoulders and he saw the place where he dwelt in her heart
Chapter XIV THE Leap of Death implements were being carried from the ring and Jim turned away to superintend their loading
Performers again rushed by each other on their way to and from the main tent
Polly stood in the centre of the lot frowning and anxious
The mere mention of the pastors name had made it seem impossible for her to ride tonight
For hours she had been whipping herself up to the point of doing it and now her courage failed her
She followed Barker as he came from the ring
Mr Barker please
He turned upon her sharply
Well what is it NOW
I want to ask you to let me off again tonight
She spoke in a short jerky desperate way
What
he shrieked
Not go into the ring with all them people inside whats paid their money acause they knowed yer
Thats it she cried
I cant
I cant
YER gettin too tony
Barker sneered
Thats the trouble with you
You aint been good for nothin since you was at that parsons house
Yer didnt stay there and yer no use here
First thing yer know yerll be out all round
Out
Sure
Yer dont think Im goin ter head my bill with a dead one do you
I am not a dead one  she answered excitedly
Im the best rider youve had since mother died
Youve said so yourself
That was afore yer got in with them church cranks
You talk about yer mother
Why shed be ashamed ter own yer
She wouldnt cried Polly
Her eyes were flashing her face was scarlet
The pride of hundreds of years of ancestry was quivering with indignation
I can ride as well as I EVER could and Ill do it too
Ill do it tomorrow
Tomorrow
echoed Barker
What do you mean by that
I mean that I CANT go into that ring TONIGHT she declared and I wont
She was desperate now and trading upon a strength beyond her own
He looked at her with momentary indecision
She WAS a good riderthe best since her mother as he had often told her
He could see this meant an issue
He felt she would be on her mettle tomorrow as far as her work was concerned if he left her alone tonight
All right he said sullenly
Yer can stay off tonight
I got the crowd in there anyway and I got their money
Ill let Eloise do a turn on Barbarian but TOMORROW youd better show me your old act
Ill show you
she cried
Ill show you
Well see that you do
He crossed into the ring
Polly stood where Barker had left her white and tense
Jim came toward her from the direction of the wagons
He glanced at her uneasily
Whats he been asayin ter you
He says I cant ride any more
Her lips closed tightly
She stared straight ahead of her
He says I was no good to the people that took me in and Im no use here
Its not so
thundered Jim
No its not
she cried
Ill show him Jim
Ill show himtomorrow
She turned toward the dressing tent Jim caught her firmly by the wrist
Wait Poll
You aint ever goin into the ring afeelin THAT WAY
Her eyes met his defiantly
Whats the difference
Whats the difference
She wrenched her wrist quickly from him and ran into the dressing tent laughing hysterically
And I brung her back to it mumbled Jim as he turned to give orders to the property men
Most of the firsthalf props were loaded and some of the men were asleep under the wagons
The lot was clear
Suddenly he felt some one approaching from the back of the enclosure
He turned and found himself face to face with the stern solitary figure of the pastor wrapped in his long black cloak
The moonlight slipped through a rift in the clouds and fell in a circle around them
What made you come here
was all Jim said
I heard that Miss Polly didnt ride today
I was afraid she might be ill Whats that to you
She ISNT ill
Douglas demanded anxiously oblivious to the gruffness in the big fellows voice
Shes all right Jim answered shortly as he shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and avoided the pastors burning gaze
And shes happy
shes content
Sure
Im glad said Douglas dully
He tried to think of some way to prolong their talk
Ive never heard from her you know
Us folks dont get much time to write
Jim turned away and began tinkering with one of the wagons
Douglas had walked up and down in front of the tents again and again fighting against a desire to do the very thing that he was doing but to no purpose and now that he was here it seemed impossible that he should go away so unsatisfied
He crossed to Jim and came determinedly to the point
Cant I see her Jim
Its agin the rules
He did not turn
There was another pause then Douglas started slowly out of the lot
Wait a minute called Jim as though the words had been wrung from him
The pastor came back with a question in his eyes
I lied to you
Shes NOT well then
Oh yes shes well enough
It aint that its about her being happy
She isnt
There was a note of unconscious exultation in his voice
No
She AINT happy here and she WAS happy WITH YOU
Then why did she leave me
I dont know
She wasnt goin ter do it at first
Somethin must ahappened afterwards somethin that you an me didnt know about
We WILL know about it Jim
Where is she
His quick eye searched the lot
His voice had regained its old command
He felt that he could conquer worlds
You cant do no good that way answered Jim
She dont want ter see you again
Why not
I dont know but she told me shed run away if I ever even talked to you about her
You neednt talk Jim Ill talk for myself
Where is she
Shell be comin out soon
You can wait around out here with me
Ill let you know in time
He led the way through a narrow passage between the wagons
Jim and Douglas had barely left the lot when Deacon Elversons small round head slipped cautiously around the corner of the dressing tent
The little deacon glanced exultantly about him
He was monarch of all he surveyed
It was very thrilling to stand here on this forbidden ground smelling the saw dust gazing at the big red wagons studying the unprotected circus properties and listening to the lightening tempo of the band
Did you see him
shouted Strong who had followed closely upon Elversons heels
The little deacon started
Strong was certainly a disturbing factor at times
Yes II saw him
Well
Hehedidnt see HER
What DID he do
Strong was beside himself with impatience
Hehe just talked to the big un and went out that way
Elverson nodded toward the wagons
I guess he aint gone far sneered Strong
He come over to this lot to see her and he aint goin ter give up till he does it
You wait here Ill take a look round
He went quickly in the direction of the wagons
Elverson needed no second invitation to wait
He was congratulating himself upon his good fortune when he all but collided with a flying apparition vanishing in the direction of the main tent
Sophisticated eyes would have seen only a rather stout acrobat clad in pink tights but Elverson was not sophisticated and he teetered after the flitting angel even unto the forbidden portals of the big top
He was peeping through the curtains which had fallen behind her and was getting his first glimpse of the great sawdust world beyond when one of the clowns dashed from the dressing tent on his way to the ring
The clown was late
He saw the limp coat tails of the deacon who was threequarters in the tent
Here was a chance to make a funny entrance
He grabbed the unsuspecting little man from the rear
The terrified deacon struck out blindly in all directions his black arms and legs moving like centipede but the clown held him firmly by the back and thrust him head foremost into the tent
Strong returned almost immediately from his unsuccessful search for the pastor
He looked about the lot for Elverson
Hey there Elverson
he called lustily
There was no response
Now wheres he got to grumbled Strong
He disappeared quickly around the corner of the dressing tent resolved to keep a sharp lookout for Douglas
Elverson was thrust from the tent soon after spitting sawdust and much discomfited by the laughing performers who followed him
His knees almost gave way beneath him when Barker came out of the ring snapping his long black whip
Get out of here you bloke
roared Barker
and Elverson got
No one had remembered to tell the groom that Polly was not to ride tonight
So Bingo was brought out as usual when their turn approached
Take him back Tom Polly called from the entrance when she learned that Bingo was waiting and bring Barbarian
Im not going on tonight
Eloise is going to ride in my place
This was the second time today that Bingo had been led away without going into the ring
Something in his big wondering eyes made Polly follow him and apologise
He was very proud was Bingo and very conscientious
He felt uneasy when he saw the other horses going to their work without him
Never mind Bingo she said patting his great arched neck well show em tomorrow
He rubbed his satiny nose against her cheek
Well make them SIT UP again
Barker says our acts no goodthat Ive let down
But its not YOUR fault Bingo
Ive not been fair to you
Ill give you a chance tomorrow
You wait
Hell never say it again Bingo
Never again
She watched him go out of the lot and laughed a little as he nipped the attendant on the arm
He was still irritated at not going into the ring
Polly had nothing more to do tonight except to get into her street clothes
The wagons would soon be moving away
For a moment she glanced at the dark church steeple then she turned to go inside the tent
A deep familiar voice stopped her
Polly
She turned quickly
She could not answer
Douglas came toward her
He gazed at her in amazement
She drew her cape about her slightly clad figure
She seemed older to him more unapproachable with her hair heaped high and sparkling with jewels
Her bodice of satin and lace shimmered through the opening of her cape
The moonlight lent mystery and indecision to her betinselled attire
The band was playing the andante for the balancing act
She found strength at last to open her lips but still no sound came from them
She and the pastor looked at each other strangely like spirits newly met from farapart worlds
She too thought her companion changed
He was older the circles beneath his eyes were deeper the look in their depths more grave
We were such close neighbours today II rather thought youd call he stammered
He was uncertain what he was sayingit did not matterhe was there with her
When youre in a circus there isnt much time for calling
Thats why Ive come to call on you
They might have been sheppherd and sheppherdess on a Mayday wooing for the halting way in which their words came
Youre all right
he went on
Youre happy
Yes very she said
Her eyes were downcast
He did not believe her the effort in her voice her drawn white face belied her words
How COULD he get the truth from her
Jim said you might not want to see me
She started
Has Jim been talking to you
Yes but I didnt let him stop me for you told me the day you left that youd never change toward me
Have you Poll
He studied her anxiously
Why no of course not she said evasively
And youll be quite frank when I ask you something
Yes of course
She was growing more and more uneasy
She glanced about for a way of escape
Why did you leave me as you did
I told you then
She tried to cross toward the dressing tent
He stepped quickly in front of her
You arent answering FRANKLY and you arent happy
She was growing desperate
She felt she must get away anywhere anywhere
He seized her small wrists and forced her to look at him
And I am not happy without YOU and I never NEVER can be
The floodgates were open his eyes were aglow he bent toward her eagerly
Oh you mustnt she begged
You MUSTNT
Youve grown so close he cried
So close
She struggled to be free
He did not heed her
You knowyou must know what I mean
He drew her toward him and forced her into his arms
Youre more precious to me than all else on this earth
For the first time he saw the extreme pallor on her face
He felt her growing limp and lifeless in his arms
A doubt crossed his mind
If I am wrong in thinking you feel as I do if you honestly care for all this he glanced about at the tents more than for any life that I can give you I shant interfere
Youll be going on your way in an hour
Ill say goodbye and God bless you but if you do care for me Polly he was pleading now if youre NOT happy here wont you come back to me
Wont you Polly
She dared not meet his eyes nor yet to send him away
She stood irresolute
The voice of Deacon Strong answered for her
So
Youre HERE are you
Yes Deacon Strong Im here answered the pastor as he turned to meet the accusing eyes of the deacon who had come quickly from behind the dressing tent
As for you miss continued Strong with an insolent nod toward Polly I might have known how youd keep your part of the bargain
Bargain
echoed Douglas
What bargain
Oh please Deacon Strong please
I didnt mean to see him I didnt truly
She hardly knew what she was saying
What bargain
demanded Douglas sternly
She told me that you and her wasnt ever goin ter see each other agin roared Strong
If Id aknowed she was goin to keep on with this kind o thing you wouldnt er got off so easy
So
Thats it
cried Douglas
It was all clear to him now
He recalled everything her hysterical behaviour her laughter her tears
It was you who drove that child back to this
He glanced at Polly
The narrow shoulders were bent forward
The nervous little fingers were clasping and unclasping each other
Never before had she seemed so small and helpless
Oh please Mr John please
Dont make him any worse
Why didnt you tell me
he demanded
It would have done no good she sobbed
Oh whywhy wont you leave me alone
It would have done all the good in the world
What right had he to send you back to this
I had every right said Strong stubbornly
What
cried Douglas
It was my duty
Your duty
Your narrowminded bigotry
I dont allow no man to talk to me like that not even my parson
Im NOT your parson any longer declared Douglas
He faced Strong squarely
He was master of his own affairs at last
Polly clung to him begging and beseeching
Oh Mr John
Mr
John
What do you mean by that
shouted Strong
I mean that I stayed with you and your narrow minded congregation before because I believed you needed me
But now this girl needs me more
She needs me to protect her from just such injustice as yours
Youd better be protectin YOURSELF
Thats my advice to you
I can do that WITHOUT your advice
Maybe you can find another church with that circus ridin girl ahangin round your neck
Hes right cried Polly
You couldnt
She clung to the pastor in terrified entreaty
You COULDNT get another church
Theyd never never forgive you
Its no use
Youve got to let me go
youve GOT to
Listen Polly
He drew her toward him
God is greater than any church or creed
Theres work to be done EVERYWHEREHIS work
Youll soon find out about that thundered Strong
So I will answered Douglas with his head thrown high
This child has opened a new world to me she has shown me a broader deeper humanity she and I will find the way together
It wont be an easy one Ill promise you that
Strong turned to go
Im not looking for the easy way
Douglas called after him then he turned to draw Pollys arm within his but Polly had slipped from his side to follow the deacon
Oh please Deacon Strong please
she pleaded
You wont go away like that
Hell be all right if youll only wait
Im NOT coming back
Im nothonestly
Im going on with the show tonight and Im going this time FOREVER
You are going to stay here with me cried Douglas
No no Mr John
Ive made up my mind and I wont be to blame for your unhappiness
She faced him firmly now
I dont belong to your world and I dont want to try any more
Im what he called meIm a circus riding girl
I was born in the circus and Ill never change
Thats my workriding and its yours to preach
You must do your work and ILL do MINE
She started toward the ring
Eloise and Barbarian were already waiting at the entrance Eloise
She took one step toward her then stopped at the sound of Barkers voice
Ladies and gentlemen he called
Although we are obliged to announce that our star rider Miss Polly will not appear tonight we offer you in her place an able substitute Mademoiselle Eloise on her black untamed horse Barbarian
Eloise put her hands on the horses back to mount
No
No
cried Polly
The other girl turned in astonishment at the agony in her voice
Polly
Wait Eloise
IM going to ride
You cant not Barbarian
He dont know your turn
So much the better
She seized the bridle from the frightened girls hand
Polly
shouted Douglas
He had followed her to the entrance
I must
I will
She flew into the ring before he could stop her
He took one step to follow her
Youd better let her alone and get out o here said Strong
His voice was like a firebrand to Douglas
He turned upon him white with rage
You drove her to this
His fists were clenched
He drew back to strike
Jim came from behind the wagons just in time to catch the uplifted arm
Leave HIM to ME this aint no parsons job
The pastor lowered his arm but kept his threatening eyes on the deacons face
Wheres Poll
asked Jim
In there
Douglas pointed toward the main tent without turning his head
He was still glaring at the deacon and breathing hard
What
cried Jim in alarm
He faced about and saw Eloise
He guessed the truth
A few quick strides brought him to the entrance curtains
He threw them back and looked into the ring
My God
Why dont Barker stop her
What is it
called Douglas
He forgot the deacon in his terror at Jims behaviour and Strong was able to slip away unnoticed
Shes goin ter ride
Shes goin ter ride Barbarian
Douglas crossed to his side and looked
Polly was springing onto the back of Barbarian
He was a poorly trained horse used by the other girl for more showy but less dangerous feats than Pollys
Shes goin through her regular turn with him shes tryin ter break her neck said Jim
She wants ter do it
Its your fault
he cried turning upon Douglas with bloodshot eyes
He was half insane he cared little whom he wounded
Why cant we stop her
cried Douglas unable to endure the strain
He took one step inside the entrance
No no not that
Jim dragged him back roughly
If she sees you now it will be the end
They watched in silence
Shes over the first part Jim whispered at last
Douglas drew back his muscles tense as he watched the scene inside the ring
Eloise stood at the pastors side horrorstricken at Pollys reckless behaviour
She knew Barbarian
It was easy to guess the end
Shes comin to the hoops Jim whispered hoarsely
Barbarian dont know that part I never trained him the other girl said
Polly made the first leap toward the hoops
The horse was not at fault it was Polly
She plunged wildly the audience started
She caught her footing with an effort
One two three hoops were passed
She threw herself across the back of the horse and hung head downward as he galloped around the ring
The band was playing loudly the people were cheering
She rose to meet the last two hoops
Shes swayin Jim shrieked in agony
Shes goin to fall
He covered his face with his hands
Polly reeled and fell at the horses side
She mounted and fell again
She rose and staggered in pursuit
I cant bear it groaned Douglas
He rushed into the ring unconscious of the thousands of eyes bent upon his black ministerial garb and caught the slip of a girl in his arms just as she was about to sink fainting beneath the horses hoofs
Barker brought the performance to a halt with a crack of his whip
The audience stood on tiptoe
Whitefaced clowns and gaily attired acrobats crowded around Polly and the pastor
Douglas did not see them
He had come into his own
Hes bringin her out whispered Eloise who still watched at the entrance
Jim dared not look up his head was still in his hands
Is it over
he groaned
I dont know
I cant tell yet
She stepped aside as Douglas came out of the tent followed by a swarm of performers
He knelt on the soft grass and rested Pollys head upon his knee
The others pressed about them
It seemed to Douglas that he waited hours then her white lids quivered and opened and the colour crept back to her lips
Its all right Jim
called one of the men from the crowd
Shes only fainted
The big fellow had waited in his tracks for the verdict
Pollys eyes looked up into those of the parson a thrill shot through his veins
It was no use was it
She shook her head with a sad little smile
He knew that she was thinking of her failure to get out of his way
Thats because I need you so much Polly that God wont let you go away from me
He drew her nearer to him and the warm blood that shot to her cheeks brought back her strength
She rose unsteadily and looked about her
Jim came toward her white and trembling
All right Poll
Oh Muvver Jim
She threw herself into his arms and clung to him sobbing weakly
No one could ever remember just how the audience left the big top that night and even Barker had no clear idea of how Jim took down the tents loaded the great wagons and sent the caravan on its way
When the last wagon was beginning to climb the long winding road of the moonlit hill Jim turned to Polly who stood near the side of the deserted ring
His eyes travelled from her to the parson who waited near her
She was in her street clothes now the little brown Quakerish dress which she had chosen to wear so much since her return from the parsonage
I guess I wont be makin no mistake this time he said and he placed her hand in that of the parson
Goodbye Muvver Jim faltered Polly
He stooped and touched her forehead with his lips
A mothers spirit breathed through his kiss
Im glad its like this he said then turned away and followed the long dotted line of winding lights disappearing slowly over the hill
Her eyes travelled after him
Douglas touched the cold little hand at her side
I belong with them she said still gazing after Jim and the wagons
You belong with me he answered in a firm grave voice and something in the deep sure tones told her that he was speaking the truth
She lifted one trembling hand to his shoulder and looked up into his face
Whither thou goest will I go where thou diest will I die
He drew her into his arms
The Lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me
THE END
