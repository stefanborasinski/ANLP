ANNE OF AVONLEA by Lucy Maud Montgomery to my former teacher HATTIE GORDON SMITH in grateful remembrance of her sympathy and encouragement Flowers spring to blossom where she walks The careful ways of duty Our hard stiff lines of life with her Are flowing curves of beauty

But an August afternoon with blue hazes scarfing the harvest slopes little winds whispering elfishly in the poplars and a dancing slendor of red poppies outflaming against the dark coppice of young firs in a corner of the cherry orchard was fitter for dreams than dead languages
The Virgil soon slipped unheeded to the ground and Anne her chin propped on her clasped hands and her eyes on the splendid mass of fluffy clouds that were heaping up just over Mr J
A Harrisons house like a great white mountain was far away in a delicious world where a certain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work shaping the destinies of future statesmen and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high and lofty ambitions
To be sure if you came down to harsh facts

which it must be confessed Anne seldom did until she had to

it did not seem likely that there was much promising material for celebrities in Avonlea school but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used her influence for good
Anne had certain rosetinted ideals of what a teacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it and she was in the midst of a delightful scene forty years hence with a famous personage

just exactly what he was to be famous for was left in convenient haziness but Anne thought it would be rather nice to have him a college president or a Canadian premier

bowing low over her wrinkled hand and assuring her that it was she who had first kindled his ambition and that all his success in life was due to the lessons she had instilled so long ago in Avonlea school
This pleasant vision was shattered by a most unpleasant interruption
A demure little Jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds later Mr Harrison arrived

if arrived be not too mild a term to describe the manner of his irruption into the yard
He bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate and angrily confronted astonished Anne who had risen to her feet and stood looking at him in some bewilderment
Mr Harrison was their new righthand neighbor and she had never met him before although she had seen him once or twice
In early April before Anne had come home from Queens Mr Robert Bell whose farm adjoined the Cuthbert place on the west had sold out and moved to Charlottetown
His farm had been bought by a certain Mr J
A Harrison whose name and the fact that he was a New Brunswick man were all that was known about him
But before he had been a month in Avonlea he had won the reputation of being an odd person


a crank Mrs Rachel Lynde said
Mrs Rachel was an outspoken lady as those of you who may have already made her acquaintance will remember
Mr Harrison was certainly different from other people

and that is the essential characteristic of a crank as everybody knows
In the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated that he wanted no fools of women around his diggings
Feminine Avonlea took its revenge by the gruesome tales it related about his housekeeping and cooking
He had hired little John Henry Carter of White Sands and John Henry started the stories
For one thing there was never any stated time for meals in the Harrison establishment
Mr Harrison got a bite when he felt hungry and if John Henry were around at the time he came in for a share but if he were not he had to wait until Mr Harrisons next hungry spell
John Henry mournfully averred that he would have starved to death if it wasnt that he got home on Sundays and got a good filling up and that his mother always gave him a basket of grub to take back with him on Monday mornings
As for washing dishes Mr Harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came
Then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead and left them to drain dry
Again Mr Harrison was close
When he was asked to subscribe to the Rev
Mr Allans salary he said hed wait and see how many dollars worth of good he got out of his preaching first

he didnt believe in buying a pig in a poke
And when Mrs Lynde went to ask for a contribution to missions

and incidentally to see the inside of the house

he told her there were more heathens among the old woman gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of and hed cheerfully contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if shed undertake it
Mrs Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs Robert Bell was safe in her grave for it would have broken her heart to see the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride
Why she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day Mrs Lynde told Marilla Cuthbert indignantly and if you could see it now
I had to hold up my skirts as I walked across it
Finally Mr Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger
Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before consequently that proceeding was considered barely respectable
And such a parrot
If you took John Henry Carters word for it never was such an unholy bird
It swore terribly
Mrs Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure she could get another place for him
Besides Ginger had bitten a piece right out of the back of John Henrys neck one day when he had stooped down too near the cage
Mrs Carter showed everybody the mark when the luckless John Henry went home on Sundays
All these things flashed through Annes mind as Mr Harrison stood quite speechless with wrath apparently before her
In his most amiable mood Mr Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man he was short and fat and bald and now with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head Anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen
All at once Mr Harrison found his voice
Im not going to put up with this he spluttered not a day longer do you hear miss
Bless my soul this is the third time miss


the third time
Patience has ceased to be a virtue miss
I warned your aunt the last time not to let it occur again


and shes let it

shes done it

what does she mean by it that is what I want to know
That is what Im here about miss
Will you explain what the trouble is
asked Anne in her most dignified manner
She had been practicing it considerably of late to have it in good working order when school began but it had no apparent effect on the irate J
A Harrison
Trouble is it
Bless my soul trouble enough I should think
The trouble is miss that I found that Jersey cow of your aunts in my oats again not half an hour ago
The third time mark you
I found her in last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday
I came here and told your aunt not to let it occur again
She has let it occur again
Wheres your aunt miss
I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of my mind

a piece of J
A Harrisons mind miss
If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert she is not my aunt and she has gone down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill said Anne with due increase of dignity at every word
I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats


she is my cow and not Miss Cuthberts

Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was a little calf and he bought her from Mr
Bell
Sorry miss
Sorry isnt going to help matters any
Youd better go and look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats

trampled them from center to circumference miss
I am very sorry repeated Anne firmly but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in
It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition
My fence is all right snapped Mr Harrison angrier than ever at this carrying of the war into the enemys country
The jail fence couldnt keep a demon of a cow like that out
And I can tell you you redheaded snippet that if the cow is yours as you say youd be better employed in watching her out of other peoples grain than in sitting round reading yellowcovered novels

with a scathing glance at the innocent tancolored Virgil by Annes feet
Something at that moment was red besides Annes hair

which had always been a tender point with her
Id rather have red hair than none at all except a little fringe round my ears she flashed
The shot told for Mr Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald head
His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly at Anne who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage
I can make allowance for you Mr Harrison because I have an imagination
I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a cow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you for the things youve said
I promise you that Dolly shall never break into your oats again
I give you my word of honor on THAT point
Well mind you she doesnt muttered Mr Harrison in a somewhat subdued tone but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him growling to himself until he was out of earshot
Grievously disturbed in mind Anne marched across the yard and shut the naughty Jersey up in the milking pen
She cant possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down she reflected
She looks pretty quiet now
I daresay she has sickened herself on those oats
I wish Id sold her to Mr Shearer when he wanted her last week but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had the auction of the stock and let them all go together
I believe it is true about Mr Harrison being a crank
Certainly theres nothing of the kindred spirit about HIM
Anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits
Marilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the house and the latter flew to get tea ready
They discussed the matter at the tea table
Ill be glad when the auction is over said Marilla
It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if Id give him the day off to go to his aunts funeral
I dont know how many aunts he has got I am sure
Thats the fourth thats died since he hired here a year ago
Ill be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr Barry takes over the farm
Well have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed
I declare it is a world of trouble as Rachel says
Heres poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know
She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them but she hasnt heard from him yet
What are the children like
How old are they
Six past

theyre twins
Oh Ive always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs Hammond had so many said Anne eagerly
Are they pretty
Goodness you couldnt tell

they were too dirty
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in
Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then because she cried he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief
He has never had any bringing up you might say
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since
Im always sorry for children that have no bringing up said Anne soberly
You know I hadnt any till you took me in hand
I hope their uncle will look after them
Just what relation is Mrs Keith to you
Mary
None in the world
It was her husband

he was our third cousin
Theres Mrs Lynde coming through the yard
I thought shed be up to hear about Mary Dont tell her about Mr Harrison and the cow implored Anne
Marilla promised but the promise was quite unnecessary for Mrs Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said I saw Mr Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody
I thought he looked pretty mad
Did he make much of a rumpus
Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs Lynde
It was only that morning Anne had said If you went to your own room at midnight locked the door pulled down the blind and SNEEZED Mrs Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was
I believe he did admitted Marilla
I was away
He gave Anne a piece of his mind
I think he is a very disagreeable man said Anne with a resentful toss of her ruddy head
You never said a truer word said Mrs Rachel solemnly
I knew thered be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man thats what
I dont know what Avonlea is coming to with so many strange people rushing into it
Itll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds
Why what other strangers are coming in
asked Marilla
Havent you heard
Well theres a family of Donnells for one thing
Theyve rented Peter Sloanes old house
Peter has hired the man to run his mill
They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them
Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and theyll simply be a burden on the public
He is in consumption

when he isnt stealing


and his wife is a slacktwisted creature that cant turn her hand to a thing
She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN
Mrs George Pye has taken her husbands orphan nephew Anthony Pye
Hell be going to school to you Anne so you many expect trouble thats what
And youll have another strange pupil too
Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother
You remember his father Marilla

Stephen Irving him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton
I dont think he jilted her
There was a quarrel

I suppose there was blame on both sides
Well anyway he didnt marry her and shes been as queer as possible ever since they say

living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge
Stephen went off to the States and went into business with his uncle and married a Yankee
Hes never been home since though his mother has been up to see him once or twice
His wife died two years ago and hes sending the boy home to his mother for a spell
Hes ten years old and I dont know if hell be a very desirable pupil
You can never tell about those Yankees
Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided cananygoodthingcomeoutofNazareth air
They MIGHT be good people of course but you were on the safe side in doubting it
She had a special prejudice against Yankees
Her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it
Avonlea school wont be the worse for a little new blood said Marilla drily and if this boy is anything like his father hell be all right
Steve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts though some people did call him proud
I should think Mrs Irving would be very glad to have the child
She has been very lonesome since her husband died
Oh the boy may be well enough but hell be different from Avonlea children said Mrs Rachel as if that clinched the matter
Mrs Rachels opinions concerning any person place or thing were always warranted to wear
Whats this I hear about your going to start up a Village Improvement Society Anne
I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last Debating Club said Anne flushing
They thought it would be rather nice

and so do Mr and Mrs Allan
Lots of villages have them now
Well youll get into no end of hot water if you do
Better leave it alone Anne thats what
People dont like being improved
Oh we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE
It is Avonlea itself
There are lots of things which might be done to make it prettier
For instance if we could coax Mr Levi Boulter to pull down that dreadful old house on his upper farm wouldnt that be an improvement
It certainly would admitted Mrs Rachel
That old ruin has been an eyesore to the settlement for years
But if you Improvers can coax Levi Boulter to do anything for the public that he isnt to be paid for doing may I be there to see and hear the process thats what
I dont want to discourage you Anne for there may be something in your idea though I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine but youll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a friend not to bother with your improvements thats what
But there I know youll go ahead with it if youve set your mind on it
You were always one to carry a thing through somehow
Something about the firm outlines of Annes lips told that Mrs Rachel was not far astray in this estimate
Annes heart was bent on forming the Improvement Society
Gilbert Blythe who was to teach in White Sands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning was enthusiastic about it and most of the other folks were willing to go in for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some fun
As for what the improvements were to be nobody had any very clear idea except Anne and Gilbert
They had talked them over and planned them out until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds if nowhere else
Mrs Rachel had still another item of news
Theyve given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant
Didnt you go to Queens with a girl of that name Anne
Yes indeed
Priscilla to teach at Carmody
How perfectly lovely
exclaimed Anne her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening stars causing Mrs Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it settled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty girl or not
II Selling in Haste and Repenting at Leisure Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon and took Diana Barry with her
Diana was of course a pledged member of the Improvement Society and the two girls talked about little else all the way to Carmody and back
The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that hall painted said Diana as they drove past the Avonlea hall a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides
Its a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before we try to get Mr Levi Boulder to pull his house down
Father says well never succeed in DOING that
Levi Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take
Perhaps hell let the boys take it down if they promise to haul the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood said Anne hopefully
We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first
We cant expect to improve everything all at once
Well have to educate public sentiment first of course
Diana wasnt exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view
I thought of something last night that we could do Anne
You know that threecornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and Newbridge and White Sands meet
Its all grown over with young spruce but wouldnt it be nice to have them all cleared out and just leave the two or three birch trees that are on it
Splendid agreed Anne gaily
And have a rustic seat put under the birches
And when spring comes well have a flowerbed made in the middle of it and plant geraniums
Yes only well have to devise some way of getting old Mrs Hiram Sloane to keep her cow off the road or shell eat our geraniums up laughed Diana
I begin to see what you mean by educating public sentiment Anne
Theres the old Boulter house now
Did you ever see such a rookery
And perched right close to the road too
An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out
I think an old deserted house is such a sad sight said Anne dreamily
It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and mourning for its oldtime joys
Marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago and that it was a real pretty place with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it
It was full of little children and laughter and songs and now it is empty and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind
How lonely and sorrowful it must feel
Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights

the ghosts of the little children of long ago and the roses and the songs

and for a little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again
Diana shook her head
I never imagine things like that about places now Anne
Dont you remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into the Haunted Wood
To this day I cant go through that bush comfortably after dark and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter house Id be frightened to pass it too
Besides those children arent dead
Theyre all grown up and doing well

and one of them is a butcher
And flowers and songs couldnt have ghosts anyhow
Anne smothered a little sigh
She loved Diana dearly and they had always been good comrades
But she had long ago learned that when she wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone
The way to it was by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her
A thundershower came up while the girls were at Carmody it did not last long however and the drive home through lanes where the raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the drenched ferns gave out spicy odors was delightful
But just as they turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty of the landscape for her
Before them on the right extended Mr Harrisons broad graygreen field of late oats wet and luxuriant and there standing squarely in the middle of it up to her sleek sides in the lush growth and blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels was a Jersey cow
Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that boded no good to the predatory quadruped
Not a word said she but she climbed nimbly down over the wheels and whisked across the fence before Diana understood what had happened
Anne come back shrieked the latter as soon as she found her voice
Youll ruin your dress in that wet grain

ruin it
She doesnt hear me
Well shell never get that cow out by herself
I must go and help her of course
Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing
Diana hopped briskly down tied the horse securely to a post turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders mounted the fence and started in pursuit of her frantic friend
She could run faster than Anne who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt and soon overtook her
Behind them they left a trail that would break Mr Harrisons heart when he should see it
Anne for mercys sake stop panted poor Diana
Im right out of breath and you are wet to the skin
I must

get

that cow

out

before

Mr
Harrison

sees her gasped Anne
I dont

care

if Im

drowned 

if we

can

only

do that
But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground
No sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner of the field
Head her off screamed Anne
Run Diana run
Diana did run
Anne tried to and the wicked Jersey went around the field as if she were possessed
Privately Diana thought she was
It was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the corner gap into the Cuthbert lane
There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper at that precise moment
Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a buggy halted just outside the lane wherein sat Mr Shearer of Carmody and his son both of whom wore a broad smile
I guess youd better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her last week Anne chuckled Mr Shearer
Ill sell her to you now if you want her said her flushed and disheveled owner
You may have her this very minute
Done
Ill give you twenty for her as I offered before and Jim here can drive her right over to Carmody
Shell go to town with the rest of the shipment this evening
Mr Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow
Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the road and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with her twenty dollars
What will Marilla say
asked Diana
Oh she wont care
Dolly was my own cow and it isnt likely shed bring more than twenty dollars at the auction
But oh dear if Mr Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again and after my giving him my word of honor that Id never let it happen
Well it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows
A cow that could jump over or break through our milkpen fence couldnt be trusted anywhere
Marilla had gone down to Mrs Lyndes and when she returned knew all about Dollys sale and transfer for Mrs Lynde had seen most of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest
I suppose its just as well shes gone though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion Anne
I dont see how she got out of the pen though
She must have broken some of the boards off
I didnt think of looking said Anne but Ill go and see now
Martin has never come back yet
Perhaps some more of his aunts have died
I think its something like Mr Peter Sloane and the octogenarians
The other evening Mrs Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr Sloane I see here that another octogenarian has just died
What is an octogenarian Peter
And Mr Sloane said he didnt know but they must be very sickly creatures for you never heard tell of them but they were dying
Thats the way with Martins aunts
Martins just like all the rest of those French said Marilla in disgust
You cant depend on them for a day
Marilla was looking over Annes Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard
A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen wringing her hands
Anne Shirley whats the matter now
Oh Marilla whatever shall I do
This is terrible
And its all my fault
Oh will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things
Mrs Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day and now Ive done it
Anne you are the most exasperating girl
WHAT is it youve done
Sold Mr Harrisons Jersey cow

the one he bought from Mr Bell 

to Mr Shearer
Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute
Anne Shirley are you dreaming
I only wish I were
Theres no dream about it though its very like a nightmare
And Mr Harrisons cow is in Charlottetown by this time
Oh Marilla I thought Id finished getting into scrapes and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life
What can I do
Do
Theres nothing to do child except go and see Mr Harrison about it
We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he doesnt want to take the money
She is just as good as his
Im sure hell be awfully cross and disagreeable about it though moaned Anne
I daresay he will
He seems to be an irritable sort of a man
Ill go and explain to him if you like
No indeed Im not as mean as that exclaimed Anne
This is all my fault and Im certainly not going to let you take my punishment
Ill go myself and Ill go at once
The sooner its over the better for it will be terribly humiliating
Poor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when she happened to glance through the open pantry door
On the table reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning

a particularly toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts
Anne had intended it for Friday evening when the youth of Avonlea were to meet at Green Gables to organize the Improvement Society
But what were they compared to the justly offended Mr Harrison
Anne thought that cake ought to soften the heart of any man especially one who had to do his own cooking and she promptly popped it into a box
She would take it to Mr Harrison as a peace offering
That is if he gives me a chance to say anything at all she thought ruefully as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields golden in the light of the dreamy August evening
I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution
III Mr Harrison at Home Mr Harrisons house was an oldfashioned loweaved whitewashed structure set against a thick spruce grove
Mr Harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda in his shirt sleeves enjoying his evening pipe
When he realized who was coming up the path he sprang suddenly to his feet bolted into the house and shut the door
This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise mingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day before
But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Annes heart
If hes so cross now what will he be when he hears what Ive done she reflected miserably as she rapped at the door
But Mr Harrison opened it smiling sheepishly and invited her to enter in a tone quite mild and friendly if somewhat nervous
He had laid aside his pipe and donned his coat he offered Anne a very dusty chair very politely and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough if it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through the bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes
No sooner had Anne seated herself than Ginger exclaimed Bless my soul whats that redheaded snippet coming here for
It would be hard to say whose face was the redder Mr Harrisons or Annes
Dont you mind that parrot said Mr Harrison casting a furious glance at Ginger
Hes

hes always talking nonsense
I got him from my brother who was a sailor
Sailors dont always use the choicest language and parrots are very imitative birds
So I should think said poor Anne the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment
She couldnt afford to snub Mr Harrison under the circumstances that was certain
When you had just sold a mans Jersey cow offhand without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things
Nevertheless the redheaded snippet was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been
Ive come to confess something to you Mr Harrison she said resolutely
Its

its about

that Jersey cow Bless my soul exclaimed Mr Harrison nervously has she gone and broken into my oats again
Well never mind

never mind if she has
Its no difference

none at all
I 
I was too hasty yesterday thats a fact
Never mind if she has
Oh if it were only that sighed Anne
But its ten times worse
I dont Bless my soul do you mean to say shes got into my wheat
No

no

not the wheat
But


Then its the cabbages
Shes broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition hey
Its NOT the cabbages Mr Harrison
Ill tell you everything


that is what I came for  but please dont interrupt me
It makes me so nervous
Just let me tell my story and dont say anything till I get through  and then no doubt youll say plenty Anne concluded but in thought only
I wont say another word said Mr Harrison and he didnt
But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating Redheaded snippet at intervals until Anne felt quite wild
I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday
This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats
Diana and I chased her out and you cant imagine what a hard time we had
I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed  and Mr Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow
I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars
It was wrong of me
I should have waited and consulted Marilla of course
But Im dreadfully given to doing things without thinking  everybody who knows me will tell you that
Mr Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train
Redheaded snippet quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt
At this point Mr Harrison arose and with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot carried Gingers cage into an adjoining room and shut the door
Ginger shrieked swore and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation but finding himself left alone relapsed into sulky silence
Excuse me and go on said Mr Harrison sitting down again
My brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners
I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen
Mr Harrison

Anne leaned forward clasping her hands with her old childish gesture while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr Harrisons embarrassed face


I found my cow still shut up in the pen
It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr
Shearer
Bless my soul exclaimed Mr Harrison in blank amazement at this unlookedfor conclusion
What a VERY extraordinary thing
Oh it isnt in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes said Anne mournfully
Im noted for that
You might suppose Id have grown out of it by this time

Ill be seventeen next March

but it seems that I havent
Mr Harrison is it too much to hope that youll forgive me
Im afraid its too late to get your cow back but here is the money for her

or you can have mine in exchange if youd rather
Shes a very good cow
And I cant express how sorry I am for it all
Tut tut said Mr Harrison briskly dont say another word about it miss
Its of no consequence

no consequence whatever
Accidents will happen
Im too hasty myself sometimes miss


far too hasty
But I cant help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me
If that cow had been in my cabbages now

but never mind she wasnt so its all right
I think Id rather have your cow in exchange since you want to be rid of her
Oh thank you Mr Harrison
Im so glad you are not vexed
I was afraid you would be
And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me after the fuss I made yesterday hey
But you mustnt mind me Im a terrible outspoken old fellow thats all

awful apt to tell the truth no matter if it is a bit plain
So is Mrs Lynde said Anne before she could prevent herself
Who
Mrs Lynde
Dont you tell me Im like that old gossip said Mr Harrison irritably
Im not

not a bit
What have you got in that box
A cake said Anne archly
In her relief at Mr Harrisons unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward featherlight
I brought it over for you

I thought perhaps you didnt have cake very often
I dont thats a fact and Im mighty fond of it too
Im much obliged to you
It looks good on top
I hope its good all the way through
It is said Anne gaily confident
I have made cakes in my time that were NOT as Mrs Allan could tell you but this one is all right
I made it for the Improvement Society but I can make another for them
Well Ill tell you what miss you must help me eat it
Ill put the kettle on and well have a cup of tea
How will that do
Will you let me make the tea
said Anne dubiously
Mr Harrison chuckled
I see you havent much confidence in my ability to make tea
Youre wrong

I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank
But go ahead yourself
Fortunately it rained last Sunday so theres plenty of clean dishes
Anne hopped briskly up and went to work
She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep
Then she swept the stove and set the table bringing the dishes out of the pantry
The state of that pantry horrified Anne but she wisely said nothing
Mr Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches
Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth
Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite Mr Harrison at his own table pouring his tea for him and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans
She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses
Mr Harrison had brought Ginger back averring that the poor bird would be lonesome and Anne feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything offered him a walnut
But Gingers feelings had been grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship
He sat moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a mere ball of green and gold
Why do you call him Ginger
asked Anne who liked appropriate names and thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage
My brother the sailor named him
Maybe it had some reference to his temper
I think a lot of that bird though

youd be surprised if you knew how much
He has his faults of course
That bird has cost me a good deal one way and another
Some people object to his swearing habits but he cant be broken of them
Ive tried

other people have tried
Some folks have prejudices against parrots
Silly aint it
I like them myself
Gingers a lot of company to me
Nothing would induce me to give that bird up

nothing in the world miss
Mr Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up
Anne however was beginning to like the queer fussy fidgety little man and before the meal was over they were quite good friends
Mr Harrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to approve of it
Thats right
Go ahead
Theres lots of room for improvement in this settlement

and in the people too
Oh I dont know flashed Anne
To herself or to her particular cronies she might admit that there were some small imperfections easily removable in Avonlea and its inhabitants
But to hear a practical outsider like Mr Harrison saying it was an entirely different thing
I think Avonlea is a lovely place and the people in it are very nice too
I guess youve got a spice of temper commented Mr Harrison surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him
It goes with hair like yours I reckon
Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I wouldnt have located here but I suppose even you will admit that it has SOME faults
I like it all the better for them said loyal Anne
I dont like places or people either that havent any faults
I think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting
Mrs Milton White says she never met a perfect person but shes heard enough about one 

her husbands first wife
Dont you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect
It would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife declared Mr Harrison with a sudden and inexplicable warmth
When tea was over Anne insisted on washing the dishes although Mr Harrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks yet
She would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also but no broom was visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there wasnt one at all
You might run across and talk to me once in a while suggested Mr Harrison when she was leaving
Tisnt far and folks ought to be neighborly
Im kind of interested in that society of yours
Seems to me therell be some fun in it
Who are you going to tackle first
We are not going to meddle with PEOPLE

it is only PLACES we mean to improve said Anne in a dignified tone
She rather suspected that Mr Harrison was making fun of the project
When she had gone Mr Harrison watched her from the window

a lithe girlish shape tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset afterglow
Im a crusty lonesome crabbed old chap he said aloud but theres something about that little girl makes me feel young again

and its such a pleasant sensation Id like to have it repeated once in a while
Redheaded snippet croaked Ginger mockingly
Mr Harrison shook his fist at the parrot
You ornery bird he muttered I almost wish Id wrung your neck when my brother the sailor brought you home
Will you never be done getting me into trouble
Anne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to Marilla who had been not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of starting out to look for her
Its a pretty good world after all isnt it Marilla
concluded Anne happily
Mrs Lynde was complaining the other day that it wasnt much of a world
She said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant you were sure to be more or less disappointed 

perhaps that is true
But there is a good side to it too
The bad things dont always come up to your expectations either 

they nearly always turn out ever so much better than you think
I looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant experience when I went over to Mr Harrisons tonight and instead he was quite kind and I had almost a nice time
I think were going to be real good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other and everything has turned out for the best
But all the same Marilla I shall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she belongs
And I do NOT like parrots
IV Different Opinions One evening at sunset Jane Andrews Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs where a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road
Jane had been up to spend the afternoon with Anne who walked part of the way home with her at the fence they met Gilbert and all three were now talking about the fateful morrow for that morrow was the first of September and the schools would open
Jane would go to Newbridge and Gilbert to White Sands
You both have the advantage of me sighed Anne
Youre going to teach children who dont know you but I have to teach my own old schoolmates and Mrs Lynde says shes afraid they wont respect me as they would a stranger unless Im very cross from the first
But I dont believe a teacher should be cross
Oh it seems to me such a responsibility
I guess well get on all right said Jane comfortably
Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good
She meant to earn her salary fairly please the trustees and get her name on the School Inspectors roll of honor
Further ambitions Jane had none
The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that
If my pupils wont do as I tell them I shall punish them
How
Give them a good whipping of course
Oh Jane you wouldnt cried Anne shocked
Jane you COULDNT
Indeed I could and would if they deserved it said Jane decidedly
I could NEVER whip a child said Anne with equal decision
I dont believe in it AT ALL
Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order and Mr Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all
No if I cant get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school
There are better ways of managing
I shall try to win my pupils affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them
But suppose they dont
said practical Jane
I wouldnt whip them anyhow
Im sure it wouldnt do any good
Oh dont whip your pupils Jane dear no matter what they do
What do you think about it Gilbert
demanded Jane
Dont you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then
Dont you think its a cruel barbarous thing to whip a child


ANY child
exclaimed Anne her face flushing with earnestness
Well said Gilbert slowly torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Annes ideal theres something to be said on both sides
I dont believe in whipping children MUCH
I think as you say Anne that there are better ways of managing as a rule and that corporal punishment should be a last resort
But on the other hand as Jane says I believe there is an occasional child who cant be influenced in any other way and who in short needs a whipping and would be improved by it
Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be my rule
Gilbert having tried to please both sides succeeded as is usual and eminently right in pleasing neither
Jane tossed her head
Ill whip my pupils when theyre naughty
Its the shortest and easiest way of convincing them
Anne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance
I shall never whip a child she repeated firmly
I feel sure it isnt either right or necessary
Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something
said Jane
Id keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him said Anne
There is some good in every person if you can find it
It is a teachers duty to find and develop it
That is what our School Management professor at Queens told us you know
Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him
Its far more important to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three Rs Professor Rennie says
But the Inspector examines them in the three Rs mind you and he wont give you a good report if they dont come up to his standard protested Jane
Id rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as a real helper than be on the roll of honor asserted Anne decidedly
Wouldnt you punish children at all when they misbehaved
asked Gilbert
Oh yes I suppose I shall have to although I know Ill hate to do it
But you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give them lines to write
I suppose you wont punish the girls by making them sit with the boys
said Jane slyly
Gilbert and Anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly
Once upon a time Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof
Well time will tell which is the best way said Jane philosophically as they parted
Anne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path shadowy rustling fernscented through Violet Vale and past Willowmere where dark and light kissed each other under the firs and down through Lovers Lane

spots she and Diana had so named long ago
She walked slowly enjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the morrow
When she reached the yard at Green Gables Mrs Lyndes loud decided tones floated out through the open kitchen window
Mrs Lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow thought Anne with a grimace but I dont believe Ill go in
Her advice is much like pepper I think

excellent in small quantities but rather scorching in her doses
Ill run over and have a chat with Mr Harrison instead
This was not the first time Anne had run over and chatted with Mr Harrison since the notable affair of the Jersey cow
She had been there several evenings and Mr Harrison and she were very good friends although there were times and seasons when Anne found the outspokenness on which he prided himself rather trying
Ginger still continued to regard her with suspicion and never failed to greet her sarcastically as redheaded snippet
Mr Harrison had tried vainly to break him of the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw Anne coming and exclaiming Bless my soul heres that pretty little girl again or something equally flattering
But Ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it
Anne was never to know how many compliments Mr Harrison paid her behind her back
He certainly never paid her any to her face
Well I suppose youve been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow
was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda steps
No indeed said Anne indignantly
She was an excellent target for teasing because she always took things so seriously
I shall never have a switch in my school Mr Harrison
Of course I shall have to have a pointer but I shall use it for pointing ONLY
So you mean to strap them instead
Well I dont know but youre right
A switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer thats a fact
I shall not use anything of the sort
Im not going to whip my pupils
Bless my soul exclaimed Mr Harrison in genuine astonishment how do you lay out to keep order then
I shall govern by affection Mr
Harrison
It wont do said Mr Harrison wont do at all Anne
Spare the rod and spoil the child
When I went to school the master whipped me regular every day because he said if I wasnt in mischief just then I was plotting it
Methods have changed since your schooldays Mr
Harrison
But human nature hasnt
Mark my words youll never manage the young fry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them
The thing is impossible
Well Im going to try my way first said Anne who had a fairly strong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her theories
Youre pretty stubborn I reckon was Mr Harrisons way of putting it
Well well well see
Someday when you get riled up

and people with hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled

youll forget all your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling
Youre too young to be teaching anyhow 

far too young and childish
Altogether Anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood
She slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning that Marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of scorching ginger tea
Anne sipped it patiently although she could not imagine what good ginger tea would do
Had it been some magic brew potent to confer age and experience Anne would have swallowed a quart of it without flinching
Marilla what if I fail
Youll hardly fail completely in one day and theres plenty more days coming said Marilla
The trouble with you Anne is that youll expect to teach those children everything and reform all their faults right off and if you cant youll think youve failed
V A Fullfledged Schoolmaam When Anne reached the school that morning

for the first time in her life she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its beauties

all was quiet and still
The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of shining morning faces and bright inquisitive eyes
She hung up her hat and faced her pupils hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling
She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school
She had revised and improved it painstakingly and then she had learned it off by heart
It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge
The only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it
After what seemed to her a year

about ten seconds in reality 

she said faintly Take your Testaments please and sank breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that followed
While the children read their verses Anne marshalled her shaky wits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the Grownup Land
Most of them were of course quite well known to her
Her own classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all gone to school with her excepting the primer class and ten newcomers to Avonlea
Anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those whose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her
To be sure they might be just as commonplace as the rest but on the other hand there MIGHT be a genius among them
It was a thrilling idea
Sitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye
He had a dark sullen little face and was staring at Anne with a hostile expression in his black eyes
Anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that boys affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly
In the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty Sloane

a jolly looking little chap with a snub nose freckled face and big light blue eyes fringed with whitish lashes


probably the DonNELL boy and if resemblance went for anything his sister was sitting across the aisle with Mary Bell
Anne wondered what sort of mother the child had to send her to school dressed as she was
She wore a faded pink silk dress trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace soiled white kid slippers and silk stockings
Her sandy hair was tortured into innumerable kinky and unnatural curls surmounted by a flamboyant bow of pink ribbon bigger than her head
Judging from her expression she was very well satisfied with herself
A pale little thing with smooth ripples of fine silky fawncolored hair flowing over her shoulders must Anne thought be Annetta Bell whose parents had formerly lived in the Newbridge school district but by reason of hauling their house fifty yards north of its old site were now in Avonlea
Three pallid little girls crowded into one seat were certainly Cottons and there was no doubt that the small beauty with the long brown curls and hazel eyes who was casting coquettish looks at Jack Gills over the edge of her Testament was Prillie Rogerson whose father had recently married a second wife and brought Prillie home from her grandmothers in Grafton
A tall awkward girl in a back seat who seemed to have too many feet and hands Anne could not place at all but later on discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come to live with an Avonlea aunt
She was also to find that if Barbara ever managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody elses feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch wall to commemorate it
But when Annes eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing her own a queer little thrill went over her as if she had found her genius
She knew this must be Paul Irving and that Mrs Rachel Lynde had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the Avonlea children
More than that Anne realized that he was unlike other children anywhere and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so intently
She knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight
He had the most beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child


features of exquisite delicacy and refinement framed in a halo of chestnut curls
His mouth was delicious being full without pouting the crimson lips just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners that narrowly escaped being dimpled
He had a sober grave meditative expression as if his spirit was much older than his body but when Anne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile which seemed an illumination of his whole being as if some lamp had suddenly kindled into flame inside of him irradiating him from top to toe
Best of all it was involuntary born of no external effort or motive but simply the outflashing of a hidden personality rare and fine and sweet
With a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends forever before a word had passed between them
The day went by like a dream
Anne could never clearly recall it afterwards
It almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching but somebody else
She heard classes and worked sums and set copies mechanically
The children behaved quite well only two cases of discipline occurred
Morley Andrews was caught driving a pair of trained crickets in the aisle
Anne stood Morley on the platform for an hour and

which Morley felt much more keenly


confiscated his crickets
She put them in a box and on the way from school set them free in Violet Vale but Morley believed then and ever afterwards that she took them home and kept them for her own amusement
The other culprit was Anthony Pye who poured the last drops of water from his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clays neck
Anne kept Anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of gentlemen admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies necks
She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen she said
Her little lecture was quite kind and touching but unfortunately Anthony remained absolutely untouched
He listened to her in silence with the same sullen expression and whistled scornfully as he went out
Anne sighed and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a Pyes affections like the building of Rome wasnt the work of a day
In fact it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections to win but Anne hoped better things of Anthony who looked as if he might be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness
When school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped wearily into her chair
Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged
There was no real reason for discouragement since nothing very dreadful had occurred but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would never learn to like teaching
And how terrible it would be to be doing something you didnt like every day for

well say forty years
Anne was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there or wait till she was safely in her own white room at home
Before she could decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her recall a recent criticism of Mr Harrisons on an overdressed female he had seen in a Charlottetown store
She looked like a headon collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare
The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk puffed frilled and shirred wherever puff frill or shirring could possibly be placed
Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers
A veil of pink chiffon lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers behind her
She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman and a very strong odor of perfume attended her
I am Mrs DonNELL

Mrs
H B DonNELL announced this vision and I have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told me when she came home to dinner today
It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY
Im sorry faltered Anne vainly trying to recollect any incident of the morning connected with the Donnell children
Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell
Now Miss Shirley the correct pronunciation of our name is DonNELL


accent on the last syllable
I hope youll remember this in future
Ill try to gasped Anne choking back a wild desire to laugh
I know by experience that its very unpleasant to have ones name SPELLED wrong and I suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong
Certainly it is
And Clarice Almira also informed me that you call my son Jacob
He told me his name was Jacob protested Anne
I might well have expected that said Mrs H B Donnell in a tone which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in this degenerate age
That boy has such plebeian tastes Miss Shirley
When he was born I wanted to call him St Clair 

it sounds SO aristocratic doesnt it
But his father insisted he should be called Jacob after his uncle
I yielded because Uncle Jacob was a rich old bachelor
And what do you think Miss Shirley
When our innocent boy was five years old Uncle Jacob actually went and got married and now he has three boys of his own
Did you ever hear of such ingratitude
The moment the invitation to the wedding

for he had the impertinence to send us an invitation Miss Shirley

came to the house I said No more Jacobs for me thank you
From that day I called my son St Clair and St Clair I am determined he shall be called
His father obstinately continues to call him Jacob and the boy himself has a perfectly unaccountable preference for the vulgar name
But St Clair he is and St Clair he shall remain
You will kindly remember this Miss Shirley will you not
THANK you
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right
Donnell

accent on the last syllable

and St Clair

on no account Jacob
Youll remember
THANK you
When Mrs H B DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called rice lillies
Please teacher I found these in Mr Wrights field he said shyly and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them and because


he lifted his big beautiful eyes


I like you teacher
You darling said Anne taking the fragrant spikes
As if Pauls words had been a spell of magic discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain
She went through the Birch Path lightfootedly attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction
Well how did you get along
Marilla wanted to know
Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you
I cant now 

I dont know myself

Im too near it
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A
He never knew it before
Isnt it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost
Mrs Lynde came up later on with more encouragement
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher
And every one of them said they liked you splendid Anne except Anthony Pye
I must admit he didnt
He said you werent any good just like all girl teachers
Theres the Pye leaven for you
But never mind
Im not going to mind said Anne quietly and Im going to make Anthony Pye like me yet
Patience and kindness will surely win him
Well you can never tell about a Pye said Mrs Rachel cautiously
They go by contraries like dreams often as not
As for that DonNELL woman shell get no DonNELLing from me I can assure you
The name is DONnell and always has been
The woman is crazy thats what
She has a pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with the family eating off a china plate
Id be afraid of a judgment if I was her
Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible hardworking man but he hadnt much gumption when he picked out a wife thats what
VI All Sorts and Conditions of Men

and women A September day on Prince Edward Island hills a crisp wind blowing up over the sand dunes from the sea a long red road winding through fields and woods now looping itself about a corner of thick set spruces now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery sheets of ferns beneath them now dipping down into a hollow where a brook flashed out of the woods and into them again now basking in open sunshine between ribbons of goldenrod and smokeblue asters air athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets those glad little pensioners of the summer hills a plump brown pony ambling along the road two girls behind him full to the lips with the simple priceless joy of youth and life
Oh this is a day left over from Eden isnt it Diana

and Anne sighed for sheer happiness
The air has magic in it
Look at the purple in the cup of the harvest valley Diana
And oh do smell the dying fir
Its coming up from that little sunny hollow where Mr Eben Wright has been cutting fence poles
Bliss is it on such a day to be alive but to smell dying fir is very heaven
Thats two thirds Wordsworth and one third Anne Shirley
It doesnt seem possible that there should be dying fir in heaven does it
And yet it doesnt seem to me that heaven would be quite perfect if you couldnt get a whiff of dead fir as you went through its woods
Perhaps well have the odor there without the death
Yes I think that will be the way
That delicious aroma must be the souls of the firs

and of course it will be just souls in heaven
Trees havent souls said practical Diana but the smell of dead fir is certainly lovely
Im going to make a cushion and fill it with fir needles
Youd better make one too Anne
I think I shall

and use it for my naps
Id be certain to dream I was a dryad or a woodnymph then
But just this minute Im well content to be Anne Shirley Avonlea schoolmaam driving over a road like this on such a sweet friendly day
Its a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us sighed Diana
Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road Anne
Almost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it and well probably be treated as if we were begging for ourselves
Its the very worst road of all
That is why I chose it
Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken this road if we had asked them
But you see Diana I feel myself responsible for the AVIS since I was the first to suggest it and it seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things
Im sorry on your account but you neednt say a word at the cranky places
Ill do all the talking


Mrs Lynde would say I was well able to
Mrs Lynde doesnt know whether to approve of our enterprise or not
She inclines to when she remembers that Mr and Mrs Allan are in favor of it but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the States is a count against it
So she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in Mrs Lyndes eyes
Priscilla is going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting and I expect it will be good for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family
I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found out that Mrs Charlotte E Morgan was Priscillas aunt
It seemed so wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote Edgewood Days and The Rosebud Garden
Where does Mrs Morgan live
In Toronto
And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit next summer and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have us meet her
That seems almost too good to be true but its something pleasant to imagine after you go to bed
The Avonlea Village Improvement Society was an organized fact
Gilbert Blythe was president Fred Wright vicepresident Anne Shirley secretary and Diana Barry treasurer
The Improvers as they were promptly christened were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of the members
It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many improvements so late in the season but they meant to plan the next summers campaign collect and discuss ideas write and read papers and as Anne said educate the public sentiment generally
There was some disapproval of course and

which the Improvers felt much more keenly

a good deal of ridicule
Mr Elisha Wright was reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization would be Courting Club
Mrs Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with geraniums
Mr Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after plans approved by the society
Mr James Spencer sent them word that he wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill
Eben Wright told Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to keep his whiskers trimmed
Mr Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace curtains in the cowstable windows
Mr Major Spencer asked Clifton Sloane an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory if it was true that everybody would have to have his milkstand handpainted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it
In spite of

or perhaps human nature being what it is because of

this the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they could hope to bring about that fall
At the second meeting in the Barry parlor Oliver Sloane moved that they tart a subscription to reshingle and paint the hall Julia Bell seconded it with an uneasy feeling that she was doing something not exactly ladylike
Gilbert put the motion it was carried unanimously and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes
The next thing was to appoint a committee and Gertie Pye determined not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels boldly moved that Miss Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee
This motion being also duly seconded and carried Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie on the committee along with Gilbert Anne Diana and Fred Wright
The committee chose their routes in private conclave
Anne and Diana were told off for the Newbridge road Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands road and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road
Because explained Gilbert to Anne as they walked home together through the Haunted Wood the Pyes all live along that road and they wont give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them
The next Saturday Anne and Diana started out
They drove to the end of the road and canvassed homeward calling first on the Andrew girls
If Catherine is alone we may get something said Diana but if Eliza is there we wont
Eliza was there

very much so

and looked even grimmer than usual
Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression that life is indeed a vale of tears and that a smile never to speak of a laugh is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible
The Andrew girls had been girls for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage
Catherine it was said had not entirely given up hope but Eliza who was born a pessimist had never had any
They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny corner scooped out of Mark Andrews beech woods
Eliza complained that it was terrible hot in summer but Catherine was wont to say it was lovely and warm in winter
Eliza was sewing patchwork not because it was needed but simply as a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting
Eliza listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile as the girls explained their errand
To be sure whenever Catherine caught Elizas eye she discarded the smile in guilty confusion but it crept back the next moment
If I had money to waste said Eliza grimly Id burn it up and have the fun of seeing a blaze maybe but I wouldnt give it to that hall not a cent
Its no benefit to the settlement

just a place for young folks to meet and carry on when theys better be home in their beds
Oh Eliza young folks must have some amusement protested Catherine
I dont see the necessity
We didnt gad about to halls and places when we were young Catherine Andrews
This world is getting worse every day I think its getting better said Catherine firmly
YOU think
Miss Elizas voice expressed the utmost contempt
It doesnt signify what you THINK Catherine Andrews
Facts is facts
Well I always like to look on the bright side Eliza
There isnt any bright side
Oh indeed there is cried Anne who couldnt endure such heresy in silence
Why there are ever so many bright sides Miss Andrews
Its really a beautiful world
You wont have such a high opinion of it when youve lived as long in it as I have retorted Miss Eliza sourly and you wont be so enthusiastic about improving it either
How is your mother Diana
Dear me but she has failed of late
She looks terrible run down
And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind Anne
The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful faltered Anne
Eliza shook her head
Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up
I wouldnt have much hope if I was her
Its best to be prepared for the worst
But oughtnt we be prepared for the best too
pleaded Anne
Its just as likely to happen as the worst
Not in my experience and Ive fiftyseven years to set against your sixteen retorted Eliza
Going are you
Well I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I havent much hope of it
Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go
As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over Mr Andrews pasture waving to them excitedly
It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak but she thrust a couple of quarters into Annes hand
Thats my contribution to painting the hall she gasped
Id like to give you a dollar but I dont dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did
Im real interested in your society and I believe youre going to do a lot of good
Im an optimist
I HAVE to be living with Eliza
I must hurry back before she misses me

she thinks Im feeding the hens
I hope youll have good luck canvassing and dont be cast down over what Eliza said
The world IS getting better

it certainly is
The next house was Daniel Blairs
Now it all depends on whether his wife is home or not said Diana as they jolted along a deeprutted lane
If she is we wont get a cent
Everybody says Dan Blair doesnt dare have his hair cut without asking her permission and its certain shes very close to state it moderately
She says she has to be just before shes generous
But Mrs Lynde says shes so much before that generosity never catches up with her at all
Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening
We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door
Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry going on dreadfully
We couldnt make out the words but Diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them
I cant believe that of Mr Blair for he is always so quiet and meek but at least he had great provocation for Marilla when that poor man came to the door red as a beet with perspiration streaming down his face he had on one of his wifes big gingham aprons
I cant get this durned thing off he said for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I cant bust em so youll have to excuse me ladies
We begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down
Mr Blair sat down too he twisted the apron around to his back and rolled it up but he did look so ashamed and worried that I felt sorry for him and Diana said she feared we had called at an inconvenient time
Oh not at all said Mr Blair trying to smile

you know he is always very polite


Im a little busy

getting ready to bake a cake as it were
My wife got a telegram today that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and shes gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea
She writ out the recipe and told me what to do but Ive clean forgot half the directions already
And it says flavor according to taste
What does that mean
How can you tell
And what if my taste doesnt happen to be other peoples taste
Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake
I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man
He didnt seem to be in his proper sphere at all
I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt that I saw one
It was on my lips to say Mr Blair if youll give us a subscription for the hall Ill mix up your cake for you
But I suddenly thought it wouldnt be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain with a fellow creature in distress
So I offered to mix the cake for him without any conditions at all
He just jumped at my offer
He said hed been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared cake was beyond him and yet he hated to disappoint his wife
He got me another apron and Diana beat the eggs and I mixed the cake
Mr Blair ran about and got us the materials
He had forgotten all about his apron and when he ran it streamed out behind him and Diana said she thought she would die to see it
He said he could bake the cake all right

he was used to that

and then he asked for our list and he put down four dollars
So you see we were rewarded
But even if he hadnt given a cent Id always feel that we had done a truly Christian act in helping him
Theodore Whites was the next stopping place
Neither Anne nor Diana had ever been there before and they had only a very slight acquaintance with Mrs Theodore who was not given to hospitality
Should they go to the back or front door
While they held a whispered consultation Mrs Theodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers
Deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the porch steps and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified callers
Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on these papers
she said anxiously
Ive just swept the house all over and I cant have any more dust tracked in
The paths been real muddy since the rain yesterday
Dont you dare laugh warned Anne in a whisper as they marched along the newspapers
And I implore you Diana not to look at me no matter what she says or I shall not be able to keep a sober face
The papers extended across the hall and into a prim fleckless parlor
Anne and Diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained their errand
Mrs White heard them politely interrupting only twice once to chase out an adventurous fly and once to pick up a tiny wisp of grass that had fallen on the carpet from Annes dress
Anne felt wretchedly guilty but Mrs White subscribed two dollars and paid the money down


to prevent us from having to go back for it Diana said when they got away
Mrs White had the newspapers gathered up before they had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw her busily wielding a broom in the hall
Ive always heard that Mrs Theodore White was the neatest woman alive and Ill believe it after this said Diana giving way to her suppressed laughter as soon as it was safe
I am glad she has no children said Anne solemnly
It would be dreadful beyond words for them if she had
At the Spencers Mrs Isabella Spencer made them miserable by saying something illnatured about everyone in Avonlea
Mr Thomas Boulter refused to give anything because the hall when it had been built twenty years before hadnt been built on the site he recommended
Mrs Esther Bell who was the picture of health took half an hour to detail all her aches and pains and sadly put down fifty cents because she wouldnt be there that time next year to do it

no she would be in her grave
Their worst reception however was at Simon Fletchers
When they drove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch window
But although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently nobody came to the door
Two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove away from Simon Fletchers
Even Anne admitted that she was beginning to feel discouraged
But the tide turned after that
Several Sloane homesteads came next where they got liberal subscriptions and from that to the end they fared well with only an occasional snub
Their last place of call was at Robert Dicksons by the pond bridge
They stayed to tea here although they were nearly home rather than risk offending Mrs Dickson who had the reputation of being a very touchy woman
While they were there old Mrs James White called in
Ive just been down to Lorenzos she announced
Hes the proudest man in Avonlea this minute
What do you think
Theres a brand new boy there

and after seven girls thats quite an event I can tell you
Anne pricked up her ears and when they drove away she said
Im going straight to Lorenzo Whites
But he lives on the White Sands road and its quite a distance out of our way protested Diana
Gilbert and Fred will canvass him
They are not going around until next Saturday and it will be too late by then said Anne firmly
The novelty will be worn off
Lorenzo White is dreadfully mean but he will subscribe to ANYTHING just now
We mustnt let such a golden opportunity slip Diana
The result justified Annes foresight
Mr White met them in the yard beaming like the sun upon an Easter day
When Anne asked for a subscription he agreed enthusiastically
Certain certain
Just put me down for a dollar more than the highest subscription youve got
That will be five dollars

Mr
Daniel Blair put down four said Anne half afraid
But Lorenzo did not flinch
Five it is

and heres the money on the spot
Now I want you to come into the house
Theres something in there worth seeing


something very few people have seen as yet
Just come in and pass YOUR opinion
What will we say if the baby isnt pretty
whispered Diana in trepidation as they followed the excited Lorenzo into the house
Oh there will certainly be something else nice to say about it said Anne easily
There always is about a baby
The baby WAS pretty however and Mr White felt that he got his five dollars worth of the girls honest delight over the plump little newcomer
But that was the first last and only time that Lorenzo White ever subscribed to anything
Anne tired as she was made one more effort for the public weal that night slipping over the fields to interview Mr Harrison who was as usual smoking his pipe on the veranda with Ginger beside him
Strickly speaking he was on the Carmody road but Jane and Gertie who were not acquainted with him save by doubtful report had nervously begged Anne to canvass him
Mr Harrison however flatly refused to subscribe a cent and all Annes wiles were in vain
But I thought you approved of our society Mr Harrison she mourned
So I do

so I do

but my approval doesnt go as deep as my pocket Anne
A few more experiences such as I have had today would make me as much of a pessimist as Miss Eliza Andrews Anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror at bedtime
VII The Pointing of Duty Anne leaned back in her chair one mild October evening and sighed
She was sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises but the closely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection with studies or school work
What is the matter
asked Gilbert who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh
Anne colored and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions
Nothing very dreadful
I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts as Professor Hamilton advised me but I couldnt get them to please me
They seem so still and foolish directly theyre written down on white paper with black ink
Fancies are like shadows


you cant cage them theyre such wayward dancing things
But perhaps Ill learn the secret some day if I keep on trying
I havent a great many spare moments you know
By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions I dont always feel like writing any of my own
You are getting on splendidly in school Anne
All the children like you said Gilbert sitting down on the stone step
No not all
Anthony Pye doesnt and WONT like me
What is worse he doesnt respect me

no he doesnt
He simply holds me in contempt and I dont mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably
It isnt that he is so very bad

he is only rather mischievous but no worse than some of the others
He seldom disobeys me but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it wasnt worthwhile disputing the point or he would

and it has a bad effect on the others
Ive tried every way to win him but Im beginning to fear I never shall
I want to for hes rather a cute little lad if he IS a Pye and I could like him if hed let me
Probably its merely the effect of what he hears at home
Not altogether
Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things
He has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good
Well well see what patience and kindness will do
I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work
Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others
That child is a perfect darling Gilbert and a genius into the bargain
Im persuaded the world will hear of him some day concluded Anne in a tone of conviction
I like teaching too said Gilbert
Its good training for one thing
Why Anne Ive learned more in the weeks Ive been teaching the young the ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself
We all seem to be getting on pretty well
The Newbridge people like Jane I hear and I think White Sands is tolerably satisfied with your humble servant

all except Mr Andrew Spencer
I met Mrs Peter Blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it her duty to inform me that Mr Spencer didnt approve of my methods
Have you ever noticed asked Anne reflectively that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable
Why is it that they never seem to think it a duty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you
Mrs H B DonNELL called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought it HER duty to inform me that Mrs Harmon Andrew didnt approve of my reading fairy tales to the children and that Mr Rogerson thought Prillie wasnt coming on fast enough in arithmetic
If Prillie would spend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do better
I feel quite sure that Jack Gillis works her class sums for her though Ive never been able to catch him redhanded
Have you succeeded in reconciling Mrs DonNELLs hopeful son to his saintly name
Yes laughed Anne but it was really a difficult task
At first when I called him St Clair he would not take the least notice until Id spoken two or three times and then when the other boys nudged him he would look up with such an aggrieved air as if Id called him John or Charlie and he couldnt be expected to know I meant him
So I kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him
I told him his mother wished me to call him St Clair and I couldnt go against her wishes
He saw it when it was all explained out

hes really a very reasonable little fellow

and he said I could call him St Clair but that hed lick the stuffing out of any of the boys that tried it
Of course I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language
Since then I call him St Clair and the boys call him Jake and all goes smoothly
He informs me that he means to be a carpenter but Mrs DonNELL says I am to make a college professor out of him
The mention of college gave a new direction to Gilberts thoughts and they talked for a time of their plans and wishes

gravely earnestly hopefully as youth loves to talk while the future is yet an untrodden path full of wonderful possibilities
Gilbert had finally made up his mind that he was going to be a doctor
Its a splendid profession he said enthusiastically
A fellow has to fight something all through life

didnt somebody once define man as a fighting animal

and I want to fight disease and pain and ignorance

which are all members one of another
I want to do my share of honest real work in the world Anne


add a little to the sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating since it began
The folks who lived before me have done so much for me that I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who will live after me
It seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get square with his obligations to the race
Id like to add some beauty to life said Anne dreamily
I dont exactly want to make people KNOW more

though I know that IS the noblest ambition

but Id love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me

to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I hadnt been born
I think youre fulfilling that ambition every day said Gilbert admiringly
And he was right
Anne was one of the children of light by birthright
After she had passed through a life with a smile or a word thrown across it like a gleam of sunshine the owner of that life saw it for the time being at least as hopeful and lovely and of good report
Finally Gilbert rose regretfully
Well I must run up to MacPhersons
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queens today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me
And I must get Marillas tea
She went to see Mrs Keith this evening and she will soon be back
Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home the fire was crackling cheerily a vase of frostbleached ferns and rubyred maple leaves adorned the table and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh
Are your eyes troubling you
Does your head ache
queried Anne anxiously
No
Im only tired

and worried
Its about Mary and those children 

Mary is worse

she cant last much longer
And as for the twins I dont know what is to become of them
Hasnt their uncle been heard from
Yes Mary had a letter from him
Hes working in a lumber camp and shacking it whatever that means
Anyway he says he cant possibly take the children till the spring
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter
She says she cant bear to ask any of them
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and thats a fact
And the long and short of it is Anne that Im sure Mary wants me to take those children

she didnt say so but she LOOKED it
Oh
Anne clasped her hands all athrill with excitement
And of course you will Marilla wont you
I havent made up my mind said Marilla rather tartly
I dont rush into things in your headlong way Anne
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim
And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after

twins at that
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children
Twins are very interesting

at least one pair of them said Anne
Its only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when Im away in school
I dont reckon thered be much amusement in it

more worry and bother than anything else I should say
It wouldnt be so risky if they were even as old as you were when I took you
I wouldnt mind Dora so much

she seems good and quiet
But that Davy is a limb
Anne was fond of children and her heart yearned over the Keith twins
The remembrance of her own neglected childhood was very vivid with her still
She knew that Marillas only vulnerable point was her stern devotion to what she believed to be her duty and Anne skillfully marshalled her arguments along this line
If Davy is naughty its all the more reason why he should have good training isnt it Marilla
If we dont take them we dont know who will nor what kind of influences may surround them
Suppose Mrs Keiths next door neighbors the Sprotts were to take them
Mrs Lynde says Henry Sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you cant believe a word his children say
Wouldnt it be dreadful to have the twins learn anything like that
Or suppose they went to the Wiggins
Mrs Lynde says that Mr Wiggins sells everything off the place that can be sold and brings his family up on skim milk
You wouldnt like your relations to be starved even if they were only third cousins would you
It seems to me Marilla that it is our duty to take them
I suppose it is assented Marilla gloomily
I daresay Ill tell Mary Ill take them
You neednt look so delighted Anne
It will mean a good deal of extra work for you
I cant sew a stitch on account of my eyes so youll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes
And you dont like sewing
I hate it said Anne calmly but if you are willing to take those children from a sense of duty surely I can do their sewing from a sense of duty
It does people good to have to do things they dont like

in moderation
VIII Marilla Adopts Twins Mrs Rachel Lynde was sitting at her kitchen window knitting a quilt just as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when Matthew Cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what Mrs Rachel called his imported orphan
But that had been in springtime and this was late autumn and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and brown
The sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden pomp behind the dark woods west of Avonlea when a buggy drawn by a comfortable brown nag came down the hill
Mrs Rachel peered at it eagerly
Theres Marilla getting home from the funeral she said to her husband who was lying on the kitchen lounge
Thomas Lynde lay more on the lounge nowadays than he had been used to do but Mrs Rachel who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household had not as yet noticed this
And shes got the twins with her

yes theres Davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the ponys tail and Marilla jerking him back
Doras sitting up on the seat as prim as you please
She always looks as if shed just been starched and ironed
Well poor Marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake
Still I dont see that she could do anything less than take them under the circumstances and shell have Anne to help her
Annes tickled to death over the whole business and she has a real knacky way with children I must say
Dear me it doesnt seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child
And now she has adopted twins
Youre never safe from being surprised till youre dead
The fat pony jogged over the bridge in Lyndes Hollow and along the Green Gables lane
Marillas face was rather grim
It was ten miles from East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for perpetual motion
It was beyond Marillas power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back of the wagon and break his neck or tumble over the dashboard under the ponys heels
In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when she got him home
Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap regardless of the reins flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bearlike hug
I dont believe you mean it he said smacking her wrinkled cheek affectionately
You dont LOOK like a lady whod whip a little boy just cause he couldnt keep still
Didnt you find it awful hard to keep still when you was only s old as me
No I always kept still when I was told said Marilla trying to speak sternly albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under Davys impulsive caresses
Well I spose that was cause you was a girl said Davy squirming back to his place after another hug
You WAS a girl once I spose though its awful funny to think of it
Dora can sit still

but there aint much fun in it I dont think
Seems to me it must be slow to be a girl
Here Dora let me liven you up a bit
Davys method of livening up was to grasp Doras curls in his fingers and give them a tug
Dora shrieked and then cried
How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day
demanded Marilla despairingly
But she was glad to die said Davy confidentially
I know cause she told me so
She was awful tired of being sick
Wed a long talk the night before she died
She told me you was going to take me and Dora for the winter and I was to be a good boy
Im going to be good but cant you be good running round just as well as sitting still
And she said I was always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her and Im going to
Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her
Well I aint going to let anybody else pull it said Davy doubling up his fists and frowning
Theyd just better try it
I didnt hurt her much

she just cried cause shes a girl
Im glad Im a boy but Im sorry Im a twin
When Jimmy Sprotts sister conterdicks him he just says Im oldern you so of course I know better and that settles HER
But I cant tell Dora that and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me
You might let me drive the geegee for a spell since Im a man
Altogether Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves
Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out
Dora submitted calmly to be kissed but Davy responded to Annes welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement Im Mr Davy Keith
At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady but Davys manners left much to be desired
Im so hungry I aint got time to eat plitely he said when Marilla reproved him
Dora aint half as hungry as I am
Look at all the excise I took on the road here
That cakes awful nice and plummy
We havent had any cake at home for evern ever so long cause mother was too sick to make it and Mrs Sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us
And Mrs Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes
Catch her
Can I have another piece
Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice
However she reminded Davy that he ought to say Thank you for it
Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite
When he had finished the slice he said If youll give me ANOTHER piece Ill say thank you for IT
No you have had plenty of cake said Marilla in a tone which Anne knew and Davy was to learn to be final
Davy winked at Anne and then leaning over the table snatched Doras first piece of cake from which she had just taken one dainty little bite out of her very fingers and opening his mouth to the fullest extent crammed the whole slice in
Doras lip trembled and Marilla was speechless with horror
Anne promptly exclaimed with her best schoolmaam air Oh Davy gentlemen dont do things like that
I know they dont said Davy as soon as he could speak but I aint a gemplum
But dont you want to be
said shocked Anne
Course I do
But you cant be a gemplum till you grow up
Oh indeed you can Anne hastened to say thinking she saw a chance to sow good seed betimes
You can begin to be a gentleman when you are a little boy
And gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies


or forget to say thank you

or pull anybodys hair
They dont have much fun thats a fact said Davy frankly
I guess Ill wait till Im grown up to be one
Marilla with a resigned air had cut another piece of cake for Dora
She did not feel able to cope with Davy just then
It had been a hard day for her what with the funeral and the long drive
At that moment she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done credit to Eliza Andrews herself
The twins were not noticeably alike although both were fair
Dora had long sleek curls that never got out of order
Davy had a crop of fuzzy little yellow ringlets all over his round head
Doras hazel eyes were gentle and mild Davys were as roguish and dancing as an elfs
Doras nose was straight Davys a positive snub Dora had a prunes and prisms mouth Davys was all smiles and besides he had a dimple in one cheek and none in the other which gave him a dear comical lopsided look when he laughed
Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner of his little face
Theyd better go to bed said Marilla who thought it was the easiest way to dispose of them
Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in the west gable
Youre not afraid to sleep alone are you Davy
No but I aint going to bed for ever so long yet said Davy comfortably
Oh yes you are
That was all the muchtried Marilla said but something in her tone squelched even Davy
He trotted obediently upstairs with Anne
When Im grown up the very first thing Im going to do is stay up ALL night just to see what it would be like he told her confidentially
In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver
Not that it really was so much worse than the weeks that followed it but it seemed so by reason of its novelty
There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not in mischief or devising it but his first notable exploit occurred two days after his arrival on Sunday morning

a fine warm day as hazy and mild as September
Anne dressed him for church while Marilla attended to Dora
Davy at first objected strongly to having his face washed
Marilla washed it yesterday

and Mrs Wiggins scoured me with hard soap the day of the funeral
Thats enough for one week
I dont see the good of being so awful clean
Its lots more comfable being dirty
Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord said Anne astutely
Davy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over fortyeight hours but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving whom he had heard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival
If Paul Irving washed his face every day that settled it
He Davy Keith would do it too if it killed him
The same consideration induced him to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet and he was really a handsome little lad when all was done
Anne felt an almost maternal pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew
Davy behaved quite well at first being occupied in casting covert glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was Paul Irving
The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off uneventfully
Mr Allan was praying when the sensation came
Lauretta White was sitting in front of Davy her head slightly bent and her fair hair hanging in two long braids between which a tempting expanse of white neck showed encased in a loose lace frill
Lauretta was a fat placidlooking child of eight who had conducted herself irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her there an infant of six months
Davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced

a caterpillar a furry squirming caterpillar
Marilla saw and clutched at him but she was too late
Davy dropped the caterpillar down Laurettas neck
Right into the middle of Mr Allans prayer burst a series of piercing shrieks
The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes
Every head in the congregation flew up
Lauretta White was dancing up and down in her pew clutching frantically at the back of her dress
Ow

mommer

mommer

ow

take it off

ow

get it out

ow

that bad boy put it down my neck

ow

mommer

its going further down

ow

ow

ow Mrs White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical writhing Lauretta out of church
Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr Allan proceeded with the service
But everybody felt that it was a failure that day
For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification
When they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for the rest of the day
She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a plain tea of bread and milk
Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish
But Annes mournful eyes troubled him
I spose he said reflectively that Paul Irving wouldnt have dropped a caterpillar down a girls neck in church would he
Indeed he wouldnt said Anne sadly
Well Im kind of sorry I did it then conceded Davy
But it was such a jolly big caterpillar

I picked him up on the church steps just as we went in
It seemed a pity to waste him
And say wasnt it fun to hear that girl yell
Tuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables
Anne hurried home from school for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she could give
Dora neat and proper in her nicely starched white dress and black sash was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor speaking demurely when spoken to keeping silence when not and in every way comporting herself as a model child
Davy blissfully dirty was making mud pies in the barnyard
I told him he might said Marilla wearily
I thought it would keep him out of worse mischief
He can only get dirty at that
Well have our teas over before we call him to his
Dora can have hers with us but I would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids here
When Anne went to call the Aids to tea she found that Dora was not in the parlor
Mrs Jasper Bell said Davy had come to the front door and called her out
A hasty consultation with Marilla in the pantry resulted in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on
Tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure
Marilla and Anne stared in dismay the Aids in amazement
Could that be Dora

that sobbing nondescript in a drenched dripping dress and hair from which the water was streaming on Marillas new coinspot rug
Dora what has happened to you
cried Anne with a guilty glance at Mrs Jasper Bell whose family was said to be the only one in the world in which accidents never occurred
Davy made me walk the pigpen fence wailed Dora
I didnt want to but he called me a fraidcat
And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress got all dirty and the pig runned right over me
My dress was just awful but Davy said if Id stand under the pump hed wash it clean and I did and he pumped water all over me but my dress aint a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled
Anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while Marilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes
Davy was caught and sent to bed without any supper
Anne went to his room at twilight and talked to him seriously

a method in which she had great faith not altogether unjustified by results
She told him she felt very badly over his conduct
I feel sorry now myself admitted Davy but the trouble is I never feel sorry for doing things till after Ive did them
Dora wouldnt help me make pies cause she was afraid of messing her cloes and that made me hopping mad
I spose Paul Irving wouldnt have made HIS sister walk a pigpen fence if he knew shed fall in
No he would never dream of such a thing
Paul is a perfect little gentleman
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time
Then he crawled up and put his arms about Annes neck snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder
Anne dont you like me a little bit even if I aint a good boy like Paul
Indeed I do said Anne sincerely
Somehow it was impossible to help liking Davy
But Id like you better still if you werent so naughty
I 
did something else today went on Davy in a muffled voice
Im sorry now but Im awful scared to tell you
You wont be very cross will you
And you wont tell Marilla will you
I dont know Davy
Perhaps I ought to tell her
But I think I can promise you I wont if you promise me that you will never do it again whatever it is
No I never will
Anyhow its not likely Id find any more of them this year
I found this one on the cellar steps
Davy what is it youve done
I put a toad in Marillas bed
You can go and take it out if you like
But say Anne wouldnt it be fun to leave it there
Davy Keith
Anne sprang from Davys clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marillas room
The bed was slightly rumpled
She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad blinking at her from under a pillow
How can I carry that awful thing out
moaned Anne with a shudder
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry
Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief
If Marilla knew shed never feel safe getting into bed again in her life
Im so glad that little sinner repented in time
Theres Diana signaling to me from her window
Im glad

I really feel the need of some diversion for what with Anthony Pye in school and Davy Keith at home my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day
IX A Question of Color That old nuisance of a Rachel Lynde was here again today pestering me for a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room said Mr Harrison wrathfully
I detest that woman more than anybody I know
She can put a whole sermon text comment and application into six words and throw it at you like a brick
Anne who was perched on the edge of the veranda enjoying the charm of a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray November twilight and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted firs below the garden turned her dreamy face over her shoulder
The trouble is you and Mrs Lynde dont understand one another she explained
That is always what is wrong when people dont like each other
I didnt like Mrs Lynde at first either but as soon as I came to understand her I learned to
Mrs Lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks but I didnt keep on eating bananas because I was told Id learn to like them if I did growled Mr
Harrison
And as for understanding her I understand that she is a confirmed busybody and I told her so
Oh that must have hurt her feelings very much said Anne reproachfully
How could you say such a thing
I said some dreadful things to Mrs Lynde long ago but it was when I had lost my temper
I couldnt say them DELIBERATELY
It was the truth and I believe in telling the truth to everybody
But you dont tell the whole truth objected Anne
You only tell the disagreeable part of the truth
Now youve told me a dozen times that my hair was red but youve never once told me that I had a nice nose
I daresay you know it without any telling chuckled Mr Harrison
I know I have red hair too

although its MUCH darker than it used to be

so theres no need of telling me that either
Well well Ill try and not mention it again since youre so sensitive
You must excuse me Anne
Ive got a habit of being outspoken and folks mustnt mind it
But they cant help minding it
And I dont think its any help that its your habit
What would you think of a person who went about sticking pins and needles into people and saying Excuse me you mustnt mind it

its just a habit Ive got
Youd think he was crazy wouldnt you
And as for Mrs Lynde being a busybody perhaps she is
But did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor and never said a word when Timothy Cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife hed bought it from her
Mrs Cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and Mrs Lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly
I suppose she has some good qualities conceded Mr Harrison grudgingly
Most folks have
I have some myself though you might never suspect it
But anyhow I aint going to give anything to that carpet
Folks are everlasting begging for money here it seems to me
Hows your project of painting the hall coming on
Splendidly
We had a meeting of the AVIS
last Friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the and shingle the roof too
MOST people gave very liberally Mr
Harrison
Anne was a sweetsouled lass but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required
What color are you going to have it
We have decided on a very pretty green
The roof will be dark red of course
Mr Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today
Whos got the job
Mr Joshua Pye of Carmody
He has nearly finished the shingling
We had to give him the contract for every one of the Pyes


and there are four families you know

said they wouldnt give a cent unless Joshua got it
They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose although some people think we shouldnt have given in to the Pyes
Mrs Lynde says they try to run everything
The main question is will this Joshua do his work well
If he does I dont see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding
He has the reputation of being a good workman though they say hes a very peculiar man
He hardly ever talks
Hes peculiar enough all right then said Mr Harrison drily
Or at least folks here will call him so
I never was much of a talker till I came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in selfdefense or Mrs Lynde would have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language
Youre not going yet Anne
I must
I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening
Besides Davy is probably breaking Marillas heart with some new mischief by this time
This morning the first thing he said was Where does the dark go Anne
I want to know
I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it didnt

that it went down the well
Marilla says she caught him hanging over the wellbox four times today trying to reach down to the dark
Hes a limb declared Mr Harrison
He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Gingers tail before I could get in from the barn
The poor bird has been moping ever since
Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks
Everything thats worth having is some trouble said Anne secretly resolving to forgive Davys next offence whatever it might be since he had avenged her on Ginger
Mr Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr Joshua Pye a surly taciturn man began painting the next day
He was not disturbed in his task
The hall was situated on what was called the lower road
In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer upper road
The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it
Mr Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart
Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody
Soon after his departure Mrs Rachel Lynde drove by having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint
When she rounded the spruce curve she saw
The sight affected Mrs Lynde oddly
She dropped the reins held up her hands and said Gracious Providence
She stared as if she could not believe her eyes
Then she laughed almost hysterically
There must be some mistake

there must
I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things
Mrs Lynde drove home meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall
The news flew like wildfire
Gilbert Blythe poring over a text book at home heard it from his fathers hired boy at sunset and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables joined on the way by Fred Wright
They found Diana Barry Jane Andrews and Anne Shirley despair personified at the yard gate of Green Gables under the big leafless willows
It isnt true surely Anne
exclaimed Gilbert
It is true answered Anne looking like the muse of tragedy
Mrs Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me
Oh it is simply dreadful
What is the use of trying to improve anything
What is dreadful
asked Oliver Sloane arriving at this moment with a bandbox he had brought from town for Marilla
Havent you heard
said Jane wrathfully
Well its simply this

Joshua Pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green

a deep brilliant blue the shade they use for painting carts and wheelbarrows
And Mrs Lynde says it is the most hideous color for a building especially when combined with a red roof that she ever saw or imagined
You could simply have knocked me down with a feather when I heard it
Its heartbreaking after all the trouble weve had
How on earth could such a mistake have happened
wailed Diana
The blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to the Pyes
The Improvers had decided to use MortonHarris paints and the MortonHarris paint cans were numbered according to a color card
A purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying number
Number 147 was the shade of green desired and when Mr Roger Pye sent word to the Improvers by his son John Andrew that he was going to town and would get their paint for them the Improvers told John Andrew to tell his father to get 147
John Andrew always averred that he did so but Mr Roger Pye as stanchly declared that John Andrew told him 157 and there the matter stands to this day
That night there was blank dismay in every Avonlea house where an Improver lived
The gloom at Green Gables was so intense that it quenched even Davy
Anne wept and would not be comforted
I must cry even if I am almost seventeen Marilla she sobbed
It is so mortifying
And it sounds the death knell of our society
Well simply be laughed out of existence
In life as in dreams however things often go by contraries
The Avonlea people did not laugh they were too angry
Their money had gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly aggrieved by the mistake
Public indignation centered on the Pyes
Roger Pye and John Andrew had bungled the matter between them and as for Joshua Pye he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint
Joshua Pye when thus animadverted upon retorted that the Avonlea taste in colors was no business of his whatever his private opinion might be he had been hired to paint the hall not to talk about it and he meant to have his money for it
The Improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit after consulting Mr Peter Sloane who was a magistrate
Youll have to pay it Peter told him
You cant hold him responsible for the mistake since he claims he was never told what the color was supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead
But its a burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful
The luckless Improvers expected that Avonlea would be more prejudiced than ever against them but instead public sympathy veered around in their favor
People thought the eager enthusiastic little band who had worked so hard for their object had been badly used
Mrs Lynde told them to keep on and show the Pyes that there really were people in the world who could do things without making a muddle of them
Mr Major Spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense and Mrs Hiram Sloane called at the school one day and beckoned Anne mysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the Sassiety wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they neednt be afraid of her cow for she would see that the marauding animal was kept within safe bounds
Even Mr Harrison chuckled if he chuckled at all in private and was all sympathy outwardly
Never mind Anne
Most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is as ugly as it can be to begin with so its bound to fade prettier
And the roof is shingled and painted all right
Folks will be able to sit in the hall after this without being leaked on
Youve accomplished so much anyhow
But Avonleas blue hall will be a byword in all the neighboring settlements from this time out said Anne bitterly
And it must be confessed that it was
X Davy in Search of a Sensation Anne walking home from school through the Birch Path one November afternoon felt convinced afresh that life was a very wonderful thing
The day had been a good day all had gone well in her little kingdom
St Clair Donnell had not fought any of the other boys over the question of his name Prillie Rogersons face had been so puffed up from the effects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the boys in her vicinity
Barbara Shaw had met with only ONE accident

spilling a dipper of water over the floor

and Anthony Pye had not been in school at all
What a nice month this November has been
said Anne who had never quite got over her childish habit of talking to herself
November is usually such a disagreeable month

as if the year had suddenly found out that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over it
This year is growing old gracefully

just like a stately old lady who knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles
Weve had lovely days and delicious twilights
This last fortnight has been so peaceful and even Davy has been almost wellbehaved
I really think he is improving a great deal
How quiet the woods are today


not a murmur except that soft wind purring in the treetops
It sounds like surf on a faraway shore
How dear the woods are
You beautiful trees
I love every one of you as a friend
Anne paused to throw her arm about a slim young birch and kiss its creamwhite trunk
Diana rounding a curve in the path saw her and laughed
Anne Shirley youre only pretending to be grown up
I believe when youre alone youre as much a little girl as you ever were
Well one cant get over the habit of being a little girl all at once said Anne gaily
You see I was little for fourteen years and Ive only been grownuppish for scarcely three
Im sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods
These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming


except the halfhour or so before I go to sleep
Im so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I havent another moment for imagining things
You dont know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night
I always imagine Im something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid


a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen
Last night I was a queen
Its really splendid to imagine you are a queen
You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to which you couldnt in real life
But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things

Im a dryad living in an old pine or a little brown woodelf hiding under a crinkled leaf
That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine
The only difference is shes a tree and Im a girl but thats no real difference
Where are you going Diana
Down to the Dicksons
I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress
Cant you walk down in the evening Anne and come home with me
I might

since Fred Wright is away in town said Anne with a rather too innocent face
Diana blushed tossed her head and walked on
She did not look offended however
Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons that evening but she did not
When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind
Marilla met her in the yard

a wildeyed Marilla
Anne Dora is lost
Dora
Lost
Anne looked at Davy who was swinging on the yard gate and detected merriment in his eyes
Davy do you know where she is
No I dont said Davy stoutly
I havent seen her since dinner time cross my heart
Ive been away ever since one oclock said Marilla
Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once
When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn
I only got home half an hour ago 

and no Dora to be seen
Davy declares he never saw her since I left
Neither I did avowed Davy solemnly
She must be somewhere around said Anne
She would never wander far away alone

you know how timid she is
Perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms
Marilla shook her head
Ive hunted the whole house through
But she may be in some of the buildings
A thorough search followed
Every corner of house yard and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people
Anne roved the orchards and the Haunted Wood calling Doras name
Marilla took a candle and explored the cellar
Davy accompanied each of them in turn and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be
Finally they met again in the yard
Its a most mysterious thing groaned Marilla
Where can she be
said Anne miserably Maybe shes tumbled into the well suggested Davy cheerfully
Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each others eyes
The thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words
She

she might have whispered Marilla
Anne feeling faint and sick went to the wellbox and peered over
The bucket sat on the shelf inside
Far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water
The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea
If Dora

but Anne could not face the idea
She shuddered and turned away
Run across for Mr Harrison said Marilla wringing her hands
Mr Harrison and John Henry are both away

they went to town today
Ill go for Mr
Barry
Mr Barry came back with Anne carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a clawlike instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork
Marilla and Anne stood by cold and shaken with horror and dread while Mr Barry dragged the well and Davy astride the gate watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment
Finally Mr Barry shook his head with a relieved air
She cant be down there
Its a mighty curious thing where she could have got to though
Look here young man are you sure youve no idea where your sister is
Ive told you a dozen times that I havent said Davy with an injured air
Maybe a tramp come and stole her
Nonsense said Marilla sharply relieved from her horrible fear of the well
Anne do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr Harrisons
She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over I cant believe Dora would venture so far alone but Ill go over and see said Anne
Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face
He quietly slipped off the gate and ran as fast as his fat legs could carry him to the barn
Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind
The house was locked the window shades were down and there was no sign of anything living about the place
She stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly
Ginger in the kitchen behind her shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served Mr Harrison as a toolhouse
Anne flew to the door unhasped it and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg
Oh Dora Dora what a fright you have given us
How came you to be here
Davy and I came over to see Ginger sobbed Dora but we couldnt see him after all only Davy made him swear by kicking the door
And then Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door and I couldnt get out
I cried and cried I was frightened and oh Im so hungry and cold and I thought youd never come Anne
Davy
But Anne could say no more
She carried Dora home with a heavy heart
Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by Davys behavior
The freak of shutting Dora up might easily have been pardoned
But Davy had told falsehoods

downright coldblooded falsehoods about it
That was the ugly fact and Anne could not shut her eyes to it
She could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment
She had grown to love Davy dearly

how dearly she had not known until this minute

and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood
Marilla listened to Annes tale in a silence that boded no good Davyward Mr Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt with
When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing shivering Dora got her her supper and put her to bed
Then she returned to the kitchen just as Marilla came grimly in leading or rather pulling the reluctant cobwebby Davy whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable
She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window
Anne was sitting limply by the west window
Between them stood the culprit
His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek subdued frightened back but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davys eyes as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on
But no half hidden smile answered him in Annes gray eyes as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief
There was something else

something ugly and repulsive
How could you behave so Davy
she asked sorrowfully
Davy squirmed uncomfortably
I just did it for fun
Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare
It was too
In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection
But you told a falsehood about it Davy said Anne more sorrowfully than ever
Davy looked puzzled
Whats a falsehood
Do you mean a whopper
I mean a story that was not true
Course I did said Davy frankly
If I hadnt you wouldnt have been scared
I HAD to tell it
Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions
Davys impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch
Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes
Oh Davy how could you
she said with a quiver in her voice
Dont you know how wrong it was
Davy was aghast
Anne crying

he had made Anne cry
A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it
He rushed to Anne hurled himself into her lap flung his arms around her neck and burst into tears
I didnt know it was wrong to tell whoppers he sobbed
How did you expect me to know it was wrong
All Mr Sprotts children told them REGULAR every day and cross their hearts too
I spose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here Ive been trying awful hard to be as good as him but now I spose youll never love me again
But I think you might have told me it was wrong
Im awful sorry Ive made you cry Anne and Ill never tell a whopper again
Davy buried his face in Annes shoulder and cried stormily
Anne in a sudden glad flash of understanding held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla
He didnt know it was wrong to tell falsehoods Marilla
I think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what isnt true again
I never will now that I know its bad asseverated Davy between sobs
If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can


Davy groped mentally for a suitable penance


you can skin me alive Anne
Dont say whopper Davy

say falsehood said the schoolmaam
Why
queried Davy settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained investigating face
Why aint whopper as good as falsehood
I want to know
Its just as big a word
Its slang and its wrong for little boys to use slang
Theres an awful lot of things its wrong to do said Davy with a sigh
I never sposed there was so many
Im sorry its wrong to tell whop


falsehoods cause its awful handy but since it is Im never going to tell any more
What are you going to do to me for telling them this time
I want to know
Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla
I dont want to be too hard on the child said Marilla
I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him
Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you couldnt expect a sixyearold child to know things like that by instinct
I suppose well just have to assume he doesnt know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning
But hell have to be punished for shutting Dora up and I cant think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and weve done that so often
Cant you suggest something else Anne
I should think you ought to be able to with that imagination youre always talking of
But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant things said Anne cuddling Davy
There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more
In the end Davy was sent to bed as usual there to remain until noon next day
He evidently did some thinking for when Anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly
Going in she found him sitting up in bed with his elbows on his knees and his chin propped on his hands
Anne he said solemnly is it wrong for everybody to tell whop


falsehoods
I want to know Yes indeed
Is it wrong for a grownup person
Yes
Then said Davy decidedly Marilla is bad for SHE tells them
And shes worsen me for I didnt know it was wrong but she does
Davy Keith Marilla never told a story in her life said Anne indignantly
She did so
She told me last Tuesday that something dreadful WOULD happen to me if I didnt say my prayers every night
And I havent said them for over a week just to see what would happen


and nothing has concluded Davy in an aggrieved tone
Anne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would be fatal and then earnestly set about saving Marillas reputation
Why Davy Keith she said solemnly something dreadful HAS happened to you this very day Davy looked sceptical
I spose you mean being sent to bed without any supper he said scornfully but THAT isnt dreadful
Course I dont like it but Ive been sent to bed so much since I come here that Im getting used to it
And you dont save anything by making me go without supper either for I always eat twice as much for breakfast
I dont mean your being sent to bed
I mean the fact that you told a falsehood today
And Davy

Anne leaned over the footboard of the bed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit


for a boy to tell what isnt true is almost the worst thing that could HAPPEN to him

almost the very worst
So you see Marilla told you the truth
But I thought the something bad would be exciting protested Davy in an injured tone
Marilla isnt to blame for what you thought
Bad things arent always exciting
Theyre very often just nasty and stupid
It was awful funny to see Marilla and you looking down the well though said Davy hugging his knees
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached
I wish youd tell me the joke said Marilla a little grimly
I havent seen much to laugh at today
Youll laugh when you hear this assured Anne
And Marilla did laugh which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne
But she sighed immediately afterwards
I suppose I shouldnt have told him that although I heard a minister say it to a child once
But he did aggravate me so
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed
He said he didnt see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God
Anne I do not know what we are going to do with that child
I never saw his beat
Im feeling clean discouraged
Oh dont say that Marilla
Remember how bad I was when I came here
Anne you never were bad

NEVER
I see that now when Ive learned what real badness is
You were always getting into terrible scrapes Ill admit but your motive was always good
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it
Oh no I dont think it is real badness with him either pleaded Anne
Its just mischief
And it is rather quiet for him here you know
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boys playmate
I really think it would be better to let them go to school Marilla
No said Marilla resolutely my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old and Mr Allan says the same thing
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they shant till theyre seven
Well we must try to reform Davy at home then said Anne cheerfully
With all his faults hes really a dear little chap
I cant help loving him
Marilla it may be a dreadful thing to say but honestly I like Davy better than Dora for all shes so good
I dont know but that I do myself confessed Marilla and it isnt fair for Dora isnt a bit of trouble
There couldnt be a better child and youd hardly know she was in the house
Dora is too good said Anne
Shed behave just as well if there wasnt a soul to tell her what to do
She was born already brought up so she doesnt need us and I think concluded Anne hitting on a very vital truth that we always love best the people who need us
Davy needs us badly
He certainly needs something agreed Marilla
Rachel Lynde would say it was a good spanking
XI Facts and Fancies Teaching is really very interesting work wrote Anne to a Queens Academy chum
Jane says she thinks it is monotonous but I dont find it so
Something funny is almost sure to happen every day and the children say such amusing things
Jane says she punishes her pupils when they make funny speeches which is probably why she finds teaching monotonous
This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was trying to spell speckled and couldnt manage it
Well he said finally I cant spell it but I know what it means
What
I asked
St Clair Donnells face miss
St Clair is certainly very much freckled although I try to prevent the others from commenting on it

for I was freckled once and well do I remember it
But I dont think St Clair minds
It was because Jimmy called him St Clair that St Clair pounded him on the way home from school
I heard of the pounding but not officially so I dont think Ill take any notice of it
Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition
I said If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other how many would you have altogether
A mouthful said Lottie
And in the nature study class when I asked them to give me a good reason why toads shouldnt be killed Benjie Sloane gravely answered Because it would rain the next day
Its so hard not to laugh Stella
I have to save up all my amusement until I get home and Marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause
She says a man in Grafton went insane once and that was how it began
Did you know that Thomas a Becket was canonized as a SNAKE
Rose Bell says he was

also that William Tyndale WROTE the New Testament
Claude White says a glacier is a man who puts in window frames
I think the most difficult thing in teaching as well as the most interesting is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts about things
One stormy day last week I gathered them around me at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I were one of themselves
I asked them to tell me the things they most wanted
Some of the answers were commonplace enough 


dolls ponies and skates
Others were decidedly original
Hester Boulter wanted to wear her Sunday dress every day and eat in the sitting room
Hannah Bell wanted to be good without having to take any trouble about it
Marjory White aged ten wanted to be a WIDOW
Questioned why she gravely said that if you werent married people called you an old maid and if you were your husband bossed you but if you were a widow thered be no danger of either
The most remarkable wish was Sally Bells
She wanted a honeymoon
I asked her if she knew what it was and she said she thought it was an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in Montreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest in bicycles
Another day I asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had ever done
I couldnt get the older ones to do so but the third class answered quite freely
Eliza Bell had set fire to her aunts carded rolls
Asked if she meant to do it she said not altogether
She just tried a little end to see how it would burn and the whole bundle blazed up in a jiffy
Emerson Gillis had spent ten cents for candy when he should have put it in his missionary box
Annetta Bells worst crime was eating some blueberries that grew in the graveyard
Willie White had slid down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his Sunday trousers on
But I was punished for it cause I had to wear patched pants to Sunday School all summer and when youre punished for a thing you dont have to repent of it declared Willie
I wish you could see some of their compositions

so much do I wish it that Ill send you copies of some written recently
Last week I told the fourth class I wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had seen
They were to write the letters on real note paper seal them in an envelope and address them to me all without any assistance from other people
Last Friday morning I found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening I realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures as well as its pains
Those compositions would atone for much
Here is Ned Clays address spelling and grammar as originally penned
Miss teacher ShiRley Green gabels
pe
Island can birds Dear teacher I think I will write you a composition about birds
birds is very useful animals
my cat catches birds
His name is William but pa calls him tom
he is oll striped and he got one of his ears froz of last winter
only for that he would be a goodlooking cat
My unkle has adopted a cat
it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children
that is not right
we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children
this is oll I can think of so no more at present from edward blake ClaY
St Clair Donnells is as usual short and to the point
St Clair never wastes words
I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought
It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination
Dear Miss Shirley You told us to describe something strange we have seen
I will describe the Avonlea Hall
It has two doors an inside one and an outside one
It has six windows and a chimney
It has two ends and two sides
It is painted blue
That is what makes it strange
It is built on the lower Carmody road
It is the third most important building in Avonlea
The others are the church and the blacksmith shop
They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts
Yours truly Jacob Donnell
PS
The hall is a very bright blue
Annetta Bells letter was quite long which surprised me for writing essays is not Annettas forte and hers are generally as brief as st Clairs
Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior but there isnt a shadow of orginality in her
Here is her letter
 Dearest teacher I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind

with all there is of me to love

and I want to serve you for ever
It would be my highest privilege
That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns
You are so beautiful my teacher
Your voice is like music and your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them
You are like a tall stately queen
Your hair is like rippling gold
Anthony Pye says it is red but you neednt pay any attention to Anthony
I have only known you for a few months but I cannot realize that there was ever a time when I did not know you

when you had not come into my life to bless and hallow it
I will always look back to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought you to me
Besides its the year we moved to Avonlea from Newbridge
My love for you has made my life very rich and it has kept me from much of harm and evil
I owe this all to you my sweetest teacher
I shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time I saw you in that black dress with flowers in your hair
I shall see you like that for ever even when we are both old and gray
You will always be young and fair to me dearest teacher
I am thinking of you all the time

in the morning and at the noontide and at the twilight
I love you when you laugh and when you sigh

even when you look disdainful
I never saw you look cross though Anthony Pye says you always look so but I dont wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it
I love you in every dress

you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last
Dearest teacher good night
The sun has set and the stars are shining

stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes
I kiss your hands and face my sweet
May God watch over you and protect you from all harm
Your afecksionate pupil Annetta Bell
This extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little
I knew Annetta couldnt have composed it any more than she could fly
When I went to school the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter
Annetta cried and fessed up freely
She said she had never written a letter and she didnt know how to or what to say but there was bundle of love letters in her mothers top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an old beau
It wasnt father sobbed Annetta it was someone who was studying for a minister and so he could write lovely letters but ma didnt marry him after all
She said she couldnt make out what he was driving at half the time
But I thought the letters were sweet and that Id just copy things out of them here and there to write you
I put teacher where he put lady and I put in something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words
I put dress in place of mood
I didnt know just what a mood was but I sposed it was something to wear
I didnt spose youd know the difference
I dont see how you found out it wasnt all mine
You must be awful clever teacher
I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another persons letter and pass it off as her own
But Im afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out
And I do love you teacher she sobbed
It was all true even if the minister wrote it first
I do love you with all my heart
Its very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances
Here is Barbara Shaws letter
I cant reproduce the blots of the original
Dear teacher You said we might write about a visit
I never visited but once
It was at my Aunt Marys last winter
My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper
The first night I was there we were at tea
I knocked over a jug and broke it
Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt
The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast
When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed
That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week
I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or Id have broken everything in the house
When I got better it was time to go home
I dont like visiting very much
I like going to school better especially since I came to Avonlea
Yours respectfully Barbara
Shaw
Willie Whites began Respected Miss I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt
She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up
Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion Query  Did Willie mean a menagerie lion
that had run away from a circus
And it turned out that the dog was a lion and my Very Brave Aunt had druv him into the barn with a stick
It was a wonder she was not et up but she was very brave
Emerson Gillis says if she thought it was a dog she wasnt any braver than if it really was a dog
But Emerson is jealous because he hasnt got a Brave Aunt himself nothing but uncles
I have kept the best for the last
You laugh at me because I think Paul is a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child
Paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates

no real playmates
You remember our School Management professor told us that we must not have favorites among our pupils but I cant help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine
I dont think it does any harm though for everybody loves Paul even Mrs Lynde who says she could never have believed shed get so fond of a Yankee
The other boys in school like him too
There is nothing weak or girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies
He is very manly and can hold his own in all games
He fought St Clair Donnell recently because St Clair said the Union Jack was away ahead of the Stars and Stripes as a flag
The result was a drawn battle and a mutual agreement to respect each others patriotism henceforth
St Clair says he can hit the HARDEST but Paul can hit the OFTENEST
Pauls Letter
My dear teacher You told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew
I think the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I mean to tell you about them
I have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but I would like to have you know about them because you understand things
There are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them
My rock people live at the shore
I used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came
Now I cant go till spring but they will be there for people like that never change

that is the splendid thing about them
Nora was the first one of them I got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best
She lives in Andrews Cove and she has black hair and black eyes and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies
You ought to hear the stories she can tell
Then there are the Twin Sailors
They dont live anywhere they sail all the time but they often come ashore to talk to me
They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world

and more than what is in the world
Do you know what happened to the youngest Twin Sailor once
He was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade
A moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea you know teacher
Well the youngest Twin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and sailed right through
He had some wonderful adventures in the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them
Then there is the Golden Lady of the cave
One day I found a big cave down on the shore and I went away in and after a while I found the Golden Lady
She has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive
And she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long

you can hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully but most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks
Ive never told Nora about the Golden Lady
I was afraid it might hurt her feelings
It even hurt her feelings if I talked too long with the Twin Sailors
I always met the Twin Sailors at the Striped Rocks
The youngest Twin Sailor is very goodtempered but the oldest Twin Sailor can look dreadfully fierce at times
I have my suspicions about that oldest Twin
I believe hed be a pirate if he dared
Theres really something very mysterious about him
He swore once and I told him if he ever did it again he neednt come ashore to talk to me because Id promised grandmother Id never associate with anybody that swore
He was pretty well scared I can tell you and he said if I would forgive him he would take me to the sunset
So the next evening when I was sitting on the Striped Rocks the oldest Twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and I got in her
The boat was all pearly and rainbowy like the inside of the mussel shells and her sail was like moonshine
Well we sailed right across to the sunset
Think of that teacher Ive been in the sunset
And what do you suppose it is
The sunset is a land all flowers
We sailed into a great garden and the clouds are beds of flowers
We sailed into a great harbor all the color of gold and I stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with buttercups as big as roses
I stayed there for ever so long
It seemed nearly a year but the Oldest Twin says it was only a few minutes
You see in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here
Your loving pupil Paul Irving
P S of course this letter isnt really true teacher
PI
XII A Jonah Day It really began the night before with a restless wakeful vigil of grumbling toothache
When Anne arose in the dull bitter winter morning she felt that life was flat stale and unprofitable
She went to school in no angelic mood
Her cheek was swollen and her face ached
The schoolroom was cold and smoky for the fire refused to burn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups
Anne sent them to their seats with a sharper tone than she had ever used before
Anthony Pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger and she saw him whisper something to his seatmate and then glance at her with a grin
Never so it seemed to Anne had there been so many squeaky pencils as there were that morning and when Barbara Shaw came up to the desk with a sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results
The coal rolled to every part of the room her slate was broken into fragments and when she picked herself up her face stained with coal dust sent the boys into roars of laughter
Anne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing
Really Barbara she said icily if you cannot move without falling over something youd better remain in your seat
It is positively disgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward
Poor Barbara stumbled back to her desk her tears combining with the coal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque
Never before had her beloved sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion and Barbara was heartbroken
Anne herself felt a prick of conscience but it only served to increase her mental irritation and the second reader class remember that lesson yet as well as the unmerciful infliction of arithmetic that followed
Just as Anne was snapping the sums out St Clair Donnell arrived breathlessly
You are half an hour late St Clair Anne reminded him frigidly
Why is this
Please miss I had to help ma make a pudding for dinner cause were expecting company and Clarice Almiras sick was St Clairs answer given in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of great mirth among his mates
Take your seat and work out the six problems on page eightyfour of your arithmetic for punishment said Anne
St Clair looked rather amazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his slate
Then he stealthily passed a small parcel to Joe Sloane across the aisle
Anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about that parcel
Old Mrs Hiram Sloane had lately taken to making and selling nut cakes by way of adding to her scanty income
The cakes were specially tempting to small boys and for several weeks Anne had had not a little trouble in regard to them
On their way to school the boys would invest their spare cash at Mrs Hirams bring the cakes along with them to school and if possible eat them and treat their mates during school hours
Anne had warned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be confiscated and yet here was St Clair Donnell coolly passing a parcel of them wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper Mrs Hiram used under her very eyes
Joseph said Anne quietly bring that parcel here
Joe startled and abashed obeyed
He was a fat urchin who always blushed and stuttered when he was frightened
Never did anybody look more guilty than poor Joe at that moment
Throw it into the fire said Anne
Joe looked very blank

gasped Joe in desperation
Joseph are you going to obey me or are you NOT
said Anne
A bolder and more selfpossessed lad than Joe Sloane would have been overawed by her tone and the dangerous flash of her eyes
This was a new Anne whom none of her pupils had ever seen before
Joe with an agonized glance at St Clair went to the stove opened the big square front door and threw the blue and white parcel in before St Clair who had sprung to his feet could utter a word
Then he dodged back just in time
For a few moments the terrified occupants of Avonlea school did not know whether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred
The innocent looking parcel which Anne had rashly supposed to contain Mrs Hirams nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinwheels for which Warren Sloane had sent to town by St Clair Donnells father the day before intending to have a birthday celebration that evening
The crackers went off in a thunderclap of noise and the pinwheels bursting out of the door spun madly around the room hissing and spluttering
Anne dropped into her chair white with dismay and all the girls climbed shrieking upon their desks
Joe Sloane stood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and St Clair helpless with laughter rocked to and fro in the aisle
Prillie Rogerson fainted and Annetta Bell went into hysterics
It seemed a long time although it was really only a few minutes before the last pinwheel subsided
Anne recovering herself sprang to open doors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room
Then she helped the girls carry the unconscious Prillie into the porch where Barbara Shaw in an agony of desire to be useful poured a pailful of half frozen water over Prillies face and shoulders before anyone could stop her
It was a full hour before quiet was restored 

but it was a quiet that might be felt
Everybody realized that even the explosion had not cleared the teachers mental atmosphere
Nobody except Anthony Pye dared whisper a word
Ned Clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while working a sum caught Annes eye and wished the floor would open and swallow him up
The geography class were whisked through a continent with a speed that made them dizzy
The grammar class were parsed and analyzed within an inch of their lives
Chester Sloane spelling odoriferous with two fs was made to feel that he could never live down the disgrace of it either in this world or that which is to come
Anne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident would be laughed over that night at a score of teatables but the knowledge only angered her further
In a calmer mood she could have carried off the situation with a laugh but now that was impossible so she ignored it in icy disdain
When Anne returned to the school after dinner all the children were as usual in their seats and every face was bent studiously over a desk except Anthony Pyes
He peered across his book at Anne his black eyes sparkling with curiosity and mockery
Anne twitched open the drawer of her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse sprang out of the drawer scampered over the desk and leaped to the floor
Anne screamed and sprang back as if it had been a snake and Anthony Pye laughed aloud
Then a silence fell

a very creepy uncomfortable silence
Annetta Bell was of two minds whether to go into hysterics again or not especially as she didnt know just where the mouse had gone
But she decided not to
Who could take any comfort out of hysterics with a teacher so whitefaced and so blazingeyed standing before one
Who put that mouse in my desk
said Anne
Her voice was quite low but it made a shiver go up and down Paul Irvings spine
Joe Sloane caught her eye felt responsible from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet but stuttered out wildly N

Anne paid no attention to the wretched Joseph
She looked at Anthony Pye and Anthony Pye looked back unabashed and unashamed
Anthony was it you
Yes it was said Anthony insolently
Anne took her pointer from her desk
It was a long heavy hardwood pointer
Come here Anthony
It was far from being the most severe punishment Anthony Pye had ever undergone
Anne even the stormysouled Anne she was at that moment could not have punished any child cruelly
But the pointer nipped keenly and finally Anthonys bravado failed him he winced and the tears came to his eyes
Anne consciencestricken dropped the pointer and told Anthony to go to his seat
She sat down at her desk feeling ashamed repentant and bitterly mortified
Her quick anger was gone and she would have given much to have been able to seek relief in tears
So all her boasts had come to this

she had actually whipped one of her pupils
How Jane would triumph
And how Mr Harrison would chuckle
But worse than this bitterest thought of all she had lost her last chance of winning Anthony Pye
Never would he like her now
Anne by what somebody has called a Herculaneum effort kept back her tears until she got home that night
Then she shut herself in the east gable room and wept all her shame and remorse and disappointment into her pillows

wept so long that Marilla grew alarmed invaded the room and insisted on knowing what the trouble was
The trouble is Ive got things the matter with my conscience sobbed Anne
Oh this has been such a Jonah day Marilla
Im so ashamed of myself
I lost my temper and whipped Anthony Pye
Im glad to hear it said Marilla with decision
Its what you should have done long ago
Oh no no Marilla
And I dont see how I can ever look those children in the face again
I feel that I have humiliated myself to the very dust
You dont know how cross and hateful and horrid I was
I cant forget the expression in Paul Irvings eyes

he looked so surprised and disappointed
Oh Marilla I HAVE tried so hard to be patient and to win Anthonys liking

and now it has all gone for nothing
Marilla passed her hard workworn hand over the girls glossy tumbled hair with a wonderful tenderness
When Annes sobs grew quieter she said very gently for her You take things too much to heart Anne
We all make mistakes

but people forget them
And Jonah days come to everybody
As for Anthony Pye why need you care if he does dislike you
He is the only one
I cant help it
I want everybody to love me and it hurts me so when anybody doesnt
And Anthony never will now
Oh I just made an idiot of myself today Marilla
Ill tell you the whole story
Marilla listened to the whole story and if she smiled at certain parts of it Anne never knew
When the tale was ended she said briskly Well never mind
This days done and theres a new one coming tomorrow with no mistakes in it yet as you used to say yourself
Just come downstairs and have your supper
Youll see if a good cup of tea and those plum puffs I made today wont hearten you up
Plum puffs wont minister to a mind diseased said Anne disconsolately but Marilla thought it a good sign that she had recovered sufficiently to adapt a quotation
The cheerful supper table with the twins bright faces and Marillas matchless plum puffs

of which Davy ate four


did hearten her up considerably after all
She had a good sleep that night and and awakened in the morning to find herself and the world transformed
It had snowed softly and thickly all through the hours of darkness and the beautiful whiteness glittering in the frosty sunshine looked like a mantle of charity cast over all the mistakes and humiliations of the past
Every morn is a fresh beginning Every morn is the world made new sang Anne as she dressed
Owing to the snow she had to go around by the road to school and she thought it was certainly an impish coincidence that Anthony Pye should come ploughing along just as she left the Green Gables lane
She felt as guilty as if their positions were reversed but to her unspeakable astonishment Anthony not only lifted his cap

which he had never done before

but said easily Kind of bad walking aint it
Can I take those books for you teacher
Anne surrendered her books and wondered if she could possibly be awake
Anthony walked on in silence to the school but when Anne took her books she smiled down at him

not the stereotyped kind smile she had so persistently assumed for his benefit but a sudden outflashing of good comradeship
Anthony smiled

no if the truth must be told Anthony GRINNED back
A grin is not generally supposed to be a respectful thing yet Anne suddenly felt that if she had not yet won Anthonys liking she had somehow or other won his respect
Mrs Rachel Lynde came up the next Saturday and confirmed this
Well Anne I guess youve won over Anthony Pye thats what
He says he believes you are some good after all even if you are a girl
Says that whipping you gave him was just as good as a mans
I never expected to win him by whipping him though said Anne a little mournfully feeling that her ideals had played her false somewhere
It doesnt seem right
Im sure my theory of kindness cant be wrong
No but the Pyes are an exception to every known rule thats what declared Mrs Rachel with conviction
Mr Harrison said Thought youd come to it when he heard it and Jane rubbed it in rather unmercifully
XIII A Golden Picnic Anne on her way to Orchard Slope met Diana bound for Green Gables just where the mossy old log bridge spanned the brook below the Haunted Wood and they sat down by the margin of the Dryads Bubble where tiny ferns were unrolling like curlyheaded green pixy folk wakening up from a nap
I was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my birthday on Saturday said Anne
Your birthday
But your birthday was in March
That wasnt my fault laughed Anne
If my parents had consulted me it would never have happened then
I should have chosen to be born in spring of course
It must be delightful to come into the world with the mayflowers and violets
You would always feel that you were their foster sister
But since I didnt the next best thing is to celebrate my birthday in the spring
Priscilla is coming over Saturday and Jane will be home
Well all four start off to the woods and spend a golden day making the acquaintance of the spring
We none of us really know her yet but well meet her back there as we never can anywhere else
I want to explore all those fields and lonely places anyhow
I have a conviction that there are scores of beautiful nooks there that have never really been SEEN although they may have been LOOKED at
Well make friends with wind and sky and sun and bring home the spring in our hearts
It SOUNDS awfully nice said Diana with some inward distrust of Annes magic of words
But wont it be very damp in some places yet
Oh well wear rubbers was Annes concession to practicalities
And I want you to come over early Saturday morning and help me prepare lunch
Im going to have the daintiest things possible


things that will match the spring you understand

little jelly tarts and lady fingers and drop cookies frosted with pink and yellow icing and buttercup cake
And we must have sandwiches too though theyre NOT very poetical
Saturday proved an ideal day for a picnic

a day of breeze and blue warm sunny with a little rollicking wind blowing across meadow and orchard
Over every sunlit upland and field was a delicate flowerstarred green
Mr Harrison harrowing at the back of his farm and feeling some of the spring witchwork even in his sober middleaged blood saw four girls basket laden tripping across the end of his field where it joined a fringing woodland of birch and fir
Their blithe voices and laughter echoed down to him
Its so easy to be happy on a day like this isnt it
Anne was saying with true Anneish philosophy
Lets try to make this a really golden day girls a day to which we can always look back with delight
Were to seek for beauty and refuse to see anything else
Begone dull care
Jane you are thinking of something that went wrong in school yesterday
How do you know
gasped Jane amazed
Oh I know the expression

Ive felt it often enough on my own face
But put it out of your mind theres a dear
It will keep till Monday

or if it doesnt so much the better
Oh girls girls see that patch of violets
Theres something for memorys picture gallery
When Im eighty years old

if I ever am


I shall shut my eyes and see those violets just as I see them now
Thats the first good gift our day has given us
If a kiss could be seen I think it would look like a violet said Priscilla
Anne glowed
Im so glad you SPOKE that thought Priscilla instead of just thinking it and keeping it to yourself
This world would be a much more interesting place

although it IS very interesting anyhow


if people spoke out their real thoughts
It would be too hot to hold some folks quoted Jane sagely
I suppose it might be but that would be their own faults for thinking nasty things
Anyhow we can tell all our thoughts today because we are going to have nothing but beautiful thoughts
Everybody can say just what comes into her head
THAT is conversation
Heres a little path I never saw before
Lets explore it
The path was a winding one so narrow that the girls walked in single file and even then the fir boughs brushed their faces
Under the firs were velvety cushions of moss and further on where the trees were smaller and fewer the ground was rich in a variety of green growing things
What a lot of elephants ears exclaimed Diana
Im going to pick a big bunch theyre so pretty
How did such graceful feathery things ever come to have such a dreadful name
asked Priscilla
Because the person who first named them either had no imagination at all or else far too much said Anne Oh girls look at that
That was a shallow woodland pool in the center of a little open glade where the path ended
Later on in the season it would be dried up and its place filled with a rank growth of ferns but now it was a glimmering placid sheet round as a saucer and clear as crystal
A ring of slender young birches encircled it and little ferns fringed its margin
HOW sweet
said Jane
Let us dance around it like woodnymphs cried Anne dropping her basket and extending her hands
But the dance was not a success for the ground was boggy and Janes rubbers came off
You cant be a woodnymph if you have to wear rubbers was her decision
Well we must name this place before we leave it said Anne yielding to the indisputable logic of facts
Everybody suggest a name and well draw lots
Diana
Birch Pool suggested Diana promptly
Crystal Lake said Jane
Anne standing behind them implored Priscilla with her eyes not to perpetrate another such name and Priscilla rose to the occasion with Glimmerglass
Annes selection was The Fairies Mirror
The names were written on strips of birch bark with a pencil Schoolmaam Jane produced from her pocket and placed in Annes hat
Then Priscilla shut her eyes and drew one
Crystal Lake read Jane triumphantly
Crystal Lake it was and if Anne thought that chance had played the pool a shabby trick she did not say so
Pushing through the undergrowth beyond the girls came out to the young green seclusion of Mr Silas Sloanes back pasture
Across it they found the entrance to a lane striking up through the woods and voted to explore it also
It rewarded their quest with a succession of pretty surprises
First skirting Mr Sloanes pasture came an archway of wild cherry trees all in bloom
The girls swung their hats on their arms and wreathed their hair with the creamy fluffy blossoms
Then the lane turned at right angles and plunged into a spruce wood so thick and dark that they walked in a gloom as of twilight with not a glimpse of sky or sunlight to be seen
This is where the bad wood elves dwell whispered Anne
They are impish and malicious but they cant harm us because they are not allowed to do evil in the spring
There was one peeping at us around that old twisted fir and didnt you see a group of them on that big freckly toadstool we just passed
The good fairies always dwell in the sunshiny places
I wish there really were fairies said Jane
Wouldnt it be nice to have three wishes granted you

or even only one
What would you wish for girls if you could have a wish granted
Id wish to be rich and beautiful and clever
Id wish to be tall and slender said Diana
I would wish to be famous said Priscilla
Anne thought of her hair and then dismissed the thought as unworthy
Id wish it might be spring all the time and in everybodys heart and all our lives she said
But that said Priscilla would be just wishing this world were like heaven
Only like a part of heaven
In the other parts there would be summer and autumn

yes and a bit of winter too
I think I want glittering snowy fields and white frosts in heaven sometimes
Dont you Jane
I 
I dont know said Jane uncomfortably
Jane was a good girl a member of the church who tried conscientiously to live up to her profession and believed everything she had been taught
But she never thought about heaven any more than she could help for all that
Minnie May asked me the other day if we would wear our best dresses every day in heaven laughed Diana
And didnt you tell her we would
asked Anne
Mercy no
I told her we wouldnt be thinking of dresses at all there
Oh I think we will

a LITTLE said Anne earnestly
Therell be plenty of time in all eternity for it without neglecting more important things
I believe well all wear beautiful dresses

or I suppose RAIMENT would be a more suitable way of speaking
I shall want to wear pink for a few centuries at firSt

it would take me that long to get tired of it I feel sure
I do love pink so and I can never wear it in THIS world
Past the spruces the lane dipped down into a sunny little open where a log bridge spanned a brook and then came the glory of a sunlit beechwood where the air was like transparent golden wine and the leaves fresh and green and the wood floor a mosaic of tremulous sunshine
Then more wild cherries and a little valley of lissome firs and then a hill so steep that the girls lost their breath climbing it but when they reached the top and came out into the open the prettiest surprise of all awaited them
Beyond were the back fields of the farms that ran out to the upper Carmody road
Just before them hemmed in by beeches and firs but open to the south was a little corner and in it a garden 

or what had once been a garden
A tumbledown stone dyke overgrown with mosses and grass surrounded it
Along the eastern side ran a row of garden cherry trees white as a snowdrift
There were traces of old paths still and a double line of rosebushes through the middle but all the rest of the space was a sheet of yellow and white narcissi in their airiest most lavish windswayed bloom above the lush green grasses
Oh how perfectly lovely
three of the girls cried
Anne only gazed in eloquent silence
How in the world does it happen that there ever was a garden back here
said Priscilla in amazement
It must be Hester Grays garden said Diana
Ive heard mother speak of it but I never saw it before and I wouldnt have supposed that it could be in existence still
Youve heard the story Anne
No but the name seems familiar to me
Oh youve seen it in the graveyard
She is buried down there in the poplar corner
You know the little brown stone with the opening gates carved on it and Sacred to the memory of Hester Gray aged twentytwo
Jordan Gray is buried right beside her but theres no stone to him
Its a wonder Marilla never told you about it Anne
To be sure it happened thirty years ago and everybody has forgotten
Well if theres a story we must have it said Anne
Lets sit right down here among the narcissi and Diana will tell it
Why girls there are hundreds of them

theyve spread over everything
It looks as if the garden were carpeted with moonshine and sunshine combined
This is a discovery worth making
To think that Ive lived within a mile of this place for six years and have never seen it before
Now Diana
Long ago began Diana this farm belonged to old Mr David Gray
He didnt live on it

he lived where Silas Sloane lives now
He had one son Jordan and he went up to Boston one winter to work and while he was there he fell in love with a girl named Hester Murray
She was working in a store and she hated it
Shed been brought up in the country and she always wanted to get back
When Jordan asked her to marry him she said she would if hed take her away to some quiet spot where shed see nothing but fields and trees
So he brought her to Avonlea
Mrs Lynde said he was taking a fearful risk in marrying a Yankee and its certain that Hester was very delicate and a very poor housekeeper but mother says she was very pretty and sweet and Jordan just worshipped the ground she walked on
Well Mr Gray gave Jordan this farm and he built a little house back here and Jordan and Hester lived in it for four years
She never went out much and hardly anybody went to see her except mother and Mrs Lynde
Jordan made her this garden and she was crazy about it and spent most of her time in it
She wasnt much of a housekeeper but she had a knack with flowers
And then she got sick
Mother says she thinks she was in consumption before she ever came here
She never really laid up but just grew weaker and weaker all the time
Jordan wouldnt have anybody to wait on her
He did it all himself and mother says he was as tender and gentle as a woman
Every day hed wrap her in a shawl and carry her out to the garden and shed lie there on a bench quite happy
They say she used to make Jordan kneel down by her every night and morning and pray with her that she might die out in the garden when the time came
And her prayer was answered
One day Jordan carried her out to the bench and then he picked all the roses that were out and heaped them over her and she just smiled up at him

and closed her eyes

and that concluded Diana softly was the end
Oh what a dear story sighed Anne wiping away her tears
What became of Jordan
asked Priscilla
He sold the farm after Hester died and went back to Boston
Mr Jabez Sloane bought the farm and hauled the little house out to the road
Jordan died about ten years after and he was brought home and buried beside Hester
I cant understand how she could have wanted to live back here away from everything said Jane
Oh I can easily understand THAT said Anne thoughtfully
I wouldnt want it myself for a steady thing because although I love the fields and woods I love people too
But I can understand it in Hester
She was tired to death of the noise of the big city and the crowds of people always coming and going and caring nothing for her
She just wanted to escape from it all to some still green friendly place where she could reSt
And she got just what she wanted which is something very few people do I believe
She had four beautiful years before she died

four years of perfect happiness so I think she was to be envied more than pitied
And then to shut your eyes and fall asleep among roses with the one you loved best on earth smiling down at you

oh I think it was beautiful
She set out those cherry trees over there said Diana
She told mother shed never live to eat their fruit but she wanted to think that something she had planted would go on living and helping to make the world beautiful after she was dead
Im so glad we came this way said Anne the shiningeyed
This is my adopted birthday you know and this garden and its story is the birthday gift it has given me
Did your mother ever tell you what Hester Gray looked like Diana
No

only just that she was pretty
Im rather glad of that because I can imagine what she looked like without being hampered by facts
I think she was very slight and small with softly curling dark hair and big sweet timid brown eyes and a little wistful pale face
The girls left their baskets in Hesters garden and spent the rest of the afternoon rambling in the woods and fields surrounding it discovering many pretty nooks and lanes
When they got hungry they had lunch in the prettiest spot of all

on the steep bank of a gurgling brook where white birches shot up out of long feathery grasses
The girls sat down by the roots and did full justice to Annes dainties even the unpoetical sandwiches being greatly appreciated by hearty unspoiled appetites sharpened by all the fresh air and exercise they had enjoyed
Anne had brought glasses and lemonade for her guests but for her own part drank cold brook water from a cup fashioned out of birch bark
The cup leaked and the water tasted of earth as brook water is apt to do in spring but Anne thought it more appropriate to the occasion than lemonade
Look do you see that poem
she said suddenly pointing
Where
Jane and Diana stared as if expecting to see Runic rhymes on the birch trees
There

down in the brook

that old green mossy log with the water flowing over it in those smooth ripples that look as if theyd been combed and that single shaft of sunshine falling right athwart it far down into the pool
Oh its the most beautiful poem I ever saw
I should rather call it a picture said Jane
A poem is lines and verses
Oh dear me no
Anne shook her head with its fluffy wild cherry coronal positively
The lines and verses are only the outward garments of the poem and are no more really it than your ruffles and flounces are YOU Jane
The real poem is the soul within them 

and that beautiful bit is the soul of an unwritten poem
It is not every day one sees a soul

even of a poem
I wonder what a soul

a persons soul

would look like said Priscilla dreamily
Like that I should think answered Anne pointing to a radiance of sifted sunlight streaming through a birch tree
Only with shape and features of course
I like to fancy souls as being made of light
And some are all shot through with rosy stains and quivers

and some have a soft glitter like moonlight on the sea

and some are pale and transparent like mist at dawn
I read somewhere once that souls were like flowers said Priscilla
Then your soul is a golden narcissus said Anne and Dianas is like a red red rose
Janes is an apple blossom pink and wholesome and sweet
And your own is a white violet with purple streaks in its heart finished Priscilla
Jane whispered to Diana that she really could not understand what they were talking about
Could she
The girls went home by the light of a calm golden sunset their baskets filled with narcissus blossoms from Hesters garden some of which Anne carried to the cemetery next day and laid upon Hesters grave
Minstrel robins were whistling in the firs and the frogs were singing in the marshes
All the basins among the hills were brimmed with topaz and emerald light
Well we have had a lovely time after all said Diana as if she had hardly expected to have it when she set out
It has been a truly golden day said Priscilla
Im really awfully fond of the woods myself said Jane
Anne said nothing
She was looking afar into the western sky and thinking of little Hester Gray
XIV A Danger Averted Anne walking home from the post office one Friday evening was joined by Mrs Lynde who was as usual cumbered with all the cares of church and state
Ive just been down to Timothy Cottons to see if I could get Alice Louise to help me for a few days she said
I had her last week for though shes too slow to stop quick shes better than nobody
But shes sick and cant come
Timothys sitting there too coughing and complaining
Hes been dying for ten years and hell go on dying for ten years more
That kind cant even die and have done with it

they cant stick to anything even to being sick long enough to finish it
Theyre a terrible shiftless family and what is to become of them I dont know but perhaps Providence does
Mrs Lynde sighed as if she rather doubted the extent of Providential knowledge on the subject
Marilla was in about her eyes again Tuesday wasnt she
What did the specialist think of them
she continued
He was much pleased said Anne brightly
He says there is a great improvement in them and he thinks the danger of her losing her sight completely is past
But he says shell never be able to read much or do any fine handwork again
How are your preparations for your bazaar coming on
The Ladies Aid Society was preparing for a fair and supper and Mrs Lynde was the head and front of the enterprise
Pretty well

and that reminds me
Mrs Allan thinks it would be nice to fix up a booth like an oldtime kitchen and serve a supper of baked beans doughnuts pie and so on
Were collecting oldfashioned fixings everywhere
Mrs Simon Fletcher is going to lend us her mothers braided rugs and Mrs Levi Boulter some old chairs and Aunt Mary Shaw will lend us her cupboard with the glass doors
I suppose Marilla will let us have her brass candlesticks
And we want all the old dishes we can get
Mrs Allan is specially set on having a real blue willow ware platter if we can find one
But nobody seems to have one
Do you know where we could get one
Miss Josephine Barry has one
Ill write and ask her if shell lend it for the occasion said Anne
Well I wish you would
I guess well have the supper in about a fortnights time
Uncle Abe Andrews is prophesying rain and storms for about that time and thats a pretty sure sign well have fine weather
The said Uncle Abe it may be mentioned was at least like other prophets in that he had small honor in his own country
He was in fact considered in the light of a standing joke for few of his weather predictions were ever fulfilled
Mr Elisha Wright who labored under the impression that he was a local wit used to say that nobody in Avonlea ever thought of looking in the Charlottetown dailies for weather probabilities
No they just asked Uncle Abe what it was going to be tomorrow and expected the opposite
Nothing daunted Uncle Abe kept on prophesying
We want to have the fair over before the election comes off continued Mrs Lynde for the candidates will be sure to come and spend lots of money
The Tories are bribing right and left so they might as well be given a chance to spend their money honestly for once
Anne was a redhot Conservative out of loyalty to Matthews memory but she said nothing
She knew better than to get Mrs Lynde started on politics
She had a letter for Marilla postmarked from a town in British Columbia
Its probably from the childrens uncle she said excitedly when she got home
Oh Marilla I wonder what he says about them
The best plan might be to open it and see said Marilla curtly
A close observer might have thought that she was excited also but she would rather have died than show it
Anne tore open the letter and glanced over the somewhat untidy and poorly written contents
He says he cant take the children this spring

hes been sick most of the winter and his wedding is put off
He wants to know if we can keep them till the fall and hell try and take them then
We will of course wont we Marilla
I dont see that there is anything else for us to do said Marilla rather grimly although she felt a secret relief
Anyhow theyre not so much trouble as they were

or else weve got used to them
Davy has improved a great deal
His MANNERS are certainly much better said Anne cautiously as if she were not prepared to say as much for his morals
Anne had come home from school the previous evening to find Marilla away at an Aid meeting Dora asleep on the kitchen sofa and Davy in the sitting room closet blissfully absorbing the contents of a jar of Marillas famous yellow plum preserves


company jam Davy called it

which he had been forbidden to touch
He looked very guilty when Anne pounced on him and whisked him out of the closet
Davy Keith dont you know that it is very wrong of you to be eating that jam when you were told never to meddle with anything in THAT closet
Yes I knew it was wrong admitted Davy uncomfortably but plum jam is awful nice Anne
I just peeped in and it looked so good I thought Id take just a weeny taste
I stuck my finger in


Anne groaned


and licked it clean
And it was so much gooder than Id ever thought that I got a spoon and just SAILED IN
Anne gave him such a serious lecture on the sin of stealing plum jam that Davy became conscience stricken and promised with repentant kisses never to do it again
Anyhow therell be plenty of jam in heaven thats one comfort he said complacently
Anne nipped a smile in the bud
Perhaps there will

if we want it she said But what makes you think so
Why its in the catechism said Davy
Oh no there is nothing like THAT in the catechism Davy
But I tell you there is persisted Davy
It was in that question Marilla taught me last Sunday
Why should we love God
It says Because He makes preserves and redeems us
Preserves is just a holy way of saying jam
I must get a drink of water said Anne hastily
When she came back it cost her some time and trouble to explain to Davy that a certain comma in the said catechism question made a great deal of difference in the meaning
Well I thought it was too good to be true he said at last with a sigh of disappointed conviction
And besides I didnt see when Hed find time to make jam if its one endless Sabbath day as the hymn says
I dont believe I want to go to heaven
Wont there ever be any Saturdays in heaven Anne
Yes Saturdays and every other kind of beautiful days
And every day in heaven will be more beautiful than the one before it Davy assured Anne who was rather glad that Marilla was not by to be shocked
Marilla it is needless to say was bringing the twins up in the good old ways of theology and discouraged all fanciful speculations thereupon
Davy and Dora were taught a hymn a catechism question and two Bible verses every Sunday
Dora learned meekly and recited like a little machine with perhaps as much understanding or interest as if she were one
Davy on the contrary had a lively curiosity and frequently asked questions which made Marilla tremble for his fate
Chester Sloane says well do nothing all the time in heaven but walk around in white dresses and play on harps and he says he hopes he wont have to go till hes an old man cause maybe hell like it better then
And he thinks it will be horrid to wear dresses and I think so too
Why cant men angels wear trousers Anne
Chester Sloane is interested in those things cause theyre going to make a minister of him
Hes got to be a minister cause his grandmother left the money to send him to college and he cant have it unless he is a minister
She thought a minister was such a spectable thing to have in a family
Chester says he doesnt mind much

though hed rather be a blacksmith

but hes bound to have all the fun he can before he begins to be a minister cause he doesnt expect to have much afterwards
I aint going to be a minister
Im going to be a storekeeper like Mr Blair and keep heaps of candy and bananas
But Id rather like going to your kind of a heaven if theyd let me play a mouth organ instead of a harp
Do you spose they would
Yes I think they would if you wanted it was all Anne could trust herself to say
The AVIS
met at Mr Harmon Andrews that evening and a full attendance had been requested since important business was to be discussed
The AVIS
was in a flourishing condition and had already accomplished wonders
Early in the spring Mr Major Spencer had redeemed his promise and had stumped graded and seeded down all the road front of his farm
A dozen other men some prompted by a determination not to let a Spencer get ahead of them others goaded into action by Improvers in their own households had followed his example
The result was that there were long strips of smooth velvet turf where once had been unsightly undergrowth or brush
The farm fronts that had not been done looked so badly by contrast that their owners were secretly shamed into resolving to see what they could do another spring
The triangle of ground at the cross roads had also been cleared and seeded down and Annes bed of geraniums unharmed by any marauding cow was already set out in the center
Altogether the Improvers thought that they were getting on beautifully even if Mr Levi Boulter tactfully approached by a carefully selected committee in regard to the old house on his upper farm did bluntly tell them that he wasnt going to have it meddled with
At this especial meeting they intended to draw up a petition to the school trustees humbly praying that a fence be put around the school grounds and a plan was also to be discussed for planting a few ornamental trees by the church if the funds of the society would permit of it

for as Anne said there was no use in starting another subscription as long as the hall remained blue
The members were assembled in the Andrews parlor and Jane was already on her feet to move the appointment of a committee which should find out and report on the price of said trees when Gertie Pye swept in pompadoured and frilled within an inch of her life
Gertie had a habit of being late


to make her entrance more effective spiteful people said
Gerties entrance in this instance was certainly effective for she paused dramatically on the middle of the floor threw up her hands rolled her eyes and exclaimed Ive just heard something perfectly awful
What DO you think
Mr Judson Parker IS GOING TO RENT ALL THE ROAD FENCE OF HIS FARM TO A PATENT MEDICINE COMPANY TO PAINT ADVERTISEMENTS ON
For once in her life Gertie Pye made all the sensation she desired
If she had thrown a bomb among the complacent Improvers she could hardly have made more
It CANT be true said Anne blankly
Thats just what I said when I heard it first dont you know said Gertie who was enjoying herself hugely
I said it couldnt be true

that Judson Parker wouldnt have the HEART to do it dont you know
But father met him this afternoon and asked him about it and he said it WAS true
Just fancy
His farm is sideon to the Newbridge road and how perfectly awful it will look to see advertisements of pills and plasters all along it dont you know
The Improvers DID know all too well
Even the least imaginative among them could picture the grotesque effect of half a mile of board fence adorned with such advertisements
All thought of church and school grounds vanished before this new danger
Parliamentary rules and regulations were forgotten and Anne in despair gave up trying to keep minutes at all
Everybody talked at once and fearful was the hubbub
Oh let us keep calm implored Anne who was the most excited of them all and try to think of some way of preventing him
I dont know how youre going to prevent him exclaimed Jane bitterly
Everybody knows what Judson Parker is
Hed do ANYTHING for money
He hasnt a SPARK of public spirit or ANY sense of the beautiful
The prospect looked rather unpromising
Judson Parker and his sister were the only Parkers in Avonlea so that no leverage could be exerted by family connections
Martha Parker was a lady of all too certain age who disapproved of young people in general and the Improvers in particular
Judson was a jovial smoothspoken man so uniformly goodnatured and bland that it was surprising how few friends he had
Perhaps he had got the better in too many business transactions

which seldom makes for popularity
He was reputed to be very sharp and it was the general opinion that he hadnt much principle
If Judson Parker has a chance to turn an honest penny as he says himself hell never lose it declared Fred Wright
Is there NOBODY who has any influence over him
asked Anne despairingly
He goes to see Louisa Spencer at White Sands suggested Carrie Sloane
Perhaps she could coax him not to rent his fences
Not she said Gilbert emphatically
I know Louisa Spencer well
She doesnt believe in Village Improvement Societies but she DOES believe in dollars and cents
Shed be more likely to urge Judson on than to dissuade him
The only thing to do is to appoint a committee to wait on him and protest said Julia Bell and you must send girls for hed hardly be civil to boys 

but I wont go so nobody need nominate me
Better send Anne alone  said Oliver Sloane
She can talk Judson over if anybody can
Anne protested
She was willing to go and do the talking but she must have others with her for moral support
Diana and Jane were therefore appointed to support her morally and the Improvers broke up buzzing like angry bees with indignation
Anne was so worried that she didnt sleep until nearly morning and then she dreamed that the trustees had put a fence around the school and painted Try Purple Pills all over it
The committee waited on Judson Parker the next afternoon
Anne pleaded eloquently against his nefarious design and Jane and Diana supported her morally and valiantly
Judson was sleek suave flattering paid them several compliments of the delicacy of sunflowers felt real bad to refuse such charming young ladies 

but business was business couldnt afford to let sentiment stand in the way these hard times
But Ill tell what I WILL do he said with a twinkle in his light full eyes
Ill tell the agent he must use only handsome tasty colors

red and yellow and so on
Ill tell him he mustnt paint the ads BLUE on any account
The vanquished committee retired thinking things not lawful to be uttered
We have done all we can do and must simply trust the rest to Providence said Jane with an unconscious imitation of Mrs Lyndes tone and manner
I wonder if Mr Allan could do anything reflected Diana
Anne shook her head
No its no use to worry Mr Allan especially now when the babys so sick
Judson would slip away from him as smoothly as from us although he HAS taken to going to church quite regularly just now
That is simply because Louisa Spencers father is an elder and very particular about such things
Judson Parker is the only man in Avonlea who would dream of renting his fences said Jane indignantly
Even Levi Boulter or Lorenzo White would never stoop to that tightfisted as they are
They would have too much respect for public opinion
Public opinion was certainly down on Judson Parker when the facts became known but that did not help matters much
Judson chuckled to himself and defied it and the Improvers were trying to reconcile themselves to the prospect of seeing the prettiest part of the Newbridge road defaced by advertisements when Anne rose quietly at the presidents call for reports of committees on the occasion of the next meeting of the Society and announced that Mr Judson Parker had instructed her to inform the Society that he was NOT going to rent his fences to the Patent Medicine Company
Jane and Diana stared as if they found it hard to believe their ears
Parliamentary etiquette which was generally very strictly enforced in the AVIS forbade them giving instant vent to their curiosity but after the Society adjourned Anne was besieged for explanations
Anne had no explanation to give
Judson Parker had overtaken her on the road the preceding evening and told her that he had decided to humor the AVIS
in its peculiar prejudice against patent medicine advertisements
That was all Anne would say then or ever afterwards and it was the simple truth but when Jane Andrews on her way home confided to Oliver Sloane her firm belief that there was more behind Judson Parkers mysterious change of heart than Anne Shirley had revealed she spoke the truth also
Anne had been down to old Mrs Irvings on the shore road the preceding evening and had come home by a short cut which led her first over the lowlying shore fields and then through the beech wood below Robert Dicksons by a little footpath that ran out to the main road just above the Lake of Shining Waters

known to unimaginative people as Barrys pond
Two men were sitting in their buggies reined off to the side of the road just at the entrance of the path
One was Judson Parker the other was Jerry Corcoran a Newbridge man against whom as Mrs Lynde would have told you in eloquent italics nothing shady had ever been PROVED
He was an agent for agricultural implements and a prominent personage in matters political
He had a finger


some people said ALL his fingers

in every political pie that was cooked and as Canada was on the eve of a general election Jerry Corcoran had been a busy man for many weeks canvassing the county in the interests of his partys candidate
Just as Anne emerged from under the overhanging beech boughs she heard Corcoran say If youll vote for Amesbury Parker

well Ive a note for that pair of harrows youve got in the spring
I suppose you wouldnt object to having it back eh
We

ll since you put it in that way drawled Judson with a grin I reckon I might as well do it
A man must look out for his own interests in these hard times
Both saw Anne at this moment and conversation abruptly ceased
Anne bowed frostily and walked on with her chin slightly more tilted than usual
Soon Judson Parker overtook her
Have a lift Anne
he inquired genially
Thank you no said Anne politely but with a fine needlelike disdain in her voice that pierced even Judson Parkers none too sensitive consciousness
His face reddened and he twitched his reins angrily but the next second prudential considerations checked him
He looked uneasily at Anne as she walked steadily on glancing neither to the right nor to the left
Had she heard Corcorans unmistakable offer and his own too plain acceptance of it
Confound Corcoran
If he couldnt put his meaning into less dangerous phrases hed get into trouble some of these longcomeshorts
And confound redheaded schoolmaams with a habit of popping out of beechwoods where they had no business to be
If Anne had heard Judson Parker measuring her corn in his own half bushel as the country saying went and cheating himself thereby as such people generally do believed that she would tell it far and wide
Now Judson Parker as has been seen was not overly regardful of public opinion but to be known as having accepted a bribe would be a nasty thing and if it ever reached Isaac Spencers ears farewell forever to all hope of winning Louisa Jane with her comfortable prospects as the heiress of a welltodo farmer
Judson Parker knew that Mr Spencer looked somewhat askance at him as it was he could not afford to take any risks
Ahem

Anne Ive been wanting to see you about that little matter we were discussing the other day
Ive decided not to let my fences to that company after all
A society with an aim like yours ought to be encouraged
Anne thawed out the merest trifle
Thank you she said
And

and

you neednt mention that little conversation of mine with Jerry
I have no intention of mentioning it in any case said Anne icily for she would have seen every fence in Avonlea painted with advertisements before she would have stooped to bargain with a man who would sell his vote
Just so

just so agreed Judson imagining that they understood each other beautifully
I didnt suppose you would
Of course I was only stringing Jerry

he thinks hes so allfired cute and smart
Ive no intention of voting for Amesbury
Im going to vote for Grant as Ive always done

youll see that when the election comes off
I just led Jerry on to see if he would commit himself
And its all right about the fence 

you can tell the Improvers that
It takes all sorts of people to make a world as Ive often heard but I think there are some who could be spared Anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror that night
I wouldnt have mentioned the disgraceful thing to a soul anyhow so my conscience is clear on THAT score
I really dont know who or what is to be thanked for this
I did nothing to bring it about and its hard to believe that Providence ever works by means of the kind of politics men like Judson Parker and Jerry Corcoran have
XV The Beginning of Vacation Anne locked the schoolhouse door on a still yellow evening when the winds were purring in the spruces around the playground and the shadows were long and lazy by the edge of the woods
She dropped the key into her pocket with a sigh of satisfaction
The school year was ended she had been reengaged for the next with many expressions of satisfaction

only Mr Harmon Andrews told her she ought to use the strap oftener

and two delightful months of a wellearned vacation beckoned her invitingly
Anne felt at peace with the world and herself as she walked down the hill with her basket of flowers in her hand
Since the earliest mayflowers Anne had never missed her weekly pilgrimage to Matthews grave
Everyone else in Avonlea except Marilla had already forgotten quiet shy unimportant Matthew Cuthbert but his memory was still green in Annes heart and always would be
She could never forget the kind old man who had been the first to give her the love and sympathy her starved childhood had craved
At the foot of the hill a boy was sitting on the fence in the shadow of the spruces

a boy with big dreamy eyes and a beautiful sensitive face
He swung down and joined Anne smiling but there were traces of tears on his cheeks
I thought Id wait for you teacher because I knew you were going to the graveyard he said slipping his hand into hers
Im going there too

Im taking this bouquet of geraniums to put on Grandpa Irvings grave for grandma
And look teacher Im going to put this bunch of white roses beside Grandpas grave in memory of my little mother

because I cant go to her grave to put it there
But dont you think shell know all about it just the same
Yes I am sure she will Paul
You see teacher its just three years today since my little mother died
Its such a long long time but it hurts just as much as ever

and I miss her just as much as ever
Sometimes it seems to me that I just cant bear it it hurts so
Pauls voice quivered and his lip trembled
He looked down at his roses hoping that his teacher would not notice the tears in his eyes
And yet said Anne very softly you wouldnt want it to stop hurting 

you wouldnt want to forget your little mother even if you could
No indeed I wouldnt

thats just the way I feel
Youre so good at understanding teacher
Nobody else understands so well

not even grandma although shes so good to me
Father understood pretty well but still I couldnt talk much to him about mother because it made him feel so bad
When he put his hand over his face I always knew it was time to stop
Poor father he must be dreadfully lonesome without me but you see he has nobody but a housekeeper now and he thinks housekeepers are no good to bring up little boys especially when he has to be away from home so much on business
Grandmothers are better next to mothers
Someday when Im brought up Ill go back to father and were never going to be parted again
Paul had talked so much to Anne about his mother and father that she felt as if she had known them
She thought his mother must have been very like what he was himself in temperament and disposition and she had an idea that Stephen Irving was a rather reserved man with a deep and tender nature which he kept hidden scrupulously from the world
Fathers not very easy to get acquainted with Paul had said once
I never got really acquainted with him until after my little mother died
But hes splendid when you do get to know him
I love him the best in all the world and Grandma Irving next and then you teacher
Id love you next to father if it wasnt my DUTY to love Grandma Irving best because shes doing so much for me
YOU know teacher
I wish she would leave the lamp in my room till I go to sleep though
She takes it right out as soon as she tucks me up because she says I mustnt be a coward
Im NOT scared but Id RATHER have the light
My little mother used always to sit beside me and hold my hand till I went to sleep
I expect she spoiled me
Mothers do sometimes you know
No Anne did not know this although she might imagine it
She thought sadly of HER little mother the mother who had thought her so perfectly beautiful and who had died so long ago and was buried beside her boyish husband in that unvisited grave far away
Anne could not remember her mother and for this reason she almost envied Paul
My birthday is next week said Paul as they walked up the long red hill basking in the June sunshine and father wrote me that he is sending me something that he thinks Ill like better than anything else he could send
I believe it has come already for Grandma is keeping the bookcase drawer locked and that is something new
And when I asked her why she just looked mysterious and said little boys mustnt be too curious
Its very exciting to have a birthday isnt it
Ill be eleven
Youd never think it to look at me would you
Grandma says Im very small for my age and that its all because I dont eat enough porridge
I do my very best but Grandma gives such generous platefuls

theres nothing mean about Grandma I can tell you
Ever since you and I had that talk about praying going home from Sunday School that day teacher


when you said we ought to pray about all our difficulties

Ive prayed every night that God would give me enough grace to enable me to eat every bit of my porridge in the mornings
But Ive never been able to do it yet and whether its because I have too little grace or too much porridge I really cant decide
Grandma says father was brought up on porridge and it certainly did work well in his case for you ought to see the shoulders he has
But sometimes concluded Paul with a sigh and a meditative air I really think porridge will be the death of me
Anne permitted herself a smile since Paul was not looking at her
All Avonlea knew that old Mrs Irving was bringing her grandson up in accordance with the good oldfashioned methods of diet and morals
Let us hope not dear she said cheerfully
How are your rock people coming on
Does the oldest Twin still continue to behave himself
He HAS to said Paul emphatically
He knows I wont associate with him if he doesnt
He is really full of wickedness I think
And has Nora found out about the Golden Lady yet
No but I think she suspects
Im almost sure she watched me the last time I went to the cave
I dont mind if she finds out


it is only for HER sake I dont want her to

so that her feelings wont be hurt
But if she is DETERMINED to have her feelings hurt it cant be helped
If I were to go to the shore some night with you do you think I could see your rock people too
Paul shook his head gravely
No I dont think you could see MY rock people
Im the only person who can see them
But you could see rock people of your own
Youre one of the kind that can
Were both that kind
YOU know teacher he added squeezing her hand chummily
Isnt it splendid to be that kind teacher
Splendid Anne agreed gray shining eyes looking down into blue shining ones
Anne and Paul both knew How fair the realm Imagination opens to the view and both knew the way to that happy land
There the rose of joy bloomed immortal by dale and stream clouds never darkened the sunny sky sweet bells never jangled out of tune and kindred spirits abounded
The knowledge of that lands geography


east o the sun west o the moon

is priceless lore not to be bought in any market place
It must be the gift of the good fairies at birth and the years can never deface it or take it away
It is better to possess it living in a garret than to be the inhabitant of palaces without it
The Avonlea graveyard was as yet the grassgrown solitude it had always been
To be sure the Improvers had an eye on it and Priscilla Grant had read a paper on cemeteries before the last meeting of the Society
At some future time the Improvers meant to have the lichened wayward old board fence replaced by a neat wire railing the grass mown and the leaning monuments straightened up
Anne put on Matthews grave the flowers she had brought for it and then went over to the little poplar shaded corner where Hester Gray slept
Ever since the day of the spring picnic Anne had put flowers on Hesters grave when she visited Matthews
The evening before she had made a pilgrimage back to the little deserted garden in the woods and brought therefrom some of Hesters own white roses
I thought you would like them better than any others dear she said softly
Anne was still sitting there when a shadow fell over the grass and she looked up to see Mrs Allan
They walked home together
Mrs Allans face was not the face of the girlbride whom the minister had brought to Avonlea five years before
It had lost some of its bloom and youthful curves and there were fine patient lines about eyes and mouth
A tiny grave in that very cemetery accounted for some of them and some new ones had come during the recent illness now happily over of her little son
But Mrs Allans dimples were as sweet and sudden as ever her eyes as clear and bright and true and what her face lacked of girlish beauty was now more than atoned for in added tenderness and strength
I suppose you are looking forward to your vacation Anne
she said as they left the graveyard
Anne nodded
Yes 
I could roll the word as a sweet morsel under my tongue
I think the summer is going to be lovely
For one thing Mrs Morgan is coming to the Island in July and Priscilla is going to bring her up
I feel one of my old thrills at the mere thought
I hope youll have a good time Anne
Youve worked very hard this past year and you have succeeded
Oh I dont know
Ive come so far short in so many things
I havent done what I meant to do when I began to teach last fall
I havent lived up to my ideals
None of us ever do said Mrs Allan with a sigh
But then Anne you know what Lowell says Not failure but low aim is crime
We must have ideals and try to live up to them even if we never quite succeed
Life would be a sorry business without them
With them its grand and great
Hold fast to your ideals Anne
I shall try
But I have to let go most of my theories said Anne laughing a little
I had the most beautiful set of theories you ever knew when I started out as a schoolmaam but every one of them has failed me at some pinch or another
Even the theory on corporal punishment teased Mrs Allan
But Anne flushed
I shall never forgive myself for whipping Anthony
Nonsense dear he deserved it
And it agreed with him
You have had no trouble with him since and he has come to think theres nobody like you
Your kindness won his love after the idea that a girl was no good was rooted out of his stubborn mind
He may have deserved it but that is not the point
If I had calmly and deliberately decided to whip him because I thought it a just punishment for him I would not feel over it as I do
But the truth is Mrs Allan that I just flew into a temper and whipped him because of that
I wasnt thinking whether it was just or unjust

even if he hadnt deserved it Id have done it just the same
That is what humiliates me
Well we all make mistakes dear so just put it behind you
We should regret our mistakes and learn from them but never carry them forward into the future with us
There goes Gilbert Blythe on his wheel

home for his vacation too I suppose
How are you and he getting on with your studies
Pretty well
We plan to finish the Virgil tonight

there are only twenty lines to do
Then we are not going to study any more until September
Do you think you will ever get to college
Oh I dont know
Anne looked dreamily afar to the opaltinted horizon
Marillas eyes will never be much better than they are now although we are so thankful to think that they will not get worse
And then there are the twins

somehow I dont believe their uncle will ever really send for them
Perhaps college may be around the bend in the road but I havent got to the bend yet and I dont think much about it lest I might grow discontented
Well I should like to see you go to college Anne but if you never do dont be discontented about it
We make our own lives wherever we are after all

college can only help us to do it more easily
They are broad or narrow according to what we put into them not what we get out
Life is rich and full here


everywhere

if we can only learn how to open our whole hearts to its richness and fulness
I think I understand what you mean said Anne thoughtfully and I know I have so much to feel thankful for

oh so much


my work and Paul Irving and the dear twins and all my friends
Do you know Mrs Allan Im so thankful for friendship
It beautifies life so much
True friendship is a very helpfulul thing indeed said Mrs Allan and we should have a very high ideal of it and never sully it by any failure in truth and sincerity
I fear the name of friendship is often degraded to a kind of intimacy that has nothing of real friendship in it
Yes

like Gertie Pyes and Julia Bells
They are very intimate and go everywhere together but Gertie is always saying nasty things of Julia behind her back and everybody thinks she is jealous of her because she is always so pleased when anybody criticizes Julia
I think it is desecration to call that friendship
If we have friends we should look only for the best in them and give them the best that is in us dont you think
Then friendship would be the most beautiful thing in the world
Friendship IS very beautiful smiled Mrs Allan but some day


Then she paused abruptly
In the delicate whitebrowed face beside her with its candid eyes and mobile features there was still far more of the child than of the woman
Annes heart so far harbored only dreams of friendship and ambition and Mrs Allan did not wish to brush the bloom from her sweet unconsciousness
So she left her sentence for the future years to finish
XVI The Substance of Things Hoped For Anne said Davy appealingly scrambling up on the shiny leathercovered sofa in the Green Gables kitchen where Anne sat reading a letter Anne Im AWFUL hungry
Youve no idea
Ill get you a piece of bread and butter in a minute said Anne absently
Her letter evidently contained some exciting news for her cheeks were as pink as the roses on the big bush outside and her eyes were as starry as only Annes eyes could be
But I aint bread and butter hungry  said Davy in a disgusted tone
Im plum cake hungry
Oh laughed Anne laying down her letter and putting her arm about Davy to give him a squeeze thats a kind of hunger that can be endured very comfortably Davyboy
You know its one of Marillas rules that you cant have anything but bread and butter between meals
Well gimme a piece then

please
Davy had been at last taught to say please but he generally tacked it on as an afterthought
He looked with approval at the generous slice Anne presently brought to him
You always put such a nice lot of butter on it Anne
Marilla spreads it pretty thin
It slips down a lot easier when theres plenty of butter
The slice slipped down with tolerable ease judging from its rapid disappearance
Davy slid head first off the sofa turned a double somersault on the rug and then sat up and announced decidedly Anne Ive made up my mind about heaven
I dont want to go there
Why not
asked Anne gravely
Cause heaven is in Simon Fletchers garret and I dont like Simon Fletcher
Heaven in

Simon Fletchers garret
gasped Anne too amazed even to laugh
Davy Keith whatever put such an extraordinary idea into your head
Milty Boulter says thats where it is
It was last Sunday in Sunday School
The lesson was about Elijah and Elisha and I up and asked Miss Rogerson where heaven was
Miss Rogerson looked awful offended
She was cross anyhow because when shed asked us what Elijah left Elisha when he went to heaven Milty Boulter said His old cloes and us fellows all laughed before we thought
I wish you could think first and do things afterwards cause then you wouldnt do them
But Milty didnt mean to be disrespeckful
He just couldnt think of the name of the thing
Miss Rogerson said heaven was where God was and I wasnt to ask questions like that
Milty nudged me and said in a whisper Heavens in Uncle Simons garret and Ill esplain about it on the road home
So when we was coming home he esplained
Miltys a great hand at esplaining things
Even if he dont know anything about a thing hell make up a lot of stuff and so you get it esplained all the same
His mother is Mrs Simons sister and he went with her to the funeral when his cousin Jane Ellen died
The minister said shed gone to heaven though Milty says she was lying right before them in the coffin
But he sposed they carried the coffin to the garret afterwards
Well when Milty and his mother went upstairs after it was all over to get her bonnet he asked her where heaven was that Jane Ellen had gone to and she pointed right to the ceiling and said Up there
Milty knew there wasnt anything but the garret over the ceiling so thats how HE found out
And hes been awful scared to go to his Uncle Simons ever since
Anne took Davy on her knee and did her best to straighten out this theological tangle also
She was much better fitted for the task than Marilla for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive understanding of the curious ideas that sevenyearolds sometimes get about matters that are of course very plain and simple to grown up people
She had just succeeded in convincing Davy that heaven was NOT in Simon Fletchers garret when Marilla came in from the garden where she and Dora had been picking peas
Dora was an industrious little soul and never happier than when helping in various small tasks suited to her chubby fingers
She fed chickens picked up chips wiped dishes and ran errands galore
She was neat faithful and observant she never had to be told how to do a thing twice and never forgot any of her little duties
Davy on the other hand was rather heedless and forgetful but he had the born knack of winning love and even yet Anne and Marilla liked him the better
While Dora proudly shelled the peas and Davy made boats of the pods with masts of matches and sails of paper Anne told Marilla about the wonderful contents of her letter
Oh Marilla what do you think
Ive had a letter from Priscilla and she says that Mrs Morgan is on the Island and that if it is fine Thursday they are going to drive up to Avonlea and will reach here about twelve
They will spend the afternoon with us and go to the hotel at White Sands in the evening because some of Mrs Morgans American friends are staying there
Oh Marilla isnt it wonderful
I can hardly believe Im not dreaming
I daresay Mrs Morgan is a lot like other people said Marilla drily although she did feel a trifle excited herself
Mrs Morgan was a famous woman and a visit from her was no commonplace occurrence
Theyll be here to dinner then
Yes and oh Marilla may I cook every bit of the dinner myself
I want to feel that I can do something for the author of The Rosebud Garden if it is only to cook a dinner for her
You wont mind will you
Goodness Im not so fond of stewing over a hot fire in July that it would vex me very much to have someone else do it
Youre quite welcome to the job
Oh thank you said Anne as if Marilla had just conferred a tremendous favor Ill make out the menu this very night
Youd better not try to put on too much style warned Marilla a little alarmed by the highflown sound of menu
Youll likely come to grief if you do
Oh Im not going to put on any style if you mean trying to do or have things we dont usually have on festal occasions assured Anne
That would be affectation and although I know I havent as much sense and steadiness as a girl of seventeen and a schoolteacher ought to have Im not so silly AS that
But I want to have everything as nice and dainty as possible
Davyboy dont leave those peapods on the back stairs

someone might slip on them
Ill have a light soup to begin with

you know I can make lovely creamofonion soup

and then a couple of roast fowls
Ill have the two white roosters
I have real affection for those roosters and theyve been pets ever since the gray hen hatched out just the two of them

little balls of yellow down
But I know they would have to be sacrificed sometime and surely there couldnt be a worthier occasion than this
But oh Marilla I cannot kill them

not even for Mrs Morgans sake
Ill have to ask John Henry Carter to come over and do it for me
Ill do it volunteered Davy if Marillall hold them by the legs cause I guess itd take both my hands to manage the axe
Its awful jolly fun to see them hopping about after their heads are cut off
Then Ill have peas and beans and creamed potatoes and a lettuce salad for vegetables resumed Anne and for dessert lemon pie with whipped cream and coffee and cheese and lady fingers
Ill make the pies and lady fingers tomorrow and do up my white muslin dress
And I must tell Diana tonight for shell want to do up hers
Mrs Morgans heroines are nearly always dressed in white muslin and Diana and I have always resolved that that was what we would wear if we ever met her
It will be such a delicate compliment dont you think
Davy dear you mustnt poke peapods into the cracks of the floor
I must ask Mr and Mrs Allan and Miss Stacy to dinner too for theyre all very anxious to meet Mrs Morgan
Its so fortunate shes coming while Miss Stacy is here
Davy dear dont sail the peapods in the water bucket

go out to the trough
Oh I do hope it will be fine Thursday and I think it will for Uncle Abe said last night when he called at Mr Harrisons that it was going to rain most of this week
Thats a good sign agreed Marilla
Anne ran across to Orchard Slope that evening to tell the news to Diana who was also very much excited over it and they discussed the matter in the hammock swung under the big willow in the Barry garden
Oh Anne maynt I help you cook the dinner
implored Diana
You know I can make splendid lettuce salad
Indeed you may said Anne unselfishly
And I shall want you to help me decorate too
I mean to have the parlor simply a BOWER of blossoms

and the dining table is to be adorned with wild roses
Oh I do hope everything will go smoothly
Mrs Morgans heroines NEVER get into scrapes or are taken at a disadvantage and they are always so selfpossessed and such good housekeepers
They seem to be BORN good housekeepers
You remember that Gertrude in Edgewood Days kept house for her father when she was only eight years old
When I was eight years old I hardly knew how to do a thing except bring up children
Mrs Morgan must be an authority on girls when she has written so much about them and I do want her to have a good opinion of us
Ive imagined it all out a dozen different ways

what shell look like and what shell say and what Ill say
And Im so anxious about my nose
There are seven freckles on it as you can see
They came at the AVI S picnic when I went around in the sun without my hat
I suppose its ungrateful of me to worry over them when I should be thankful theyre not spread all over my face as they once were but I do wish they hadnt come

all Mrs Morgans heroines have such perfect complexions
I cant recall a freckled one among them
Yours are not very noticeable comforted Diana
Try a little lemon juice on them tonight
The next day Anne made her pies and lady fingers did up her muslin dress and swept and dusted every room in the house

a quite unnecessary proceeding for Green Gables was as usual in the apple pie order dear to Marillas heart
But Anne felt that a fleck of dust would be a desecration in a house that was to be honored by a visit from Charlotte E Morgan
She even cleaned out the catchall closet under the stairs although there was not the remotest possibility of Mrs Morgans seeing its interior
But I want to FEEL that it is in perfect order even if she isnt to see it Anne told Marilla
You know in her book Golden Keys she makes her two heroines Alice and Louisa take for their motto that verse of Longfellows In the elder days of art Builders wrought with greatest care Each minute and unseen part For the gods see everywhere and so they always kept their cellar stairs scrubbed and never forgot to sweep under the beds
I should have a guilty conscience if I thought this closet was in disorder when Mrs Morgan was in the house
Ever since we read Golden Keys last April Diana and I have taken that verse for our motto too
That night John Henry Carter and Davy between them contrived to execute the two white roosters and Anne dressed them the usually distasteful task glorified in her eyes by the destination of the plump birds
I dont like picking fowls she told Marilla but isnt it fortunate we dont have to put our souls into what our hands may be doing
Ive been picking chickens with my hands but in imagination Ive been roaming the Milky Way
I thought youd scattered more feathers over the floor than usual remarked Marilla
Then Anne put Davy to bed and made him promise that he would behave perfectly the next day
If Im as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just as bad as I like all the next day
asked Davy
I couldnt do that said Anne discreetly but Ill take you and Dora for a row in the flat right to the bottom of the pond and well go ashore on the sandhills and have a picnic
Its a bargain said Davy
Ill be good you bet
I meant to go over to Mr Harrisons and fire peas from my new popgun at Ginger but another dayll do as well
I espect it will be just like Sunday but a picnic at the shorell make up for THAT
XVII A Chapter of Accidents Anne woke three times in the night and made pilgrimages to her window to make sure that Uncle Abes prediction was not coming true
Finally the morning dawned pearly and lustrous in a sky full of silver sheen and radiance and the wonderful day had arrived
Diana appeared soon after breakfast with a basket of flowers over one arm and HER muslin dress over the other

for it would not do to don it until all the dinner preparations were completed
Meanwhile she wore her afternoon pink print and a lawn apron fearfully and wonderfully ruffled and frilled and very neat and pretty and rosy she was
You look simply sweet said Anne admiringly
Diana sighed
But Ive had to let out every one of my dresses AGAIN
I weigh four pounds more than I did in July
Anne WHERE will this end
Mrs Morgans heroines are all tall and slender
Well lets forget our troubles and think of our mercies said Anne gaily
Mrs Allan says that whenever we think of anything that is a trial to us we should also think of something nice that we can set over against it
If you are slightly too plump youve got the dearest dimples and if I have a freckled nose the SHAPE of it is all right
Do you think the lemon juice did any good
Yes I really think it did said Diana critically and much elated Anne led the way to the garden which was full of airy shadows and wavering golden lights
Well decorate the parlor first
We have plenty of time for Priscilla said theyd be here about twelve or half past at the latest so well have dinner at one
There may have been two happier and more excited girls somewhere in Canada or the United States at that moment but I doubt it
Every snip of the scissors as rose and peony and bluebell fell seemed to chirp Mrs Morgan is coming today
Anne wondered how Mr Harrison COULD go on placidly mowing hay in the field across the lane just as if nothing were going to happen
The parlor at Green Gables was a rather severe and gloomy apartment with rigid horsehair furniture stiff lace curtains and white antimacassars that were always laid at a perfectly correct angle except at such times as they clung to unfortunate peoples buttons
Even Anne had never been able to infuse much grace into it for Marilla would not permit any alterations
But it is wonderful what flowers can accomplish if you give them a fair chance when Anne and Diana finished with the room you would not have recognized it
A great blue bowlful of snowballs overflowed on the polished table
The shining black mantelpiece was heaped with roses and ferns
Every shelf of the whatnot held a sheaf of bluebells the dark corners on either side of the grate were lighted up with jars full of glowing crimson peonies and the grate itself was aflame with yellow poppies
All this splendor and color mingled with the sunshine falling through the honeysuckle vines at the windows in a leafy riot of dancing shadows over walls and floor made of the usually dismal little room the veritable bower of Annes imagination and even extorted a tribute of admiration from Marilla who came in to criticize and remained to praise
Now we must set the table said Anne in the tone of a priestess about to perform some sacred rite in honor of a divinity
Well have a big vaseful of wild roses in the center and one single rose in front of everybodys plate  and a special bouquet of rosebuds only by Mrs Morgans  an allusion to The Rosebud Garden you know
The table was set in the sitting room with Marillas finest linen and the best china glass and silver
You may be perfectly certain that every article placed on it was polished or scoured to the highest possible perfection of gloss and glitter
Then the girls tripped out to the kitchen which was filled with appetizing odors emanating from the oven where the chickens were already sizzling splendidly
Anne prepared the potatoes and Diana got the peas and beans ready
Then while Diana shut herself into the pantry to compound the lettuce salad Anne whose cheeks were already beginning to glow crimson as much with excitement as from the heat of the fire prepared the bread sauce for the chickens minced her onions for the soup and finally whipped the cream for her lemon pies
And what about Davy all this time
Was he redeeming his promise to be good
He was indeed
To be sure he insisted on remaining in the kitchen for his curiosity wanted to see all that went on
But as he sat quietly in a corner busily engaged in untying the knots in a piece of herring net he had brought home from his last trip to the shore nobody objected to this
At half past eleven the lettuce salad was made the golden circles of the pies were heaped with whipped cream and everything was sizzling and bubbling that ought to sizzle and bubble
Wed better go and dress now said Anne for they may be here by twelve
We must have dinner at sharp one for the soup must be served as soon as its done
Serious indeed were the toilet rites presently performed in the east gable
Anne peered anxiously at her nose and rejoiced to see that its freckles were not at all prominent thanks either to the lemon juice or to the unusual flush on her cheeks
When they were ready they looked quite as sweet and trim and girlish as ever did any of Mrs Morgans heroines
I do hope Ill be able to say something once in a while and not sit like a mute said Diana anxiously
All Mrs Morgans heroines converse so beautifully
But Im afraid Ill be tonguetied and stupid
And Ill be sure to say I seen
I havent often said it since Miss Stacy taught here but in moments of excitement its sure to pop out
Anne if I were to say I seen before Mrs Morgan Id die of mortification
And it would be almost as bad to have nothing to say
Im nervous about a good many things said Anne but I dont think there is much fear that I wont be able to talk And to do her justice there wasnt
Anne shrouded her muslin glories in a big apron and went down to concoct her soup
Marilla had dressed herself and the twins and looked more excited than she had ever been known to look before
At half past twelve the Allans and Miss Stacy came
Everything was going well but Anne was beginning to feel nervous
It was surely time for Priscilla and Mrs Morgan to arrive
She made frequent trips to the gate and looked as anxiously down the lane as ever her namesake in the Bluebeard story peered from the tower casement
Suppose they dont come at all
she said piteously
Dont suppose it
It would be too mean said Diana who however was beginning to have uncomfortable misgivings on the subject
Anne said Marilla coming out from the parlor Miss Stacy wants to see Miss Barrys willowware platter
Anne hastened to the sitting room closet to get the platter
She had in accordance with her promise to Mrs Lynde written to Miss Barry of Charlottetown asking for the loan of it
Miss Barry was an old friend of Annes and she promply sent the platter out with a letter exhorting Anne to be very careful of it for she had paid twenty dollars for it
The platter had served its purpose at the Aid bazaar and had then been returned to the Green Gables closet for Anne would not trust anybody but herself to take it back to town
She carried the platter carefully to the front door where her guests were enjoying the cool breeze that blew up from the brook
It was examined and admired then just as Anne had taken it back into her own hands a terrific crash and clatter sounded from the kitchen pantry
Marilla Diana and Anne fled out the latter pausing only long enough to set the precious platter hastily down on the second step of the stairs
When they reached the pantry a truly harrowing spectacle met their eyes

a guilty looking small boy scrambling down from the table with his clean print blouse liberally plastered with yellow filling and on the table the shattered remnants of what had been two brave becreamed lemon pies
Davy had finished ravelling out his herring net and had wound the twine into a ball
Then he had gone into the pantry to put it up on the shelf above the table where he already kept a score or so of similar balls which so far as could be discovered served no useful purpose save to yield the joy of possession
Davy had to climb on the table and reach over to the shelf at a dangerous angle

something he had been forbidden by Marilla to do as he had come to grief once before in the experiment
The result in this instance was disastrous
Davy slipped and came sprawling squarely down on the lemon pies
His clean blouse was ruined for that time and the pies for all time
It is however an ill wind that blows nobody good and the pig was eventually the gainer by Davys mischance
Davy Keith said Marilla shaking him by the shoulder didnt I forbid you to climb up on that table again
Didnt I
I forgot whimpered Davy
Youve told me not to do such an awful lot of things that I cant remember them all
Well you march upstairs and stay there till after dinner
Perhaps youll get them sorted out in your memory by that time
No Anne never you mind interceding for him
Im not punishing him because he spoiled your pies

that was an accident
Im punishing him for his disobedience
Go Davy I say
Aint I to have any dinner
wailed Davy
You can come down after dinner is over and have yours in the kitchen
Oh all right said Davy somewhat comforted
I know Annell save some nice bones for me wont you Anne
Cause you know I didnt mean to fall on the pies
Say Anne since they ARE spoiled cant I take some of the pieces upstairs with me
No no lemon pie for you Master Davy said Marilla pushing him toward the hall
What shall we do for dessert
asked Anne looking regretfully at the wreck and ruin
Get out a crock of strawberry preserves said Marilla consolingly
Theres plenty of whipped cream left in the bowl for it
One oclock came

but no Priscilla or Mrs Morgan
Anne was in an agony
Everything was done to a turn and the soup was just what soup should be but couldnt be depended on to remain so for any length of time
I dont believe theyre coming after all said Marilla crossly
Anne and Diana sought comfort in each others eyes
At half past one Marilla again emerged from the parlor
Girls we MUST have dinner
Everybody is hungry and its no use waiting any longer
Priscilla and Mrs Morgan are not coming thats plain and nothing is being improved by waiting
Anne and Diana set about lifting the dinner with all the zest gone out of the performance
I dont believe Ill be able to eat a mouthful said Diana dolefully
Nor I
But I hope everything will be nice for Miss Stacys and Mr and Mrs Allans sakes said Anne listlessly
When Diana dished the peas she tasted them and a very peculiar expression crossed her face
Anne did YOU put sugar in these peas
Yes said Anne mashing the potatoes with the air of one expected to do her duty
I put a spoonful of sugar in
We always do
Dont you like it
But I put a spoonful in too when I set them on the stove said Diana
Anne dropped her masher and tasted the peas also
Then she made a grimace
How awful
I never dreamed you had put sugar in because I knew your mother never does
I happened to think of it for a wonder


Im always forgetting it

so I popped a spoonful in
Its a case of too many cooks I guess said Marilla who had listened to this dialogue with a rather guilty expression
I didnt think youd remember about the sugar Anne for Im perfectly certain you never did before

so I put in a spoonful
The guests in the parlor heard peal after peal of laughter from the kitchen but they never knew what the fun was about
There were no green peas on the dinner table that day however
Well said Anne sobering down again with a sigh of recollection we have the salad anyhow and I dont think anything has happened to the beans
Lets carry the things in and get it over
It cannot be said that that dinner was a notable success socially
The Allans and Miss Stacy exerted themselves to save the situation and Marillas customary placidity was not noticeably ruffled
But Anne and Diana between their disappointment and the reaction from their excitement of the forenoon could neither talk nor eat
Anne tried heroically to bear her part in the conversation for the sake of her guests but all the sparkle had been quenched in her for the time being and in spite of her love for the Allans and Miss Stacy she couldnt help thinking how nice it would be when everybody had gone home and she could bury her weariness and disappointment in the pillows of the east gable
There is an old proverb that really seems at times to be inspired 


it never rains but it pours
The measure of that days tribulations was not yet full
Just as Mr Allan had finished returning thanks there arose a strange ominous sound on the stairs as of some hard heavy object bounding from step to step finishing up with a grand smash at the bottom
Everybody ran out into the hall
Anne gave a shriek of dismay
At the bottom of the stairs lay a big pink conch shell amid the fragments of what had been Miss Barrys platter and at the top of the stairs knelt a terrified Davy gazing down with wideopen eyes at the havoc
Davy said Marilla ominously did you throw that conch down ON PURPOSE
No I never did whimpered Davy
I was just kneeling here quiet as quiet to watch you folks through the bannisters and my foot struck that old thing and pushed it off

and Im awful hungry

and I do wish youd lick a fellow and have done with it instead of always sending him upstairs to miss all the fun
Dont blame Davy said Anne gathering up the fragments with trembling fingers
It was my fault
I set that platter there and forgot all about it
I am properly punished for my carelessness but oh what will Miss Barry say
Well you know she only bought it so it isnt the same as if it was an heirloom said Diana trying to console
The guests went away soon after feeling that it was the most tactful thing to do and Anne and Diana washed the dishes talking less than they had ever been known to do before
Then Diana went home with a headache and Anne went with another to the east gable where she stayed until Marilla came home from the post office at sunset with a letter from Priscilla written the day before
Mrs Morgan had sprained her ankle so severely that she could not leave her room
And oh Anne dear wrote Priscilla Im so sorry but Im afraid we wont get up to Green Gables at all now for by the time Auntys ankle is well she will have to go back to Toronto
She has to be there by a certain date
Well sighed Anne laying the letter down on the red sandstone step of the back porch where she was sitting while the twilight rained down out of a dappled sky I always thought it was too good to be true that Mrs Morgan should really come
But there

that speech sounds as pessimistic as Miss Eliza Andrews and Im ashamed of making it
After all it was NOT too good to be true

things just as good and far better are coming true for me all the time
And I suppose the events of today have a funny side too
Perhaps when Diana and I are old and gray we shall be able to laugh over them
But I feel that I cant expect to do it before then for it has truly been a bitter disappointment
Youll probably have a good many more and worse disappointments than that before you get through life said Marilla who honestly thought she was making a comforting speech
It seems to me Anne that you are never going to outgrow your fashion of setting your heart so on things and then crashing down into despair because you dont get them
I know Im too much inclined that way agreed Anne ruefully
When I think something nice is going to happen I seem to fly right up on the wings of anticipation and then the first thing I realize I drop down to earth with a thud
But really Marilla the flying part IS glorious as long as it lasts

its like soaring through a sunset
I think it almost pays for the thud
Well maybe it does admitted Marilla
Id rather walk calmly along and do without both flying and thud
But everybody has her own way of living

I used to think there was only one right way 

but since Ive had you and the twins to bring up I dont feel so sure of it
What are you going to do about Miss Barrys platter
Pay her back the twenty dollars she paid for it I suppose
Im so thankful it wasnt a cherished heirloom because then no money could replace it
Maybe you could find one like it somewhere and buy it for her
Im afraid not
Platters as old as that are very scarce
Mrs Lynde couldnt find one anywhere for the supper
I only wish I could for of course Miss Barry would just as soon have one platter as another if both were equally old and genuine
Marilla look at that big star over Mr Harrisons maple grove with all that holy hush of silvery sky about it
It gives me a feeling that is like a prayer
After all when one can see stars and skies like that little disappointments and accidents cant matter so much can they
Wheres Davy
said Marilla with an indifferent glance at the star
In bed
Ive promised to take him and Dora to the shore for a picnic tomorrow
Of course the original agreement was that he must be good
But he TRIED to be good

and I hadnt the heart to disappoint him
Youll drown yourself or the twins rowing about the pond in that flat grumbled Marilla
Ive lived here for sixty years and Ive never been on the pond yet
Well its never too late to mend said Anne roguishly
Suppose you come with us tomorrow
Well shut Green Gables up and spend the whole day at the shore daffing the world aside
No thank you said Marilla with indignant emphasis
Id be a nice sight wouldnt I rowing down the pond in a flat
I think I hear Rachel pronouncing on it
Theres Mr Harrison driving away somewhere
Do you suppose there is any truth in the gossip that Mr Harrison is going to see Isabella Andrews
No Im sure there isnt
He just called there one evening on business with Mr Harmon Andrews and Mrs Lynde saw him and said she knew he was courting because he had a white collar on
I dont believe Mr Harrison will ever marry
He seems to have a prejudice against marriage
Well you can never tell about those old bachelors
And if he had a white collar on Id agree with Rachel that it looks suspicious for Im sure he never was seen with one before
I think he only put it on because he wanted to conclude a business deal with Harmon Andrews said Anne
Ive heard him say thats the only time a man needs to be particular about his appearance because if he looks prosperous the party of the second part wont be so likely to try to cheat him
I really feel sorry for Mr Harrison I dont believe he feels satisfied with his life
It must be very lonely to have no one to care about except a parrot dont you think
But I notice Mr Harrison doesnt like to be pitied
Nobody does I imagine
Theres Gilbert coming up the lane said Marilla
If he wants you to go for a row on the pond mind you put on your coat and rubbers
Theres a heavy dew tonight
XVIII An Adventure on the Tory Road Anne said Davy sitting up in bed and propping his chin on his hands Anne where is sleep
People go to sleep every night and of course I know its the place where I do the things I dream but I want to know WHERE it is and how I get there and back without knowing anything about it

and in my nighty too
Where is it
Anne was kneeling at the west gable window watching the sunset sky that was like a great flower with petals of crocus and a heart of fiery yellow
She turned her head at Davys question and answered dreamily Over the mountains of the moon Down the valley of the shadow
Paul Irving would have known the meaning of this or made a meaning out of it for himself if he didnt but practical Davy who as Anne often despairingly remarked hadnt a particle of imagination was only puzzled and disgusted
Anne I believe youre just talking nonsense
Of course I was dear boy
Dont you know that it is only very foolish folk who talk sense all the time
Well I think you might give a sensible answer when I ask a sensible question said Davy in an injured tone
Oh you are too little to understand said Anne
But she felt rather ashamed of saying it for had she not in keen remembrance of many similar snubs administered in her own early years solemnly vowed that she would never tell any child it was too little to understand
Yet here she was doing it

so wide sometimes is the gulf between theory and practice
Well Im doing my best to grow said Davy but its a thing you cant hurry much
If Marilla wasnt so stingy with her jam I believe Id grow a lot faster
Marilla is not stingy Davy said Anne severely
It is very ungrateful of you to say such a thing
Theres another word that means the same thing and sounds a lot better but I dont just remember it said Davy frowning intently
I heard Marilla say she was it herself the other day
If you mean ECONOMICAL its a VERY different thing from being stingy
It is an excellent trait in a person if she is economical
If Marilla had been stingy she wouldnt have taken you and Dora when your mother died
Would you have liked to live with Mrs
Wiggins
You just bet I wouldnt
Davy was emphatic on that point
Nor I dont want to go out to Uncle Richard neither
Id far rather live here even if Marilla is that longtailed word when it comes to jam cause YOURE here Anne
Say Anne wont you tell me a story fore I go to sleep
I dont want a fairy story
Theyre all right for girls I spose but I want something exciting

lots of killing and shooting in it and a house on fire and intrusting things like that
Fortunately for Anne Marilla called out at this moment from her room
Anne Dianas signaling at a great rate
Youd better see what she wants
Anne ran to the east gable and saw flashes of light coming through the twilight from Dianas window in groups of five which meant according to their old childish code Come over at once for I have something important to reveal
Anne threw her white shawl over her head and hastened through the Haunted Wood and across Mr Bells pasture corner to Orchard Slope
Ive good news for you Anne said Diana
Mother and I have just got home from Carmody and I saw Mary Sentner from Spencer vale in Mr Blairs store
She says the old Copp girls on the Tory Road have a willowware platter and she thinks its exactly like the one we had at the supper
She says theyll likely sell it for Martha Copp has never been known to keep anything she COULD sell but if they wont theres a platter at Wesley Keysons at Spencervale and she knows theyd sell it but she isnt sure its just the same kind as Aunt Josephines
Ill go right over to Spencervale after it tomorrow said Anne resolutely and you must come with me
It will be such a weight off my mind for I have to go to town day after tomorrow and how can I face your Aunt Josephine without a willowware platter
It would be even worse than the time I had to confess about jumping on the spare room bed
Both girls laughed over the old memory

concerning which if any of my readers are ignorant and curious I must refer them to Annes earlier history
The next afternoon the girls fared forth on their platter hunting expedition
It was ten miles to Spencervale and the day was not especially pleasant for traveling
It was very warm and windless and the dust on the road was such as might have been expected after six weeks of dry weather
Oh I do wish it would rain soon sighed Anne
Everything is so parched up
The poor fields just seem pitiful to me and the trees seem to be stretching out their hands pleading for rain
As for my garden it hurts me every time I go into it
I suppose I shouldnt complain about a garden when the farmers crops are suffering so
Mr Harrison says his pastures are so scorched up that his poor cows can hardly get a bite to eat and he feels guilty of cruelty to animals every time he meets their eyes
After a wearisome drive the girls reached Spencervale and turned down the Tory Road

a green solitary highway where the strips of grass between the wheel tracks bore evidence to lack of travel
Along most of its extent it was lined with thickset young spruces crowding down to the roadway with here and there a break where the back field of a Spencervale farm came out to the fence or an expanse of stumps was aflame with fireweed and goldenrod
Why is it called the Tory Road
asked Anne
Mr Allan says it is on the principle of calling a place a grove because there are no trees in it said Diana for nobody lives along the road except the Copp girls and old Martin Bovyer at the further end who is a Liberal
The Tory government ran the road through when they were in power just to show they were doing something
Dianas father was a Liberal for which reason she and Anne never discussed politics
Green Gables folk had always been Conservatives
Finally the girls came to the old Copp homestead

a place of such exceeding external neatness that even Green Gables would have suffered by contrast
The house was a very oldfashioned one situated on a slope which fact had necessitated the building of a stone basement under one end
The house and outbuildings were all whitewashed to a condition of blinding perfection and not a weed was visible in the prim kitchen garden surrounded by its white paling
The shades are all down said Diana ruefully
I believe that nobody is home
This proved to be the case
The girls looked at each other in perplexity
I dont know what to do said Anne
If I were sure the platter was the right kind I would not mind waiting until they came home
But if it isnt it may be too late to go to Wesley Keysons afterward
Diana looked at a certain little square window over the basement
That is the pantry window I feel sure she said because this house is just like Uncle Charles at Newbridge and that is their pantry window
The shade isnt down so if we climbed up on the roof of that little house we could look into the pantry and might be able to see the platter
Do you think it would be any harm
No I dont think so decided Anne after due reflection since our motive is not idle curiosity
This important point of ethics being settled Anne prepared to mount the aforesaid little house a construction of lathes with a peaked roof which had in times past served as a habitation for ducks
The Copp girls had given up keeping ducks


because they were such untidy birds


and the house had not been in use for some years save as an abode of correction for setting hens
Although scrupulously whitewashed it had become somewhat shaky and Anne felt rather dubious as she scrambled up from the vantage point of a keg placed on a box
Im afraid it wont bear my weight she said as she gingerly stepped on the roof
Lean on the window sill advised Diana and Anne accordingly leaned
Much to her delight she saw as she peered through the pane a willowware platter exactly such as she was in quest of on the shelf in front of the window
So much she saw before the catastrophe came
In her joy Anne forgot the precarious nature of her footing incautiously ceased to lean on the window sill gave an impulsive little hop of pleasure

and the next moment she had crashed through the roof up to her armpits and there she hung quite unable to extricate herself
Diana dashed into the duck house and seizing her unfortunate friend by the waist tried to draw her down
Ow

dont shrieked poor Anne
There are some long splinters sticking into me
See if you can put something under my feet

then perhaps I can draw myself up
Diana hastily dragged in the previously mentioned keg and Anne found that it was just sufficiently high to furnish a secure resting place for her feet
But she could not release herself
Could I pull you out if I crawled up
suggested Diana
Anne shook her head hopelessly
No

the splinters hurt too badly
If you can find an axe you might chop me out though
Oh dear I do really begin to believe that I was born under an illomened star
Diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found
Ill have to go for help she said returning to the prisoner
No indeed you wont said Anne vehemently
If you do the story of this will get out everywhere and I shall be ashamed to show my face
No we must just wait until the Copp girls come home and bind them to secrecy
Theyll know where the axe is and get me out
Im not uncomfortable as long as I keep perfectly still


not uncomfortable in BODY I mean
I wonder what the Copp girls value this house at
I shall have to pay for the damage Ive done but I wouldnt mind that if I were only sure they would understand my motive in peeping in at their pantry window
My sole comfort is that the platter is just the kind I want and if Miss Copp will only sell it to me I shall be resigned to what has happened
What if the Copp girls dont come home until after night

or till tomorrow
suggested Diana
If theyre not back by sunset youll have to go for other assistance I suppose said Anne reluctantly but you mustnt go until you really have to
Oh dear this is a dreadful predicament
I wouldnt mind my misfortunes so much if they were romantic as Mrs Morgans heroines always are but they are always just simply ridiculous
Fancy what the Copp girls will think when they drive into their yard and see a girls head and shoulders sticking out of the roof of one of their outhouses
Listen

is that a wagon
No Diana I believe it is thunder
Thunder it was undoubtedly and Diana having made a hasty pilgrimage around the house returned to announce that a very black cloud was rising rapidly in the northwest
I believe were going to have a heavy thundershower she exclaimed in dismay Oh Anne what will we do
We must prepare for it said Anne tranquilly
A thunderstorm seemed a trifle in comparison with what had already happened
Youd better drive the horse and buggy into that open shed
Fortunately my parasol is in the buggy
Here

take my hat with you
Marilla told me I was a goose to put on my best hat to come to the Tory Road and she was right as she always is
Diana untied the pony and drove into the shed just as the first heavy drops of rain fell
There she sat and watched the resulting downpour which was so thick and heavy that she could hardly see Anne through it holding the parasol bravely over her bare head
There was not a great deal of thunder but for the best part of an hour the rain came merrily down
Occasionally Anne slanted back her parasol and waved an encouraging hand to her friend But conversation at that distance was quite out of the question
Finally the rain ceased the sun came out and Diana ventured across the puddles of the yard
Did you get very wet
she asked anxiously
Oh no returned Anne cheerfully
My head and shoulders are quite dry and my skirt is only a little damp where the rain beat through the lathes
Dont pity me Diana for I havent minded it at all
I kept thinking how much good the rain will do and how glad my garden must be for it and imagining what the flowers and buds would think when the drops began to fall
I imagined out a most interesting dialogue between the asters and the sweet peas and the wild canaries in the lilac bush and the guardian spirit of the garden
When I go home I mean to write it down
I wish I had a pencil and paper to do it now because I daresay Ill forget the best parts before I reach home
Diana the faithful had a pencil and discovered a sheet of wrapping paper in the box of the buggy
Anne folded up her dripping parasol put on her hat spread the wrapping paper on a shingle Diana handed up and wrote out her garden idyl under conditions that could hardly be considered as favorable to literature
Nevertheless the result was quite pretty and Diana was enraptured when Anne read it to her
Oh Anne its sweet

just sweet
DO send it to the Canadian Woman
Anne shook her head
Oh no it wouldnt be suitable at all
There is no PLOT in it you see
Its just a string of fancies
I like writing such things but of course nothing of the sort would ever do for publication for editors insist on plots so Priscilla says
Oh theres Miss Sarah Copp now
PLEASE Diana go and explain
Miss Sarah Copp was a small person garbed in shabby black with a hat chosen less for vain adornment than for qualities that would wear well
She looked as amazed as might be expected on seeing the curious tableau in her yard but when she heard Dianas explanation she was all sympathy
She hurriedly unlocked the back door produced the axe and with a few skillfull blows set Anne free
The latter somewhat tired and stiff ducked down into the interior of her prison and thankfully emerged into liberty once more
Miss Copp she said earnestly
I assure you I looked into your pantry window only to discover if you had a willowware platter
I didnt see anything else  I didnt LOOK for anything else
Bless you thats all right said Miss Sarah amiably
You neednt worry  theres no harm done
Thank goodness we Copps keep our pantries presentable at all times and dont care who sees into them
As for that old duckhouse Im glad its smashed for maybe now Martha will agree to having it taken down
She never would before for fear it might come in handy sometime and Ive had to whitewash it every spring
But you might as well argue with a post as with Martha
She went to town today  I drove her to the station
And you want to buy my platter
Well what will you give for it
Twenty dollars said Anne who was never meant to match business wits with a Copp or she would not have offered her price at the start
Well Ill see said Miss Sarah cautiously
That platter is mine fortunately or Id never dare to sell it when Martha wasnt here
As it is I daresay shell raise a fuss
Marthas the boss of this establishment I can tell you
Im getting awful tired of living under another womans thumb
But come in come in
You must be real tired and hungry
Ill do the best I can for you in the way of tea but I warn you not to expect anything but bread and butter and some cowcumbers
Martha locked up all the cake and cheese and preserves afore she went
She always does because she says Im too extravagant with them if company comes
The girls were hungry enough to do justice to any fare and they enjoyed Miss Sarahs excellent bread and butter and cowcumbers thoroughly
When the meal was over Miss Sarah said I dont know as I mind selling the platter
But its worth twentyfive dollars
Its a very old platter
Diana gave Annes foot a gentle kick under the table meaning Dont agree  shell let it go for twenty if you hold out
But Anne was not minded to take any chances in regard to that precious platter
She promptly agreed to give twentyfive and Miss Sarah looked as if she felt sorry she hadnt asked for thirty
Well I guess you may have it
I want all the money I can scare up just now
The fact is   Miss Sarah threw up her head importantly with a proud flush on her thin cheeks  Im going to be married  to Luther Wallace
He wanted me twenty years ago
I liked him real well but he was poor then and father packed him off
I spose I shouldnt have let him go so meek but I was timid and frightened of father
Besides I didnt know men were so skurse
When the girls were safely away Diana driving and Anne holding the coveted platter carefully on her lap the green rainfreshened solitudes of the Tory Road were enlivened by ripples of girlish laughter
Ill amuse your Aunt Josephine with the strange eventful history of this afternoon when I go to town tomorrow
Weve had a rather trying time but its over now
Ive got the platter and that rain has laid the dust beautifully
So alls well that ends well
Were not home yet said Diana rather pessimistically and theres no telling what may happen before we are
Youre such a girl to have adventures Anne
Having adventures comes natural to some people said Anne serenely
You just have a gift for them or you havent
XIX Just a Happy Day After all Anne had said to Marilla once I believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything very splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string
Life at Green Gables was full of just such days for Annes adventures and misadventures like those of other people did not all happen at once but were sprinkled over the year with long stretches of harmless happy days between filled with work and dreams and laughter and lessons
Such a day came late in August
In the forenoon Anne and Diana rowed the delighted twins down the pond to the sandshore to pick sweet grass and paddle in the surf over which the wind was harping an old lyric learned when the world was young
In the afternoon Anne walked down to the old Irving place to see Paul
She found him stretched out on the grassy bank beside the thick fir grove that sheltered the house on the north absorbed in a book of fairy tales
He sprang up radiantly at sight of her
Oh Im so glad youve come teacher he said eagerly because Grandmas away
Youll stay and have tea with me wont you
Its so lonesome to have tea all by oneself
YOU know teacher
Ive had serious thoughts of asking Young Mary Joe to sit down and eat her tea with me but I expect Grandma wouldnt approve
She says the French have to be kept in their place
And anyhow its difficult to talk with Young Mary Joe
She just laughs and says Well yous do beat all de kids I ever knowed
That isnt my idea of conversation
Of course Ill stay to tea said Anne gaily
I was dying to be asked
My mouth has been watering for some more of your grandmas delicious shortbread ever since I had tea here before
Paul looked very sober
If it depended on me teacher he said standing before Anne with his hands in his pockets and his beautiful little face shadowed with sudden care You should have shortbread with a right good will
But it depends on Mary Joe
I heard Grandma tell her before she left that she wasnt to give me any shortcake because it was too rich for little boys stomachs
But maybe Mary Joe will cut some for you if I promise I wont eat any
Let us hope for the best
Yes let us agreed Anne whom this cheerful philosophy suited exactly and if Mary Joe proves hardhearted and wont give me any shortbread it doesnt matter in the least so you are not to worry over that
Youre sure you wont mind if she doesnt
said Paul anxiously
Perfectly sure dear heart
Then I wont worry said Paul with a long breath of relief especially as I really think Mary Joe will listen to reason
Shes not a naturally unreasonable person but she has learned by experience that it doesnt do to disobey Grandmas orders
Grandma is an excellent woman but people must do as she tells them
She was very much pleased with me this morning because I managed at last to eat all my plateful of porridge
It was a great effort but I succeeded
Grandma says she thinks shell make a man of me yet
But teacher I want to ask you a very important question
You will answer it truthfully wont you
Ill try promised Anne
Do you think Im wrong in my upper story
asked Paul as if his very existence depended on her reply
Goodness no Paul exclaimed Anne in amazement
Certainly youre not
What put such an idea into your head
Mary Joe

but she didnt know I heard her
Mrs Peter Sloanes hired girl Veronica came to see Mary Joe last evening and I heard them talking in the kitchen as I was going through the hall
I heard Mary Joe say Dat Paul he is de queeres leetle boy
He talks dat queer
I tink deres someting wrong in his upper story
I couldnt sleep last night for ever so long thinking of it and wondering if Mary Joe was right
I couldnt bear to ask Grandma about it somehow but I made up my mind Id ask you
Im so glad you think Im all right in my upper story
Of course you are
Mary Joe is a silly ignorant girl and you are never to worry about anything she says said Anne indignantly secretly resolving to give Mrs Irving a discreet hint as to the advisability of restraining Mary Joes tongue
Well thats a weight off my mind said Paul
Im perfectly happy now teacher thanks to you
It wouldnt be nice to have something wrong in your upper story would it teacher
I suppose the reason Mary Joe imagines I have is because I tell her what I think about things sometimes
It is a rather dangerous practice admitted Anne out of the depths of her own experience
Well by and by Ill tell you the thoughts I told Mary Joe and you can see for yourself if theres anything queer in them said Paul but Ill wait till it begins to get dark
That is the time I ache to tell people things and when nobody else is handy I just HAVE to tell Mary Joe
But after this I wont if it makes her imagine Im wrong in my upper story
Ill just ache and bear it
And if the ache gets too bad you can come up to Green Gables and tell me your thoughts suggested Anne with all the gravity that endeared her to children who so dearly love to be taken seriously
Yes I will
But I hope Davy wont be there when I go because he makes faces at me
I dont mind VERY much because he is such a little boy and I am quite a big one but still it is not pleasant to have faces made at you
And Davy makes such terrible ones
Sometimes I am frightened he will never get his face straightened out again
He makes them at me in church when I ought to be thinking of sacred things
Dora likes me though and I like her but not so well as I did before she told Minnie May Barry that she meant to marry me when I grew up
I may marry somebody when I grow up but Im far too young to be thinking of it yet dont you think teacher
Rather young agreed teacher
Speaking of marrying reminds me of another thing that has been troubling me of late continued Paul
Mrs Lynde was down here one day last week having tea with Grandma and Grandma made me show her my little mothers picture

the one father sent me for my birthday present
I didnt exactly want to show it to Mrs Lynde
Mrs Lynde is a good kind woman but she isnt the sort of person you want to show your mothers picture to
YOU know teacher
But of course I obeyed Grandma
Mrs Lynde said she was very pretty ut kind of actressy looking and must have been an awful lot younger than father
Then she said Some of these days your pa will be marrying again likely
How will you like to have a new ma Master Paul 
Well the idea almost took my breath away teacher but I wasnt going to let Mrs Lynde see THAT
I just looked her straight in the face

like this

and I said Mrs Lynde father made a pretty good job of picking out my first mother and I could trust him to pick out just as good a one the second time
And I CAN trust him teacher
But still I hope if he ever does give me a new mother hell ask my opinion about her before its too late
Theres Mary Joe coming to call us to tea
Ill go and consult with her about the shortbread
As a result of the consultation Mary Joe cut the shortbread and added a dish of preserves to the bill of fare
Anne poured the tea and she and Paul had a very merry meal in the dim old sitting room whose windows were open to the gulf breezes and they talked so much nonsense that Mary Joe was quite scandalized and told Veronica the next evening that de school mees was as queer as Paul
After tea Paul took Anne up to his room to show her his mothers picture which had been the mysterious birthday present kept by Mrs Irving in the bookcase
Pauls little lowceilinged room was a soft whirl of ruddy light from the sun that was setting over the sea and swinging shadows from the fir trees that grew close to the square deepset window
From out this soft glow and glamor shone a sweet girlish face with tender mother eyes that was hanging on the wall at the foot of the bed
Thats my little mother said Paul with loving pride
I got Grandma to hang it there where Id see it as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning
I never mind not having the light when I go to bed now because it just seems as if my little mother was right here with me
Father knew just what I would like for a birthday present although he never asked me
Isnt it wonderful how much fathers DO know
Your mother was very lovely Paul and you look a little like her
But her eyes and hair are darker than yours
My eyes are the same color as fathers said Paul flying about the room to heap all available cushions on the window seat but fathers hair is gray
He has lots of it but it is gray
You see father is nearly fifty
Thats ripe old age isnt it
But its only OUTSIDE hes old
INSIDE hes just as young as anybody
Now teacher please sit here and Ill sit at your feet
May I lay my head against your knee
Thats the way my little mother and I used to sit
Oh this is real splendid I think
Now I want to hear those thoughts which Mary Joe pronounces so queer said Anne patting the mop of curls at her side
Paul never needed any coaxing to tell his thoughts

at least to congenial souls
I thought them out in the fir grove one night he said dreamily
Of course I didnt BELIEVE them but I THOUGHT them
YOU know teacher
And then I wanted to tell them to somebody and there was nobody but Mary Joe
Mary Joe was in the pantry setting bread and I sat down on the bench beside her and I said Mary Joe do you know what I think
I think the evening star is a lighthouse on the land where the fairies dwell
And Mary Joe said Well yous are de queer one
Dare aint no such ting as fairies
I was very much provoked
Of course I knew there are no fairies but that neednt prevent my thinking there is
You know teacher
But I tried again quite patiently
I said Well then Mary Joe do you know what I think
I think an angel walks over the world after the sun sets

a great tall white angel with silvery folded wings


and sings the flowers and birds to sleep
Children can hear him if they know how to listen
Then Mary Joe held up her hands all over flour and said Well yous are de queer leetle boy
Yous make me feel scare
And she really did looked scared
I went out then and whispered the rest of my thoughts to the garden
There was a little birch tree in the garden and it died
Grandma says the salt spray killed it but I think the dryad belonging to it was a foolish dryad who wandered away to see the world and got lost
And the little tree was so lonely it died of a broken heart
And when the poor foolish little dryad gets tired of the world and comes back to her tree HER heart will break said Anne
Yes but if dryads are foolish they must take the consequences just as if they were real people said Paul gravely
Do you know what I think about the new moon teacher
I think it is a little golden boat full of dreams
And when it tips on a cloud some of them spill out and fall into your sleep
Exactly teacher
Oh you DO know
And I think the violets are little snips of the sky that fell down when the angels cut out holes for the stars to shine through
And the buttercups are made out of old sunshine and I think the sweet peas will be butterflies when they go to heaven
Now teacher do you see anything so very queer about those thoughts
No laddie dear they are not queer at all they are strange and beautiful thoughts for a little boy to think and so people who couldnt think anything of the sort themselves if they tried for a hundred years think them queer
But keep on thinking them Paul 

some day you are going to be a poet I believe
When Anne reached home she found a very different type of boyhood waiting to be put to bed
Davy was sulky and when Anne had undressed him he bounced into bed and buried his face in the pillow
Davy you have forgotten to say your prayers said Anne rebukingly
No I didnt forget said Davy defiantly but I aint going to say my prayers any more
Im going to give up trying to be good cause no matter how good I am youd like Paul Irving better
So I might as well be bad and have the fun of it
I dont like Paul Irving BETTER said Anne seriously
I like you just as well only in a different way
But I want you to like me the same way pouted Davy
You cant like different people the same way
You dont like Dora and me the same way do you
Davy sat up and reflected
No

o

o he admitted at last I like Dora because shes my sister but I like you because youre YOU
And I like Paul because he is Paul and Davy because he is Davy said Anne gaily
Well I kind of wish Id said my prayers then said Davy convinced by this logic
But its too much bother getting out now to say them
Ill say them twice over in the morning Anne
Wont that do as well
No Anne was positive it would not do as well
So Davy scrambled out and knelt down at her knee
When he had finished his devotions he leaned back on his little bare brown heels and looked up at her
Anne Im gooder than I used to be
Yes indeed you are Davy said Anne who never hesitated to give credit where credit was due
I KNOW Im gooder said Davy confidently and Ill tell you how I know it
Today Marilla give me two pieces of bread and jam one for me and one for Dora
One was a good deal bigger than the other and Marilla didnt say which was mine
But I give the biggest piece to Dora
That was good of me wasnt it
Very good and very manly Davy
Of course admitted Davy Dora wasnt very hungry and she only et half her slice and then she give the rest to me
But I didnt know she was going to do that when I give it to her so I WAS good Anne
In the twilight Anne sauntered down to the Dryads Bubble and saw Gilbert Blythe coming down through the dusky Haunted Wood
She had a sudden realization that Gilbert was a schoolboy no longer
And how manly he looked  the tall frankfaced fellow with the clear straightforward eyes and the broad shoulders
Anne thought Gilbert was a very handsome lad even though he didnt look at all like her ideal man
She and Diana had long ago decided what kind of a man they admired and their tastes seemed exactly similar
He must be very tall and distinguished looking with melancholy inscrutable eyes and a melting sympathetic voice
There was nothing either melancholy or inscrutable in Gilberts physiognomy but of course that didnt matter in friendship
Gilbert stretched himself out on the ferns beside the Bubble and looked approvingly at Anne
If Gilbert had been asked to describe his ideal woman the description would have answered point for point to Anne even to those seven tiny freckles whose obnoxious presence still continued to vex her soul
Gilbert was as yet little more than a boy but a boy has his dreams as have others and in Gilberts future there was always a girl with big limpid gray eyes and a face as fine and delicate as a flower
He had made up his mind also that his future must be worthy of its goddess
Even in quiet Avonlea there were temptations to be met and faced
White Sands youth were a rather fast set and Gilbert was popular wherever he went
But he meant to keep himself worthy of Annes friendship and perhaps some distant day her love and he watched over word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to pass in judgment on it
She held over him the unconscious influence that every girl whose ideals are high and pure wields over her friends an influence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals and which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them
In Gilberts eyes Annes greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped to the petty practices of so many of the Avonlea girls  the small jealousies the little deceits and rivalries the palpable bids for favor
Anne held herself apart from all this not consciously or of design but simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign to her transparent impulsive nature crystal clear in its motives and aspirations
But Gilbert did not attempt to put his thoughts into words for he had already too good reason to know that Anne would mercilessly and frostily nip all attempts at sentiment in the bud  or laugh at him which was ten times worse
You look like a real dryad under that birch tree he said teasingly
I love birch trees said Anne laying her cheek against the creamy satin of the slim bole with one of the pretty caressing gestures that came so natural to her
Then youll be glad to hear that Mr Major Spencer has decided to set out a row of white birches all along the road front of his farm by way of encouraging the AVIS said Gilbert
He was talking to me about it today
Major Spencer is the most progressive and publicspirited man in Avonlea
And Mr William Bell is going to set out a spruce hedge along his road front and up his lane
Our Society is getting on splendidly Anne
It is past the experimental stage and is an accepted fact
The older folks are beginning to take an interest in it and the White Sands people are talking of starting one too
Even Elisha Wright has come around since that day the Americans from the hotel had the picnic at the shore
They praised our roadsides so highly and said they were so much prettier than in any other part of the Island
And when in due time the other farmers follow Mr Spencers good example and plant ornamental trees and hedges along their road fronts Avonlea will be the prettiest settlement in the province
The Aids are talking of taking up the graveyard said Anne and I hope they will because there will have to be a subscription for that and it would be no use for the Society to try it after the hall affair
But the Aids would never have stirred in the matter if the Society hadnt put it into their thoughts unofficially
Those trees we planted on the church grounds are flourishing and the trustees have promised me that they will fence in the school grounds next year
If they do Ill have an arbor day and every scholar shall plant a tree and well have a garden in the corner by the road
Weve succeeded in almost all our plans so far except in getting the old Boulter house removed said Gilbert and Ive given THAT up in despair
Levi wont have it taken down just to vex us
Theres a contrary streak in all the Boulters and its strongly developed in him
Julia Bell wants to send another committee to him but I think the better way will just be to leave him severely alone said Anne sagely
And trust to Providence as Mrs Lynde says smiled Gilbert
Certainly no more committees
They only aggravate him
Julia Bell thinks you can do anything if you only have a committee to attempt it
Next spring Anne we must start an agitation for nice lawns and grounds
Well sow good seed betimes this winter
Ive a treatise here on lawns and lawnmaking and Im going to prepare a paper on the subject soon
Well I suppose our vacation is almost over
School opens Monday
Has Ruby Gillis got the Carmody school
Yes Priscilla wrote that she had taken her own home school so the Carmody trustees gave it to Ruby
Im sorry Priscilla is not coming back but since she cant Im glad Ruby has got the school
She will be home for Saturdays and it will seem like old times to have her and Jane and Diana and myself all together again
Marilla just home from Mrs Lyndes was sitting on the back porch step when Anne returned to the house
Rachel and I have decided to have our cruise to town tomorrow she said
Mr Lynde is feeling better this week and Rachel wants to go before he has another sick spell
I intend to get up extra early tomorrow morning for Ive ever so much to do said Anne virtuously
For one thing Im going to shift the feathers from my old bedtick to the new one
I ought to have done it long ago but Ive just kept putting it off


its such a detestable task
Its a very bad habit to put off disagreeable things and I never mean to again or else I cant comfortably tell my pupils not to do it
That would be inconsistent
Then I want to make a cake for Mr Harrison and finish my paper on gardens for the AVIS and write Stella and wash and starch my muslin dress and make Doras new apron
You wont get half done said Marilla pessimistically
I never yet planned to do a lot of things but something happened to prevent me
XX The Way It Often Happens Anne rose betimes the next morning and blithely greeted the fresh day when the banners of the sunrise were shaken triumphantly across the pearly skies
Green Gables lay in a pool of sunshine flecked with the dancing shadows of poplar and willow
Beyond the land was Mr Harrisons wheatfield a great windrippled expanse of pale gold
The world was so beautiful that Anne spent ten blissful minutes hanging idly over the garden gate drinking the loveliness in
After breakfast Marilla made ready for her journey
Dora was to go with her having been long promised this treat
Now Davy you try to be a good boy and dont bother Anne she straitly charged him
If you are good Ill bring you a striped candy cane from town
For alas Marilla had stooped to the evil habit of bribing people to be good
I wont be bad on purpose but sposen Im bad zacksidentally
Davy wanted to know
Youll have to guard against accidents admonished Marilla
Anne if Mr Shearer comes today get a nice roast and some steak
If he doesnt youll have to kill a fowl for dinner tomorrow
Anne nodded
Im not going to bother cooking any dinner for just Davy and myself today she said
That cold ham bone will do for noon lunch and Ill have some steak fried for you when you come home at night
Im going to help Mr Harrison haul dulse this morning announced Davy
He asked me to and I guess hell ask me to dinner too
Mr Harrison is an awful kind man
Hes a real sociable man
I hope Ill be like him when I grow up
I mean BEHAVE like him

I dont want to LOOK like him
But I guess theres no danger for Mrs Lynde says Im a very handsome child
Do you spose itll last Anne
I want to know I daresay it will said Anne gravely
You ARE a handsome boy Davy 

Marilla looked volumes of disapproval


but you must live up to it and be just as nice and gentlemanly as you look to be
And you told Minnie May Barry the other day when you found her crying cause some one said she was ugly that if she was nice and kind and loving people wouldnt mind her looks said Davy discontentedly
Seems to me you cant get out of being good in this world for some reason or nother
You just HAVE to behave
Dont you want to be good
asked Marilla who had learned a great deal but had not yet learned the futility of asking such questions
Yes I want to be good but not TOO good said Davy cautiously
You dont have to be very good to be a Sunday School superintendent
Mr Bells that and hes a real bad man
Indeed hes not said Marila indignantly
He is

he says he is himself asseverated Davy
He said it when he prayed in Sunday School last Sunday
He said he was a vile worm and a miserable sinner and guilty of the blackest niquity
What did he do that was so bad Marilla
Did he kill anybody
Or steal the collection cents
I want to know
Fortunately Mrs Lynde came driving up the lane at this moment and Marilla made off feeling that she had escaped from the snare of the fowler and wishing devoutly that Mr Bell were not quite so highly figurative in his public petitions especially in the hearing of small boys who were always wanting to know
Anne left alone in her glory worked with a will
The floor was swept the beds made the hens fed the muslin dress washed and hung out on the line
Then Anne prepared for the transfer of feathers
She mounted to the garret and donned the first old dress that came to hand

a navy blue cashmere she had worn at fourteen
It was decidedly on the short side and as skimpy as the notable wincey Anne had worn upon the occasion of her debut at Green Gables but at least it would not be materially injured by down and feathers
Anne completed her toilet by tying a big red and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to Matthew over her head and thus accoutred betook herself to the kitchen chamber whither Marilla before her departure had helped her carry the feather bed
A cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky moment Anne looked into it
There were those seven freckles on her nose more rampant than ever or so it seemed in the glare of light from the unshaded window
Oh I forgot to rub that lotion on last night she thought
Id better run down to the pantry and do it now
Anne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles
On one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the freckles remained
A few days previously she had found a recipe for a freckle lotion in a magazine and as the ingredients were within her reach she straightway compounded it much to the disgust of Marilla who thought that if Providence had placed freckles on your nose it was your bounden duty to leave them there
Anne scurried down to the pantry which always dim from the big willow growing close to the window was now almost dark by reason of the shade drawn to exclude flies
Anne caught the bottle containing the lotion from the shelf and copiously anointed her nose therewith by means of a little sponge sacred to the purpose
This important duty done she returned to her work
Any one who has ever shifted feathers from one tick to another will not need to be told that when Anne finished she was a sight to behold
Her dress was white with down and fluff and her front hair escaping from under the handkerchief was adorned with a veritable halo of feathers
At this auspicious moment a knock sounded at the kitchen door
That must be Mr Shearer thought Anne
Im in a dreadful mess but Ill have to run down as I am for hes always in a hurry
Down flew Anne to the kitchen door
If ever a charitable floor did open to swallow up a miserable befeathered damsel the Green Gables porch floor should promptly have engulfed Anne at that moment
On the doorstep were standing Priscilla Grant golden and fair in silk attire a short stout grayhaired lady in a tweed suit and another lady tall stately wonderfully gowned with a beautiful highbred face and large blacklashed violet eyes whom Anne instinctively felt as she would have said in her earlier days to be Mrs Charlotte E Morgan
In the dismay of the moment one thought stood out from the confusion of Annes mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial straw
All Mrs Morgans heroines were noted for rising to the occasion
No matter what their troubles were they invariably rose to the occasion and showed their superiority over all ills of time space and quantity
Anne therefore felt it was HER duty to rise to the occasion and she did it so perfectly that Priscilla afterward declared she never admired Anne Shirley more than at that moment
No matter what her outraged feelings were she did not show them
She greeted Priscilla and was introduced to her companions as calmly and composedly as if she had been arrayed in purple and fine linen
To be sure it was somewhat of a shock to find that the lady she had instinctively felt to be Mrs Morgan was not Mrs Morgan at all but an unknown Mrs Pendexter while the stout little grayhaired woman was Mrs Morgan but in the greater shock the lesser lost its power
Anne ushered her guests to the spare room and thence into the parlor where she left them while she hastened out to help Priscilla unharness her horse
Its dreadful to come upon you so unexpectedly as this apologized Priscilla but I did not know till last night that we were coming
Aunt Charlotte is going away Monday and she had promised to spend today with a friend in town
But last night her friend telephoned to her not to come because they were quarantined for scarlet fever
So I suggested we come here instead for I knew you were longing to see her
We called at the White Sands Hotel and brought Mrs Pendexter with us
She is a friend of aunts and lives in New York and her husband is a millionaire
We cant stay very long for Mrs Pendexter has to be back at the hotel by five oclock
Several times while they were putting away the horse Anne caught Priscilla looking at her in a furtive puzzled way
She neednt stare at me so Anne thought a little resentfully
If she doesnt KNOW what it is to change a feather bed she might IMAGINE it
When Priscilla had gone to the parlor and before Anne could escape upstairs Diana walked into the kitchen
Anne caught her astonished friend by the arm
Diana Barry who do you suppose is in that parlor at this very moment
Mrs Charlotte E Morgan

and a New York millionaires wife

and here I am like THIS

and NOT A THING IN THE HOUSE FOR DINNER BUT A COLD HAM BONE Diana
By this time Anne had become aware that Diana was staring at her in precisely the same bewildered fashion as Priscilla had done
It was really too much
Oh Diana dont look at me so she implored
YOU at least must know that the neatest person in the world couldnt empty feathers from one tick into another and remain neat in the process
It

it

isnt the feathers hesitated Diana
Its


its

your nose Anne
My nose
Oh Diana surely nothing has gone wrong with it
Anne rushed to the little looking glass over the sink
One glance revealed the fatal truth
Her nose was a brilliant scarlet
Anne sat down on the sofa her dauntless spirit subdued at last
What is the matter with it
asked Diana curiosity overcoming delicacy
I thought I was rubbing my freckle lotion on it but I must have used that red dye Marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs was the despairing response
What shall I do
Wash it off said Diana practically
Perhaps it wont wash off
First I dye my hair then I dye my nose
Marilla cut my hair off when I dyed it but that remedy would hardly be practicable in this case
Well this is another punishment for vanity and I suppose I deserve it

though theres not much comfort in THAT
It is really almost enough to make one believe in illluck though Mrs Lynde says there is no such thing because everything is foreordained
Fortunately the dye washed off easily and Anne somewhat consoled betook herself to the east gable while Diana ran home
Presently Anne came down again clothed and in her right mind
The muslin dress she had fondly hoped to wear was bobbing merrily about on the line outside so she was forced to content herself with her black lawn
She had the fire on and the tea steeping when Diana returned the latter wore HER muslin at least and carried a covered platter in her hand
Mother sent you this she said lifting the cover and displaying a nicely carved and jointed chicken to Annes greatful eyes
The chicken was supplemented by light new bread excellent butter and cheese Marillas fruit cake and a dish of preserved plums floating in their golden syrup as in congealed summer sunshine
There was a big bowlful of pinkandwhite asters also by way of decoration yet the spread seemed very meager beside the elaborate one formerly prepared for Mrs Morgan
Annes hungry guests however did not seem to think anything was lacking and they ate the simple viands with apparent enjoyment
But after the first few moments Anne thought no more of what was or was not on her bill of fare
Mrs Morgans appearance might be somewhat disappointing as even her loyal worshippers had been forced to admit to each other but she proved to be a delightful conversationalist
She had traveled extensively and was an excellent storyteller
She had seen much of men and women and crystalized her experiences into witty little sentences and epigrams which made her hearers feel as if they were listening to one of the people in clever books
But under all her sparkle there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true womanly sympathy and kindheartedness which won affection as easily as her brilliancy won admiration
Nor did she monopolize the conversation
She could draw others out as skillfully and fully as she could talk herself and Anne and Diana found themselves chattering freely to her
Mrs Pendexter said little she merely smiled with her lovely eyes and lips and ate chicken and fruit cake and preserves with such exquisite grace that she conveyed the impression of dining on ambrosia and honeydew
But then as Anne said to Diana later on anybody so divinely beautiful as Mrs Pendexter didnt need to talk it was enough for her just to LOOK
After dinner they all had a walk through Lovers Lane and Violet Vale and the Birch Path then back through the Haunted Wood to the Dryads Bubble where they sat down and talked for a delightful last half hour
Mrs Morgan wanted to know how the Haunted Wood came by its name and laughed until she cried when she heard the story and Annes dramatic account of a certain memorable walk through it at the witching hour of twilight
It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul hasnt it
said Anne when her guests had gone and she and Diana were alone again
I dont know which I enjoyed more

listening to Mrs Morgan or gazing at Mrs Pendexter
I believe we had a nicer time than if wed known they were coming and been cumbered with much serving
You must stay to tea with me Diana and well talk it all over
Priscilla says Mrs Pendexters husbands sister is married to an English earl and yet she took a second helping of the plum preserves said Diana as if the two facts were somehow incompatible
I daresay even the English earl himself wouldnt have turned up his aristocratic nose at Marillas plum preserves said Anne proudly
Anne did not mention the misfortune which had befallen HER nose when she related the days history to Marilla that evening
But she took the bottle of freckle lotion and emptied it out of the window
I shall never try any beautifying messes again she said darkly resolute
They may do for careful deliberate people but for anyone so hopelessly given over to making mistakes as I seem to be its tempting fate to meddle with them
XXI Sweet Miss Lavendar School opened and Anne returned to her work with fewer theories but considerably more experience
She had several new pupils six and sevenyearolds just venturing roundeyed into a world of wonder
Among them were Davy and Dora
Davy sat with Milty Boulter who had been going to school for a year and was therefore quite a man of the world
Dora had made a compact at Sunday School the previous Sunday to sit with Lily Sloane but Lily Sloane not coming the first day she was temporarily assigned to Mirabel Cotton who was ten years old and therefore in Doras eyes one of the big girls
I think school is great fun Davy told Marilla when he got home that night
You said Id find it hard to sit still and I did


you mostly do tell the truth I notice

but you can wriggle your legs about under the desk and that helps a lot
Its splendid to have so many boys to play with
I sit with Milty Boulter and hes fine
Hes longer than me but Im wider
Its nicer to sit in the back seats but you cant sit there till your legs grow long enough to touch the floor
Milty drawed a picture of Anne on his slate and it was awful ugly and I told him if he made pictures of Anne like that Id lick him at recess
I thought first Id draw one of him and put horns and a tail on it but I was afraid it would hurt his feelings and Anne says you should never hurt anyones feelings
It seems its dreadful to have your feelings hurt
Its better to knock a boy down than hurt his feelings if you MUST do something
Milty said he wasnt scared of me but hed just as soon call it somebody else to blige me so he rubbed out Annes name and printed Barbara Shaws under it
Milty doesnt like Barbara cause she calls him a sweet little boy and once she patted him on his head
Dora said primly that she liked school but she was very quiet even for her and when at twilight Marilla bade her go upstairs to bed she hesitated and began to cry
Im

Im frightened she sobbed
I 
I dont want to go upstairs alone in the dark
What notion have you got into your head now
demanded Marilla
Im sure youve gone to bed alone all summer and never been frightened before
Dora still continued to cry so Anne picked her up cuddled her sympathetically and whispered Tell Anne all about it sweetheart
What are you frightened of
Of

of Mirabel Cottons uncle sobbed Dora
Mirabel Cotton told me all about her family today in school
Nearly everybody in her family has died

all her grandfathers and grandmothers and ever so many uncles and aunts
They have a habit of dying Mirabel says
Mirabels awful proud of having so many dead relations and she told me what they all died of and what they said and how they looked in their coffins
And Mirabel says one of her uncles was seen walking around the house after he was buried
Her mother saw him
I dont mind the rest so much but I cant help thinking about that uncle
Anne went upstairs with Dora and sat by her until she fell asleep
The next day Mirabel Cotton was kept in at recess and gently but firmly given to understand that when you were so unfortunate as to possess an uncle who persisted in walking about houses after he had been decently interred it was not in good taste to talk about that eccentric gentleman to your deskmate of tender years
Mirabel thought this very harsh
The Cottons had not much to boast of
How was she to keep up her prestige among her schoolmates if she were forbidden to make capital out of the family ghost
September slipped by into a gold and crimson graciousness of October
One Friday evening Diana came over
Id a letter from Ella Kimball today Anne and she wants us to go over to tea tomorrow afternoon to meet her cousin Irene Trent from town
But we cant get one of our horses to go for theyll all be in use tomorrow and your pony is lame

so I suppose we cant go
Why cant we walk
suggested Anne
If we go straight back through the woods well strike the West Grafton road not far from the Kimball place
I was through that way last winter and I know the road
Its no more than four miles and we wont have to walk home for Oliver Kimball will be sure to drive us
Hell be only too glad of the excuse for he goes to see Carrie Sloane and they say his father will hardly ever let him have a horse
It was accordingly arranged that they should walk and the following afternoon they set out going by way of Lovers Lane to the back of the Cuthbert farm where they found a road leading into the heart of acres of glimmering beech and maple woods which were all in a wondrous glow of flame and gold lying in a great purple stillness and peace
Its as if the year were kneeling to pray in a vast cathedral full of mellow stained light isnt it
said Anne dreamily
It doesnt seem right to hurry through it does it
It seems irreverent like running in a church
We MUST hurry though said Diana glancing at her watch
Weve left ourselves little enough time as it is
Well Ill walk fast but dont ask me to talk said Anne quickening her pace
I just want to drink the days loveliness in

I feel as if she were holding it out to my lips like a cup of airy wine and Ill take a sip at every step
Perhaps it was because she was so absorbed in drinking it in that Anne took the left turning when they came to a fork in the road
She should have taken the right but ever afterward she counted it the most fortunate mistake of her life
They came out finally to a lonely grassy road with nothing in sight along it but ranks of spruce saplings
Why where are we
exclaimed Diana in bewilderment
This isnt the West Grafton road
No its the base line road in Middle Grafton said Anne rather shamefacedly
I must have taken the wrong turning at the fork
I dont know where we are exactly but we must be all of three miles from Kimballs still
Then we cant get there by five for its half past four now said Diana with a despairing look at her watch
Well arrive after they have had their tea and theyll have all the bother of getting ours over again
Wed better turn back and go home suggested Anne humbly
But Diana after consideration vetoed this
No we may as well go and spend the evening since we have come this far A few yards further on the girls came to a place where the road forked again
Which of these do we take
asked Diana dubiously
Anne shook her head
I dont know and we cant afford to make any more mistakes
Here is a gate and a lane leading right into the wood
There must be a house at the other side
Let us go down and inquire
What a romantic old lane this it said Diana as they walked along its twists and turns
It ran under patriarchal old firs whose branches met above creating a perpetual gloom in which nothing except moss could grow
On either hand were brown wood floors crossed here and there by fallen lances of sunlight
All was very still and remote as if the world and the cares of the world were far away
I feel as if we were walking through an enchanted forest said Anne in a hushed tone
Do you suppose well ever find our way back to the real world again Diana
We shall presently come to a palace with a spellbound princess in it I think
Around the next turn they came in sight not indeed of a palace but of a little house almost as surprising as a palace would have been in this province of conventional wooden farmhouses all as much alike in general characteristics as if they had grown from the same seed
Anne stopped short in rapture and Diana exclaimed Oh I know where we are now
That is the little stone house where Miss Lavendar Lewis lives

Echo Lodge she calls it I think
Ive often heard of it but Ive never seen it before
Isnt it a romantic spot
Its the sweetest prettiest place I ever saw or imagined said Anne delightedly
It looks like a bit out of a story book or a dream
The house was a loweaved structure built of undressed blocks of red Island sandstone with a little peaked roof out of which peered two dormer windows with quaint wooden hoods over them and two great chimneys
The whole house was covered with a luxuriant growth of ivy finding easy foothold on the rough stonework and turned by autumn frosts to most beautiful bronze and winered tints
Before the house was an oblong garden into which the lane gate where the girls were standing opened
The house bounded it on one side on the three others it was enclosed by an old stone dyke so overgrown with moss and grass and ferns that it looked like a high green bank
On the right and left the tall dark spruces spread their palmlike branches over it but below it was a little meadow green with clover aftermath sloping down to the blue loop of the Grafton River
No other house or clearing was in sight

nothing but hills and valleys covered with feathery young firs
I wonder what sort of a person Miss Lewis is speculated Diana as they opened the gate into the garden
They say she is very peculiar
Shell be interesting then said Anne decidedly
Peculiar people are always that at least whatever else they are or are not
Didnt I tell you we would come to an enchanted palace
I knew the elves hadnt woven magic over that lane for nothing
But Miss Lavendar Lewis is hardly a spellbound princess laughed Diana
Shes an old maid

shes fortyfive and quite gray Ive heard
Oh thats only part of the spell asserted Anne confidently
At heart shes young and beautiful still

and if we only knew how to unloose the spell she would step forth radiant and fair again
But we dont know how

its always and only the prince who knows that 

and Miss Lavendars prince hasnt come yet
Perhaps some fatal mischance has befallen him

though THATS against the law of all fairy tales
Im afraid he came long ago and went away again said Diana
They say she used to be engaged to Stephan Irving

Pauls father

when they were young
But they quarreled and parted
Hush warned Anne
The door is open
The girls paused in the porch under the tendrils of ivy and knocked at the open door
There was a patter of steps inside and a rather odd little personage presented herself

a girl of about fourteen with a freckled face a snub nose a mouth so wide that it did really seem as if it stretched from ear to ear and two long braids of fair hair tied with two enormous bows of blue ribbon
Is Miss Lewis at home
asked Diana
Yes maam
Come in maam
Ill tell Miss Lavendar youre here maam
Shes upstairs maam
With this the small handmaiden whisked out of sight and the girls left alone looked about them with delighted eyes
The interior of this wonderful little house was quite as interesting as its exterior
The room had a low ceiling and two square smallpaned windows curtained with muslin frills
All the furnishings were oldfashioned but so well and daintily kept that the effect was delicious
But it must be candidly admitted that the most attractive feature to two healthy girls who had just tramped four miles through autumn air was a table set out with pale blue china and laden with delicacies while little goldenhued ferns scattered over the cloth gave it what Anne would have termed a festal air
Miss Lavendar must be expecting company to tea she whispered
There are six places set
But what a funny little girl she has
She looked like a messenger from pixy land
I suppose she could have told us the road but I was curious to see Miss Lavendar
S 
s

sh shes coming
And with that Miss Lavendar Lewis was standing in the doorway
The girls were so surprised that they forgot good manners and simply stared
They had unconsciously been expecting to see the usual type of elderly spinster as known to their experience 

a rather angular personage with prim gray hair and spectacles
Nothing more unlike Miss Lavendar could possibly be imagined
She was a little lady with snowwhite hair beautifully wavy and thick and carefully arranged in becoming puffs and coils
Beneath it was an almost girlish face pink cheeked and sweet lipped with big soft brown eyes and dimples

actually dimples
She wore a very dainty gown of cream muslin with palehued roses on it

a gown which would have seemed ridiculously juvenile on most women of her age but which suited Miss Lavendar so perfectly that you never thought about it at all
Charlotta the Fourth says that you wished to see me she said in a voice that matched her appearance
We wanted to ask the right road to West Grafton said Diana
We are invited to tea at Mr Kimballs but we took the wrong path coming through the woods and came out to the base line instead of the West Grafton road
Do we take the right or left turning at your gate
The left said Miss Lavendar with a hesitating glance at her tea table
Then she exclaimed as if in a sudden little burst of resolution But oh wont you stay and have tea with me
Please do
Mr Kimballs will have tea over before you get there
And Charlotta the Fourth and I will be so glad to have you
Diana looked mute inquiry at Anne
Wed like to stay said Anne promptly for she had made up her mind that she wanted to know more of this surprising Miss Lavendar if it wont inconvenience you
But you are expecting other guests arent you
Miss Lavendar looked at her tea table again and blushed
I know youll think me dreadfully foolish she said
I AM foolish

and Im ashamed of it when Im found out but never unless I AM found out
Im not expecting anybody

I was just pretending I was
You see I was so lonely
I love company


that is the right kind of company

but so few people ever come here because it is so far out of the way
Charlotta the Fourth was lonely too
So I just pretended I was going to have a tea party
I cooked for it

and decorated the table for it


and set it with my mothers wedding china 

and I dressed up for it
Diana secretly thought Miss Lavendar quite as peculiar as report had pictured her
The idea of a woman of fortyfive playing at having a tea party just as if she were a little girl
But Anne of the shining eyes exclaimed joyfuly Oh do YOU imagine things too
That too revealed a kindred spirit to Miss Lavendar
Yes I do she confessed boldly
Of course its silly in anybody as old as I am
But what is the use of being an independent old maid if you cant be silly when you want to and when it doesnt hurt anybody
A person must have some compensations
I dont believe I could live at times if I didnt pretend things
Im not often caught at it though and Charlotta the Fourth never tells
But Im glad to be caught today for you have really come and I have tea all ready for you
Will you go up to the spare room and take off your hats
Its the white door at the head of the stairs
I must run out to the kitchen and see that Charlotta the Fourth isnt letting the tea boil
Charlotta the Fourth is a very good girl but she WILL let the tea boil
Miss Lavendar tripped off to the kitchen on hospitable thoughts intent and the girls found their way up to the spare room an apartment as white as its door lighted by the ivyhung dormer window and looking as Anne said like the place where happy dreams grew
This is quite an adventure isnt it
said Diana
And isnt Miss Lavendar sweet if she IS a little odd
She doesnt look a bit like an old maid
She looks just as music sounds I think answered Anne
When they went down Miss Lavendar was carrying in the teapot and behind her looking vastly pleased was Charlotta the Fourth with a plate of hot biscuits
Now you must tell me your names said Miss Lavendar
Im so glad you are young girls
I love young girls
Its so easy to pretend Im a girl myself when Im with them
I do hate

with a little grimace


to believe Im old
Now who are you


just for convenience sake
Diana Barry
And Anne Shirley
May I pretend that Ive known you for a hundred years and call you Anne and Diana right away
You may the girls said both together
Then just lets sit comfily down and eat everything said Miss Lavendar happily
Charlotta you sit at the foot and help with the chicken
It is so fortunate that I made the sponge cake and doughnuts
Of course it was foolish to do it for imaginary guests


I know Charlotta the Fourth thought so didnt you Charlotta
But you see how well it has turned out
Of course they wouldnt have been wasted for Charlotta the Fourth and I could have eaten them through time
But sponge cake is not a thing that improves with time
That was a merry and memorable meal and when it was over they all went out to the garden lying in the glamor of sunset
I do think you have the loveliest place here said Diana looking round her admiringly
Why do you call it Echo Lodge
asked Anne
Charlotta said Miss Lavendar go into the house and bring out the little tin horn that is hanging over the clock shelf
Charlotta the Fourth skipped off and returned with the horn
Blow it Charlotta commanded Miss Lavendar
Charlotta accordingly blew a rather raucous strident blast
There was moments stillness

and then from the woods over the river came a multitude of fairy echoes sweet elusive silvery as if all the horns of elfland were blowing against the sunset
Anne and Diana exclaimed in delight
Now laugh Charlotta

laugh loudly
Charlotta who would probably have obeyed if Miss Lavendar had told her to stand on her head climbed upon the stone bench and laughed loud and heartily
Back came the echoes as if a host of pixy people were mimicking her laughter in the purple woodlands and along the firfringed points
People always admire my echoes very much said Miss Lavendar as if the echoes were her personal property
I love them myself
They are very good company

with a little pretending
On calm evenings Charlotta the Fourth and I often sit out here and amuse ourselves with them
Charlotta take back the horn and hang it carefully in its place
Why do you call her Charlotta the Fourth
asked Diana who was bursting with curiosity on this point
Just to keep her from getting mixed up with other Charlottas in my thoughts said Miss Lavendar seriously
They all look so much alike theres no telling them apart
Her name isnt really Charlotta at all
It is

let me see

what is it
I THINK its Leonora

yes it IS Leonora
You see it is this way
When mother died ten years ago I couldnt stay here alone


and I couldnt afford to pay the wages of a grownup girl
So I got little Charlotta Bowman to come and stay with me for board and clothes
Her name really was Charlotta

she was Charlotta the First
She was just thirteen
She stayed with me till she was sixteen and then she went away to Boston because she could do better there
Her sister came to stay with me then
Her name was Julietta

Mrs
Bowman had a weakness for fancy names I think

but she looked so like Charlotta that I kept calling her that all the time

and she didnt mind
So I just gave up trying to remember her right name
She was Charlotta the Second and when she went away Evelina came and she was Charlotta the Third
Now I have Charlotta the Fourth but when she is sixteen

shes fourteen now


she will want to go to Boston too and what I shall do then I really do not know
Charlotta the Fourth is the last of the Bowman girls and the best
The other Charlottas always let me see that they thought it silly of me to pretend things but Charlotta the Fourth never does no matter what she may really think
I dont care what people think about me if they dont let me see it
Well said Diana looking regretfully at the setting sun
I suppose we must go if we want to get to Mr Kimballs before dark
Weve had a lovely time Miss Lewis
Wont you come again to see me
pleaded Miss Lavendar
Tall Anne put her arm about the little lady
Indeed we shall she promised
Now that we have discovered you well wear out our welcome coming to see you
Yes we must go


we must tear ourselves away as Paul Irving says every time he comes to Green Gables
Paul Irving
There was a subtle change in Miss Lavendars voice
Who is he
I didnt think there was anybody of that name in Avonlea
Anne felt vexed at her own heedlessness
She had forgotten about Miss Lavendars old romance when Pauls name slipped out
He is a little pupil of mine she explained slowly
He came from Boston last year to live with his grandmother Mrs Irving of the shore road
Is he Stephen Irvings son
Miss Lavendar asked bending over her namesake border so that her face was hidden
Yes
Im going to give you girls a bunch of lavendar apiece said Miss Lavendar brightly as if she had not heard the answer to her question
Its very sweet dont you think
Mother always loved it
She planted these borders long ago
Father named me Lavendar because he was so fond of it
The very first time he saw mother was when he visited her home in East Grafton with her brother
He fell in love with her at first sight and they put him in the spare room bed to sleep and the sheets were scented with lavendar and he lay awake all night and thought of her
He always loved the scent of lavendar after that

and that was why he gave me the name
Dont forget to come back soon girls dear
Well be looking for you Charlotta the Fourth and I
She opened the gate under the firs for them to pass through
She looked suddenly old and tired the glow and radiance had faded from her face her parting smile was as sweet with ineradicable youth as ever but when the girls looked back from the first curve in the lane they saw her sitting on the old stone bench under the silver poplar in the middle of the garden with her head leaning wearily on her hand
She does look lonely said Diana softly
We must come often to see her
I think her parents gave her the only right and fitting name that could possibly be given her said Anne
If they had been so blind as to name her Elizabeth or Nellie or Muriel she must have been called Lavendar just the same I think
Its so suggestive of sweetness and oldfashioned graces and silk attire
Now my name just smacks of bread and butter patchwork and chores
Oh I dont think so said Diana
Anne seems to me real stately and like a queen
But Id like Kerrenhappuch if it happened to be your name
I think people make their names nice or ugly just by what they are themselves
I cant bear Josie or Gertie for names now but before I knew the Pye girls I thought them real pretty
Thats a lovely idea Diana said Anne enthusiastically
Living so that you beautify your name even if it wasnt beautiful to begin with

making it stand in peoples thoughts for something so lovely and pleasant that they never think of it by itself
Thank you Diana
XXII Odds and Ends So you had tea at the stone house with Lavendar Lewis
said Marilla at the breakfast table next morning
What is she like now
Its over fifteen years since I saw her last

it was one Sunday in Grafton church
I suppose she has changed a great deal
Davy Keith when you want something you cant reach ask to have it passed and dont spread yourself over the table in that fashion
Did you ever see Paul Irving doing that when he was here to meals
But Pauls arms are longern mine brumbled Davy
Theyve had eleven years to grow and mineve only had seven
Sides I DID ask but you and Anne was so busy talking you didnt pay any tention
Sides Pauls never been here to any meal escept tea and its easier to be plite at tea than at breakfast
You aint half as hungry
Its an awful long while between supper and breakfast
Now Anne that spoonful aint any bigger than it was last year and IM ever so much bigger
Of course I dont know what Miss Lavendar used to look like but I dont fancy somehow that she has changed a great deal said Anne after she had helped Davy to maple syrup giving him two spoonfuls to pacify him
Her hair is snowwhite but her face is fresh and almost girlish and she has the sweetest brown eyes

such a pretty shade of woodbrown with little golden glints in them


and her voice makes you think of white satin and tinkling water and fairy bells all mixed up together
She was reckoned a great beauty when she was a girl said Marilla
I never knew her very well but I liked her as far as I did know her
Some folks thought her peculiar even then
DAVY if ever I catch you at such a trick again youll be made to wait for your meals till everyone else is done like the French
Most conversations between Anne and Marilla in the presence of the twins were punctuated by these rebukes Davyward
In this instance Davy sad to relate not being able to scoop up the last drops of his syrup with his spoon had solved the difficulty by lifting his plate in both hands and applying his small pink tongue to it
Anne looked at him with such horrified eyes that the little sinner turned red and said half shamefacedly half defiantly There aint any wasted that way
People who are different from other people are always called peculiar said Anne
And Miss Lavendar is certainly different though its hard to say just where the difference comes in
Perhaps it is because she is one of those people who never grow old
One might as well grow old when all your generation do said Marilla rather reckless of her pronouns
If you dont you dont fit in anywhere
Far as I can learn Lavendar Lewis has just dropped out of everything
Shes lived in that out of the way place until everybody has forgotten her
That stone house is one of the oldest on the Island
Old Mr Lewis built it eighty years ago when he came out from England
Davy stop joggling Doras elbow
Oh I saw you
You neednt try to look innocent
What does make you behave so this morning
Maybe I got out of the wrong side of the bed suggested Davy
Milty Boulter says if you do that things are bound to go wrong with you all day
His grandmother told him
But which is the right side
And what are you to do when your beds against the wall
I want to know
Ive always wondered what went wrong between Stephen Irving and Lavendar Lewis continued Marilla ignoring Davy
They were certainly engaged twentyfive years ago and then all at once it was broken off
I dont know what the trouble was but it must have been something terrible for he went away to the States and never come home since
Perhaps it was nothing very dreadful after all
I think the little things in life often make more trouble than the big things said Anne with one of those flashes of insight which experience could not have bettered
Marilla please dont say anything about my being at Miss Lavendars to Mrs Lynde
Shed be sure to ask a hundred questions and somehow I wouldnt like it

nor Miss Lavendar either if she knew I feel sure
I daresay Rachel would be curious admitted Marilla though she hasnt as much time as she used to have for looking after other peoples affairs
Shes tied home now on account of Thomas and shes feeling pretty downhearted for I think shes beginning to lose hope of his ever getting better
Rachel will be left pretty lonely if anything happens to him with all her children settled out west except Eliza in town and she doesnt like her husband
Marillas pronouns slandered Eliza who was very fond of her husband
Rachel says if hed only brace up and exert his will power hed get better
But what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight
continued Marilla
Thomas Lynde never had any will power to exert
His mother ruled him till he married and then Rachel carried it on
Its a wonder he dared to get sick without asking her permission
But there I shouldnt talk so
Rachel has been a good wife to him
Hed never have amounted to anything without her thats certain
He was born to be ruled and its well he fell into the hands of a clever capable manager like Rachel
He didnt mind her way
It saved him the bother of ever making up his own mind about anything
Davy do stop squirming like an eel
Ive nothing else to do protested Davy
I cant eat any more and its no fun watching you and Anne eat
Well you and Dora go out and give the hens their wheat said Marilla
And dont you try to pull any more feathers out of the white roosters tail either
I wanted some feathers for an Injun headdress said Davy sulkily
Milty Boulter has a dandy one made out of the feathers his mother give him when she killed their old white gobbler
You might let me have some
That roosters got ever so many moren he wants
You may have the old feather duster in the garret said Anne and Ill dye them green and red and yellow for you
You do spoil that boy dreadfully said Marilla when Davy with a radiant face had followed prim Dora out
Marillas education had made great strides in the past six years but she had not yet been able to rid herself of the idea that it was very bad for a child to have too many of its wishes indulged
All the boys of his class have Indian headdresses and Davy wants one too said Anne
I know how it feels

Ill never forget how I used to long for puffed sleeves when all the other girls had them
And Davy isnt being spoiled
He is improving every day
Think what a difference there is in him since he came here a year ago
He certainly doesnt get into as much mischief since he began to go to school acknowledged Marilla
I suppose he works off the tendency with the other boys
But its a wonder to me we havent heard from Richard Keith before this
Never a word since last May
Ill be afraid to hear from him sighed Anne beginning to clear away the dishes
If a letter should come Id dread opening it for fear it would tell us to send the twins to him
A month later a letter did come
But it was not from Richard Keith
A friend of his wrote to say that Richard Keith had died of consumption a fortnight previously
The writer of the letter was the executor of his will and by that will the sum of two thousand dollars was left to Miss Marilla Cuthbert in trust for David and Dora Keith until they came of age or married
In the meantime the interest was to be used for their maintenance
It seems dreadful to be glad of anything in connection with a death said Anne soberly
Im sorry for poor Mr Keith but I AM glad that we can keep the twins
Its a very good thing about the money said Marilla practically
I wanted to keep them but I really didnt see how I could afford to do it especially when they grew older
The rent of the farm doesnt do any more than keep the house and I was bound that not a cent of your money should be spent on them
You do far too much for them as it is
Dora didnt need that new hat you bought her any more than a cat needs two tails
But now the way is made clear and they are provided for
Davy and Dora were delighted when they heard that they were to live at Green Gables for good
The death of an uncle whom they had never seen could not weigh a moment in the balance against that
But Dora had one misgiving
Was Uncle Richard buried
she whispered to Anne
Yes dear of course
He

he

isnt like Mirabel Cottons uncle is he
in a still more agitated whisper
He wont walk about houses after being buried will he Anne
XXIII Miss Lavendars Romance I think Ill take a walk through to Echo Lodge this evening said Anne one Friday afternoon in December
It looks like snow said Marilla dubiously
Ill be there before the snow comes and I mean to stay all night
Diana cant go because she has company and Im sure Miss Lavendar will be looking for me tonight
Its a whole fortnight since I was there
Anne had paid many a visit to Echo Lodge since that October day
Sometimes she and Diana drove around by the road sometimes they walked through the woods
When Diana could not go Anne went alone
Between her and Miss Lavendar had sprung up one of those fervent helpful friendships possible only between a woman who has kept the freshness of youth in her heart and soul and a girl whose imagination and intuition supplied the place of experience
Anne had at last discovered a real kindred spirit while into the little ladys lonely sequestered life of dreams Anne and Diana came with the wholesome joy and exhilaration of the outer existence which Miss Lavendar the world forgetting by the world forgot had long ceased to share they brought an atmosphere of youth and reality to the little stone house
Charlotta the Fourth always greeted them with her very widest smile

and Charlottas smiles WERE fearfully wide

loving them for the sake of her adored mistress as well as for their own
Never had there been such high jinks held in the little stone house as were held there that beautiful latelingering autumn when November seemed October over again and even December aped the sunshine and hazes of summer
But on this particular day it seemed as if December had remembered that it was time for winter and had turned suddenly dull and brooding with a windless hush predictive of coming snow
Nevertheless Anne keenly enjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands though alone she never found it lonely her imagination peopled her path with merry companions and with these she carried on a gay pretended conversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations are apt to be in real life where people sometimes fail most lamentably to talk up to the requirements
In a make believe assembly of choice spirits everybody says just the thing you want her to say and so gives you the chance to say just what YOU want to say
Attended by this invisible company Anne traversed the woods and arrived at the fir lane just as broad feathery flakes began to flutter down softly
At the first bend she came upon Miss Lavendar standing under a big broadbranching fir
She wore a gown of warm rich red and her head and shoulders were wrapped in a silvery gray silk shawl
You look like the queen of the fir wood fairies called Anne merrily
I thought you would come tonight Anne said Miss Lavendar running forward
And Im doubly glad for Charlotta the Fourth is away
Her mother is sick and she had to go home for the night
I should have been very lonely if you hadnt come

even the dreams and the echoes wouldnt have been enough company
Oh Anne how pretty you are she added suddenly looking up at the tall slim girl with the soft roseflush of walking on her face
How pretty and how young
Its so delightful to be seventeen isnt it
I do envy you concluded Miss Lavendar candidly
But you are only seventeen at heart smiled Anne
No Im old

or rather middleaged which is far worse sighed Miss Lavendar
Sometimes I can pretend Im not but at other times I realize it
And I cant reconcile myself to it as most women seem to
Im just as rebellious as I was when I discovered my first gray hair
Now Anne dont look as if you were trying to understand
Seventeen CANT understand
Im going to pretend right away that I am seventeen too and I can do it now that youre here
You always bring youth in your hand like a gift
Were going to have a jolly evening
Tea first

what do you want for tea
Well have whatever you like
Do think of something nice and indigestible
There were sounds of riot and mirth in the little stone house that night
What with cooking and feasting and making candy and laughing and pretending it is quite true that Miss Lavendar and Anne comported themselves in a fashion entirely unsuited to the dignity of a spinster of fortyfive and a sedate schoolmaam
Then when they were tired they sat down on the rug before the grate in the parlor lighted only by the soft fireshine and perfumed deliciously by Miss Lavendars open rosejar on the mantel
The wind had risen and was sighing and wailing around the eaves and the snow was thudding softly against the windows as if a hundred storm sprites were tapping for entrance
Im so glad youre here Anne said Miss Lavendar nibbling at her candy
If you werent I should be blue

very blue


almost navy blue
Dreams and makebelieves are all very well in the daytime and the sunshine but when dark and storm come they fail to satisfy
One wants real things then
But you dont know this

seventeen never knows it
At seventeen dreams DO satisfy because you think the realities are waiting for you further on
When I was seventeen Anne I didnt think fortyfive would find me a whitehaired little old maid with nothing but dreams to fill my life
But you arent an old maid said Anne smiling into Miss Lavendars wistful woodbrown eyes
Old maids are BORN

they dont BECOME
Some are born old maids some achieve old maidenhood and some have old maidenhood thrust upon them parodied Miss Lavendar whimsically
You are one of those who have achieved it then laughed Anne and youve done it so beautifully that if every old maid were like you they would come into the fashion I think
I always like to do things as well as possible said Miss Lavendar meditatively and since an old maid I had to be I was determined to be a very nice one
People say Im odd but its just because I follow my own way of being an old maid and refuse to copy the traditional pattern
Anne did anyone ever tell you anything about Stephen Irving and me
Yes said Anne candidly Ive heard that you and he were engaged once
So we were

twentyfive years ago

a lifetime ago
And we were to have been married the next spring
I had my wedding dress made although nobody but mother and Stephen ever knew THAT
Wed been engaged in a way almost all our lives you might say
When Stephen was a little boy his mother would bring him here when she came to see my mother and the second time he ever came


he was nine and I was six

he told me out in the garden that he had pretty well made up his mind to marry me when he grew up
I remember that I said Thank you and when he was gone I told mother very gravely that there was a great weight off my mind because I wasnt frightened any more about having to be an old maid
How poor mother laughed
And what went wrong
asked Anne breathlessly
We had just a stupid silly commonplace quarrel
So commonplace that if youll believe me I dont even remember just how it began
I hardly know who was the more to blame for it
Stephen did really begin it but I suppose I provoked him by some foolishness of mine
He had a rival or two you see
I was vain and coquettish and liked to tease him a little
He was a very highstrung sensitive fellow
Well we parted in a temper on both sides
But I thought it would all come right and it would have if Stephen hadnt come back too soon
Anne my dear Im sorry to say

Miss Lavendar dropped her voice as if she were about to confess a predilection for murdering people that I am a dreadfully sulky person
Oh you neednt smile


its only too true
I DO sulk and Stephen came back before I had finished sulking
I wouldnt listen to him and I wouldnt forgive him and so he went away for good
He was too proud to come again
And then I sulked because he didnt come
I might have sent for him perhaps but I couldnt humble myself to do that
I was just as proud as he was

pride and sulkiness make a very bad combination Anne
But I could never care for anybody else and I didnt want to
I knew I would rather be an old maid for a thousand years than marry anybody who wasnt Stephen Irving
Well it all seems like a dream now of course
How sympathetic you look Anne

as sympathetic as only seventeen can look
But dont overdo it
Im really a very happy contented little person in spite of my broken heart
My heart did break if ever a heart did when I realized that Stephen Irving was not coming back
But Anne a broken heart in real life isnt half as dreadful as it is in books
Its a good deal like a bad tooth

though you wont think THAT a very romantic simile
It takes spells of aching and gives you a sleepless night now and then but between times it lets you enjoy life and dreams and echoes and peanut candy as if there were nothing the matter with it
And now youre looking disappointed
You dont think Im half as interesting a person as you did five minutes ago when you believed I was always the prey of a tragic memory bravely hidden beneath external smiles
Thats the worst

or the best


of real life Anne
It WONT let you be miserable
It keeps on trying to make you comfortable

and succeedingeven when youre determined to be unhappy and romantic
Isnt this candy scrumptious
Ive eaten far more than is good for me already but Im going to keep recklessly on
After a little silence Miss Lavendar said abruptly It gave me a shock to hear about Stephens son that first day you were here Anne
Ive never been able to mention him to you since but Ive wanted to know all about him
What sort of a boy is he
He is the dearest sweetest child I ever knew Miss Lavendar


and he pretends things too just as you and I do
Id like to see him said Miss Lavendar softly as if talking to herself
I wonder if he looks anything like the little dreamboy who lives here with me

MY little dreamboy
If you would like to see Paul Ill bring him through with me sometime said Anne
I would like it

but not too soon
I want to get used to the thought
There might be more pain than pleasure in it

if he looked too much like Stephen

or if he didnt look enough like him
In a months time you may bring him
Accordingly a month later Anne and Paul walked through the woods to the stone house and met Miss Lavendar in the lane
She had not been expecting them just then and she turned very pale
So this is Stephens boy she said in a low tone taking Pauls hand and looking at him as he stood beautiful and boyish in his smart little fur coat and cap
He

he is very like his father
Everybody says Im a chip off the old block remarked Paul quite at his ease
Anne who had been watching the little scene drew a relieved breath
She saw that Miss Lavendar and Paul had taken to each other and that there would be no constraint or stiffness
Miss Lavendar was a very sensible person in spite of her dreams and romance and after that first little betrayal she tucked her feelings out of sight and entertained Paul as brightly and naturally as if he were anybodys son who had come to see her
They all had a jolly afternoon together and such a feast of fat things by way of supper as would have made old Mrs Irving hold up her hands in horror believing that Pauls digestion would be ruined for ever
Come again laddie said Miss Lavendar shaking hands with him at parting
You may kiss me if you like said Paul gravely
Miss Lavendar stooped and kissed him
How did you know I wanted to
she whispered
Because you looked at me just as my little mother used to do when she wanted to kiss me
As a rule I dont like to be kissed
Boys dont
You know Miss Lewis
But I think I rather like to have you kiss me
And of course Ill come to see you again
I think Id like to have you for a particular friend of mine if you dont object
I 
I dont think I shall object said Miss Lavendar
She turned and went in very quickly but a moment later she was waving a gay and smiling goodbye to them from the window
I like Miss Lavendar announced Paul as they walked through the beech woods
I like the way she looked at me and I like her stone house and I like Charlotta the Fourth
I wish Grandma Irving had a Charlotta the Fourth instead of a Mary Joe
I feel sure Charlotta the Fourth wouldnt think I was wrong in my upper story when I told her what I think about things
Wasnt that a splendid tea we had teacher
Grandma says a boy shouldnt be thinking about what he gets to eat but he cant help it sometimes when he is real hungry
YOU know teacher
I dont think Miss Lavendar would make a boy eat porridge for breakfast if he didnt like it
Shed get things for him he did like
But of course


Paul was nothing if not fairminded


that mightnt be very good for him
Its very nice for a change though teacher
YOU know
XXIV A Prophet in His Own Country One May day Avonlea folks were mildly excited over some Avonlea Notes signed Observer which appeared in the Charlottetown Daily Enterprise
Gossip ascribed the authorship thereof to Charlie Sloane partly because the said Charlie had indulged in similar literary flights in times past and partly because one of the notes seemed to embody a sneer at Gilbert Blythe
Avonlea juvenile society persisted in regarding Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane as rivals in the good graces of a certain damsel with gray eyes and an imagination
Gossip as usual was wrong
Gilbert Blythe aided and abetted by Anne had written the notes putting in the one about himself as a blind
Only two of the notes have any bearing on this history Rumor has it that there will be a wedding in our village ere the daisies are in bloom
A new and highly respected citizen will lead to the hymeneal altar one of our most popular ladies
Uncle Abe our wellknown weather prophet predicts a violent storm of thunder and lightning for the evening of the twentythird of May beginning at seven oclock sharp
The area of the storm will extend over the greater part of the Province
People traveling that evening will do well to take umbrellas and mackintoshes with them
Uncle Abe really has predicted a storm for sometime this spring said Gilbert but do you suppose Mr Harrison really does go to see Isabella Andrews
No said Anne laughing Im sure he only goes to play checkers with Mr Harrison Andrews but Mrs Lynde says she knows Isabella Andrews must be going to get married shes in such good spirits this spring
Poor old Uncle Abe felt rather indignant over the notes
He suspected that Observer was making fun of him
He angrily denied having assigned any particular date for his storm but nobody believed him
Life in Avonlea continued on the smooth and even tenor of its way
The planting was put in the Improvers celebrated an Arbor Day
Each Improver set out or caused to be set out five ornamental trees
As the society now numbered forty members this meant a total of two hundred young trees
Early oats greened over the red fields apple orchards flung great blossoming arms about the farmhouses and the Snow Queen adorned itself as a bride for her husband
Anne liked to sleep with her window open and let the cherry fragrance blow over her face all night
She thought it very poetical
Marilla thought she was risking her life
Thanksgiving should be celebrated in the spring said Anne one evening to Marilla as they sat on the front door steps and listened to the silversweet chorus of the frogs
I think it would be ever so much better than having it in November when everything is dead or asleep
Then you have to remember to be thankful but in May one simply cant help being thankful


that they are alive if for nothing else
I feel exactly as Eve must have felt in the garden of Eden before the trouble began
IS that grass in the hollow green or golden
It seems to me Marilla that a pearl of a day like this when the blossoms are out and the winds dont know where to blow from next for sheer crazy delight must be pretty near as good as heaven
Marilla looked scandalized and glanced apprehensively around to make sure the twins were not within earshot
They came around the corner of the house just then
Aint it an awful nicesmelling evening
asked Davy sniffing delightedly as he swung a hoe in his grimy hands
He had been working in his garden
That spring Marilla by way of turning Davys passion for reveling in mud and clay into useful channels had given him and Dora a small plot of ground for a garden
Both had eagerly gone to work in a characteristic fashion
Dora planted weeded and watered carefully systematically and dispassionately
As a result her plot was already green with prim orderly little rows of vegetables and annuals
Davy however worked with more zeal than discretion he dug and hoed and raked and watered and transplanted so energetically that his seeds had no chance for their lives
How is your garden coming on Davyboy
asked Anne
Kind of slow said Davy with a sigh
I dont know why the things dont grow better
Milty Boulter says I must have planted them in the dark of the moon and thats the whole trouble
He says you must never sow seeds or kill pork or cut your hair or do any portant thing in the wrong time of the moon
Is that true Anne
I want to know
Maybe if you didnt pull your plants up by the roots every other day to see how theyre getting on at the other end theyd do better said Marilla sarcastically
I only pulled six of them up protested Davy
I wanted to see if there was grubs at the roots
Milty Boulter said if it wasnt the moons fault it must be grubs
But I only found one grub
He was a great big juicy curly grub
I put him on a stone and got another stone and smashed him flat
He made a jolly SQUISH I tell you
I was sorry there wasnt more of them
Doras garden was planted same times mine and her things are growing all right
It CANT be the moon Davy concluded in a reflective tone
Marilla look at that apple tree said Anne
Why the thing is human
It is reaching out long arms to pick its own pink skirts daintily up and provoke us to admiration
Those Yellow Duchess trees always bear well said Marilla complacently
That treell be loaded this year
Im real glad

theyre great for pies
But neither Marilla nor Anne nor anybody else was fated to make pies out of Yellow Duchess apples that year
The twentythird of May came

an unseasonably warm day as none realized more keenly than Anne and her little beehive of pupils sweltering over fractions and syntax in the Avonlea schoolroom
A hot breeze blew all the forenoon but after noon hour it died away into a heavy stillness
At half past three Anne heard a low rumble of thunder
She promptly dismissed school at once so that the children might get home before the storm came
As they went out to the playground Anne perceived a certain shadow and gloom over the world in spite of the fact that the sun was still shining brightly
Annetta Bell caught her hand nervously
Oh teacher look at that awful cloud
Anne looked and gave an exclamation of dismay
In the northwest a mass of cloud such as she had never in all her life beheld before was rapidly rolling up
It was dead black save where its curled and fringed edges showed a ghastly livid white
There was something about it indescribably menacing as it gloomed up in the clear blue sky now and again a bolt of lightning shot across it followed by a savage growl
It hung so low that it almost seemed to be touching the tops of the wooded hills
Mr Harmon Andrews came clattering up the hill in his truck wagon urging his team of grays to their utmost speed
He pulled them to a halt opposite the school
Guess Uncle Abes hit it for once in his life Anne he shouted
His storms coming a leetle ahead of time
Did ye ever see the like of that cloud
Here all you young ones that are going my way pile in and those that aint scoot for the post office if yeve moren a quarter of a mile to go and stay there till the showers over
Anne caught Davy and Dora by the hands and flew down the hill along the Birch Path and past Violet Vale and Willowmere as fast as the twins fat legs could go
They reached Green Gables not a moment too soon and were joined at the door by Marilla who had been hustling her ducks and chickens under shelter
As they dashed into the kitchen the light seemed to vanish as if blown out by some mighty breath the awful cloud rolled over the sun and a darkness as of late twilight fell across the world
At the same moment with a crash of thunder and a blinding glare of lightning the hail swooped down and blotted the landscape out in one white fury
Through all the clamor of the storm came the thud of torn branches striking the house and the sharp crack of breaking glass
In three minutes every pane in the west and north windows was broken and the hail poured in through the apertures covering the floor with stones the smallest of which was as big as a hens egg
For three quarters of an hour the storm raged unabated and no one who underwent it ever forgot it
Marilla for once in her life shaken out of her composure by sheer terror knelt by her rocking chair in a corner of the kitchen gasping and sobbing between the deafening thunder peals
Anne white as paper had dragged the sofa away from the window and sat on it with a twin on either side
Davy at the first crash had howled Anne Anne is it the Judgment Day
Anne Anne I never meant to be naughty and then had buried his face in Annes lap and kept it there his little body quivering
Dora somewhat pale but quite composed sat with her hand clasped in Annes quiet and motionless
It is doubtful if an earthquake would have disturbed Dora
Then almost as suddenly as it began the storm ceased
The hail stopped the thunder rolled and muttered away to the eastward and the sun burst out merry and radiant over a world so changed that it seemed an absurd thing to think that a scant three quarters of an hour could have effected such a transformation
Marilla rose from her knees weak and trembling and dropped on her rocker
Her face was haggard and she looked ten years older
Have we all come out of that alive
she asked solemnly
You bet we have piped Davy cheerfully quite his own man again
I wasnt a bit scared either

only just at the first
It come on a fellow so sudden
I made up my mind quick as a wink that I wouldnt fight Teddy Sloane Monday as Id promised but now maybe I will
Say Dora was you scared
Yes I was a little scared said Dora primly but I held tight to Annes hand and said my prayers over and over again
Well Id have said my prayers too if Id have thought of it said Davy but he added triumphantly you see I came through just as safe as you for all I didnt say them
Anne got Marilla a glassful of her potent currant wine

HOW potent it was Anne in her earlier days had had all too good reason to know

and then they went to the door to look out on the strange scene
Far and wide was a white carpet knee deep of hailstones drifts of them were heaped up under the eaves and on the steps
When three or four days later those hailstones melted the havoc they had wrought was plainly seen for every green growing thing in the field or garden was cut off
Not only was every blossom stripped from the apple trees but great boughs and branches were wrenched away
And out of the two hundred trees set out by the Improvers by far the greater number were snapped off or torn to shreds
Can it possibly be the same world it was an hour ago
asked Anne dazedly
It MUST have taken longer than that to play such havoc
The like of this has never been known in Prince Edward Island said Marilla never
I remember when I was a girl there was a bad storm but it was nothing to this
Well hear of terrible destruction you may be sure
I do hope none of the children were caught out in it murmured Anne anxiously
As it was discovered later none of the children had been since all those who had any distance to go had taken Mr Andrews excellent advice and sought refuge at the post office
There comes John Henry Carter said Marilla
John Henry came wading through the hailstones with a rather scared grin
Oh aint this awful Miss Cuthbert
Mr Harrison sent me over to see if yous had come out all right
Were none of us killed said Marilla grimly and none of the buildings was struck
I hope you got off equally well
Yasm
Not quite so well maam
We was struck
The lightning knocked over the kitchen chimbly and come down the flue and knocked over Gingers cage and tore a hole in the floor and went into the sullar
Yasm
Was Ginger hurt
queried Anne
Yasm
He was hurt pretty bad
He was killed
Later on Anne went over to comfort Mr Harrison
She found him sitting by the table stroking Gingers gay dead body with a trembling hand
Poor Ginger wont call you any more names Anne he said mournfully
Anne could never have imagined herself crying on Gingers account but the tears came into her eyes
He was all the company I had Anne

and now hes dead
Well well Im an old fool to care so much
Ill let on I dont care
I know youre going to say something sympathetic as soon as I stop talking

but dont
If you did Id cry like a baby
Hasnt this been a terrible storm
I guess folks wont laugh at Uncle Abes predictions again
Seems as if all the storms that hes been prophesying all his life that never happened came all at once
Beats all how he struck the very day though dont it
Look at the mess we have here
I must hustle round and get some boards to patch up that hole in the floor
Avonlea folks did nothing the next day but visit each other and compare damages
The roads were impassable for wheels by reason of the hailstones so they walked or rode on horseback
The mail came late with ill tidings from all over the province
Houses had been struck people killed and injured the whole telephone and telegraph system had been disorganized and any number of young stock exposed in the fields had perished
Uncle Abe waded out to the blacksmiths forge early in the morning and spent the whole day there
It was Uncle Abes hour of triumph and he enjoyed it to the full
It would be doing Uncle Abe an injustice to say that he was glad the storm had happened but since it had to be he was very glad he had predicted it

to the very day too
Uncle Abe forgot that he had ever denied setting the day
As for the trifling discrepancy in the hour that was nothing
Gilbert arrived at Green Gables in the evening and found Marilla and Anne busily engaged in nailing strips of oilcloth over the broken windows
Goodness only knows when well get glass for them said Marilla
Mr Barry went over to Carmody this afternoon but not a pane could he get for love or money
Lawson and Blair were cleaned out by the Carmody people by ten oclock
Was the storm bad at White Sands Gilbert
I should say so
I was caught in the school with all the children and I thought some of them would go mad with fright
Three of them fainted and two girls took hysterics and Tommy Blewett did nothing but shriek at the top of his voice the whole time
I only squealed once said Davy proudly
My garden was all smashed flat he continued mournfully but so was Doras he added in a tone which indicated that there was yet balm in Gilead
Anne came running down from the west gable
Oh Gilbert have you heard the news
Mr Levi Boulters old house was struck and burned to the ground
It seems to me that Im dreadfully wicked to feel glad over THAT when so much damage has been done
Mr Boulter says he believes the AVIS
magicked up that storm on purpose
Well one thing is certain said Gilbert laughing Observer has made Uncle Abes reputation as a weather prophet
Uncle Abes storm will go down in local history
It is a most extraordinary coincidence that it should have come on the very day we selected
I actually have a half guilty feeling as if I really had magicked it up
We may as well rejoice over the old house being removed for theres not much to rejoice over where our young trees are concerned
Not ten of them have escaped
Ah well well just have to plant them over again next spring said Anne philosophically
That is one good thing about this world

there are always sure to be more springs
XXV An Avonlea Scandal One blithe June morning a fortnight after Uncle Abes storm Anne came slowly through the Green Gables yard from the garden carrying in her hands two blighted stalks of white narcissus
Look Marilla she said sorroly holding up the flowers before the eyes of a grim lady with her hair coifed in a green gingham apron who was going into the house with a plucked chicken these are the only buds the storm spared

and even they are imperfect
Im so sorry

I wanted some for Matthews grave
He was always so fond of June lilies
I kind of miss them myself admitted Marilla though it doesnt seem right to lament over them when so many worse things have happened

all the crops destroyed as well as the fruit
But people have sown their oats over again said Anne comfortingly and Mr Harrison says he thinks if we have a good summer they will come out all right though late
And my annuals are all coming up again 

but oh nothing can replace the June lilies
Poor little Hester Gray will have none either
I went all the way back to her garden last night but there wasnt one
Im sure shell miss them
I dont think its right for you to say such things Anne I really dont said Marilla severely
Hester Gray has been dead for thirty years and her spirit is in heaven

I hope
Yes but I believe she loves and remembers her garden here still said Anne
Im sure no matter how long Id lived in heaven Id like to look down and see somebody putting flowers on my grave
If I had had a garden here like Hester Grays it would take me more than thirty years even in heaven to forget being homesick for it by spells
Well dont let the twins hear you talking like that was Marillas feeble protest as she carried her chicken into the house
Anne pinned her narcissi on her hair and went to the lane gate where she stood for awhile sunning herself in the June brightness before going in to attend to her Saturday morning duties
The world was growing lovely again old Mother Nature was doing her best to remove the traces of the storm and though she was not to succeed fully for many a moon she was really accomplishing wonders
I wish I could just be idle all day today Anne told a bluebird who was singing and swinging on a willow bough but a schoolmaam who is also helping to bring up twins cant indulge in laziness birdie
How sweet you are singing little bird
You are just putting the feelings of my heart into song ever so much better than I could myself
Why who is coming
An express wagon was jolting up the lane with two people on the front seat and a big trunk behind
When it drew near Anne recognized the driver as the son of the station agent at Bright River but his companion was a stranger

a scrap of a woman who sprang nimbly down at the gate almost before the horse came to a standstill
She was a very pretty little person evidently nearer fifty than forty but with rosy cheeks sparkling black eyes and shining black hair surmounted by a wonderful beflowered and beplumed bonnet
In spite of having driven eight miles over a dusty road she was as neat as if she had just stepped out of the proverbial bandbox
Is this where Mr James A Harrison lives
she inquired briskly
No Mr Harrison lives over there said Anne quite lost in astonishment
Well I DID think this place seemed too tidy

MUCH too tidy for James A to be living here unless he has greatly changed since I knew him chirped the little lady
Is it true that James A is going to be married to some woman living in this settlement
No oh no cried Anne flushing so guiltily that the stranger looked curiously at her as if she half suspected her of matrimonial designs on Mr Harrison
But I saw it in an Island paper persisted the Fair Unknown
A friend sent a marked copy to me

friends are always so ready to do such things
James A
s name was written in over new citizen
Oh that note was only meant as a joke gasped Anne
Mr Harrison has no intention of marrying ANYBODY
I assure you he hasnt
Im very glad to hear it said the rosy lady climbing nimbly back to her seat in the wagon because he happens to be married already
I am his wife
Oh you may well look surprised
I suppose he has been masquerading as a bachelor and breaking hearts right and left
Well well James A nodding vigorously over the fields at the long white house your fun is over
I am here

though I wouldnt have bothered coming if I hadnt thought you were up to some mischief
I suppose turning to Anne that parrot of his is as profane as ever
His parrot

is dead

I THINK gasped poor Anne who couldnt have felt sure of her own name at that precise moment
Dead
Everything will be all right then cried the rosy lady jubilantly
I can manage James A if that bird is out of the way
With which cryptic utterance she went joyfully on her way and Anne flew to the kitchen door to meet Marilla
Anne who was that woman
Marilla said Anne solemnly but with dancing eyes do I look as if I were crazy
Not more so than usual said Marilla with no thought of being sarcastic
Well then do you think I am awake
Anne what nonsense has got into you
Who was that woman I say
Marilla if Im not crazy and not asleep she cant be such stuff as dreams are made of

she must be real
Anyway Im sure I couldnt have imagined such a bonnet
She says she is Mr Harrisons wife Marilla
Marilla stared in her turn
His wife
Anne Shirley
Then what has he been passing himself off as an unmarried man for
I dont suppose he did really said Anne trying to be just
He never said he wasnt married
People simply took it for granted
Oh Marilla what will Mrs Lynde say to this
They found out what Mrs Lynde had to say when she came up that evening
Mrs Lynde wasnt surprised
Mrs Lynde had always expected something of the sort
Mrs Lynde had always known there was SOMETHING about Mr Harrison
To think of his deserting his wife
she said indignantly
Its like something youd read of in the States but who would expect such a thing to happen right here in Avonlea
But we dont know that he deserted her protested Anne determined to believe her friend innocent till he was proved guilty
We dont know the rights of it at all
Well we soon will
Im going straight over there said Mrs Lynde who had never learned that there was such a word as delicacy in the dictionary
Im not supposed to know anything about her arrival and Mr Harrison was to bring some medicine for Thomas from Carmody today so that will be a good excuse
Ill find out the whole story and come in and tell you on the way back
Mrs Lynde rushed in where Anne had feared to tread
Nothing would have induced the latter to go over to the Harrison place but she had her natural and proper share of curiosity and she felt secretly glad that Mrs Lynde was going to solve the mystery
She and Marilla waited expectantly for that good ladys return but waited in vain
Mrs Lynde did not revisit Green Gables that night
Davy arriving home at nine oclock from the Boulter place explained why
I met Mrs Lynde and some strange woman in the Hollow he said and gracious how they were talking both at once
Mrs Lynde said to tell you she was sorry it was too late to call tonight
Anne Im awful hungry
We had tea at Miltys at four and I think Mrs Boulter is real mean
She didnt give us any preserves or cake 

and even the bread was skurce
Davy when you go visiting you must never criticize anything you are given to eat said Anne solemnly
It is very bad manners
All right

Ill only think it said Davy cheerfully
Do give a fellow some supper Anne
Anne looked at Marilla who followed her into the pantry and shut the door cautiously
You can give him some jam on his bread I know what tea at Levi Boulters is apt to be
Davy took his slice of bread and jam with a sigh
Its a kind of disappointing world after all he remarked
Milty has a cat that takes fits

shes took a fit regular every day for three weeks
Milty says its awful fun to watch her
I went down today on purpose to see her have one but the mean old thing wouldnt take a fit and just kept healthy as healthy though Milty and me hung round all the afternoon and waited
But never mind 

Davy brightened up as the insidious comfort of the plum jam stole into his soul


maybe Ill see her in one sometime yet
It doesnt seem likely shed stop having them all at once when shes been so in the habit of it does it
This jam is awful nice
Davy had no sorrows that plum jam could not cure
Sunday proved so rainy that there was no stirring abroad but by Monday everybody had heard some version of the Harrison story
The school buzzed with it and Davy came home full of information
Marilla Mr Harrison has a new wife

well not ezackly new but theyve stopped being married for quite a spell Milty says
I always sposed people had to keep on being married once theyd begun but Milty says no theres ways of stopping if you cant agree
Milty says one way is just to start off and leave your wife and thats what Mr Harrison did
Milty says Mr Harrison left his wife because she throwed things at him

HARD things

and Arty Sloane says it was because she wouldnt let him smoke and Ned Clay says it was cause she never let up scolding him
I wouldnt leave MY wife for anything like that
Id just put my foot down and say Mrs Davy youve just got to do whatll please ME cause Im a MAN
THATD settle her pretty quick I guess
But Annetta Clay says SHE left HIM because he wouldnt scrape his boots at the door and she doesnt blame her
Im going right over to Mr Harrisons this minute to see what shes like
Davy soon returned somewhat cast down
Mrs Harrison was away

shes gone to Carmody with Mrs Rachel Lynde to get new paper for the parlor
And Mr Harrison said to tell Anne to go over and see him cause he wants to have a talk with her
And say the floor is scrubbed and Mr Harrison is shaved though there wasnt any preaching yesterday
The Harrison kitchen wore a very unfamiliar look to Anne
The floor was indeed scrubbed to a wonderful pitch of purity and so was every article of furniture in the room the stove was polished until she could see her face in it the walls were whitewashed and the window panes sparkled in the sunlight
By the table sat Mr Harrison in his working clothes which on Friday had been noted for sundry rents and tatters but which were now neatly patched and brushed
He was sprucely shaved and what little hair he had was carefully trimmed
Sit down Anne sit down said Mr Harrison in a tone but two degrees removed from that which Avonlea people used at funerals
Emilys gone over to Carmody with Rachel Lynde

shes struck up a lifelong friendship already with Rachel Lynde
Beats all how contrary women are
Well Anne my easy times are over

all over
Its neatness and tidiness for me for the rest of my natural life I suppose
Mr Harrison did his best to speak dolefully but an irrepressible twinkle in his eye betrayed him
Mr Harrison you are glad your wife is come back cried Anne shaking her finger at him
You neednt pretend youre not because I can see it plainly
Mr Harrison relaxed into a sheepish smile
Well

well

Im getting used to it he conceded
I cant say I was sorry to see Emily
A man really needs some protection in a community like this where he cant play a game of checkers with a neighbor without being accused of wanting to marry that neighbors sister and having it put in the paper
Nobody would have supposed you went to see Isabella Andrews if you hadnt pretended to be unmarried said Anne severely
I didnt pretend I was
If anybodyd have asked me if I was married Id have said I was
But they just took it for granted
I wasnt anxious to talk about the matter

I was feeling too sore over it
It would have been nuts for Mrs Rachel Lynde if she had known my wife had left me wouldnt it now
But some people say that you left her
She started it Anne she started it
Im going to tell you the whole story for I dont want you to think worse of me than I deserve

nor of Emily neither
But lets go out on the veranda
Everything is so fearful neat in here that it kind of makes me homesick
I suppose Ill get used to it after awhile but it eases me up to look at the yard
Emily hasnt had time to tidy it up yet
As soon as they were comfortably seated on the veranda Mr Harrison began his tale of woe
I lived in Scottsford New Brunswick before I came here Anne
My sister kept house for me and she suited me fine she was just reasonably tidy and she let me alone and spoiled me

so Emily says
But three years ago she died
Before she died she worried a lot about what was to become of me and finally she got me to promise Id get married
She advised me to take Emily Scott because Emily had money of her own and was a pattern housekeeper
I said says I Emily Scott wouldnt look at me
You ask her and see says my sister and just to ease her mind I promised her I would

and I did
And Emily said shed have me
Never was so surprised in my life Anne

a smart pretty little woman like her and an old fellow like me
I tell you I thought at first I was in luck
Well we were married and took a little wedding trip to St John for a fortnight and then we went home
We got home at ten oclock at night and I give you my word Anne that in half an hour that woman was at work housecleaning
Oh I know youre thinking my house needed it


youve got a very expressive face Anne your thoughts just come out on it like print

but it didnt not that bad
It had got pretty mixed up while I was keeping bachelors hall I admit but Id got a woman to come in and clean it up before I was married and thered been considerable painting and fixing done
I tell you if you took Emily into a brand new white marble palace shed be into the scrubbing as soon as she could get an old dress on
Well she cleaned house till one oclock that night and at four she was up and at it again
And she kept on that way

fars I could see she never stopped
It was scour and sweep and dust everlasting except on Sundays and then she was just longing for Monday to begin again
But it was her way of amusing herself and I could have reconciled myself to it if shed left me alone
But that she wouldnt do
Shed set out to make me over but she hadnt caught me young enough
I wasnt allowed to come into the house unless I changed my boots for slippers at the door
I darsnt smoke a pipe for my life unless I went to the barn
And I didnt use good enough grammar
Emilyd been a schoolteacher in her early life and shed never got over it
Then she hated to see me eating with my knife
Well there it was pick and nag everlasting
But I spose Anne to be fair I was cantankerous too
I didnt try to improve as I might have done

I just got cranky and disagreeable when she found fault
I told her one day she hadnt complained of my grammar when I proposed to her
It wasnt an overly tactful thing to say
A woman would forgive a man for beating her sooner than for hinting she was too much pleased to get him
Well we bickered along like that and it wasnt exactly pleasant but we might have got used to each other after a spell if it hadnt been for Ginger
Ginger was the rock we split on at last
Emily didnt like parrots and she couldnt stand Gingers profane habits of speech
I was attached to the bird for my brother the sailors sake
My brother the sailor was a pet of mine when we were little tads and hed sent Ginger to me when he was dying
I didnt see any sense in getting worked up over his swearing
Theres nothing I hate worsen profanity in a human being but in a parrot thats just repeating what its heard with no more understanding of it than Id have of Chinese allowances might be made
But Emily couldnt see it that way
Women aint logical
She tried to break Ginger of swearing but she hadnt any better success than she had in trying to make me stop saying I seen and them things
Seemed as if the more she tried the worse Ginger got same as me
Well things went on like this both of us getting raspier till the CLIMAX came
Emily invited our minister and his wife to tea and another minister and HIS wife that was visiting them
Id promised to put Ginger away in some safe place where nobody would hear him

Emily wouldnt touch his cage with a tenfoot pole 


and I meant to do it for I didnt want the ministers to hear anything unpleasant in my house
But it slipped my mind

Emily was worrying me so much about clean collars and grammar that it wasnt any wonder

and I never thought of that poor parrot till we sat down to tea
Just as minister number one was in the very middle of saying grace Ginger who was on the veranda outside the dining room window lifted up HIS voice
The gobbler had come into view in the yard and the sight of a gobbler always had an unwholesome effect on Ginger
He surpassed himself that time
You can smile Anne and I dont deny Ive chuckled some over it since myself but at the time I felt almost as much mortified as Emily
I went out and carried Ginger to the barn
I cant say I enjoyed the meal
I knew by the look of Emily that there was trouble brewing for Ginger and James A
When the folks went away I started for the cow pasture and on the way I did some thinking
I felt sorry for Emily and kind of fancied I hadnt been so thoughtful of her as I might and besides I wondered if the ministers would think that Ginger had learned his vocabulary from me
The long and short of it was I decided that Ginger would have to be mercifully disposed of and when Id druv the cows home I went in to tell Emily so
But there was no Emily and there was a letter on the table

just according to the rule in story books
Emily writ that Id have to choose between her and Ginger shed gone back to her own house and there she would stay till I went and told her Id got rid of that parrot
I was all riled up Anne and I said she might stay till doomsday if she waited for that and I stuck to it
I packed up her belongings and sent them after her
It made an awful lot of talk 

Scottsford was pretty near as bad as Avonlea for gossip

and everybody sympathized with Emily
It kept me all cross and cantankerous and I saw Id have to get out or Id never have any peace
I concluded Id come to the Island
Id been here when I was a boy and I liked it but Emily had always said she wouldnt live in a place where folks were scared to walk out after dark for fear theyd fall off the edge
So just to be contrary I moved over here
And thats all there is to it
I hadnt ever heard a word from or about Emily till I come home from the back field Saturday and found her scrubbing the floor but with the first decent dinner Id had since she left me all ready on the table
She told me to eat it first and then wed talk

by which I concluded that Emily had learned some lessons about getting along with a man
So shes here and shes going to stay

seeing that Gingers dead and the Islands some bigger than she thought
Theres Mrs Lynde and her now
No dont go Anne
Stay and get acquainted with Emily
She took quite a notion to you Saturday


wanted to know who that handsome redhaired girl was at the next house
Mrs Harrison welcomed Anne radiantly and insisted on her staying to tea
James A has been telling me all about you and how kind youve been making cakes and things for him she said
I want to get acquainted with all my new neighbors just as soon as possible
Mrs Lynde is a lovely woman isnt she
So friendly
When Anne went home in the sweet June dusk Mrs Harrison went with her across the fields where the fireflies were lighting their starry lamps
I suppose said Mrs Harrison confidentially that James A has told you our story
Yes
Then I neednt tell it for James A is a just man and he would tell the truth
The blame was far from being all on his side
I can see that now
I wasnt back in my own house an hour before I wished I hadnt been so hasty but I wouldnt give in
I see now that I expected too much of a man
And I was real foolish to mind his bad grammar
It doesnt matter if a man does use bad grammar so long as he is a good provider and doesnt go poking round the pantry to see how much sugar youve used in a week
I feel that James A and I are going to be real happy now
I wish I knew who Observer is so that I could thank him
I owe him a real debt of gratitude
Anne kept her own counsel and Mrs Harrison never knew that her gratitude found its way to its object
Anne felt rather bewildered over the farreaching consequences of those foolish notes
They had reconciled a man to his wife and made the reputation of a prophet
Mrs Lynde was in the Green Gables kitchen
She had been telling the whole story to Marilla
Well and how do you like Mrs
Harrison
she asked Anne
Very much
I think shes a real nice little woman
Thats exactly what she is said Mrs Rachel with emphasis and as Ive just been sayin to Marilla I think we ought all to overlook Mr Harrisons peculiarities for her sake and try to make her feel at home here thats what
Well I must get back
Thomasll be wearying for me
I get out a little since Eliza came and hes seemed a lot better these past few days but I never like to be long away from him
I hear Gilbert Blythe has resigned from White Sands
Hell be off to college in the fall I suppose
Mrs Rachel looked sharply at Anne but Anne was bending over a sleepy Davy nodding on the sofa and nothing was to be read in her face
She carried Davy away her oval girlish cheek pressed against his curly yellow head
As they went up the stairs Davy flung a tired arm about Annes neck and gave her a warm hug and a sticky kiss
Youre awful nice Anne
Milty Boulter wrote on his slate today and showed it to Jennie Sloane Roses red and vilets blue Sugars sweet and so are you and that spresses my feelings for you ezackly Anne
XXVI Around the Bend Thomas Lynde faded out of life as quietly and unobtrusively as he had lived it
His wife was a tender patient unwearied nurse
Sometimes Rachel had been a little hard on her Thomas in health when his slowness or meekness had provoked her but when he became ill no voice could be lower no hand more gently skillful no vigil more uncomplaining
Youve been a good wife to me Rachel he once said simply when she was sitting by him in the dusk holding his thin blanched old hand in her workhardened one
A good wife
Im sorry I aint leaving you better off but the children will look after you
Theyre all smart capable children just like their mother
A good mother

a good woman



He had fallen asleep then and the next morning just as the white dawn was creeping up over the pointed firs in the hollow Marilla went softly into the east gable and wakened Anne
Anne Thomas Lynde is gone

their hired boy just brought the word
Im going right down to Rachel
On the day after Thomas Lyndes funeral Marilla went about Green Gables with a strangely preoccupied air
Occasionally she looked at Anne seemed on the point of saying something then shook her head and buttoned up her mouth
After tea she went down to see Mrs Rachel and when she returned she went to the east gable where Anne was correcting school exercises
How is Mrs Lynde tonight
asked the latter
Shes feeling calmer and more composed answered Marilla sitting down on Annes bed

a proceeding which betokened some unusual mental excitement for in Marillas code of household ethics to sit on a bed after it was made up was an unpardonable offense
But shes very lonely
Eliza had to go home today

her son isnt well and she felt she couldnt stay any longer
When Ive finished these exercises Ill run down and chat awhile with Mrs Lynde said Anne
I had intended to study some Latin composition tonight but it can wait
I suppose Gilbert Blythe is going to college in the fall said Marilla jerkily
How would you like to go too Anne
Anne looked up in astonishment
I would like it of course Marilla
But it isnt possible
I guess it can be made possible
Ive always felt that you should go
Ive never felt easy to think you were giving it all up on my account
But Marilla Ive never been sorry for a moment that I stayed home
Ive been so happy

Oh these past two years have just been delightful
Oh yes I know youve been contented enough
But that isnt the question exactly
You ought to go on with your education
Youve saved enough to put you through one year at Redmond and the money the stock brought in will do for another year

and theres scholarships and things you might win
Yes but I cant go Marilla
Your eyes are better of course but I cant leave you alone with the twins
They need so much looking after
I wont be alone with them
Thats what I meant to discuss with you
I had a long talk with Rachel tonight
Anne shes feeling dreadful bad over a good many things
Shes not left very well off
It seems they mortgaged the farm eight years ago to give the youngest boy a start when he went west and theyve never been able to pay much more than the interest since
And then of course Thomas illness has cost a good deal one way or another
The farm will have to be sold and Rachel thinks therell be hardly anything left after the bills are settled
She says shell have to go and live with Eliza and its breaking her heart to think of leaving Avonlea
A woman of her age doesnt make new friends and interests easy
And Anne as she talked about it the thought came to me that I would ask her to come and live with me but I thought I ought to talk it over with you first before I said anything to her
If I had Rachel living with me you could go to college
How do you feel about it
I feel

as if

somebody

had handed me

the moon

and I didnt know

exactly

what to do

with it said Anne dazedly
But as for asking Mrs Lynde to come here that is for you to decide Marilla
Do you think

are you sure

you would like it
Mrs Lynde is a good woman and a kind neighbor but

but


But shes got her faults you mean to say
Well she has of course but I think Id rather put up with far worse faults than see Rachel go away from Avonlea
Id miss her terrible
Shes the only close friend Ive got here and Id be lost without her
Weve been neighbors for fortyfive years and weve never had a quarrel

though we came rather near it that time you flew at Mrs Rachel for calling you homely and redhaired
Do you remember Anne
I should think I do said Anne ruefully
People dont forget things like that
How I hated poor Mrs Rachel at that moment
And then that apology you made her
Well you were a handful in all conscience Anne
I did feel so puzzled and bewildered how to manage you
Matthew understood you better
Matthew understood everything said Anne softly as she always spoke of him
Well I think it could be managed so that Rachel and I wouldnt clash at all
It always seemed to me that the reason two women cant get along in one house is that they try to share the same kitchen and get in each others way
Now if Rachel came here she could have the north gable for her bedroom and the spare room for a kitchen as well as not for we dont really need a spare room at all
She could put her stove there and what furniture she wanted to keep and be real comfortable and independent
Shell have enough to live on of courseher childrenll see to thatso all Id be giving her would be house room
Yes Anne far as Im concerned Id like it
Then ask her said Anne promptly
Id be very sorry myself to see Mrs Rachel go away
And if she comes continued Marilla You can go to college as well as not
Shell be company for me and shell do for the twins what I cant do so theres no reason in the world why you shouldnt go
Anne had a long meditation at her window that night
Joy and regret struggled together in her heart
She had come at last

suddenly and unexpectedly

to the bend in the road and college was around it with a hundred rainbow hopes and visions but Anne realized as well that when she rounded that curve she must leave many sweet things behind


all the little simple duties and interests which had grown so dear to her in the last two years and which she had glorified into beauty and delight by the enthusiasm she had put into them
She must give up her school


and she loved every one of her pupils even the stupid and naughty ones
The mere thought of Paul Irving made her wonder if Redmond were such a name to conjure with after all
Ive put out a lot of little roots these two years Anne told the moon and when Im pulled up theyre going to hurt a great deal
But its best to go I think and as Marilla says theres no good reason why I shouldnt
I must get out all my ambitions and dust them
Anne sent in her resignation the next day and Mrs Rachel after a heart to heart talk with Marilla gratefully accepted the offer of a home at Green Gables
She elected to remain in her own house for the summer however the farm was not to be sold until the fall and there were many arrangements to be made
I certainly never thought of living as far off the road as Green Gables sighed Mrs Rachel to herself
But really Green Gables doesnt seem as out of the world as it used to do

Anne has lots of company and the twins make it real lively
And anyhow Id rather live at the bottom of a well than leave Avonlea
These two decisions being noised abroad speedily ousted the arrival of Mrs Harrison in popular gossip
Sage heads were shaken over Marilla Cuthberts rash step in asking Mrs Rachel to live with her
People opined that they wouldnt get on together
They were both too fond of their own way and many doleful predictions were made none of which disturbed the parties in question at all
They had come to a clear and distinct understanding of the respective duties and rights of their new arrangements and meant to abide by them
I wont meddle with you nor you with me Mrs Rachel had said decidedly and as for the twins Ill be glad to do all I can for them but I wont undertake to answer Davys questions thats what
Im not an encyclopedia neither am I a Philadelphia lawyer
Youll miss Anne for that
Sometimes Annes answers were about as queer as Davys questions said Marilla drily
The twins will miss her and no mistake but her future cant be sacrificed to Davys thirst for information
When he asks questions I cant answer Ill just tell him children should be seen and not heard
That was how I was brought up and I dont know but what it was just as good a way as all these newfangled notions for training children
Well Annes methods seem to have worked fairly well with Davy said Mrs Lynde smilingly
He is a reformed character thats what
He isnt a bad little soul conceded Marilla
I never expected to get as fond of those children as I have
Davy gets round you somehow 

and Dora is a lovely child although she is

kind of

well kind of


Monotonous
Exactly supplied Mrs Rachel
Like a book where every page is the same thats what
Dora will make a good reliable woman but shell never set the pond on fire
Well that sort of folks are comfortable to have round even if theyre not as interesting as the other kind
Gilbert Blythe was probably the only person to whom the news of Annes resignation brought unmixed pleasure
Her pupils looked upon it as a sheer catastrophe
Annetta Bell had hysterics when she went home
Anthony Pye fought two pitched and unprovoked battles with other boys by way of relieving his feelings
Barbara Shaw cried all night
Paul Irving defiantly told his grandmother that she neednt expect him to eat any porridge for a week
I cant do it Grandma he said
I dont really know if I can eat ANYTHING
I feel as if there was a dreadful lump in my throat
Id have cried coming home from school if Jake Donnell hadnt been watching me
I believe I will cry after I go to bed
It wouldnt show on my eyes tomorrow would it
And it would be such a relief
But anyway I cant eat porridge
Im going to need all my strength of mind to bear up against this Grandma and I wont have any left to grapple with porridge
Oh Grandma I dont know what Ill do when my beautiful teacher goes away
Milty Boulter says he bets Jane Andrews will get the school
I suppose Miss Andrews is very nice
But I know she wont understand things like Miss Shirley
Diana also took a very pessimistic view of affairs
It will be horribly lonesome here next winter she mourned one twilight when the moonlight was raining airy silver through the cherry boughs and filling the east gable with a soft dreamlike radiance in which the two girls sat and talked Anne on her low rocker by the window Diana sitting Turkfashion on the bed
You and Gilbert will be gone 

and the Allans too
They are going to call Mr Allan to Charlottetown and of course hell accept
Its too mean
Well be vacant all winter I suppose and have to listen to a long string of candidates

and half of them wont be any good
I hope they wont call Mr Baxter from East Grafton here anyhow said Anne decidedly
He wants the call but he does preach such gloomy sermons
Mr Bell says hes a minister of the old school but Mrs Lynde says theres nothing whatever the matter with him but indigestion
His wife isnt a very good cook it seems and Mrs Lynde says that when a man has to eat sour bread two weeks out of three his theology is bound to get a kink in it somewhere
Mrs Allan feels very badly about going away
She says everybody has been so kind to her since she came here as a bride that she feels as if she were leaving lifelong friends
And then theres the babys grave you know
She says she doesnt see how she can go away and leave that

it was such a little mite of a thing and only three months old and she says she is afraid it will miss its mother although she knows better and wouldnt say so to Mr Allan for anything
She says she has slipped through the birch grove back of the manse nearly every night to the graveyard and sung a little lullaby to it
She told me all about it last evening when I was up putting some of those early wild roses on Matthews grave
I promised her that as long as I was in Avonlea I would put flowers on the babys grave and when I was away I felt sure that


That I would do it supplied Diana heartily
Of course I will
And Ill put them on Matthews grave too for your sake Anne
Oh thank you
I meant to ask you to if you would
And on little Hester Grays too
Please dont forget hers
Do you know Ive thought and dreamed so much about little Hester Gray that she has become strangely real to me
I think of her back there in her little garden in that cool still green corner and I have a fancy that if I could steal back there some spring evening just at the magic time twixt light and dark and tiptoe so softly up the beech hill that my footsteps could not frighten her I would find the garden just as it used to be all sweet with June lilies and early roses with the tiny house beyond it all hung with vines and little Hester Gray would be there with her soft eyes and the wind ruffling her dark hair wandering about putting her fingertips under the chins of the lilies and whispering secrets with the roses and I would go forward oh so softly and hold out my hands and say to her Little Hester Gray wont you let me be your playmate for I love the roses too
And we would sit down on the old bench and talk a little and dream a little or just be beautifully silent together
And then the moon would rise and I would look around me 

and there would be no Hester Gray and no little vinehung house and no roses

only an old waste garden starred with June lilies amid the grasses and the wind sighing oh so sorrowfully in the cherry trees
And I would not know whether it had been real or if I had just imagined it all
Diana crawled up and got her back against the headboard of the bed
When your companion of twilight hour said such spooky things it was just as well not to be able to fancy there was anything behind you
Im afraid the Improvement Society will go down when you and Gilbert are both gone she remarked dolefully
Not a bit of fear of it said Anne briskly coming back from dreamland to the affairs of practical life
It is too firmly established for that especially since the older people are becoming so enthusiastic about it
Look what they are doing this summer for their lawns and lanes
Besides Ill be watching for hints at Redmond and Ill write a paper for it next winter and send it over
Dont take such a gloomy view of things Diana
And dont grudge me my little hour of gladness and jubilation now
Later on when I have to go away Ill feel anything but glad
Its all right for you to be glad

youre going to college and youll have a jolly time and make heaps of lovely new friends
I hope I shall make new friends said Anne thoughtfully
The possibilities of making new friends help to make life very fascinating
But no matter how many friends I make theyll never be as dear to me as the old ones

especially a certain girl with black eyes and dimples
Can you guess who she is Diana
But therell be so many clever girls at Redmond sighed Diana and Im only a stupid little country girl who says I seen sometimes

though I really know better when I stop to think
Well of course these past two years have really been too pleasant to last
I know SOMEBODY who is glad you are going to Redmond anyhow
Anne Im going to ask you a question

a serious question
Dont be vexed and do answer seriously
Do you care anything for Gilbert
Ever so much as a friend and not a bit in the way you mean said Anne calmly and decidedly she also thought she was speaking sincerely
Diana sighed
She wished somehow that Anne had answered differently
Dont you mean EVER to be married Anne
Perhaps

some day

when I meet the right one said Anne smiling dreamily up at the moonlight
But how can you be sure when you do meet the right one
persisted Diana
Oh I should know him

SOMETHING would tell me
You know what my ideal is Diana
But peoples ideals change sometimes
Mine wont
And I COULDNT care for any man who didnt fulfill it
What if you never meet him
Then I shall die an old maid was the cheerful response
I daresay it isnt the hardest death by any means
Oh I suppose the dying would be easy enough its the living an old maid I shouldnt like said Diana with no intention of being humorous
Although I wouldnt mind being an old maid VERY much if I could be one like Miss Lavendar
But I never could be
When Im fortyfive Ill be horribly fat
And while there might be some romance about a thin old maid there couldnt possibly be any about a fat one
Oh mind you Nelson Atkins proposed to Ruby Gillis three weeks ago
Ruby told me all about it
She says she never had any intention of taking him because any one who married him will have to go in with the old folks but Ruby says that he made such a perfectly beautiful and romantic proposal that it simply swept her off her feet
But she didnt want to do anything rash so she asked for a week to consider and two days later she was at a meeting of the Sewing Circle at his mothers and there was a book called The Complete Guide to Etiquette lying on the parlor table
Ruby said she simply couldnt describe her feelings when in a section of it headed The Deportment of Courtship and Marriage she found the very proposal Nelson had made word for word
She went home and wrote him a perfectly scathing refusal and she says his father and mother have taken turns watching him ever since for fear hell drown himself in the river but Ruby says they neednt be afraid for in the Deportment of Courtship and Marriage it told how a rejected lover should behave and theres nothing about drowning in THAT
And she says Wilbur Blair is literally pining away for her but shes perfectly helpless in the matter
Anne made an impatient movement
I hate to say it

it seems so disloyal

but well I dont like Ruby Gillis now
I liked her when we went to school and Queens together

though not so well as you and Jane of course
But this last year at Carmody she seems so different

so

so


I know nodded Diana
Its the Gillis coming out in her


she cant help it
Mrs Lynde says that if ever a Gillis girl thought about anything but the boys she never showed it in her walk and conversation
She talks about nothing but boys and what compliments they pay her and how crazy they all are about her at Carmody
And the strange thing is they ARE too


Diana admitted this somewhat resentfully
Last night when I saw her in Mr Blairs store she whispered to me that shed just made a new mash
I wouldnt ask her who it was because I knew she was dying to BE asked
Well its what Ruby always wanted I suppose
You remember even when she was little she always said she meant to have dozens of beaus when she grew up and have the very gayest time she could before she settled down
Shes so different from Jane isnt she
Jane is such a nice sensible ladylike girl
Dear old Jane is a jewel agreed Anne but she added leaning forward to bestow a tender pat on the plump dimpled little hand hanging over her pillow theres nobody like my own Diana after all
Do you remember that evening we first met Diana and swore eternal friendship in your garden
Weve kept that oath I think

weve never had a quarrel nor even a coolness
I shall never forget the thrill that went over me the day you told me you loved me
I had had such a lonely starved heart all through my childhood
Im just beginning to realize how starved and lonely it really was
Nobody cared anything for me or wanted to be bothered with me
I should have been miserable if it hadnt been for that strange little dreamlife of mine wherein I imagined all the friends and love I craved
But when I came to Green Gables everything was changed
And then I met you
You dont know what your friendship meant to me
I want to thank you here and now dear for the warm and true affection youve always given me
And always always will sobbed Diana
I shall NEVER love anybody 

any GIRL

half as well as I love you
And if I ever do marry and have a little girl of my own Im going to name her ANNE
XXVII An Afternoon at the Stone House Where are you going all dressed up Anne
Davy wanted to know
You look bully in that dress
Anne had come down to dinner in a new dress of pale green muslin 

the first color she had worn since Matthews death
It became her perfectly bringing out all the delicate flowerlike tints of her face and the gloss and burnish of her hair
Davy how many times have I told you that you mustnt use that word she rebuked
Im going to Echo Lodge
Take me with you entreated Davy
I would if I were driving
But Im going to walk and its too far for your eightyearold legs
Besides Paul is going with me and I fear you dont enjoy yourself in his company
Oh I like Paul lots bettern I did said Davy beginning to make fearful inroads into his pudding
Since Ive got pretty good myself I dont mind his being gooder so much
If I can keep on Ill catch up with him some day both in legs and goodness
Sides Pauls real nice to us second primer boys in school
He wont let the other big boys meddle with us and he shows us lots of games
How came Paul to fall into the brook at noon hour yesterday
asked Anne
I met him on the playground such a dripping figure that I sent him promptly home for clothes without waiting to find out what had happened
Well it was partly a zacksident explained Davy
He stuck his head in on purpose but the rest of him fell in zacksidentally
We was all down at the brook and Prillie Rogerson got mad at Paul about something

shes awful mean and horrid anyway if she IS pretty

and said that his grandmother put his hair up in curl rags every night
Paul wouldnt have minded what she said I guess but Gracie Andrews laughed and Paul got awful red cause Gracies his girl you know
Hes CLEAN GONE on her

brings her flowers and carries her books as far as the shore road
He got as red as a beet and said his grandmother didnt do any such thing and his hair was born curly
And then he laid down on the bank and stuck his head right into the spring to show them
Oh it wasnt the spring we drink out of


seeing a horrified look on Marillas face


it was the little one lower down
But the banks awful slippy and Paul went right in
I tell you he made a bully splash
Oh Anne Anne I didnt mean to say that

it just slipped out before I thought
He made a SPLENDID splash
But he looked so funny when he crawled out all wet and muddy
The girls laughed moren ever but Gracie didnt laugh
She looked sorry
Gracies a nice girl but shes got a snub nose
When I get big enough to have a girl I wont have one with a snub nose

Ill pick one with a pretty nose like yours Anne
A boy who makes such a mess of syrup all over his face when he is eating his pudding will never get a girl to look at him said Marilla severely
But Ill wash my face before I go courting protested Davy trying to improve matters by rubbing the back of his hand over the smears
And Ill wash behind my ears too without being told
I remembered to this morning Marilla
I dont forget half as often as I did
But


and Davy sighed


theres so many corners about a fellow that its awful hard to remember them all
Well if I cant go to Miss Lavendars Ill go over and see Mrs Harrison
Mrs Harrisons an awful nice woman I tell you
She keeps a jar of cookies in her pantry apurpose for little boys and she always gives me the scrapings out of a pan shes mixed up a plum cake in
A good many plums stick to the sides you see
Mr Harrison was always a nice man but hes twice as nice since he got married over again
I guess getting married makes folks nicer
Why dont YOU get married Marilla
I want to know
Marillas state of single blessedness had never been a sore point with her so she answered amiably with an exchange of significant looks with Anne that she supposed it was because nobody would have her
But maybe you never asked anybody to have you protested Davy
Oh Davy said Dora primly shocked into speaking without being spoken to its the MEN that have to do the asking
I dont know why they have to do it ALWAYS grumbled Davy
Seems to me everythings put on the men in this world
Can I have some more pudding Marilla
Youve had as much as was good for you said Marilla but she gave him a moderate second helping
I wish people could live on pudding
Why cant they Marilla
I want to know
Because theyd soon get tired of it
Id like to try that for myself said skeptical Davy
But I guess its better to have pudding only on fish and company days than none at all
They never have any at Milty Boulters
Milty says when company comes his mother gives them cheese and cuts it herself

one little bit apiece and one over for manners
If Milty Boulter talks like that about his mother at least you neednt repeat it said Marilla severely
Bless my soul

Davy had picked this expression up from Mr Harrison and used it with great gusto


Milty meant it as a compelment
Hes awful proud of his mother cause folks say she could scratch a living on a rock
I 
I suppose them pesky hens are in my pansy bed again said Marilla rising and going out hurriedly
The slandered hens were nowhere near the pansy bed and Marilla did not even glance at it
Instead she sat down on the cellar hatch and laughed until she was ashamed of herself
When Anne and Paul reached the stone house that afternoon they found Miss Lavendar and Charlotta the Fourth in the garden weeding raking clipping and trimming as if for dear life
Miss Lavendar herself all gay and sweet in the frills and laces she loved dropped her shears and ran joyously to meet her guests while Charlotta the Fourth grinned cheerfully
Welcome Anne
I thought youd come today
You belong to the afternoon so it brought you
Things that belong together are sure to come together
What a lot of trouble that would save some people if they only knew it
But they dont

and so they waste beautiful energy moving heaven and earth to bring things together that DONT belong
And you Paul

why youve grown
Youre half a head taller than when you were here before
Yes Ive begun to grow like pigweed in the night as Mrs Lynde says said Paul in frank delight over the fact
Grandma says its the porridge taking effect at last
Perhaps it is
Goodness knows


Paul sighed deeply


Ive eaten enough to make anyone grow
I do hope now that Ive begun Ill keep on till Im as tall as father
He is six feet you know Miss Lavendar
Yes Miss Lavendar did know the flush on her pretty cheeks deepened a little she took Pauls hand on one side and Annes on the other and walked to the house in silence
Is it a good day for the echoes Miss Lavendar
queried Paul anxiously
The day of his first visit had been too windy for echoes and Paul had been much disappointed
Yes just the best kind of a day answered Miss Lavendar rousing herself from her reverie
But first we are all going to have something to eat
I know you two folks didnt walk all the way back here through those beechwoods without getting hungry and Charlotta the Fourth and I can eat any hour of the day

we have such obliging appetites
So well just make a raid on the pantry
Fortunately its lovely and full
I had a presentiment that I was going to have company today and Charlotta the Fourth and I prepared
I think you are one of the people who always have nice things in their pantry declared Paul
Grandmas like that too
But she doesnt approve of snacks between meals
I wonder he added meditatively if I OUGHT to eat them away from home when I know she doesnt approve
Oh I dont think she would disapprove after you have had a long walk
That makes a difference said Miss Lavendar exchanging amused glances with Anne over Pauls brown curls
I suppose that snacks ARE extremely unwholesome
That is why we have them so often at Echo Lodge
We

Charlotta the Fourth and I 
live in defiance of every known law of diet
We eat all sorts of indigestible things whenever we happen to think of it by day or night and we flourish like green bay trees
We are always intending to reform
When we read any article in a paper warning us against something we like we cut it out and pin it up on the kitchen wall so that well remember it
But we never can somehow 

until after weve gone and eaten that very thing
Nothing has ever killed us yet but Charlotta the Fourth has been known to have bad dreams after we had eaten doughnuts and mince pie and fruit cake before we went to bed
Grandma lets me have a glass of milk and a slice of bread and butter before I go to bed and on Sunday nights she puts jam on the bread said Paul
So Im always glad when its Sunday night


for more reasons than one
Sunday is a very long day on the shore road
Grandma says its all too short for her and that father never found Sundays tiresome when he was a little boy
It wouldnt seem so long if I could talk to my rock people but I never do that because Grandma doesnt approve of it on Sundays
I think a good deal but Im afraid my thoughts are worldly
Grandma says we should never think anything but religious thoughts on Sundays
But teacher here said once that every really beautiful thought was religious no matter what it was about or what day we thought it on
But I feel sure Grandma thinks that sermons and Sunday School lessons are the only things you can think truly religious thoughts about
And when it comes to a difference of opinion between Grandma and teacher I dont know what to do
In my heart


Paul laid his hand on his breast and raised very serious blue eyes to Miss Lavendars immediately sympathetic face


I agree with teacher
But then you see Grandma has brought father up HER way and made a brilliant success of him and teacher has never brought anybody up yet though shes helping with Davy and Dora
But you cant tell how theyll turn out till they ARE grown up
So sometimes I feel as if it might be safer to go by Grandmas opinions
I think it would agreed Anne solemnly
Anyway I daresay that if your Grandma and I both got down to what we really do mean under our different ways of expressing it wed find out we both meant much the same thing
Youd better go by her way of expressing it since its been the result of experience
Well have to wait until we see how the twins do turn out before we can be sure that my way is equally good
After lunch they went back to the garden where Paul made the acquaintance of the echoes to his wonder and delight while Anne and Miss Lavendar sat on the stone bench under the poplar and talked
So you are going away in the fall
said Miss Lavendar wistfully
I ought to be glad for your sake Anne

but Im horribly selfishly sorry
I shall miss you so much
Oh sometimes I think it is of no use to make friends
They only go out of your life after awhile and leave a hurt that is worse than the emptiness before they came
That sounds like something Miss Eliza Andrews might say but never Miss Lavendar said Anne
NOTHING is worse than emptiness

and Im not going out of your life
There are such things as letters and vacations
Dearest Im afraid youre looking a little pale and tired
Oh

hoo

hoo

hoo went Paul on the dyke where he had been making noises diligently

not all of them melodious in the making but all coming back transmuted into the very gold and silver of sound by the fairy alchemists over the river
Miss Lavendar made an impatient movement with her pretty hands
Im just tired of everything

even of the echoes
There is nothing in my life but echoes

echoes of lost hopes and dreams and joys
Theyre beautiful and mocking
Oh Anne its horrid of me to talk like this when I have company
Its just that Im getting old and it doesnt agree with me
I know Ill be fearfully cranky by the time Im sixty
But perhaps all I need is a course of blue pills
At this moment Charlotta the Fourth who had disappeared after lunch returned and announced that the northeast corner of Mr John Kimballs pasture was red with early strawberries and wouldnt Miss Shirley like to go and pick some
Early strawberries for tea
exclaimed Miss Lavendar
Oh Im not so old as I thought

and I dont need a single blue pill
Girls when you come back with your strawberries well have tea out here under the silver poplar
Ill have it all ready for you with homegrown cream
Anne and Charlotta the Fourth accordingly betook themselves back to Mr Kimballs pasture a green remote place where the air was as soft as velvet and fragrant as a bed of violets and golden as amber
Oh isnt it sweet and fresh back here
breathed Anne
I just feel as if I were drinking in the sunshine
Yes maam so do I
Thats just exactly how I feel too maam agreed Charlotta the Fourth who would have said precisely the same thing if Anne had remarked that she felt like a pelican of the wilderness
Always after Anne had visited Echo Lodge Charlotta the Fourth mounted to her little room over the kitchen and tried before her looking glass to speak and look and move like Anne
Charlotta could never flatter herself that she quite succeeded but practice makes perfect as Charlotta had learned at school and she fondly hoped that in time she might catch the trick of that dainty uplift of chin that quick starry outflashing of eyes that fashion of walking as if you were a bough swaying in the wind
It seemed so easy when you watched Anne
Charlotta the Fourth admired Anne wholeheartedly
It was not that she thought her so very handsome
Diana Barrys beauty of crimson cheek and black curls was much more to Charlotta the Fourths taste than Annes moonshine charm of luminous gray eyes and the pale everchanging roses of her cheeks
But Id rather look like you than be pretty she told Anne sincerely
Anne laughed sipped the honey from the tribute and cast away the sting
She was used to taking her compliments mixed
Public opinion never agreed on Annes looks
People who had heard her called handsome met her and were disappointed
People who had heard her called plain saw her and wondered where other peoples eyes were
Anne herself would never believe that she had any claim to beauty
When she looked in the glass all she saw was a little pale face with seven freckles on the nose thereof
Her mirror never revealed to her the elusive evervarying play of feeling that came and went over her features like a rosy illuminating flame or the charm of dream and laughter alternating in her big eyes
While Anne was not beautiful in any strictly defined sense of the word she possessed a certain evasive charm and distinction of appearance that left beholders with a pleasurable sense of satisfaction in that softly rounded girlhood of hers with all its strongly felt potentialities
Those who knew Anne best felt without realizing that they felt it that her greatest attraction was the aura of possibility surrounding her

the power of future development that was in her
She seemed to walk in an atmosphere of things about to happen
As they picked Charlotta the Fourth confided to Anne her fears regarding Miss Lavendar
The warmhearted little handmaiden was honestly worried over her adored mistress condition
Miss Lavendar isnt well Miss Shirley maam
Im sure she isnt though she never complains
She hasnt seemed like herself this long while maam

not since that day you and Paul were here together before
I feel sure she caught cold that night maam
After you and him had gone she went out and walked in the garden for long after dark with nothing but a little shawl on her
There was a lot of snow on the walks and I feel sure she got a chill maam
Ever since then Ive noticed her acting tired and lonesome like
She dont seem to take an interest in anything maam
She never pretends companys coming nor fixes up for it nor nothing maam
Its only when you come she seems to chirk up a bit
And the worst sign of all Miss Shirley maam


Charlotta the Fourth lowered her voice as if she were about to tell some exceedingly weird and awful symptom indeed


is that she never gets cross now when I breaks things
Why Miss Shirley maam yesterday I bruk her green and yaller bowl thats always stood on the bookcase
Her grandmother brought it out from England and Miss Lavendar was awful choice of it
I was dusting it just as careful Miss Shirley maam and it slipped out so fashion afore I could grab holt of it and bruk into about forty millyun pieces
I tell you I was sorry and scared
I thought Miss Lavendar would scold me awful maam and Id ruther she had than take it the way she did
She just come in and hardly looked at it and said Its no matter Charlotta
Take up the pieces and throw them away
Just like that Miss Shirley maam

take up the pieces and throw them away as if it wasnt her grandmothers bowl from England
Oh she isnt well and I feel awful bad about it
Shes got nobody to look after her but me
Charlotta the Fourths eyes brimmed up with tears
Anne patted the little brown paw holding the cracked pink cup sympathetically
I think Miss Lavendar needs a change Charlotta
She stays here alone too much
Cant we induce her to go away for a little trip
Charlotta shook her head with its rampant bows disconsolately
I dont think so Miss Shirley maam
Miss Lavendar hates visiting
Shes only got three relations she ever visits and she says she just goes to see them as a family duty
Last time when she come home she said she wasnt going to visit for family duty no more
Ive come home in love with loneliness Charlotta she says to me and I never want to stray from my own vine and fig tree again
My relations try so hard to make an old lady of me and it has a bad effect on me
Just like that Miss Shirley maam
It has a very bad effect on me
So I dont think it would do any good to coax her to go visiting
We must see what can be done said Anne decidedly as she put the last possible berry in her pink cup
Just as soon as I have my vacation Ill come through and spend a whole week with you
Well have a picnic every day and pretend all sorts of interesting things and see if we cant cheer Miss Lavendar up
That will be the very thing Miss Shirley maam exclaimed Charlotta the Fourth in rapture
She was glad for Miss Lavendars sake and for her own too
With a whole week in which to study Anne constantly she would surely be able to learn how to move and behave like her
When the girls got back to Echo Lodge they found that Miss Lavendar and Paul had carried the little square table out of the kitchen to the garden and had everything ready for tea
Nothing ever tasted so delicious as those strawberries and cream eaten under a great blue sky all curdled over with fluffy little white clouds and in the long shadows of the wood with its lispings and its murmurings
After tea Anne helped Charlotta wash the dishes in the kitchen while Miss Lavendar sat on the stone bench with Paul and heard all about his rock people
She was a good listener this sweet Miss Lavendar but just at the last it struck Paul that she had suddenly lost interest in the Twin Sailors
Miss Lavendar why do you look at me like that
he asked gravely
How do I look Paul
Just as if you were looking through me at somebody I put you in mind of said Paul who had such occasional flashes of uncanny insight that it wasnt quite safe to have secrets when he was about
You do put me in mind of somebody I knew long ago said Miss Lavendar dreamily
When you were young
Yes when I was young
Do I seem very old to you Paul
Do you know I cant make up my mind about that said Paul confidentially
Your hair looks old

I never knew a young person with white hair
But your eyes are as young as my beautiful teachers when you laugh
I tell you what Miss Lavendar


Pauls voice and face were as solemn as a judges


I think you would make a splendid mother
You have just the right look in your eyes


the look my little mother always had
I think its a pity you havent any boys of your own
I have a little dream boy Paul
Oh have you really
How old is he
About your age I think
He ought to be older because I dreamed him long before you were born
But Ill never let him get any older than eleven or twelve because if I did some day he might grow up altogether and then Id lose him
I know nodded Paul
Thats the beauty of dreampeople

they stay any age you want them
You and my beautiful teacher and me myself are the only folks in the world that I know of that have dreampeople
Isnt it funny and nice we should all know each other
But I guess that kind of people always find each other out
Grandma never has dreampeople and Mary Joe thinks Im wrong in the upper story because I have them
But I think its splendid to have them
YOU know Miss Lavendar
Tell me all about your little dreamboy
He has blue eyes and curly hair
He steals in and wakens me with a kiss every morning
Then all day he plays here in the garden


and I play with him
Such games as we have
We run races and talk with the echoes and I tell him stories
And when twilight comes


I know interrupted Paul eagerly
He comes and sits beside you


SO

because of course at twelve hed be too big to climb into your lap 

and lays his head on your shoulder

SO

and you put your arms about him and hold him tight tight and rest your cheek on his head


yes thats the very way
Oh you DO know Miss Lavendar
Anne found the two of them there when she came out of the stone house and something in Miss Lavendars face made her hate to disturb them
Im afraid we must go Paul if we want to get home before dark
Miss Lavendar Im going to invite myself to Echo Lodge for a whole week pretty soon
If you come for a week Ill keep you for two threatened Miss Lavendar
XXVIII The Prince Comes Back to the Enchanted Palace The last day of school came and went
A triumphant semiannual examination was held and Annes pupils acquitted themselves splendidly
At the close they gave her an address and a writing desk
All the girls and ladies present cried and some of the boys had it cast up to them later on that they cried too although they always denied it
Mrs Harmon Andrews Mrs Peter Sloane and Mrs William Bell walked home together and talked things over
I do think it is such a pity Anne is leaving when the children seem so much attached to her sighed Mrs Peter Sloane who had a habit of sighing over everything and even finished off her jokes that way
To be sure she added hastily we all know well have a good teacher next year too
Jane will do her duty Ive no doubt said Mrs Andrews rather stiffly
I dont suppose shell tell the children quite so many fairy tales or spend so much time roaming about the woods with them
But she has her name on the Inspectors Roll of Honor and the Newbridge people are in a terrible state over her leaving
Im real glad Anne is going to college said Mrs Bell
She has always wanted it and it will be a splendid thing for her
Well I dont know
Mrs Andrews was determined not to agree fully with anybody that day
I dont see that Anne needs any more education
Shell probably be marrying Gilbert Blythe if his infatuation for her lasts till he gets through college and what good will Latin and Greek do her then
If they taught you at college how to manage a man there might be some sense in her going
Mrs Harmon Andrews so Avonlea gossip whispered had never learned how to manage her man and as a result the Andrews household was not exactly a model of domestic happiness
I see that the Charlottetown call to Mr Allan is up before the Presbytery said Mrs Bell
That means well be losing him soon I suppose
Theyre not going before September said Mrs Sloane
It will be a great loss to the community

though I always did think that Mrs Allan dressed rather too gay for a ministers wife
But we are none of us perfect
Did you notice how neat and snug Mr Harrison looked today
I never saw such a changed man
He goes to church every Sunday and has subscribed to the salary
Hasnt that Paul Irving grown to be a big boy
said Mrs Andrews
He was such a mite for his age when he came here
I declare I hardly knew him today
Hes getting to look a lot like his father
Hes a smart boy said Mrs Bell
Hes smart enough but

Mrs
Andrews lowered her voice


I believe he tells queer stories
Gracie came home from school one day last week with the greatest rigmarole he had told her about people who lived down at the shore

stories there couldnt be a word of truth in you know
I told Gracie not to believe them and she said Paul didnt intend her to
But if he didnt what did he tell them to her for
Anne says Paul is a genius said Mrs Sloane
He may be
You never know what to expect of them Americans said Mrs Andrews
Mrs Andrews only acquaintance with the word genius was derived from the colloquial fashion of calling any eccentric individual a queer genius
She probably thought with Mary Joe that it meant a person with something wrong in his upper story
Back in the schoolroom Anne was sitting alone at her desk as she had sat on the first day of school two years before her face leaning on her hand her dewy eyes looking wistfully out of the window to the Lake of Shining Waters
Her heart was so wrung over the parting with her pupils that for a moment college had lost all its charm
She still felt the clasp of Annetta Bells arms about her neck and heard the childish wail Ill NEVER love any teacher as much as you Miss Shirley never never
For two years she had worked earnestly and faithfully making many mistakes and learning from them
She had had her reward
She had taught her scholars something but she felt that they had taught her much more

lessons of tenderness selfcontrol innocent wisdom lore of childish hearts
Perhaps she had not succeeded in inspiring any wonderful ambitions in her pupils but she had taught them more by her own sweet personality than by all her careful precepts that it was good and necessary in the years that were before them to live their lives finely and graciously holding fast to truth and courtesy and kindness keeping aloof from all that savored of falsehood and meanness and vulgarity
They were perhaps all unconscious of having learned such lessons but they would remember and practice them long after they had forgotten the capital of Afghanistan and the dates of the Wars of the Roses
Another chapter in my life is closed said Anne aloud as she locked her desk
She really felt very sad over it but the romance in the idea of that closed chapter did comfort her a little
Anne spent a fortnight at Echo Lodge early in her vacation and everybody concerned had a good time
She took Miss Lavendar on a shopping expedition to town and persuaded her to buy a new organdy dress then came the excitement of cutting and making it together while the happy Charlotta the Fourth basted and swept up clippings
Miss Lavendar had complained that she could not feel much interest in anything but the sparkle came back to her eyes over her pretty dress
What a foolish frivolous person I must be she sighed
Im wholesomely ashamed to think that a new dress


even it is a forgetmenot organdy

should exhilarate me so when a good conscience and an extra contribution to Foreign Missions couldnt do it
Midway in her visit Anne went home to Green Gables for a day to mend the twins stockings and settle up Davys accumulated store of questions
In the evening she went down to the shore road to see Paul Irving
As she passed by the low square window of the Irving sitting room she caught a glimpse of Paul on somebodys lap but the next moment he came flying through the hall
Oh Miss Shirley he cried excitedly you cant think what has happened
Something so splendid
Father is here


just think of that
Father is here
Come right in
Father this is my beautiful teacher
YOU know father
Stephen Irving came forward to meet Anne with a smile
He was a tall handsome man of middle age with irongray hair deepset dark blue eyes and a strong sad face splendidly modeled about chin and brow
Just the face for a hero of romance Anne thought with a thrill of intense satisfaction
It was so disappointing to meet someone who ought to be a hero and find him bald or stooped or otherwise lacking in manly beauty
Anne would have thought it dreadful if the object of Miss Lavendars romance had not looked the part
So this is my little sons beautiful teacher of whom I have heard so much said Mr Irving with a hearty handshake
Pauls letters have been so full of you Miss Shirley that I feel as if I were pretty well acquainted with you already
I want to thank you for what you have done for Paul
I think that your influence has been just what he needed
Mother is one of the best and dearest of women but her robust matteroffact Scotch common sense could not always understand a temperament like my laddies
What was lacking in her you have supplied
Between you I think Pauls training in these two past years has been as nearly ideal as a motherless boys could be
Everybody likes to be appreciated
Under Mr Irvings praise Annes face burst flower like into rosy bloom and the busy weary man of the world looking at her thought he had never seen a fairer sweeter slip of girlhood than this little down east schoolteacher with her red hair and wonderful eyes
Paul sat between them blissfully happy
I never dreamed father was coming he said radiantly
Even Grandma didnt know it
It was a great surprise
As a general thing


Paul shook his brown curls gravely


I dont like to be surprised
You lose all the fun of expecting things when youre surprised
But in a case like this it is all right
Father came last night after I had gone to bed
And after Grandma and Mary Joe had stopped being surprised he and Grandma came upstairs to look at me not meaning to wake me up till morning
But I woke right up and saw father
I tell you I just sprang at him
With a hug like a bears said Mr Irving putting his arms around Pauls shoulder smilingly
I hardly knew my boy he had grown so big and brown and sturdy
I dont know which was the most pleased to see father Grandma or I continued Paul
Grandmas been in kitchen all day making the things father likes to eat
She wouldnt trust them to Mary Joe she says
Thats HER way of showing gladness
I like best just to sit and talk to father
But Im going to leave you for a little while now if youll excuse me
I must get the cows for Mary Joe
That is one of my daily duties
When Paul had scampered away to do his daily duty Mr Irving talked to Anne of various matters
But Anne felt that he was thinking of something else underneath all the time
Presently it came to the surface
In Pauls last letter he spoke of going with you to visit an old


friend of mine

Miss Lewis at the stone house in Grafton
Do you know her well
Yes indeed she is a very dear friend of mine was Annes demure reply which gave no hint of the sudden thrill that tingled over her from head to foot at Mr Irvings question
Anne felt instinctively that romance was peeping at her around a corner
Mr Irving rose and went to the window looking out on a great golden billowing sea where a wild wind was harping
For a few moments there was silence in the little darkwalled room
Then he turned and looked down into Annes sympathetic face with a smile halfwhimsical halftender
I wonder how much you know he said
I know all about it replied Anne promptly
You see she explained hastily Miss Lavendar and I are very intimate
She wouldnt tell things of such a sacred nature to everybody
We are kindred spirits
Yes I believe you are
Well I am going to ask a favor of you
I would like to go and see Miss Lavendar if she will let me
Will you ask her if I may come
Would she not
Oh indeed she would
Yes this was romance the very the real thing with all the charm of rhyme and story and dream
It was a little belated perhaps like a rose blooming in October which should have bloomed in June but none the less a rose all sweetness and fragrance with the gleam of gold in its heart
Never did Annes feet bear her on a more willing errand than on that walk through the beechwoods to Grafton the next morning
She found Miss Lavendar in the garden
Anne was fearfully excited
Her hands grew cold and her voice trembled
Miss Lavendar I have something to tell you

something very important
Can you guess what it is
Anne never supposed that Miss Lavendar could GUESS but Miss Lavendars face grew very pale and Miss Lavendar said in a quiet still voice from which all the color and sparkle that Miss Lavendars voice usually suggested had faded
Stephen Irving is home
How did you know
Who told you
cried Anne disappointedly vexed that her great revelation had been anticipated
Nobody
I knew that must be it just from the way you spoke
He wants to come and see you said Anne
May I send him word that he may
Yes of course fluttered Miss Lavendar
There is no reason why he shouldnt
He is only coming as any old friend might
Anne had her own opinion about that as she hastened into the house to write a note at Miss Lavendars desk
Oh its delightful to be living in a storybook she thought gaily
It will come out all right of course

it must

and Paul will have a mother after his own heart and everybody will be happy
But Mr Irving will take Miss Lavendar away

and dear knows what will happen to the little stone house

and so there are two sides to it as there seems to be to everything in this world
The important note was written and Anne herself carried it to the Grafton post office where she waylaid the mail carrier and asked him to leave it at the Avonlea office
Its so very important Anne assured him anxiously
The mail carrier was a rather grumpy old personage who did not at all look the part of a messenger of Cupid and Anne was none too certain that his memory was to be trusted
But he said he would do his best to remember and she had to be contented with that
Charlotta the Fourth felt that some mystery pervaded the stone house that afternoon

a mystery from which she was excluded
Miss Lavendar roamed about the garden in a distracted fashion
Anne too seemed possessed by a demon of unrest and walked to and fro and went up and down
Charlotta the Fourth endured it till atience ceased to be a virtue then she confronted Anne on the occasion of that romantic young persons third aimless peregrination through the kitchen
Please Miss Shirley maam said Charlotta the Fourth with an indignant toss of her very blue bows its plain to be seen you and Miss Lavendar have got a secret and I think begging your pardon if Im too forward Miss Shirley maam that its real mean not to tell me when weve all been such chums
Oh Charlotta dear Id have told you all about it if it were my secret

but its Miss Lavendars you see
However Ill tell you this much

and if nothing comes of it you must never breathe a word about it to a living soul
You see Prince Charming is coming tonight
He came long ago but in a foolish moment went away and wandered afar and forgot the secret of the magic pathway to the enchanted castle where the princess was weeping her faithful heart out for him
But at last he remembered it again and the princess is waiting still

because nobody but her own dear prince could carry her off
Oh Miss Shirley maam what is that in prose
gasped the mystified Charlotta
Anne laughed
In prose an old friend of Miss Lavendars is coming to see her tonight
Do you mean an old beau of hers
demanded the literal Charlotta
That is probably what I do mean

in prose answered Anne gravely
It is Pauls father

Stephen Irving
And goodness knows what will come of it but let us hope for the best Charlotta
I hope that hell marry Miss Lavendar was Charlottas unequivocal response
Some womens intended from the start to be old maids and Im afraid Im one of them Miss Shirley maam because Ive awful little patience with the men
But Miss Lavendar never was
And Ive been awful worried thinking what on earth shed do when I got so big Id HAVE to go to Boston
There aint any more girls in our family and dear knows what shed do if she got some stranger that might laugh at her pretendings and leave things lying round out of their place and not be willing to be called Charlotta the Fifth
She might get someone who wouldnt be as unlucky as me in breaking dishes but shed never get anyone whod love her better
And the faithful little handmaiden dashed to the oven door with a sniff
They went through the form of having tea as usual that night at Echo Lodge but nobody really ate anything
After tea Miss Lavendar went to her room and put on her new forgetmenot organdy while Anne did her hair for her
Both were dreadfully excited but Miss Lavendar pretended to be very calm and indifferent
I must really mend that rent in the curtain tomorrow she said anxiously inspecting it as if it were the only thing of any importance just then
Those curtains have not worn as well as they should considering the price I paid
Dear me Charlotta has forgotten to dust the stair railing AGAIN
I really MUST speak to her about it
Anne was sitting on the porch steps when Stephen Irving came down the lane and across the garden
This is the one place where time stands still he said looking around him with delighted eyes
There is nothing changed about this house or garden since I was here twentyfive years ago
It makes me feel young again
You know time always does stand still in an enchanted palace said Anne seriously
It is only when the prince comes that things begin to happen
Mr Irving smiled a little sadly into her uplifted face all astar with its youth and promise
Sometimes the prince comes too late he said
He did not ask Anne to translate her remark into prose
Like all kindred spirits he understood
Oh no not if he is the real prince coming to the true princess said Anne shaking her red head decidedly as she opened the parlor door
When he had gone in she shut it tightly behind him and turned to confront Charlotta the Fourth who was in the hall all nods and becks and wreathed smiles
Oh Miss Shirley maam she breathed I peeked from the kitchen window

and hes awful handsome

and just the right age for Miss Lavendar
And oh Miss Shirley maam do you think it would be much harm to listen at the door
It would be dreadful Charlotta said Anne firmly so just you come away with me out of the reach of temptation
I cant do anything and its awful to hang round just waiting sighed Charlotta
What if he dont propose after all Miss Shirley maam
You can never be sure of them men
My older sister Charlotta the First thought she was engaged to one once
But it turned out HE had a different opinion and she says shell never trust one of them again
And I heard of another case where a man thought he wanted one girl awful bad when it was really her sister he wanted all the time
When a man dont know his own mind Miss Shirley maam hows a poor woman going to be sure of it
Well go to the kitchen and clean the silver spoons said Anne
Thats a task which wont require much thinking fortunately


for I COULDNT think tonight
And it will pass the time
It passed an hour
Then just as Anne laid down the last shining spoon they heard the front door shut
Both sought comfort fearfully in each others eyes
Oh Miss Shirley maam gasped Charlotta if hes going away this early theres nothing into it and never will be
They flew to the window
Mr Irving had no intention of going away
He and Miss Lavendar were strolling slowly down the middle path to the stone bench
Oh Miss Shirley maam hes got his arm around her waist whispered Charlotta the Fourth delightedly
He must have proposed to her or shed never allow it
Anne caught Charlotta the Fourth by her own plump waist and danced her around the kitchen until they were both out of breath
Oh Charlotta she cried gaily Im neither a prophetess nor the daughter of a prophetess but Im going to make a prediction
Therell be a wedding in this old stone house before the maple leaves are red
Do you want that translated into prose Charlotta
No I can understand that said Charlotta
A wedding aint poetry
Why Miss Shirley maam youre crying
What for
Oh because its all so beautiful

and story bookish

and romantic

and sad said Anne winking the tears out of her eyes
Its all perfectly lovely

but theres a little sadness mixed up in it too somehow
Oh of course theres a resk in marrying anybody conceded Charlotta the Fourth but when alls said and done Miss Shirley maam theres many a worse thing than a husband
XXIX Poetry and Prose For the next month Anne lived in what for Avonlea might be called a whirl of excitement
The preparation of her own modest outfit for Redmond was of secondary importance
Miss Lavendar was getting ready to be married and the stone house was the scene of endless consultations and plannings and discussions with Charlotta the Fourth hovering on the outskirts of things in agitated delight and wonder
Then the dressmaker came and there was the rapture and wretchedness of choosing fashions and being fitted
Anne and Diana spent half their time at Echo Lodge and there were nights when Anne could not sleep for wondering whether she had done right in advising Miss Lavendar to select brown rather than navy blue for her traveling dress and to have her gray silk made princess
Everybody concerned in Miss Lavendars story was very happy
Paul Irving rushed to Green Gables to talk the news over with Anne as soon as his father had told him
I knew I could trust father to pick me out a nice little second mother he said proudly
Its a fine thing to have a father you can depend on teacher
I just love Miss Lavendar
Grandma is pleased too
She says shes real glad father didnt pick out an American for his second wife because although it turned out all right the first time such a thing wouldnt be likely to happen twice
Mrs Lynde says she thoroughly approves of the match and thinks its likely Miss Lavendar will give up her queer notions and be like other people now that shes going to be married
But I hope she wont give her queer notions up teacher because I like them
And I dont want her to be like other people
There are too many other people around as it is
YOU know teacher
Charlotta the Fourth was another radiant person
Oh Miss Shirley maam it has all turned out so beautiful
When Mr Irving and Miss Lavendar come back from their tower Im to go up to Boston and live with them

and me only fifteen and the other girls never went till they were sixteen
Aint Mr Irving splendid
He just worships the ground she treads on and it makes me feel so queer sometimes to see the look in his eyes when hes watching her
It beggars description Miss Shirley maam
Im awful thankful theyre so fond of each other
Its the best way when alls said and done though some folks can get along without it
Ive got an aunt who has been married three times and says she married the first time for love and the last two times for strictly business and was happy with all three except at the times of the funerals
But I think she took a resk Miss Shirley maam
Oh its all so romantic breathed Anne to Marilla that night
If I hadnt taken the wrong path that day we went to Mr Kimballs Id never have known Miss Lavendar and if I hadnt met her Id never have taken Paul there

and hed never have written to his father about visiting Miss Lavendar just as Mr Irving was starting for San Francisco
Mr Irving says whenever he got that letter he made up his mind to send his partner to San Francisco and come here instead
He hadnt heard anything of Miss Lavendar for fifteen years
Somebody had told him then that she was to be married and he thought she was and never asked anybody anything about her
And now everything has come right
And I had a hand in bringing it about
Perhaps as Mrs Lynde says everything is foreordained and it was bound to happen anyway
But even so its nice to think one was an instrument used by predestination
Yes indeed its very romantic
I cant see that its so terribly romantic at all said Marilla rather crisply
Marilla thought Anne was too worked up about it and had plenty to do with getting ready for college without traipsing to Echo Lodge two days out of three helping Miss Lavendar
In the first place two young fools quarrel and turn sulky then Steve Irving goes to the States and after a spell gets married up there and is perfectly happy from all accounts
Then his wife dies and after a decent interval he thinks hell come home and see if his first fancyll have him
Meanwhile shes been living single probably because nobody nice enough came along to want her and they meet and agree to be married after all
Now where is the romance in all that
Oh there isnt any when you put it that way gasped Anne rather as if somebody had thrown cold water over her
I suppose thats how it looks in prose
But its very different if you look at it through poetry

and I think its nicer


Anne recovered herself and her eyes shone and her cheeks flushed


to look at it through poetry
Marilla glanced at the radiant young face and refrained from further sarcastic comments
Perhaps some realization came to her that after all it was better to have like Anne the vision and the faculty divine

that gift which the world cannot bestow or take away of looking at life through some transfiguring

or revealing

medium whereby everything seemed apparelled in celestial light wearing a glory and a freshness not visible to those who like herself and Charlotta the Fourth looked at things only through prose
Whens the wedding to be
she asked after a pause
The last Wednesday in August
They are to be married in the garden under the honeysuckle trellis

the very spot where Mr Irving proposed to her twentyfive years ago
Marilla that IS romantic even in prose
Theres to be nobody there except Mrs Irving and Paul and Gilbert and Diana and I and Miss Lavendars cousins
And they will leave on the six oclock train for a trip to the Pacific coast
When they come back in the fall Paul and Charlotta the Fourth are to go up to Boston to live with them
But Echo Lodge is to be left just as it is

only of course theyll sell the hens and cow and board up the windows

and every summer theyre coming down to live in it
Im so glad
It would have hurt me dreadfully next winter at Redmond to think of that dear stone house all stripped and deserted with empty rooms

or far worse still with other people living in it
But I can think of it now just as Ive always seen it waiting happily for the summer to bring life and laughter back to it again
There was more romance in the world than that which had fallen to the share of the middleaged lovers of the stone house
Anne stumbled suddenly on it one evening when she went over to Orchard Slope by the wood cut and came out into the Barry garden
Diana Barry and Fred Wright were standing together under the big willow
Diana was leaning against the gray trunk her lashes cast down on very crimson cheeks
One hand was held by Fred who stood with his face bent toward her stammering something in low earnest tones
There were no other people in the world except their two selves at that magic moment so neither of them saw Anne who after one dazed glance of comprehension turned and sped noiselessly back through the spruce wood never stopping till she gained her own gable room where she sat breathlessly down by her window and tried to collect her scattered wits
Diana and Fred are in love with each other she gasped
Oh it does seem so

so

so HOPELESSLY grown up
Anne of late had not been without her suspicions that Diana was proving false to the melancholy Byronic hero of her early dreams
But as things seen are mightier than things heard or suspected the realization that it was actually so came to her with almost the shock of perfect surprise
This was succeeded by a queer little lonely feeling

as if somehow Diana had gone forward into a new world shutting a gate behind her leaving Anne on the outside
Things are changing so fast it almost frightens me Anne thought a little sadly
And Im afraid that this cant help making some difference between Diana and me
Im sure I cant tell her all my secrets after this

she might tell Fred
And what CAN she see in Fred
Hes very nice and jolly

but hes just Fred Wright
It is always a very puzzling question

what can somebody see in somebody else
But how fortunate after all that it is so for if everybody saw alike

well in that case as the old Indian said Everybody would want my squaw
It was plain that Diana DID see something in Fred Wright however Annes eyes might be holden
Diana came to Green Gables the next evening a pensive shy young lady and told Anne the whole story in the dusky seclusion of the east gable
Both girls cried and kissed and laughed
Im so happy said Diana but it does seem ridiculous to think of me being engaged
What is it really like to be engaged
asked Anne curiously
Well that all depends on who youre engaged to answered Diana with that maddening air of superior wisdom always assumed by those who are engaged over those who are not
Its perfectly lovely to be engaged to Fred

but I think it would be simply horrid to be engaged to anyone else
Theres not much comfort for the rest of us in that seeing that there is only one Fred laughed Anne
Oh Anne you dont understand said Diana in vexation
I didnt mean THAT

its so hard to explain
Never mind youll understand sometime when your own turn comes
Bless you dearest of Dianas I understand now
What is an imagination for if not to enable you to peep at life through other peoples eyes
You must be my bridesmaid you know Anne
Promise me that


wherever you may be when Im married
Ill come from the ends of the earth if necessary promised Anne solemnly
Of course it wont be for ever so long yet said Diana blushing
Three years at the very least

for Im only eighteen and mother says no daughter of hers shall be married before shes twentyone
Besides Freds father is going to buy the Abraham Fletcher farm for him and he says hes got to have it two thirds paid for before hell give it to him in his own name
But three years isnt any too much time to get ready for housekeeping for I havent a speck of fancy work made yet
But Im going to begin crocheting doilies tomorrow
Myra Gillis had thirtyseven doilies when she was married and Im determined I shall have as many as she had
I suppose it would be perfectly impossible to keep house with only thirtysix doilies conceded Anne with a solemn face but dancing eyes
Diana looked hurt
I didnt think youd make fun of me Anne she said reproachfully
Dearest I wasnt making fun of you cried Anne repentantly
I was only teasing you a bit
I think youll make the sweetest little housekeeper in the world
And I think its perfectly lovely of you to be planning already for your home odreams
Anne had no sooner uttered the phrase home odreams than it captivated her fancy and she immediately began the erection of one of her own
It was of course tenanted by an ideal master dark proud and melancholy but oddly enough Gilbert Blythe persisted in hanging about too helping her arrange pictures lay out gardens and accomplish sundry other tasks which a proud and melancholy hero evidently considered beneath his dignity
Anne tried to banish Gilberts image from her castle in Spain but somehow he went on being there so Anne being in a hurry gave up the attempt and pursued her aerial architecture with such success that her home odreams was built and furnished before Diana spoke again
I suppose Anne you must think its funny I should like Fred so well when hes so different from the kind of man Ive always said I would marry

the tall slender kind
But somehow I wouldnt want Fred to be tall and slender

because dont you see he wouldnt be Fred then
Of course added Diana rather dolefully we will be a dreadfully pudgy couple
But after all thats better than one of us being short and fat and the other tall and lean like Morgan Sloane and his wife
Mrs Lynde says it always makes her think of the long and short of it when she sees them together
Well said Anne to herself that night as she brushed her hair before her gilt framed mirror I am glad Diana is so happy and satisfied
But when my turn comes

if it ever does

I do hope therell be something a little more thrilling about it
But then Diana thought so too once
Ive heard her say time and again shed never get engaged any poky commonplace way

hed HAVE to do something splendid to win her
But she has changed
Perhaps Ill change too
But I wont

and Im determined I wont
Oh I think these engagements are dreadfully unsettling things when they happen to your intimate friends
XXX A Wedding at the Stone House The last week in August came
Miss Lavendar was to be married in it
Two weeks later Anne and Gilbert would leave for Redmond College
In a weeks time Mrs Rachel Lynde would move to Green Gables and set up her lares and penates in the erstwhile spare room which was already prepared for her coming
She had sold all her superfluous household plenishings by auction and was at present reveling in the congenial occupation of helping the Allans pack up
Mr Allan was to preach his farewell sermon the next Sunday
The old order was changing rapidly to give place to the new as Anne felt with a little sadness threading all her excitement and happiness
Changes aint totally pleasant but theyre excellent things said Mr Harrison philosophically
Two years is about long enough for things to stay exactly the same
If they stayed put any longer they might grow mossy
Mr Harrison was smoking on his veranda
His wife had selfsacrificingly told that he might smoke in the house if he took care to sit by an open window
Mr Harrison rewarded this concession by going outdoors altogether to smoke in fine weather and so mutual goodwill reigned
Anne had come over to ask Mrs Harrison for some of her yellow dahlias
She and Diana were going through to Echo Lodge that evening to help Miss Lavendar and Charlotta the Fourth with their final preparations for the morrows bridal
Miss Lavendar herself never had dahlias she did not like them and they would not have suited the fine retirement of her oldfashioned garden
But flowers of any kind were rather scarce in Avonlea and the neighboring districts that summer thanks to Uncle Abes storm and Anne and Diana thought that a certain old creamcolored stone jug usually kept sacred to doughnuts brimmed over with yellow dahlias would be just the thing to set in a dim angle of the stone house stairs against the dark background of red hall paper
I spose youll be starting off for college in a fortnights time
continued Mr Harrison
Well were going to miss you an awful lot Emily and me
To be sure Mrs Lyndell be over there in your place
There aint nobody but a substitute can be found for them
The irony of Mr Harrisons tone is quite untransferable to paper
In spite of his wifes intimacy with Mrs Lynde the best that could be said of the relationship between her and Mr Harrison even under the new regime was that they preserved an armed neutrality
Yes Im going said Anne
Im very glad with my head

and very sorry with my heart
I spose youll be scooping up all the honors that are lying round loose at Redmond
I may try for one or two of them confessed Anne but I dont care so much for things like that as I did two years ago
What I want to get out of my college course is some knowledge of the best way of living life and doing the most and best with it
I want to learn to understand and help other people and myself
Mr Harrison nodded
Thats the idea exactly
Thats what college ought to be for instead of for turning out a lot of BA
s so chock full of booklearning and vanity that there aint room for anything else
Youre all right
College wont be able to do you much harm I reckon
Diana and Anne drove over to Echo Lodge after tea taking with them all the flowery spoil that several predatory expeditions in their own and their neighbors gardens had yielded
They found the stone house agog with excitement
Charlotta the Fourth was flying around with such vim and briskness that her blue bows seemed really to possess the power of being everywhere at once
Like the helmet of Navarre Charlottas blue bows waved ever in the thickest of the fray
Praise be to goodness youve come she said devoutly for theres heaps of things to do

and the frosting on that cake WONT harden

and theres all the silver to be rubbed up yet


and the horsehair trunk to be packed

and the roosters for the chicken salad are running out there beyant the henhouse yet crowing Miss Shirley maam
And Miss Lavendar aint to be trusted to do a thing
I was thankful when Mr Irving came a few minutes ago and took her off for a walk in the woods
Courtings all right in its place Miss Shirley maam but if you try to mix it up with cooking and scouring everythings spoiled
Thats MY opinion Miss Shirley maam
Anne and Diana worked so heartily that by ten oclock even Charlotta the Fourth was satisfied
She braided her hair in innumerable plaits and took her weary little bones off to bed
But Im sure I shant sleep a blessed wink Miss Shirley maam for fear that somethingll go wrong at the last minute

the cream wont whip

or Mr Irvingll have a stroke and not be able to come
He isnt in the habit of having strokes is he
asked Diana the dimpled corners of her mouth twitching
To Diana Charlotta the Fourth was if not exactly a thing of beauty certainly a joy forever
Theyre not things that go by habit said Charlotta the Fourth with dignity
They just HAPPEN

and there you are
ANYBODY can have a stroke
You dont have to learn how
Mr Irving looks a lot like an uncle of mine that had one once just as he was sitting down to dinner one day
But maybe everythingll go all right
In this world youve just got to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever God sends
The only thing Im worried about is that it wont be fine tomorrow said Diana
Uncle Abe predicted rain for the middle of the week and ever since the big storm I cant help believing theres a good deal in what Uncle Abe says
Anne who knew better than Diana just how much Uncle Abe had to do with the storm was not much disturbed by this
She slept the sleep of the just and weary and was roused at an unearthly hour by Charlotta the Fourth
Oh Miss Shirley maam its awful to call you so early came wailing through the keyhole but theres so much to do yet

and oh Miss Shirley maam Im skeered its going to rain and I wish youd get up and tell me you think it aint
Anne flew to the window hoping against hope that Charlotta the Fourth was saying this merely by way of rousing her effectually
But alas the morning did look unpropitious
Below the window Miss Lavendars garden which should have been a glory of pale virgin sunshine lay dim and windless and the sky over the firs was dark with moody clouds
Isnt it too mean
said Diana
We must hope for the best said Anne determinedly
If it only doesnt actually rain a cool pearly gray day like this would really be nicer than hot sunshine
But it will rain mourned Charlotta creeping into the room a figure of fun with her many braids wound about her head the ends tied up with white thread sticking out in all directions
Itll hold off till the last minute and then pour cats and dogs
And all the folks will get sopping

and track mud all over the house


and they wont be able to be married under the honeysuckle

and its awful unlucky for no sun to shine on a bride say what you will Miss Shirley maam
I knew things were going too well to last
Charlotta the Fourth seemed certainly to have borrowed a leaf out of Miss Eliza Andrews book
It did not rain though it kept on looking as if it meant to
By noon the rooms were decorated the table beautifully laid and upstairs was waiting a bride adorned for her husband
You do look sweet said Anne rapturously
Lovely echoed Diana
Everythings ready Miss Shirley maam and nothing dreadful has happened YET was Charlottas cheerful statement as she betook herself to her little back room to dress
Out came all the braids the resultant rampant crinkliness was plaited into two tails and tied not with two bows alone but with four of brandnew ribbon brightly blue
The two upper bows rather gave the impression of overgrown wings sprouting from Charlottas neck somewhat after the fashion of Raphaels cherubs
But Charlotta the Fourth thought them very beautiful and after she had rustled into a white dress so stiffly starched that it could stand alone she surveyed herself in her glass with great satisfaction

a satisfaction which lasted until she went out in the hall and caught a glimpse through the spare room door of a tall girl in some softly clinging gown pinning white starlike flowers on the smooth ripples of her ruddy hair
Oh Ill NEVER be able to look like Miss Shirley thought poor Charlotta despairingly
You just have to be born so I guess


dont seems if any amount of practice could give you that AIR
By one oclock the guests had come including Mr and Mrs Allan for Mr Allan was to perform the ceremony in the absence of the Grafton minister on his vacation
There was no formality about the marriage
Miss Lavendar came down the stairs to meet her bridegroom at the foot and as he took her hand she lifted her big brown eyes to his with a look that made Charlotta the Fourth who intercepted it feel queerer than ever
They went out to the honeysuckle arbor where Mr Allan was awaiting them
The guests grouped themselves as they pleased
Anne and Diana stood by the old stone bench with Charlotta the Fourth between them desperately clutching their hands in her cold tremulous little paws
Mr Allan opened his blue book and the ceremony proceeded
Just as Miss Lavendar and Stephen Irving were pronounced man and wife a very beautiful and symbolic thing happened
The sun suddenly burst through the gray and poured a flood of radiance on the happy bride
Instantly the garden was alive with dancing shadows and flickering lights
What a lovely omen thought Anne as she ran to kiss the bride
Then the three girls left the rest of the guests laughing around the bridal pair while they flew into the house to see that all was in readiness for the feast
Thanks be to goodness its over Miss Shirley maam breathed Charlotta the Fourth and theyre married safe and sound no matter what happens now
The bags of rice are in the pantry maam and the old shoes are behind the door and the cream for whipping is on the sullar steps
At half past two Mr and Mrs Irving left and everybody went to Bright River to see them off on the afternoon train
As Miss Lavendar

I beg her pardon Mrs Irving

stepped from the door of her old home Gilbert and the girls threw the rice and Charlotta the Fourth hurled an old shoe with such excellent aim that she struck Mr Allan squarely on the head
But it was reserved for Paul to give the prettiest sendoff
He popped out of the porch ringing furiously a huge old brass dinner bell which had adorned the dining room mantel
Pauls only motive was to make a joyful noise but as the clangor died away from point and curve and hill across the river came the chime of fairy wedding bells ringing clearly sweetly faintly and more faint as if Miss Lavendars beloved echoes were bidding her greeting and farewell
And so amid this benediction of sweet sounds Miss Lavendar drove away from the old life of dreams and makebelieves to a fuller life of realities in the busy world beyond
Two hours later Anne and Charlotta the Fourth came down the lane again
Gilbert had gone to West Grafton on an errand and Diana had to keep an engagement at home
Anne and Charlotta had come back to put things in order and lock up the little stone house
The garden was a pool of late golden sunshine with butterflies hovering and bees booming but the little house had already that indefinable air of desolation which always follows a festivity
Oh dear me dont it look lonesome
sniffed Charlotta the Fourth who had been crying all the way home from the station
A wedding aint much cheerfuller than a funeral after all when its all over Miss Shirley maam
A busy evening followed
The decorations had to be removed the dishes washed the uneaten delicacies packed into a basket for the delectation of Charlotta the Fourths young brothers at home
Anne would not rest until everything was in applepie order after Charlotta had gone home with her plunder Anne went over the still rooms feeling like one who trod alone some banquet hall deserted and closed the blinds
Then she locked the door and sat down under the silver poplar to wait for Gilbert feeling very tired but still unweariedly thinking long long thoughts
What are you thinking of Anne
asked Gilbert coming down the walk
He had left his horse and buggy out at the road
Of Miss Lavendar and Mr Irving answered Anne dreamily
Isnt it beautiful to think how everything has turned out

how they have come together again after all the years of separation and misunderstanding
Yes its beautiful said Gilbert looking steadily down into Annes uplifted face but wouldnt it have been more beautiful still Anne if there had been NO separation or misunderstanding


if they had come hand in hand all the way through life with no memories behind them but those which belonged to each other
For a moment Annes heart fluttered queerly and for the first time her eyes faltered under Gilberts gaze and a rosy flush stained the paleness of her face
It was as if a veil that had hung before her inner consciousness had been lifted giving to her view a revelation of unsuspected feelings and realities
Perhaps after all romance did not come into ones life with pomp and blare like a gay knight riding down perhaps it crept to ones side like an old friend through quiet ways perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose until some sudden shaft of illumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music perhaps


perhaps

love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship as a goldenhearted rose slipping from its green sheath
Then the veil dropped again but the Anne who walked up the dark lane was not quite the same Anne who had driven gaily down it the evening before
The page of girlhood had been turned as by an unseen finger and the page of womanhood was before her with all its charm and mystery its pain and gladness
Gilbert wisely said nothing more but in his silence he read the history of the next four years in the light of Annes remembered blush
Four years of earnest happy work

and then the guerdon of a useful knowledge gained and a sweet heart won
Behind them in the garden the little stone house brooded among the shadows
It was lonely but not forsaken
It had not yet done with dreams and laughter and the joy of life there were to be future summers for the little stone house meanwhile it could wait
And over the river in purple durance the echoes bided their time
