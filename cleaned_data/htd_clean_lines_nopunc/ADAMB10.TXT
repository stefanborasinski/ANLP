Adam Bede by George Eliot Book One Chapter I The Workshop With a single drop of ink for a mirror the Egyptian sorcerer undertakes to reveal to any chance comer farreaching visions of the past
This is what I undertake to do for you reader
With this drop of ink at the end of my pen I will show you the roomy workshop of Mr Jonathan Burge carpenter and builder in the village of Hayslope as it appeared on the eighteenth of June in the year of our Lord 1799
The afternoon sun was warm on the five workmen there busy upon doors and windowframes and wainscoting
A scent of pinewood from a tentlike pile of planks outside the open door mingled itself with the scent of the elderbushes which were spreading their summer snow close to the open window opposite the slanting sunbeams shone through the transparent shavings that flew before the steady plane and lit up the fine grain of the oak panelling which stood propped against the wall
On a heap of those soft shavings a rough grey shepherd dog had made himself a pleasant bed and was lying with his nose between his forepaws occasionally wrinkling his brows to cast a glance at the tallest of the five workmen who was carving a shield in the centre of a wooden mantelpiece
It was to this workman that the strong barytone belonged which was heard above the sound of plane and hammer singing Awake my soul and with the sun Thy daily stage of duty run Shake off dull sloth
Here some measurement was to be taken which required more concentrated attention and the sonorous voice subsided into a low whistle but it presently broke out again with renewed vigour Let all thy converse be sincere Thy conscience as the noonday clear
Such a voice could only come from a broad chest and the broad chest belonged to a largeboned muscular man nearly six feet high with a back so flat and a head so well poised that when he drew himself up to take a more distant survey of his work he had the air of a soldier standing at ease
The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength yet the long supple hand with its broad fingertips looked ready for works of skill
In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon and justified his name but the jetblack hair made the more noticeable by its contrast with the light paper cap and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked prominent and mobile eyebrows indicated a mixture of Celtic blood
The face was large and roughly hewn and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of goodhumoured honest intelligence
It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adams brother
He is nearly as tall he has the same type of features the same hue of hair and complexion but the strength of the family likeness seems only to render more conspicuous the remarkable difference of expression both in form and face
Seths broad shoulders have a slight stoop his eyes are grey his eyebrows have less prominence and more repose than his brothers and his glance instead of being keen is confiding and benign
He has thrown off his paper cap and you see that his hair is not thick and straight like Adams but thin and wavy allowing you to discern the exact contour of a coronal arch that predominates very decidedly over the brow
The idle tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from Seth they scarcely ever spoke to Adam
The concert of the tools and Adams voice was at last broken by Seth who lifting the door at which he had been working intently placed it against the wall and said There
Ive finished my door today anyhow
The workmen all looked up Jim Salt a burly redhaired man known as Sandy Jim paused from his planing and Adam said to Seth with a sharp glance of surprise What
Dost think theest finished the door
Aye sure said Seth with answering surprise whats awanting tot
A loud roar of laughter from the other three workmen made Seth look round confusedly
Adam did not join in the laughter but there was a slight smile on his face as he said in a gentler tone than before Why theest forgot the panels
The laughter burst out afresh as Seth clapped his hands to his head and coloured over brow and crown
Hoorray
shouted a small lithe fellow called Wiry Ben running forward and seizing the door
Well hang up th door at fur end o th shop an write ont Seth Bede the Methody his work
Here Jim lends hould o th red pot
Nonsense
said Adam
Let it alone Ben Cranage
Youll mayhap be making such a slip yourself some day youll laugh o th other side o your mouth then
Catch me at it Adam
Itll be a good while afore my heads full o th Methodies said Ben
Nay but its often full o drink and thats worse
Ben however had now got the red pot in his hand and was about to begin writing his inscription making by way of preliminary an imaginary S in the air
Let it alone will you
Adam called out laying down his tools striding up to Ben and seizing his right shoulder
Let it alone or Ill shake the soul out o your body
Ben shook in Adams iron grasp but like a plucky small man as he was he didnt mean to give in
With his left hand he snatched the brush from his powerless right and made a movement as if he would perform the feat of writing with his left
In a moment Adam turned him round seized his other shoulder and pushing him along pinned him against the wall
But now Seth spoke
Let be Addy let be
Ben will be joking
Why hes i the right to laugh at meI canna help laughing at myself
I shant loose him till he promises to let the door alone said Adam
Come Ben lad said Seth in a persuasive tone dont lets have a quarrel about it
You know Adam will have his way
You mays well try to turn a waggon in a narrow lane
Say youll leave the door alone and make an end ont
I binna frighted at Adam said Ben but I donna mind sayin as Ill let t alone at your askin Seth
Come thats wise of you Ben said Adam laughing and relaxing his grasp
They all returned to their work now but Wiry Ben having had the worst in the bodily contest was bent on retrieving that humiliation by a success in sarcasm
Which was ye thinkin on Seth he beganthe pretty parsons face or her sarmunt when ye forgot the panels
Come and hear her Ben said Seth goodhumouredly shes going to preach on the Green tonight happen yed get something to think on yourself then instead o those wicked songs youre so fond on
Ye might get religion and that ud be the best days earnings y ever made
All i good time for that Seth Ill think about that when Im agoin to settle i life bachelors doesnt want such heavy earnins
Happen I shall do the coortin an the religion both together as YE do Seth but ye wouldna ha me get converted an chop in atween ye an the pretty preacher an carry her aff
No fear o that Ben shes neither for you nor for me to win I doubt
Only you come and hear her and you wont speak lightly on her again
Well Im half a mind t ha a look at her tonight if there isnt good company at th Holly Bush
Whatll she take for her text
Happen ye can tell me Seth if so be as I shouldna come up i time fort
Willt bewhat come ye out for to see
A prophetess
Yea I say unto you and more than a prophetessa uncommon pretty young woman
Come Ben said Adam rather sternly you let the words o the Bible alone youre going too far now
What
Are YE aturnin roun Adam
I thought ye war dead again th women preachin a while agoo
Nay Im not turnin noway
I said nought about the women preachin
I said You let the Bible alone youve got a jest book hant you as youre rare and proud on
Keep your dirty fingers to that
Why y are gettin as big a saint as Seth
Y are goin to th preachin tonight I should think
Yell do finely t lead the singin
But I don know what Parson Irwine ull say at his gran favright Adam Bede aturnin Methody
Never do you bother yourself about me Ben
Im not agoing to turn Methodist any more nor you arethough its like enough youll turn to something worse
Mester Irwines got more sense nor to meddle wi peoples doing as they like in religion
Thats between themselves and God as hes said to me many a time
Aye aye but hes none so fond o your dissenters for all that
Maybe Im none so fond o Josh Tods thick ale but I dont hinder you from making a fool o yourself wit
There was a laugh at this thrust of Adams but Seth said very seriously
Nay nay Addy thee mustna say as anybodys religions like thick ale
Thee dostna believe but what the dissenters and the Methodists have got the root o the matter as well as the church folks
Nay Seth lad Im not for laughing at no mans religion
Let em follow their consciences thats all
Only I think it ud be better if their consciences ud let em stay quiet i the church theres a deal to be learnt there
And theres such a thing as being oversperitial we must have something beside Gospel i this world
Look at the canals an th aqueducs an th coalpit engines and Arkwrights mills there at Cromford a man must learn summat beside Gospel to make them things I reckon
But t hear some o them preachers youd think as a man must be doing nothing alls life but shuttings eyes and looking whats agoing on inside him
I know a man must have the love o God in his soul and the Bibles Gods word
But what does the Bible say
Why it says as God put his sperrit into the workman as built the tabernacle to make him do all the carved work and things as wanted a nice hand
And this is my way o looking at it theres the sperrit o God in all things and all timesweekday as well as Sundayand i the great works and inventions and i the figuring and the mechanics
And God helps us with our headpieces and our hands as well as with our souls and if a man does bits o jobs out o working hours builds a oven for s wife to save her from going to the bakehouse or scrats at his bit o garden and makes two potatoes grow istead o one hes doin more good and hes just as near to God as if he was running after some preacher and apraying and agroaning
Well done Adam
said Sandy Jim who had paused from his planing to shift his planks while Adam was speaking thats the best sarmunt Ive heared this long while
By th same token my wifes been aplaguin on me to build her a oven this twelvemont
Theres reason in what thee sayst Adam observed Seth gravely
But thee knowst thyself as its hearing the preachers thee findst so much fault with has turned many an idle fellow into an industrious un
Its the preacher as empties th alehouse and if a man gets religion hell do his work none the worse for that
Ony hell lave the panels out o th doors sometimes eh Seth
said Wiry Ben
Ah Ben youve got a joke again me as ll last you your life
But it isna religion as was i fault there it was Seth Bede as was allays a woolgathering chap and religion hasna cured him the mores the pity
Neer heed me Seth said Wiry Ben y are a downright good hearted chap panels or no panels an ye donna set up your bristles at every bit o fun like some o your kin as is mayhap cliverer
Seth lad said Adam taking no notice of the sarcasm against himself thee mustna take me unkind
I wasna driving at thee in what I said just now
Some s got one way o looking at things and some s got another
Nay nay Addy thee meanst me no unkindness said Seth I know that well enough
Theet like thy dog Gypthee barkst at me sometimes but thee allays lickst my hand after
All hands worked on in silence for some minutes until the church clock began to strike six
Before the first stroke had died away Sandy Jim had loosed his plane and was reaching his jacket Wiry Ben had left a screw half driven in and thrown his screwdriver into his toolbasket Mum Taft who true to his name had kept silence throughout the previous conversation had flung down his hammer as he was in the act of lifting it and Seth too had straightened his back and was putting out his hand towards his paper cap
Adam alone had gone on with his work as if nothing had happened
But observing the cessation of the tools he looked up and said in a tone of indignation Look there now
I cant abide to see men throw away their tools i that way the minute the clock begins to strike as if they took no pleasure i their work and was afraid o doing a stroke too much
Seth looked a little conscious and began to be slower in his preparations for going but Mum Taft broke silence and said Aye aye Adam lad ye talk like a young un
When y are six anforty like me istid o sixantwenty ye wonna be so flush o workin for nought
Nonsense said Adam still wrathful whats age got to do with it I wonder
Ye arena getting stiff yet I reckon
I hate to see a mans arms drop down as if he was shot before the clocks fairly struck just as if hed never a bit o pride and delight in s work
The very grindstone ull go on turning a bit after you loose it
Bodderation Adam
exclaimed Wiry Ben lave a chap aloon will ee
Ye war afinding faut wi preachers a while agooy are fond enough o preachin yoursen
Ye may like work better nor play but I like play better nor work thatll commodate yeit laves ye th more to do
With this exit speech which he considered effective Wiry Ben shouldered his basket and left the workshop quickly followed by Mum Taft and Sandy Jim
Seth lingered and looked wistfully at Adam as if he expected him to say something
Shalt go home before thee gost to the preaching
Adam asked looking up
Nay Ive got my hat and things at Will Maskerys
I shant be home before going for ten
Ill happen see Dinah Morris safe home if shes willing
Theres nobody comes with her from Poysers thee knowst
Then Ill tell mother not to look for thee said Adam
Thee artna going to Poysers thyself tonight
said Seth rather timidly as he turned to leave the workshop
Nay Im going to th school
Hitherto Gyp had kept his comfortable bed only lifting up his head and watching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workmen departing
But no sooner did Adam put his ruler in his pocket and begin to twist his apron round his waist than Gyp ran forward and looked up in his masters face with patient expectation
If Gyp had had a tail he would doubtless have wagged it but being destitute of that vehicle for his emotions he was like many other worthy personages destined to appear more phlegmatic than nature had made him
What
Art ready for the basket eh Gyp
said Adam with the same gentle modulation of voice as when he spoke to Seth
Gyp jumped and gave a short bark as much as to say Of course
Poor fellow he had not a great range of expression
The basket was the one which on workdays held Adams and Seths dinner and no official walking in procession could look more resolutely unconscious of all acquaintances than Gyp with his basket trotting at his masters heels
On leaving the workshop Adam locked the door took the key out and carried it to the house on the other side of the woodyard
It was a low house with smooth grey thatch and buff walls looking pleasant and mellow in the evening light
The leaded windows were bright and speckless and the doorstone was as clean as a white boulder at ebb tide
On the doorstone stood a clean old woman in a darkstriped linen gown a red kerchief and a linen cap talking to some speckled fowls which appeared to have been drawn towards her by an illusory expectation of cold potatoes or barley
The old womans sight seemed to be dim for she did not recognize Adam till he said Heres the key Dolly lay it down for me in the house will you
Aye sure but wunna ye come in Adam
Miss Marys i th house and Mester Burge ull be back anon hed be glad t ha ye to supper wim Ill bes warrand
No Dolly thank you Im off home
Good evening
Adam hastened with long strides Gyp close to his heels out of the workyard and along the highroad leading away from the village and down to the valley
As he reached the foot of the slope an elderly horseman with his portmanteau strapped behind him stopped his horse when Adam had passed him and turned round to have another long look at the stalwart workman in paper cap leather breeches and darkblue worsted stockings
Adam unconscious of the admiration he was exciting presently struck across the fields and now broke out into the tune which had all day long been running in his head Let all thy converse be sincere Thy conscience as the noonday clear For Gods allseeing eye surveys Thy secret thoughts thy works and ways
Chapter II The Preaching About a quarter to seven there was an unusual appearance of excitement in the village of Hayslope and through the whole length of its little street from the Donnithorne Arms to the churchyard gate the inhabitants had evidently been drawn out of their houses by something more than the pleasure of lounging in the evening sunshine
The Donnithorne Arms stood at the entrance of the village and a small farmyard and stackyard which flanked it indicating that there was a pretty take of land attached to the inn gave the traveller a promise of good feed for himself and his horse which might well console him for the ignorance in which the weatherbeaten sign left him as to the heraldic bearings of that ancient family the Donnithornes
Mr Casson the landlord had been for some time standing at the door with his hands in his pockets balancing himself on his heels and toes and looking towards a piece of unenclosed ground with a maple in the middle of it which he knew to be the destination of certain grave looking men and women whom he had observed passing at intervals
Mr Cassons person was by no means of that common type which can be allowed to pass without description
On a front view it appeared to consist principally of two spheres bearing about the same relation to each other as the earth and the moon that is to say the lower sphere might be said at a rough guess to be thirteen times larger than the upper which naturally performed the function of a mere satellite and tributary
But here the resemblance ceased for Mr Cassons head was not at all a melancholylooking satellite nor was it a spotty globe as Milton has irreverently called the moon on the contrary no head and face could look more sleek and healthy and its expression which was chiefly confined to a pair of round and ruddy cheeks the slight knot and interruptions forming the nose and eyes being scarcely worth mentionwas one of jolly contentment only tempered by that sense of personal dignity which usually made itself felt in his attitude and bearing
This sense of dignity could hardly be considered excessive in a man who had been butler to the family for fifteen years and who in his present high position was necessarily very much in contact with his inferiors
How to reconcile his dignity with the satisfaction of his curiosity by walking towards the Green was the problem that Mr Casson had been revolving in his mind for the last five minutes but when he had partly solved it by taking his hands out of his pockets and thrusting them into the armholes of his waistcoat by throwing his head on one side and providing himself with an air of contemptuous indifference to whatever might fall under his notice his thoughts were diverted by the approach of the horseman whom we lately saw pausing to have another look at our friend Adam and who now pulled up at the door of the Donnithorne Arms
Take off the bridle and give him a drink ostler said the traveller to the lad in a smockfrock who had come out of the yard at the sound of the horses hoofs
Why whats up in your pretty village landlord
he continued getting down
There seems to be quite a stir
Its a Methodis preaching sir its been gev hout as a young womans agoing to preach on the Green answered Mr Casson in a treble and wheezy voice with a slightly mincing accent
Will you please to step in sir an tek somethink
No I must be getting on to Rosseter
I only want a drink for my horse
And what does your parson say I wonder to a young woman preaching just under his nose
Parson Irwine sir doesnt live here he lives at Broxon over the hill there
The parsonage heres a tumbledown place sir not fit for gentry to live in
He comes here to preach of a Sunday afternoon sir an puts up his hoss here
Its a grey cob sir an he sets great store byt
Hes allays put up his hoss here sir iver since before I hed the Donnithorne Arms
Im not this countryman you may tell by my tongue sir
Theyre curous talkers i this country sir the gentrys hard work to hunderstand em
I was brought hup among the gentry sir an got the turn o their tongue when I was a bye
Why what do you think the folks here says for hevnt you
the gentry you know says hevnt youwell the people about here says hanna yey
Its what they call the dileck as is spoke hereabout sir
Thats what Ive heared Squire Donnithorne say many a time its the dileck says he
Aye aye said the stranger smiling
I know it very well
But youve not got many Methodists about here surelyin this agricultural spot
I should have thought there would hardly be such a thing as a Methodist to be found about here
Youre all farmers arent you
The Methodists can seldom lay much hold on THEM
Why sir theres a pretty lot o workmen round about sir
Theres Mester Burge as owns the timberyard over there he underteks a good bit o building an repairs
An theres the stonepits not far off
Theres plenty of emply i this countryside sir
An theres a fine batch o Methodisses at Treddlesonthats the market town about three mile offyoull maybe ha come through it sir
Theres pretty nigh a score of em on the Green now as come from there
Thats where our people gets it from though theres only two men of em in all Hayslope thats Will Maskery the wheelwright and Seth Bede a young man as works at the carpenterin
The preacher comes from Treddleston then does she
Nay sir she comes out o Stonyshire pretty nigh thirty mile off
But shes avisitin hereabout at Mester Poysers at the Hall Farmits them barns an big walnuttrees right away to the left sir
Shes own niece to Poysers wife an theyll be fine an vexed at her for making a fool of herself i that way
But Ive heared as theres no holding these Methodisses when the maggits once got i their head many of em goes stark starin mad wi their religion
Though this young womans quiet enough to look at by what I can make out Ive not seen her myself
Well I wish I had time to wait and see her but I must get on
Ive been out of my way for the last twenty minutes to have a look at that place in the valley
Its Squire Donnithornes I suppose
Yes sir thats Donnithorne Chase that is
Fine hoaks there isnt there sir
I should know what it is sir for Ive lived butler there agoing i fifteen year
Its Captain Donnithorne as is th heir sirSquire Donnithornes grandson
Hell be comin of hage this ayarvest sir an we shall hev fine doins
He owns all the land about here sir Squire Donnithorne does
Well its a pretty spot whoever may own it said the traveller mounting his horse and one meets some fine strapping fellows about too
I met as fine a young fellow as ever I saw in my life about half an hour ago before I came up the hilla carpenter a tall broadshouldered fellow with black hair and black eyes marching along like a soldier
We want such fellows as he to lick the French
Aye sir thats Adam Bede that is Ill be boundThias Bedes son everybody knows him hereabout
Hes an uncommon clever stiddy fellow an wonderful strong
Lord bless you sirif youll hexcuse me for saying sohe can walk forty mile aday an lift a matter o sixty ston
Hes an uncommon favourite wi the gentry sir Captain Donnithorne and Parson Irwine meks a fine fuss wi him
But hes a little lifted up an pepperylike
Well good evening to you landlord I must get on
Your servant sir good evenin
The traveller put his horse into a quick walk up the village but when he approached the Green the beauty of the view that lay on his right hand the singular contrast presented by the groups of villagers with the knot of Methodists near the maple and perhaps yet more curiosity to see the young female preacher proved too much for his anxiety to get to the end of his journey and he paused
The Green lay at the extremity of the village and from it the road branched off in two directions one leading farther up the hill by the church and the other winding gently down towards the valley
On the side of the Green that led towards the church the broken line of thatched cottages was continued nearly to the churchyard gate but on the opposite northwestern side there was nothing to obstruct the view of gently swelling meadow and wooded valley and dark masses of distant hill
That rich undulating district of Loamshire to which Hayslope belonged lies close to a grim outskirt of Stonyshire overlooked by its barren hills as a pretty blooming sister may sometimes be seen linked in the arm of a rugged tall swarthy brother and in two or three hours ride the traveller might exchange a bleak treeless region intersected by lines of cold grey stone for one where his road wound under the shelter of woods or up swelling hills muffled with hedgerows and long meadowgrass and thick corn and where at every turn he came upon some fine old countryseat nestled in the valley or crowning the slope some homestead with its long length of barn and its cluster of golden ricks some grey steeple looking out from a pretty confusion of trees and thatch and darkred tiles
It was just such a picture as this last that Hayslope Church had made to the traveller as he began to mount the gentle slope leading to its pleasant uplands and now from his station near the Green he had before him in one view nearly all the other typical features of this pleasant land
High up against the horizon were the huge conical masses of hill like giant mounds intended to fortify this region of corn and grass against the keen and hungry winds of the north not distant enough to be clothed in purple mystery but with sombre greenish sides visibly specked with sheep whose motion was only revealed by memory not detected by sight wooed from day to day by the changing hours but responding with no change in themselvesleft for ever grim and sullen after the flush of morning the winged gleams of the April noonday the parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun
And directly below them the eye rested on a more advanced line of hanging woods divided by bright patches of pasture or furrowed crops and not yet deepened into the uniform leafy curtains of high summer but still showing the warm tints of the young oak and the tender green of the ash and lime
Then came the valley where the woods grew thicker as if they had rolled down and hurried together from the patches left smooth on the slope that they might take the better care of the tall mansion which lifted its parapets and sent its faint blue summer smoke among them
Doubtless there was a large sweep of park and a broad glassy pool in front of that mansion but the swelling slope of meadow would not let our traveller see them from the village green
He saw instead a foreground which was just as lovelythe level sunlight lying like transparent gold among the gently curving stems of the feathered grass and the tall red sorrel and the white ambels of the hemlocks lining the bushy hedgerows
It was that moment in summer when the sound of the scythe being whetted makes us cast more lingering looks at the flowersprinkled tresses of the meadows
He might have seen other beauties in the landscape if he had turned a little in his saddle and looked eastward beyond Jonathan Burges pasture and woodyard towards the green cornfields and walnuttrees of the Hall Farm but apparently there was more interest for him in the living groups close at hand
Every generation in the village was there from old Feyther Taft in his brown worsted nightcap who was bent nearly double but seemed tough enough to keep on his legs a long while leaning on his short stick down to the babies with their little round heads lolling forward in quilted linen caps
Now and then there was a new arrival perhaps a slouching labourer who having eaten his supper came out to look at the unusual scene with a slow bovine gaze willing to hear what any one had to say in explanation of it but by no means excited enough to ask a question
But all took care not to join the Methodists on the Green and identify themselves in that way with the expectant audience for there was not one of them that would not have disclaimed the imputation of having come out to hear the preacher womanthey had only come out to see what war agoin on like
The men were chiefly gathered in the neighbourhood of the blacksmiths shop
But do not imagine them gathered in a knot
Villagers never swarm a whisper is unknown among them and they seem almost as incapable of an undertone as a cow or a stag
Your true rustic turns his back on his interlocutor throwing a question over his shoulder as if he meant to run away from the answer and walking a step or two farther off when the interest of the dialogue culminates
So the group in the vicinity of the blacksmiths door was by no means a close one and formed no screen in front of Chad Cranage the blacksmith himself who stood with his black brawny arms folded leaning against the doorpost and occasionally sending forth a bellowing laugh at his own jokes giving them a marked preference over the sarcasms of Wiry Ben who had renounced the pleasures of the Holly Bush for the sake of seeing life under a new form
But both styles of wit were treated with equal contempt by Mr Joshua Rann
Mr Ranns leathern apron and subdued griminess can leave no one in any doubt that he is the village shoemaker the thrusting out of his chin and stomach and the twirling of his thumbs are more subtle indications intended to prepare unwary strangers for the discovery that they are in the presence of the parish clerk
Old Joshway as he is irreverently called by his neighbours is in a state of simmering indignation but he has not yet opened his lips except to say in a resounding bass undertone like the tuning of a violoncello Sehon King of the Amorites for His mercy endureth for ever and Og the King of Basan for His mercy endureth for evera quotation which may seem to have slight bearing on the present occasion but as with every other anomaly adequate knowledge will show it to be a natural sequence
Mr Rann was inwardly maintaining the dignity of the Church in the face of this scandalous irruption of Methodism and as that dignity was bound up with his own sonorous utterance of the responses his argument naturally suggested a quotation from the psalm he had read the last Sunday afternoon
The stronger curiosity of the women had drawn them quite to the edge of the Green where they could examine more closely the Quakerlike costume and odd deportment of the female Methodists
Underneath the maple there was a small cart which had been brought from the wheelwrights to serve as a pulpit and round this a couple of benches and a few chairs had been placed
Some of the Methodists were resting on these with their eyes closed as if wrapt in prayer or meditation
Others chose to continue standing and had turned their faces towards the villagers with a look of melancholy compassion which was highly amusing to Bessy Cranage the blacksmiths buxom daughter known to her neighbours as Chads Bess who wondered why the folks war amakin faces a thatns
Chads Bess was the object of peculiar compassion because her hair being turned back under a cap which was set at the top of her head exposed to view an ornament of which she was much prouder than of her red cheeksnamely a pair of large round earrings with false garnets in them ornaments condemned not only by the Methodists but by her own cousin and namesake Timothys Bess who with much cousinly feeling often wished them ear rings might come to good
Timothys Bess though retaining her maiden appellation among her familiars had long been the wife of Sandy Jim and possessed a handsome set of matronly jewels of which it is enough to mention the heavy baby she was rocking in her arms and the sturdy fellow of five in kneebreeches and red legs who had a rusty milkcan round his neck by way of drum and was very carefully avoided by Chads small terrier
This young olivebranch notorious under the name of Timothys Besss Ben being of an inquiring disposition unchecked by any false modesty had advanced beyond the group of women and children and was walking round the Methodists looking up in their faces with his mouth wide open and beating his stick against the milkcan by way of musical accompaniment
But one of the elderly women bending down to take him by the shoulder with an air of grave remonstrance Timothys Besss Ben first kicked out vigorously then took to his heels and sought refuge behind his fathers legs
Ye gallows young dog said Sandy Jim with some paternal pride if ye donna keep that stick quiet Ill tek it from ye
What dye mane by kickin foulks
Here
Gie him here to me Jim said Chad Cranage Ill tie hirs up an shoe him as I do th hosses
Well Mester Casson he continued as that personage sauntered up towards the group of men how are ye t naight
Are ye coom t help groon
They say folks allays groon when theyre hearkenin to th Methodys as if they war bad i th inside
I mane to groon as loud as your cow did th other naight an then the praicher ull think Im i th raight way
Id advise you not to be up to no nonsense Chad said Mr Casson with some dignity Poyser wouldnt like to hear as his wifes niece was treated any ways disrespectful for all he maynt be fond of her taking on herself to preach
Aye an shes a pleasantlooked un too said Wiry Ben
Ill stick up for the pretty women preachin I know theyd persuade me over a deal sooner nor th ugly men
I shouldna wonder if I turn Methody afore the nights out an begin to coort the preacher like Seth Bede
Why Seths looking rether too high I should think said Mr Casson
This womans kin wouldnt like her to demean herself to a common carpenter
Tchu
said Ben with a long treble intonation whats folkss kin got to do wit
Not a chip
Poysers wife may turn her nose up an forget bygones but this Dinah Morris they tell me s as poor as iver she wasworks at a mill ans much ado to keep hersen
A strappin young carpenter as is a readymade Methody like Seth wouldna be a bad match for her
Why Poysers make as big a fuss wi Adam Bede as if he war a nevvy o their own
Idle talk
idle talk
said Mr Joshua Rann
Adam an Seths two men you wunna fit them two wi the same last
Maybe said Wiry Ben contemptuously but Seths the lad for me though he war a Methody twice oer
Im fair beat wi Seth for Ive been teasin him iver sin weve been workin together an he bears me no more malice nor a lamb
An hes a stout hearted feller too for when we saw the old tree all afire a comin across the fields one night an we thought as it war a boguy Seth made no more ado but he up tot as bold as a constable
Why there he comes out o Will Maskerys an theres Will hisself lookin as meek as if he couldna knock a nail o the head for fear o hurtint
An theres the pretty preacher woman
My eye shes got her bonnet off
I mun go a bit nearer
Several of the men followed Bens lead and the traveller pushed his horse on to the Green as Dinah walked rather quickly and in advance of her companions towards the cart under the mapletree
While she was near Seths tall figure she looked short but when she had mounted the cart and was away from all comparison she seemed above the middle height of woman though in reality she did not exceed itan effect which was due to the slimness of her figure and the simple line of her black stuff dress
The stranger was struck with surprise as he saw her approach and mount the cartsurprise not so much at the feminine delicacy of her appearance as at the total absence of selfconsciousness in her demeanour
He had made up his mind to see her advance with a measured step and a demure solemnity of countenance he had felt sure that her face would be mantled with the smile of conscious saintship or else charged with denunciatory bitterness
He knew but two types of Methodistthe ecstatic and the bilious
But Dinah walked as simply as if she were going to market and seemed as unconscious of her outward appearance as a little boy there was no blush no tremulousness which said I know you think me a pretty woman too young to preach no casting up or down of the eyelids no compression of the lips no attitude of the arms that said But you must think of me as a saint
She held no book in her ungloved hands but let them hang down lightly crossed before her as she stood and turned her grey eyes on the people
There was no keenness in the eyes they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out rather than impressed by external objects
She stood with her left hand towards the descending sun and leafy boughs screened her from its rays but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness like flowers at evening
It was a small oval face of a uniform transparent whiteness with an egglike line of cheek and chin a full but firm mouth a delicate nostril and a low perpendicular brow surmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair
The hair was drawn straight back behind the ears and covered except for an inch or two above the brow by a net Quaker cap
The eyebrows of the same colour as the hair were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled the eyelashes though no darker were long and abundantnothing was left blurred or unfinished
It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals
The eyes had no peculiar beauty beyond that of expression they looked so simple so candid so gravely loving that no accusing scowl no light sneer could help melting away before their glance
Joshua Rann gave a long cough as if he were clearing his throat in order to come to a new understanding with himself Chad Cranage lifted up his leather skullcap and scratched his head and Wiry Ben wondered how Seth had the pluck to think of courting her
A sweet woman the stranger said to himself but surely nature never meant her for a preacher
Perhaps he was one of those who think that nature has theatrical properties and with the considerate view of facilitating art and psychology makes up her characters so that there may be no mistake about them
But Dinah began to speak
Dear friends she said in a clear but not loud voice let us pray for a blessing
She closed her eyes and hanging her head down a little continued in the same moderate tone as if speaking to some one quite near her Saviour of sinners
When a poor woman laden with sins went out to the well to draw water she found Thee sitting at the well
She knew Thee not she had not sought Thee her mind was dark her life was unholy
But Thou didst speak to her Thou didst teach her Thou didst show her that her life lay open before Thee and yet Thou wast ready to give her that blessing which she had never sought
Jesus Thou art in the midst of us and Thou knowest all men if there is any here like that poor womanif their minds are dark their lives unholyif they have come out not seeking Thee not desiring to be taught deal with them according to the free mercy which Thou didst show to her Speak to them Lord open their ears to my message bring their sins to their minds and make them thirst for that salvation which Thou art ready to give
Lord Thou art with Thy people still they see Thee in the night watches and their hearts burn within them as Thou talkest with them by the way
And Thou art near to those who have not known Thee open their eyes that they may see Theesee Thee weeping over them and saying Ye will not come unto me that ye might have lifesee Thee hanging on the cross and saying Father forgive them for they know not what they dosee Thee as Thou wilt come again in Thy glory to judge them at the last
Amen
Dinah opened her eyes again and paused looking at the group of villagers who were now gathered rather more closely on her right hand
Dear friends she began raising her voice a little you have all of you been to church and I think you must have heard the clergyman read these words The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor
Jesus Christ spoke those wordshe said he came TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR
I dont know whether you ever thought about those words much but I will tell you when I remember first hearing them
It was on just such a sort of evening as this when I was a little girl and my aunt as brought me up took me to hear a good man preach out of doors just as we are here
I remember his face well he was a very old man and had very long white hair his voice was very soft and beautiful not like any voice I had ever heard before
I was a little girl and scarcely knew anything and this old man seemed to me such a different sort of a man from anybody I had ever seen before that I thought he had perhaps come down from the sky to preach to us and I said Aunt will he go back to the sky tonight like the picture in the Bible
That man of God was Mr Wesley who spent his life in doing what our blessed Lord didpreaching the Gospel to the poorand he entered into his rest eight years ago
I came to know more about him years after but I was a foolish thoughtless child then and I remembered only one thing he told us in his sermon
He told us as Gospel meant good news
The Gospel you know is what the Bible tells us about God
Think of that now
Jesus Christ did really come down from heaven as I like a silly child thought Mr Wesley did and what he came down for was to tell good news about God to the poor
Why you and me dear friends are poor
We have been brought up in poor cottages and have been reared on oatcake and lived coarse and we havent been to school much nor read books and we dont know much about anything but what happens just round us
We are just the sort of people that want to hear good news
For when anybodys well off they dont much mind about hearing news from distant parts but if a poor man or womans in trouble and has hard work to make out a living they like to have a letter to tell em theyve got a friend as will help em
To be sure we cant help knowing something about God even if weve never heard the Gospel the good news that our Saviour brought us
For we know everything comes from God dont you say almost every day This and that will happen please God and We shall begin to cut the grass soon please God to send us a little more sunshine
We know very well we are altogether in the hands of God
We didnt bring ourselves into the world we cant keep ourselves alive while were sleeping the daylight and the wind and the corn and the cows to give us milkeverything we have comes from God
And he gave us our souls and put love between parents and children and husband and wife
But is that as much as we want to know about God
We see he is great and mighty and can do what he will we are lost as if we was struggling in great waters when we try to think of him
But perhaps doubts come into your mind like this Can God take much notice of us poor people
Perhaps he only made the world for the great and the wise and the rich
It doesnt cost him much to give us our little handful of victual and bit of clothing but how do we know he cares for us any more than we care for the worms and things in the garden so as we rear our carrots and onions
Will God take care of us when we die
And has he any comfort for us when we are lame and sick and helpless
Perhaps too he is angry with us else why does the blight come and the bad harvests and the fever and all sorts of pain and trouble
For our life is full of trouble and if God sends us good he seems to send bad too
How is it
How is it
Ah dear friends we are in sad want of good news about God and what does other good news signify if we havent that
For everything else comes to an end and when we die we leave it all
But God lasts when everything else is gone
What shall we do if he is not our friend
Then Dinah told how the good news had been brought and how the mind of God towards the poor had been made manifest in the life of Jesus dwelling on its lowliness and its acts of mercy
So you see dear friends she went on Jesus spent his time almost all in doing good to poor people he preached out of doors to them and he made friends of poor workmen and taught them and took pains with them
Not but what he did good to the rich too for he was full of love to all men only he saw as the poor were more in want of his help
So he cured the lame and the sick and the blind and he worked miracles to feed the hungry because he said he was sorry for them and he was very kind to the little children and comforted those who had lost their friends and he spoke very tenderly to poor sinners that were sorry for their sins
Ah wouldnt you love such a man if you saw himif he were here in this village
What a kind heart he must have
What a friend he would be to go to in trouble
How pleasant it must be to be taught by him
Well dear friends who WAS this man
Was he only a good mana very good man and no morelike our dear Mr Wesley who has been taken from usHe was the Son of Godin the image of the Father the Bible says that means just like God who is the beginning and end of all thingsthe God we want to know about
So then all the love that Jesus showed to the poor is the same love that God has for us
We can understand what Jesus felt because he came in a body like ours and spoke words such as we speak to each other
We were afraid to think what God was before the God who made the world and the sky and the thunder and lightning
We could never see him we could only see the things he had made and some of these things was very terrible so as we might well tremble when we thought of him
But our blessed Saviour has showed us what God is in a way us poor ignorant people can understand he has showed us what Gods heart is what are his feelings towards us
But let us see a little more about what Jesus came on earth for
Another time he said I came to seek and to save that which was lost and another time I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
The LOSTSINNERSAh dear friends does that mean you and me
Hitherto the traveller had been chained to the spot against his will by the charm of Dinahs mellow treble tones which had a variety of modulation like that of a fine instrument touched with the unconscious skill of musical instinct
The simple things she said seemed like novelties as a melody strikes us with a new feeling when we hear it sung by the pure voice of a boyish chorister the quiet depth of conviction with which she spoke seemed in itself an evidence for the truth of her message
He saw that she had thoroughly arrested her hearers
The villagers had pressed nearer to her and there was no longer anything but grave attention on all faces
She spoke slowly though quite fluently often pausing after a question or before any transition of ideas
There was no change of attitude no gesture the effect of her speech was produced entirely by the inflections of her voice and when she came to the question Will God take care of us when we die
she uttered it in such a tone of plaintive appeal that the tears came into some of the hardest eyes
The stranger had ceased to doubt as he had done at the first glance that she could fix the attention of her rougher hearers but still he wondered whether she could have that power of rousing their more violent emotions which must surely be a necessary seal of her vocation as a Methodist preacher until she came to the words Lost Sinners
when there was a great change in her voice and manner
She had made a long pause before the exclamation and the pause seemed to be filled by agitating thoughts that showed themselves in her features
Her pale face became paler the circles under her eyes deepened as they did when tears halfgather without falling and the mild loving eyes took an expression of appalled pity as if she had suddenly discerned a destroying angel hovering over the heads of the people
Her voice became deep and muffled but there was still no gesture
Nothing could be less like the ordinary type of the Ranter than Dinah
She was not preaching as she heard others preach but speaking directly from her own emotions and under the inspiration of her own simple faith
But now she had entered into a new current of feeling
Her manner became less calm her utterance more rapid and agitated as she tried to bring home to the people their guilt their wilful darkness their state of disobedience to Godas she dwelt on the hatefulness of sin the Divine holiness and the sufferings of the Saviour by which a way had been opened for their salvation
At last it seemed as if in her yearning desire to reclaim the lost sheep she could not be satisfied by addressing her hearers as a body
She appealed first to one and then to another beseeching them with tears to turn to God while there was yet time painting to them the desolation of their souls lost in sin feeding on the husks of this miserable world far away from God their Father and then the love of the Saviour who was waiting and watching for their return
There was many a responsive sigh and groan from her fellow Methodists but the village mind does not easily take fire and a little smouldering vague anxiety that might easily die out again was the utmost effect Dinahs preaching had wrought in them at present
Yet no one had retired except the children and old Feyther Taft who being too deaf to catch many words had some time ago gone back to his inglenook
Wiry Ben was feeling very uncomfortable and almost wishing he had not come to hear Dinah he thought what she said would haunt him somehow
Yet he couldnt help liking to look at her and listen to her though he dreaded every moment that she would fix her eyes on him and address him in particular
She had already addressed Sandy Jim who was now holding the baby to relieve his wife and the big softhearted man had rubbed away some tears with his fist with a confused intention of being a better fellow going less to the Holly Bush down by the Stonepits and cleaning himself more regularly of a Sunday
In front of Sandy Jim stood Chads Bess who had shown an unwonted quietude and fixity of attention ever since Dinah had begun to speak
Not that the matter of the discourse had arrested her at once for she was lost in a puzzling speculation as to what pleasure and satisfaction there could be in life to a young woman who wore a cap like Dinahs
Giving up this inquiry in despair she took to studying Dinahs nose eyes mouth and hair and wondering whether it was better to have such a sort of pale face as that or fat red cheeks and round black eyes like her own
But gradually the influence of the general gravity told upon her and she became conscious of what Dinah was saying
The gentle tones the loving persuasion did not touch her but when the more severe appeals came she began to be frightened
Poor Bessy had always been considered a naughty girl she was conscious of it if it was necessary to be very good it was clear she must be in a bad way
She couldnt find her places at church as Sally Rann could she had often been tittering when she curcheyed to Mr Irwine and these religious deficiencies were accompanied by a corresponding slackness in the minor morals for Bessy belonged unquestionably to that unsoaped lazy class of feminine characters with whom you may venture to eat an egg an apple or a nut
All this she was generally conscious of and hitherto had not been greatly ashamed of it
But now she began to feel very much as if the constable had come to take her up and carry her before the justice for some undefined offence
She had a terrified sense that God whom she had always thought of as very far off was very near to her and that Jesus was close by looking at her though she could not see him
For Dinah had that belief in visible manifestations of Jesus which is common among the Methodists and she communicated it irresistibly to her hearers she made them feel that he was among them bodily and might at any moment show himself to them in some way that would strike anguish and penitence into their hearts
See
she exclaimed turning to the left with her eyes fixed on a point above the heads of the people
See where our blessed Lord stands and weeps and stretches out his arms towards you
Hear what he says How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not
and ye would not she repeated in a tone of pleading reproach turning her eyes on the people again
See the print of the nails on his dear hands and feet
It is your sins that made them
Ah
How pale and worn he looks
He has gone through all that great agony in the garden when his soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto death and the great drops of sweat fell like blood to the ground
They spat upon him and buffeted him they scourged him they mocked him they laid the heavy cross on his bruised shoulders
Then they nailed him up
Ah what pain
His lips are parched with thirst and they mock him still in this great agony yet with those parched lips he prays for them Father forgive them for they know not what they do
Then a horror of great darkness fell upon him and he felt what sinners feel when they are for ever shut out from God
That was the last drop in the cup of bitterness
My God my God
he cries why hast Thou forsaken me
All this he bore for you
For youand you never think of him for youand you turn your backs on him you dont care what he has gone through for you
Yet he is not weary of toiling for you he has risen from the dead he is praying for you at the right hand of GodFather forgive them for they know not what they do
And he is upon this earth too he is among us he is there close to you now I see his wounded body and his look of love
Here Dinah turned to Bessy Cranage whose bonny youth and evident vanity had touched her with pity
Poor child
Poor child
He is beseeching you and you dont listen to him
You think of earrings and fine gowns and caps and you never think of the Saviour who died to save your precious soul
Your cheeks will be shrivelled one day your hair will be grey your poor body will be thin and tottering
Then you will begin to feel that your soul is not saved then you will have to stand before God dressed in your sins in your evil tempers and vain thoughts
And Jesus who stands ready to help you now wont help you then because you wont have him to be your Saviour he will be your judge
Now he looks at you with love and mercy and says Come to me that you may have life then he will turn away from you and say Depart from me into everlasting fire
Poor Bessys wideopen black eyes began to fill with tears her great red cheeks and lips became quite pale and her face was distorted like a little childs before a burst of crying
Ah poor blind child
Dinah went on think if it should happen to you as it once happened to a servant of God in the days of her vanity
SHE thought of her lace caps and saved all her money to buy em she thought nothing about how she might get a clean heart and a right spiritshe only wanted to have better lace than other girls
And one day when she put her new cap on and looked in the glass she saw a bleeding Face crowned with thorns
That face is looking at you nowhere Dinah pointed to a spot close in front of BessyAh tear off those follies
Cast them away from you as if they were stinging adders
They ARE stinging youthey are poisoning your soulthey are dragging you down into a dark bottomless pit where you will sink for ever and for ever and for ever further away from light and God
Bessy could bear it no longer a great terror was upon her and wrenching her earrings from her ears she threw them down before her sobbing aloud
Her father Chad frightened lest he should be laid hold on too this impression on the rebellious Bess striking him as nothing less than a miracle walked hastily away and began to work at his anvil by way of reassuring himself
Folks mun ha hossshoes praichin or no praichin the divil canna lay hould o me for that he muttered to himself
But now Dinah began to tell of the joys that were in store for the penitent and to describe in her simple way the divine peace and love with which the soul of the believer is filledhow the sense of Gods love turns poverty into riches and satisfies the soul so that no uneasy desire vexes it no fear alarms it how at last the very temptation to sin is extinguished and heaven is begun upon earth because no cloud passes between the soul and God who is its eternal sun
Dear friends she said at last brothers and sisters whom I love as those for whom my Lord has died believe me I know what this great blessedness is and because I know it I want you to have it too
I am poor like you I have to get my living with my hands but no lord nor lady can be so happy as me if they havent got the love of God in their souls
Think what it isnot to hate anything but sin to be full of love to every creature to be frightened at nothing to be sure that all things will turn to good not to mind pain because it is our Fathers will to know that nothingno not if the earth was to be burnt up or the waters come and drown usnothing could part us from God who loves us and who fills our souls with peace and joy because we are sure that whatever he wills is holy just and good
Dear friends come and take this blessedness it is offered to you it is the good news that Jesus came to preach to the poor
It is not like the riches of this world so that the more one gets the less the rest can have
God is without end his love is without end Its streams the whole creation reach So plenteous is the store Enough for all enough for each Enough for evermore
Dinah had been speaking at least an hour and the reddening light of the parting day seemed to give a solemn emphasis to her closing words
The stranger who had been interested in the course of her sermon as if it had been the development of a dramafor there is this sort of fascination in all sincere unpremeditated eloquence which opens to one the inward drama of the speakers emotionsnow turned his horse aside and pursued his way while Dinah said Let us sing a little dear friends and as he was still winding down the slope the voices of the Methodists reached him rising and falling in that strange blending of exultation and sadness which belongs to the cadence of a hymn
Chapter III After the Preaching IN less than an hour from that time Seth Bede was walking by Dinahs side along the hedgerowpath that skirted the pastures and green cornfields which lay between the village and the Hall Farm
Dinah had taken off her little Quaker bonnet again and was holding it in her hands that she might have a freer enjoyment of the cool evening twilight and Seth could see the expression of her face quite clearly as he walked by her side timidly revolving something he wanted to say to her
It was an expression of unconscious placid gravityof absorption in thoughts that had no connection with the present moment or with her own personalityan expression that is most of all discouraging to a lover
Her very walk was discouraging it had that quiet elasticity that asks for no support
Seth felt this dimly he said to himself Shes too good and holy for any man let alone me and the words he had been summoning rushed back again before they had reached his lips
But another thought gave him courage Theres no man could love her better and leave her freer to follow the Lords work
They had been silent for many minutes now since they had done talking about Bessy Cranage Dinah seemed almost to have forgotten Seths presence and her pace was becoming so much quicker that the sense of their being only a few minutes walk from the yardgates of the Hall Farm at last gave Seth courage to speak
Youve quite made up your mind to go back to Snowfield o Saturday Dinah
Yes said Dinah quietly
Im called there
It was borne in upon my mind while I was meditating on Sunday night as Sister Allen whos in a decline is in need of me
I saw her as plain as we see that bit of thin white cloud lifting up her poor thin hand and beckoning to me
And this morning when I opened the Bible for direction the first words my eyes fell on were And after we had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia
If it wasnt for that clear showing of the Lords will I should be loath to go for my heart yearns over my aunt and her little ones and that poor wandering lamb Hetty Sorrel
Ive been much drawn out in prayer for her of late and I look on it as a token that there may be mercy in store for her
God grant it said Seth
For I doubt Adams heart is so set on her hell never turn to anybody else and yet it ud go to my heart if he was to marry her for I canna think as shed make him happy
Its a deep mysterythe way the heart of man turns to one woman out of all the rest hes seen i the world and makes it easier for him to work seven year for HER like Jacob did for Rachel sooner than have any other woman for th asking
I often think of them words And Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days for the love he had to her
I know those words ud come true with me Dinah if so be youd give me hope as I might win you after seven years was over
I know you think a husband ud be taking up too much o your thoughts because St Paul says She thats married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband and may happen youll think me overbold to speak to you about it again after what you told me o your mind last Saturday
But Ive been thinking it over again by night and by day and Ive prayed not to be blinded by my own desires to think whats only good for me must be good for you too
And it seems to me theres more texts for your marrying than ever you can find against it
For St Paul says as plain as can be in another place I will that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully and then two are better than one and that holds good with marriage as well as with other things
For we should be o one heart and o one mind Dinah
We both serve the same Master and are striving after the same gifts and Id never be the husband to make a claim on you as could interfere with your doing the work God has fitted you for
Id make a shift and fend indoor and out to give you more liberty more than you can have now for youve got to get your own living now and Im strong enough to work for us both
When Seth had once begun to urge his suit he went on earnestly and almost hurriedly lest Dinah should speak some decisive word before he had poured forth all the arguments he had prepared
His cheeks became flushed as he went on his mild grey eyes filled with tears and his voice trembled as he spoke the last sentence
They had reached one of those very narrow passes between two tall stones which performed the office of a stile in Loamshire and Dinah paused as she turned towards Seth and said in her tender but calm treble notes Seth Bede I thank you for your love towards me and if I could think of any man as more than a Christian brother I think it would be you
But my heart is not free to marry
That is good for other women and it is a great and a blessed thing to be a wife and mother but as God has distributed to every man as the Lord hath called every man so let him walk
God has called me to minister to others not to have any joys or sorrows of my own but to rejoice with them that do rejoice and to weep with those that weep
He has called me to speak his word and he has greatly owned my work
It could only be on a very clear showing that I could leave the brethren and sisters at Snowfield who are favoured with very little of this worlds good where the trees are few so that a child might count them and theres very hard living for the poor in the winter
It has been given me to help to comfort and strengthen the little flock there and to call in many wanderers and my soul is filled with these things from my rising up till my lying down
My life is too short and Gods work is too great for me to think of making a home for myself in this world
Ive not turned a deaf ear to your words Seth for when I saw as your love was given to me I thought it might be a leading of Providence for me to change my way of life and that we should be fellowhelpers and I spread the matter before the Lord
But whenever I tried to fix my mind on marriage and our living together other thoughts always came inthe times when Ive prayed by the sick and dying and the happy hours Ive had preaching when my heart was filled with love and the Word was given to me abundantly
And when Ive opened the Bible for direction Ive always lighted on some clear word to tell me where my work lay
I believe what you say Seth that you would try to be a help and not a hindrance to my work but I see that our marriage is not Gods willHe draws my heart another way
I desire to live and die without husband or children
I seem to have no room in my soul for wants and fears of my own it has pleased God to fill my heart so full with the wants and sufferings of his poor people
Seth was unable to reply and they walked on in silence
At last as they were nearly at the yardgate he said Well Dinah I must seek for strength to bear it and to endure as seeing Him who is invisible
But I feel now how weak my faith is
It seems as if when you are gone I could never joy in anything any more
I think its something passing the love of women as I feel for you for I could be content without your marrying me if I could go and live at Snowfield and be near you
I trusted as the strong love God has given me towards you was a leading for us both but it seems it was only meant for my trial
Perhaps I feel more for you than I ought to feel for any creature for I often cant help saying of you what the hymn says In darkest shades if she appear My dawning is begun She is my souls bright morningstar And she my rising sun
That may be wrong and I am to be taught better
But you wouldnt be displeased with me if things turned out so as I could leave this country and go to live at Snowfield
No Seth but I counsel you to wait patiently and not lightly to leave your own country and kindred
Do nothing without the Lords clear bidding
Its a bleak and barren country there not like this land of Goshen youve been used to
We mustnt be in a hurry to fix and choose our own lot we must wait to be guided
But youd let me write you a letter Dinah if there was anything I wanted to tell you
Yes sure let me know if youre in any trouble
Youll be continually in my prayers
They had now reached the yardgate and Seth said I wont go in Dinah so farewell
He paused and hesitated after she had given him her hand and then said Theres no knowing but what you may see things different after a while
There may be a new leading
Let us leave that Seth
Its good to live only a moment at a time as Ive read in one of Mr Wesleys books
It isnt for you and me to lay plans weve nothing to do but to obey and to trust
Farewell
Dinah pressed his hand with rather a sad look in her loving eyes and then passed through the gate while Seth turned away to walk lingeringly home
But instead of taking the direct road he chose to turn back along the fields through which he and Dinah had already passed and I think his blue linen handkerchief was very wet with tears long before he had made up his mind that it was time for him to set his face steadily homewards
He was but threeandtwenty and had only just learned what it is to loveto love with that adoration which a young man gives to a woman whom he feels to be greater and better than himself
Love of this sort is hardly distinguishable from religious feeling
What deep and worthy love is so whether of woman or child or art or music
Our caresses our tender words our still rapture under the influence of autumn sunsets or pillared vistas or calm majestic statues or Beethoven symphonies all bring with them the consciousness that they are mere waves and ripples in an unfathomable ocean of love and beauty our emotion in its keenest moment passes from expression into silence our love at its highest flood rushes beyond its object and loses itself in the sense of divine mystery
And this blessed gift of venerating love has been given to too many humble craftsmen since the world began for us to feel any surprise that it should have existed in the soul of a Methodist carpenter half a century ago while there was yet a lingering afterglow from the time when Wesley and his fellowlabourer fed on the hips and haws of the Cornwall hedges after exhausting limbs and lungs in carrying a divine message to the poor
That afterglow has long faded away and the picture we are apt to make of Methodism in our imagination is not an amphitheatre of green hills or the deep shade of broadleaved sycamores where a crowd of rough men and wearyhearted women drank in a faith which was a rudimentary culture which linked their thoughts with the past lifted their imagination above the sordid details of their own narrow lives and suffused their souls with the sense of a pitying loving infinite Presence sweet as summer to the houseless needy
It is too possible that to some of my readers Methodism may mean nothing more than lowpitched gables up dingy streets sleek grocers sponging preachers and hypocritical jargonelements which are regarded as an exhaustive analysis of Methodism in many fashionable quarters
That would be a pity for I cannot pretend that Seth and Dinah were anything else than Methodistsnot indeed of that modern type which reads quarterly reviews and attends in chapels with pillared porticoes but of a very oldfashioned kind
They believed in present miracles in instantaneous conversions in revelations by dreams and visions they drew lots and sought for Divine guidance by opening the Bible at hazard having a literal way of interpreting the Scriptures which is not at all sanctioned by approved commentators and it is impossibie for me to represent their diction as correct or their instruction as liberal
Still if I have read religious history arightfaith hope and charity have not always been found in a direct ratio with a sensibility to the three concords and it is possiblethank Heavento have very erroneous theories and very sublime feelings
The raw bacon which clumsy Molly spares from her own scanty store that she may carry it to her neighbours child to stop the fits may be a piteously inefficacious remedy but the generous stirring of neighbourly kindness that prompted the deed has a beneficent radiation that is not lost
Considering these things we can hardly think Dinah and Seth beneath our sympathy accustomed as we may be to weep over the loftier sorrows of heroines in satin boots and crinoline and of heroes riding fiery horses themselves ridden by still more fiery passions
Poor Seth
He was never on horseback in his life except once when he was a little lad and Mr Jonathan Burge took him up bebind telling him to hold on tight and instead of bursting out into wild accusing apostrophes to God and destiny he is resolving as he now walks homewards under the solemn starlight to repress his sadness to be less bent on having his own will and to live more for others as Dinah does
Chapter IV Home and Its Sorrows A GREEN valley with a brook running through it full almost to overflowing with the late rains overhung by low stooping willows
Across this brook a plank is thrown and over this plank Adam Bede is passing with his undoubting step followed close by Gyp with the basket evidently making his way to the thatched house with a stack of timber by the side of it about twenty yards up the opposite slope
The door of the house is open and an elderly woman is looking out but she is not placidly contemplating the evening sunshine she has been watching with dim eyes the gradually enlarging speck which for the last few minutes she has been quite sure is her darling son Adam
Lisbeth Bede loves her son with the love of a woman to whom her firstborn has come late in life
She is an anxious spare yet vigorous old woman clean as a snowdrop
Her grey hair is turned neatly back under a pure linen cap with a black band round it her broad chest is covered with a buff neckerchief and below this you see a sort of short bedgown made of bluecheckered linen tied round the waist and descending to the hips from whence there is a considerable length of linsey woolsey petticoat
For Lisbeth is tall and in other points too there is a strong likeness between her and her son Adam
Her dark eyes are somewhat dim nowperhaps from too much cryingbut her broadly marked eyebrows are still black her teeth are sound and as she stands knitting rapidly and unconsciously with her work hardened hands she has as firmly upright an attitude as when she is carrying a pail of water on her head from the spring
There is the same type of frame and the same keen activity of temperament in mother and son but it was not from her that Adam got his well filled brow and his expression of largehearted intelligence
Family likeness has often a deep sadness in it
Nature that great tragic dramatist knits us together by bone and muscle and divides us by the subtler web of our brains blends yearning and repulsion and ties us by our heartstrings to the beings that jar us at every movement
We hear a voice with the very cadence of our own uttering the thoughts we despise we see eyesah so like our mothersaverted from us in cold alienation and our last darling child startles us with the air and gestures of the sister we parted from in bitterness long years ago
The father to whom we owe our best heritagethe mechanical instinct the keen sensibility to harmony the unconscious skill of the modelling handgalls us and puts us to shame by his daily errors the long lost mother whose face we begin to see in the glass as our own wrinkles come once fretted our young souls with her anxious humours and irrational persistence
It is such a fond anxious mothers voice that you hear as Lisbeth says Well my lad its gone seven by th clock
Theet allays stay till the last childs born
Thee wants thy supper Ill warrand
Wheres Seth
Gone arter some os chapellin I reckon
Aye aye Seths at no harm mother thee mayst be sure
But wheres father
said Adam quickly as he entered the house and glanced into the room on the left hand which was used as a workshop
Hasnt he done the coffin for Tholer
Theres the stuff standing just as I left it this morning
Done the coffin
said Lisbeth following him and knitting uninterruptedly though she looked at her son very anxiously
Eh my lad he went aff to Treddleson this forenoon ans niver come back
I doubt hes got to th Waggin Overthrow again
A deep flush of anger passed rapidly over Adams face
He said nothing but threw off his jacket and began to roll up his shirt sleeves again
What art goin to do Adam
said the mother with a tone and look of alarm
Thee wouldstna go to work again wiout hain thy bit o supper
Adam too angry to speak walked into the workshop
But his mother threw down her knitting and hurrying after him took hold of his arm and said in a tone of plaintive remonstrance Nay my lad my lad thee munna go wiout thy supper theres the taters wi the gravy in em just as thee likst em
I saved em o purpose for thee
Come an ha thy supper come
Let be
said Adam impetuously shaking her off and seizing one of the planks that stood against the wall
Its fine talking about having supper when heres a coffin promised to be ready at Broxon by seven oclock tomorrow morning and ought to ha been there now and not a nail struck yet
My throats too full to swallow victuals
Why thee canstna get the coffin ready said Lisbeth
Theet work thyself to death
It ud take thee all night to dot
What signifies how long it takes me
Isnt the coffin promised
Can they bury the man without a coffin
Id work my right hand off sooner than deceive people with lies i that way
It makes me mad to think ont
I shall overrun these doings before long
Ive stood enough of em
Poor Lisbeth did not hear this threat for the first time and if she had been wise she would have gone away quietly and said nothing for the next hour
But one of the lessons a woman most rarely learns is never to talk to an angry or a drunken man
Lisbeth sat down on the chopping bench and began to cry and by the time she had cried enough to make her voice very piteous she burst out into words
Nay my lad my lad thee wouldstna go away an break thy mothers heart an leave thy feyther to ruin
Thee wouldstna ha em carry me to th churchyard an thee not to follow me
I shanna rest i my grave if I donna see thee at th last an hows they to let thee know as Im adyin if theet gone aworkin i distant parts an Seth belike gone arter thee and thy feyther not able to hold a pen fors hand shakin besides not knowin where thee art
Thee mun forgie thy feytherthee munna be so bitter again him
He war a good feyther to thee afore he took to th drink
Hes a clever workman an taught thee thy trade remember ans niver gen me a blow nor so much as an ill wordno not even in s drink
Thee wouldstna ha m go to the workhus thy own feytheran him as was a finegrowed man an handy at everythin amost as thee art thysen fiveantwenty ear ago when thee wast a baby at the breast
Lisbeths voice became louder and choked with sobsa sort of wail the most irritating of all sounds where real sorrows are to be borne and real work to be done
Adam broke in impatiently
Now Mother dont cry and talk so
Havent I got enough to vex me without that
Whats th use o telling me things as I only think too much on every day
If I didna think on em why should I do as I do for the sake o keeping things together here
But I hate to be talking where its no use I like to keep my breath for doing istead o talking
I know thee dost things as nobody else ud do my lad
But theet allays so hard upo thy feyther Adam
Thee thinkst nothing too much to do for Seth thee snappst me up if iver I find faut wi th lad
But theet so angered wi thy feyther more nor wi anybody else
Thats better than speaking soft and letting things go the wrong way I reckon isnt it
If I wasnt sharp with him hed sell every bit o stuff i th yard and spend it on drink
I know theres a duty to be done by my father but it isnt my duty to encourage him in running headlong to ruin
And what has Seth got to do with it
The lad does no harm as I know of
But leave me alone Mother and let me get on with the work
Lisbeth dared not say any more but she got up and called Gyp thinking to console herself somewhat for Adams refusal of the supper she had spread out in the loving expectation of looking at him while he ate it by feeding Adams dog with extra liberality
But Gyp was watching his master with wrinkled brow and ears erect puzzled at this unusual course of things and though he glanced at Lisbeth when she called him and moved his forepaws uneasily well knowing that she was inviting him to supper he was in a divided state of mind and remained seated on his haunches again fixing his eyes anxiously on his master
Adam noticed Gyps mental conflict and though his anger had made him less tender than usual to his mother it did not prevent him from caring as much as usual for his dog
We are apt to be kinder to the brutes that love us than to the women that love us
Is it because the brutes are dumb
Go Gyp go lad
Adam said in a tone of encouraging command and Gyp apparently satisfied that duty and pleasure were one followed Lisbeth into the houseplace
But no sooner had he licked up his supper than he went back to his master while Lisbeth sat down alone to cry over her knitting
Women who are never bitter and resentful are often the most querulous and if Solomon was as wise as he is reputed to be I feel sure that when he compared a contentious woman to a continual dropping on a very rainy day he had not a vixen in his eyea fury with long nails acrid and selfish
Depend upon it he meant a good creature who had no joy but in the happiness of the loved ones whom she contributed to make uncomfortable putting by all the tidbits for them and spending nothing on herself
Such a woman as Lisbeth for exampleat once patient and complaining selfrenouncing and exacting brooding the livelong day over what happened yesterday and what is likely to happen tomorrow and crying very readily both at the good and the evil
But a certain awe mingled itself with her idolatrous love of Adam and when he said Leave me alone she was always silenced
So the hours passed to the loud ticking of the old dayclock and the sound of Adams tools
At last he called for a light and a draught of water beer was a thing only to be drunk on holidays and Lisbeth ventured to say as she took it in Thy supper stans ready for thee when thee likst
Donna thee sit up mother said Adam in a gentle tone
He had worked off his anger now and whenever he wished to be especially kind to his mother he fell into his strongest native accent and dialect with which at other times his speech was less deeply tinged
Ill see to Father when he comes home maybe he wonna come at all tonight
I shall be easier if theet i bed
Nay Ill bide till Seth comes
He wonna be long now I reckon
It was then past nine by the clock which was always in advance of the days and before it had struck ten the latch was lifted and Seth entered
He had heard the sound of the tools as he was approaching
Why Mother he said how is it as Fathers working so late
Its none o thy feyther as is aworkinthee might know that well anoof if thy head warna full o chapellinits thy brother as does iverything for theres niver nobody else i th way to do nothin
Lisbeth was going on for she was not at all afraid of Seth and usually poured into his ears all the querulousness which was repressed by her awe of Adam
Seth had never in his life spoken a harsh word to his mother and timid people always wreak their peevishness on the gentle
But Seth with an anxious look had passed into the workshop and said Addy hows this
What
Fathers forgot the coffin
Aye lad th old tale but I shall get it done said Adam looking up and casting one of his bright keen glances at his brother
Why whats the matter with thee
Theet in trouble
Seths eyes were red and there was a look of deep depression on his mild face
Yes Addy but its what must be borne and cant be helped
Why theest never been to the school then
School
No that screw can wait said Adam hammering away again
Let me take my turn now and do thee go to bed said Seth
No lad Id rather go on now Im in harness
Theet help me to carry it to Broxon when its done
Ill call thee up at sunrise
Go and eat thy supper and shut the door so as I maynt hear Mothers talk
Seth knew that Adam always meant what he said and was not to be persuaded into meaning anything else
So he turned with rather a heavy heart into the houseplace
Adams niver touched a bit o victual sin home hes come said Lisbeth
I reckon theest hed thy supper at some o thy Methody folks
Nay Mother said Seth Ive had no supper yet
Come then said Lisbeth but donna thee ate the taters for Adam ull happen ate em if I leave em stannin
He loves a bit o taters an gravy
But hes been so sore an angered he wouldnt ate em for all Id putten em by o purpose for him
An hes been athreatenin to go away again she went on whimpering an Im fast sure hell go some dawnin afore Im up an niver let me know aforehand an hell niver come back again when once hes gone
An Id better niver ha had a son as is like no other bodys son for the deftness an th handiness an so looked on by th grit folks an tall an upright like a poplartree an me to be parted from him an niver see m no more
Come Mother donna grieve thyself in vain said Seth in a soothing voice
Theest not half so good reason to think as Adam ull go away as to think hell stay with thee
He may say such a thing when hes in wrathand hes got excuse for being wrathful sometimesbut his heart ud never let him go
Think how hes stood by us all when its been none so easypaying his savings to free me from going for a soldier an turnin his earnins into wood for father when hes got plenty o uses for his money and many a young man like him ud ha been married and settled before now
Hell never turn round and knock down his own work and forsake them as its been the labour of his life to stand by
Donna talk to me abouts marrin said Lisbeth crying afresh
Hes sets heart on that Hetty Sorrel as ull niver save a penny an ull toss up her head ats old mother
An to think as he might ha Mary Burge an be took partners an be a big man wi workmen under him like Mester BurgeDollys told me so oer and oer againif it warna as hes sets heart on that bit of a wench as is o no more use nor the gillyflower on the wall
An he so wise at bookin an figurin an not to know no better nor that
But Mother thee knowst we canna love just where other folks ud have us
Theres nobody but God can control the heart of man
I could ha wished myself as Adam could ha made another choice but I wouldnt reproach him for what he cant help
And Im not sure but what he tries to oercome it
But its a matter as he doesnt like to be spoke to about and I can only pray to the Lord to bless and direct him
Aye theet allays ready enough at prayin but I donna see as thee gets much wi thy prayin
Thee wotna get double earnins o this side Yule
Th Methodies ll niver make thee half the man thy brother is for all theyre amakin a preacher on thee
Its partly truth thee speakst there Mother said Seth mildly Adams far before me ans done more for me than I can ever do for him
God distributes talents to every man according as He sees good
But thee mustna undervally prayer
Prayer mayna bring money but it brings us what no money can buya power to keep from sin and be content with Gods will whatever He may please to send
If thee wouldst pray to God to help thee and trust in His goodness thee wouldstna be so uneasy about things
Unaisy
Im i th right ont to be unaisy
Its well seen on THEE what it is niver to be unaisy
Theet gi away all thy earnins an niver be unaisy as theest nothin laid up again a rainy day
If Adam had been as aisy as thee hed niver ha had no money to pay for thee
Take no thought for the morrowtake no thoughtthats what theet allays sayin an what comes ont
Why as Adam has to take thought for thee
Those are the words o the Bible Mother said Seth
They dont mean as we should be idle
They mean we shouldnt be overanxious and worreting ourselves about whatll happen to morrow but do our duty and leave the rest to Gods will
Aye aye thats the way wi thee thee allays makes a peck o thy own words out o a pint o the Bibles
I donna see how theet to know as take no thought for the morrow means all that
An when the Bibles such a big book an thee canst read all throt an ha the pick o the texes I canna think why thee dostna pick better words as donna mean so much more nor they say
Adam doesna pick a thatn I can understan the tex as hes allays asayin God helps them as helps theirsens
Nay Mother said Seth thats no text o the Bible
It comes out of a book as Adam picked up at the stall at Treddleson
It was wrote by a knowing man but overworldly I doubt
However that sayings partly true for the Bible tells us we must be workers together with God
Well howm I to know
It sounds like a tex
But whats th matter wi th lad
Theet hardly atin a bit o supper
Dostna mean to ha no more nor that bit o oatcake
An thee lookst as white as a flick o new bacon
Whats th matter wi thee
Nothing to mind about Mother Im not hungry
Ill just look in at Adam again and see if hell let me go on with the coffin
Ha a drop o warm broth
said Lisbeth whose motherly feeling now got the better of her nattering habit
Ill set twothree sticks alight in a minute
Nay Mother thank thee theet very good said Seth gratefully and encouraged by this touch of tenderness he went on Let me pray a bit with thee for Father and Adam and all of usitll comfort thee happen more than thee thinkst
Well Ive nothin to say again it
Lisbeth though disposed always to take the negative side in her conversations with Seth had a vague sense that there was some comfort and safety in the fact of his piety and that it somehow relieved her from the trouble of any spiritual transactions on her own behalf
So the mother and son knelt down together and Seth prayed for the poor wandering father and for those who were sorrowing for him at home
And when he came to the petition that Adam might never be called to set up his tent in a far country but that his mother might be cheered and comforted by his presence all the days of her pilgrimage Lisbeths ready tears flowed again and she wept aloud
When they rose from their knees Seth went to Adam again and said Wilt only lie down for an hour or two and let me go on the while
No Seth no
Make Mother go to bed and go thyself
Meantime Lisbeth had dried her eyes and now followed Seth holding something in her hands
It was the brownandyellow platter containing the baked potatoes with the gravy in them and bits of meat which she had cut and mixed among them
Those were dear times when wheaten bread and fresh meat were delicacies to working people
She set the dish down rather timidly on the bench by Adams side and said Thee canst pick a bit while theet workin
Ill bring thee another drop o water
Aye Mother do said Adam kindly Im getting very thirsty
In half an hour all was quiet no sound was to be heard in the house but the loud ticking of the old dayclock and the ringing of Adams tools
The night was very still when Adam opened the door to look out at twelve oclock the only motion seemed to be in the glowing twinkling stars every blade of grass was asleep
Bodily haste and exertion usually leave our thoughts very much at the mercy of our feelings and imagination and it was so tonight with Adam
While his muscles were working lustily his mind seemed as passive as a spectator at a diorama scenes of the sad past and probably sad future floating before him and giving place one to the other in swift sucession
He saw how it would be tomorrow morning when he had carried the coffin to Broxton and was at home again having his breakfast his father perhaps would come in ashamed to meet his sons glance would sit down looking older and more tottering than he had done the morning before and hang down his head examining the floor quarries while Lisbeth would ask him how he supposed the coffin had been got ready that he had slinked off and left undonefor Lisbeth was always the first to utter the word of reproach although she cried at Adams severity towards his father
So it will go on worsening and worsening thought Adam theres no slipping uphill again and no standing still when once youve begun to slip down
And then the day came back to him when he was a little fellow and used to run by his fathers side proud to be taken out to work and prouder still to hear his father boasting to his fellowworkmen how the little chap had an uncommon notion o carpentering
What a fine active fellow his father was then
When people asked Adam whose little lad he was he had a sense of distinction as he answered Im Thias Bedes lad
He was quite sure everybody knew Thias Bededidnt he make the wonderful pigeonhouse at Broxton parsonage
Those were happy days especially when Seth who was three years the younger began to go out working too and Adam began to be a teacher as well as a learner
But then came the days of sadness when Adam was someway on in his teens and Thias began to loiter at the publichouses and Lisbeth began to cry at home and to pour forth her plaints in the hearing of her sons
Adam remembered well the night of shame and anguish when he first saw his father quite wild and foolish shouting a song out fitfully among his drunken companions at the Waggon Overthrown
He had run away once when he was only eighteen making his escape in the morning twilight with a little blue bundle over his shoulder and his mensuration book in his pocket and saying to himself very decidedly that he could bear the vexations of home no longerhe would go and seek his fortune setting up his stick at the crossways and bending his steps the way it fell
But by the time he got to Stoniton the thought of his mother and Seth left behind to endure everything without him became too importunate and his resolution failed him
He came back the next day but the misery and terror his mother had gone through in those two days had haunted her ever since
No
Adam said to himself tonight that must never happen again
It ud make a poor balance when my doings are cast up at the last if my poor old mother stood o the wrong side
My backs broad enough and strong enough I should be no better than a coward to go away and leave the troubles to be borne by them as arent half so able
They that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of those that are weak and not to please themselves
Theres a text wants no candle to showt it shines by its own light
Its plain enough you get into the wrong road i this life if you run after this and that only for the sake o making things easy and pleasant to yourself
A pig may poke his nose into the trough and think o nothing outside it but if youve got a mans heart and soul in you you cant be easy amaking your own bed an leaving the rest to lie on the stones
Nay nay Ill never slip my neck out o the yoke and leave the load to be drawn by the weak uns
Fathers a sore cross to me ans likely to be for many a long year to come
What then
Ive got th health and the limbs and the sperrit to bear it
At this moment a smart rap as if with a willow wand was given at the house door and Gyp instead of barking as might have been expected gave a loud howl
Adam very much startled went at once to the door and opened it
Nothing was there all was still as when he opened it an hour before the leaves were motionless and the light of the stars showed the placid fields on both sides of the brook quite empty of visible life
Adam walked round the house and still saw nothing except a rat which darted into the woodshed as he passed
He went in again wondering the sound was so peculiar that the moment he heard it it called up the image of the willow wand striking the door
He could not help a little shudder as he remembered how often his mother had told him of just such a sound coming as a sign when some one was dying
Adam was not a man to be gratuitously superstitious but he had the blood of the peasant in him as well as of the artisan and a peasant can no more help believing in a traditional superstition than a horse can help trembling when he sees a camel
Besides he had that mental combination which is at once humble in the region of mystery and keen in the region of knowledge it was the depth of his reverence quite as much as his hard common sense which gave him his disinclination to doctrinal religion and he often checked Seths argumentative spiritualism by saying Eh its a big mystery thee knowst but little about it
And so it happened that Adam was at once penetrating and credulous
If a new building had fallen down and he had been told that this was a divine judgment he would have said May be but the bearing o the roof and walls wasnt right else it wouldnt ha come down yet he believed in dreams and prognostics and to his dying day he bated his breath a little when he told the story of the stroke with the willow wand
I tell it as he told it not attempting to reduce it to its natural elementsin our eagerness to explain impressions we often lose our hold of the sympathy that comprehends them
But he had the best antidote against imaginative dread in the necessity for getting on with the coffin and for the next ten minutes his hammer was ringing so uninterruptedly that other sounds if there were any might well be overpowered
A pause came however when he had to take up his ruler and now again came the strange rap and again Gyp howled
Adam was at the door without the loss of a moment but again all was still and the starlight showed there was nothing but the dewladen grass in front of the cottage
Adam for a moment thought uncomfortably about his father but of late years he had never come home at dark hours from Treddleston and there was every reason for believing that he was then sleeping off his drunkenness at the Waggon Overthrown
Besides to Adam the conception of the future was so inseparable from the painful image of his father that the fear of any fatal accident to him was excluded by the deeply infixed fear of his continual degradation
The next thought that occurred to him was one that made him slip off his shoes and tread lightly upstairs to listen at the bedroom doors
But both Seth and his mother were breathing regularly
Adam came down and set to work again saying to himself I wont open the door again
Its no use staring about to catch sight of a sound
Maybe theres a world about us as we cant see but th ears quicker than the eye and catches a sound fromt now and then
Some people think they get a sight ont too but theyre mostly folks whose eyes are not much use to em at anything else
For my part I think its better to see when your perpendiculars true than to see a ghost
Such thoughts as these are apt to grow stronger and stronger as daylight quenches the candles and the birds begin to sing
By the time the red sunlight shone on the brass nails that formed the initials on the lid of the coffin any lingering foreboding from the sound of the willow wand was merged in satisfaction that the work was done and the promise redeemed
There was no need to call Seth for he was already moving overhead and presently came downstairs
Now lad said Adam as Seth made his appearance the coffins done and we can take it over to Broxon and be back again before half after six
Ill take a mouthful o oatcake and then well be off
The coffin was soon propped on the tall shoulders of the two brothers and they were making their way followed close by Gyp out of the little woodyard into the lane at the back of the house
It was but about a mile and a half to Broxton over the opposite slope and their road wound very pleasantly along lanes and across fields where the pale woodbines and the dogroses were scenting the hedgerows and the birds were twittering and trilling in the tall leafy boughs of oak and elm
It was a strangely mingled picturethe fresh youth of the summer morning with its Edenlike peace and loveliness the stalwart strength of the two brothers in their rusty working clothes and the long coffin on their shoulders
They paused for the last time before a small farmhouse outside the village of Broxton
By six oclock the task was done the coffin nailed down and Adam and Seth were on their way home
They chose a shorter way homewards which would take them across the fields and the brook in front of the house
Adam had not mentioned to Seth what had happened in the night but he still retained sufficient impression from it himself to say Seth lad if Father isnt come home by the time weve had our breakfast I think itll be as well for thee to go over to Treddleson and look after him and thee canst get me the brass wire I want
Never mind about losing an hour at thy work we can make that up
What dost say
Im willing said Seth
But see what clouds have gathered since we set out
Im thinking we shall have more rain
Itll be a sore time for th haymaking if the meadows are flooded again
The brooks fine and full now another days rain ud cover the plank and we should have to go round by the road
They were coming across the valley now and had entered the pasture through which the brook ran
Why whats that sticking against the willow
continued Seth beginning to walk faster
Adams heart rose to his mouth the vague anxiety about his father was changed into a great dread
He made no answer to Seth but ran forward preceded by Gyp who began to bark uneasily and in two moments he was at the bridge
This was what the omen meant then
And the greyhaired father of whom he had thought with a sort of hardness a few hours ago as certain to live to be a thorn in his side was perhaps even then struggling with that watery death
This was the first thought that flashed through Adams conscience before he had time to seize the coat and drag out the tall heavy body
Seth was already by his side helping him and when they had it on the bank the two sons in the first moment knelt and looked with mute awe at the glazed eyes forgetting that there was need for actionforgetting everything but that their father lay dead before them
Adam was the first to speak
Ill run to Mother he said in a loud whisper
Ill be back to thee in a minute
Poor Lisbeth was busy preparing her sons breakfast and their porridge was already steaming on the fire
Her kitchen always looked the pink of cleanliness but this morning she was more than usually bent on making her hearth and breakfasttable look comfortable and inviting
The lads ull be fine an hungry she said halfaloud as she stirred the porridge
Its a good step to Broxon an its hungry air oer the hillwi that heavy coffin too
Eh
Its heavier now wi poor Bob Tholer int
Howiver Ive made a drap more porridge nor common this mornin
The feyther ull happen come in arter a bit
Not as hell ate much porridge
He swallers sixpennorth o ale an saves a haporth o porridgethats his way o layin by money as Ive told him many a time an am likely to tell him again afore the days out
Eh poor mon he takes it quiet enough theres no denyin that
But now Lisbeth heard the heavy thud of a running footstep on the turf and turning quickly towards the door she saw Adam enter looking so pale and overwhelmed that she screamed aloud and rushed towards him before he had time to speak
Hush Mother Adam said rather hoarsely dont be frightened
Fathers tumbled into the water
Belike we may bring him round again
Seth and me are going to carry him in
Get a blanket and make it hot as the fire
In reality Adam was convinced that his father was dead but he knew there was no other way of repressing his mothers impetuous wailing grief than by occupying her with some active task which had hope in it
He ran back to Seth and the two sons lifted the sad burden in heartstricken silence
The wideopen glazed eyes were grey like Seths and had once looked with mild pride on the boys before whom Thias had lived to hang his head in shame
Seths chief feeling was awe and distress at this sudden snatching away of his fathers soul but Adams mind rushed back over the past in a flood of relenting and pity
When death the great Reconciler has come it is never our tenderness that we repent of but our severity
Chapter V The Rector BEFORE twelve oclock there had been some heavy storms of rain and the water lay in deep gutters on the sides of the gravel walks in the garden of Broxton Parsonage the great Provence roses had been cruelly tossed by the wind and beaten by the rain and all the delicatestemmed border flowers had been dashed down and stained with the wet soil
A melancholy morningbecause it was nearly time hayharvest should begin and instead of that the meadows were likely to be flooded
But people who have pleasant homes get indoor enjoyments that they would never think of but for the rain
If it had not been a wet morning Mr Irwine would not have been in the diningroom playing at chess with his mother and he loves both his mother and chess quite well enough to pass some cloudy hours very easily by their help
Let me take you into that diningroom and show you the Rev
Adolphus Irwine Rector of Broxton Vicar of Hayslope and Vicar of Blythe a pluralist at whom the severest Church reformer would have found it difficult to look sour
We will enter very softly and stand still in the open doorway without awaking the glossy brown setter who is stretched across the hearth with her two puppies beside her or the pug who is dozing with his black muzzle aloft like a sleepy president
The room is a large and lofty one with an ample mullioned oriel window at one end the walls you see are new and not yet painted but the furniture though originally of an expensive sort is old and scanty and there is no drapery about the window
The crimson cloth over the large diningtable is very threadbare though it contrasts pleasantly enough with the dead hue of the plaster on the walls but on this cloth there is a massive silver waiter with a decanter of water on it of the same pattern as two larger ones that are propped up on the sideboard with a coat of arms conspicuous in their centre
You suspect at once that the inhabitants of this room have inherited more blood than wealth and would not be surprised to find that Mr Irwine had a finely cut nostril and upper lip but at present we can only see that he has a broad flat back and an abundance of powdered hair all thrown backward and tied behind with a black ribbona bit of conservatism in costume which tells you that he is not a young man
He will perhaps turn round by and by and in the meantime we can look at that stately old lady his mother a beautiful aged brunette whose richtoned complexion is well set off by the complex wrappings of pure white cambric and lace about her head and neck
She is as erect in her comely embonpoint as a statue of Ceres and her dark face with its delicate aquiline nose firm proud mouth and small intense black eye is so keen and sarcastic in its expression that you instinctively substitute a pack of cards for the chessmen and imagine her telling your fortune
The small brown hand with which she is lifting her queen is laden with pearls diamonds and turquoises and a large black veil is very carefully adjusted over the crown of her cap and falls in sharp contrast on the white folds about her neck
It must take a long time to dress that old lady in the morning
But it seems a law of nature that she should be dressed so she is clearly one of those children of royalty who have never doubted their right divine and never met with any one so absurd as to question it
There Dauphin tell me what that is
says this magnificent old lady as she deposits her queen very quietly and folds her arms
I should be sorry to utter a word disagreeable to your feelings
Ah you witchmother you sorceress
How is a Christian man to win a game off you
I should have sprinkled the board with holy water before we began
Youve not won that game by fair means now so dont pretend it
Yes yes thats what the beaten have always said of great conquerors
But see theres the sunshine falling on the board to show you more clearly what a foolish move you made with that pawn
Come shall I give you another chance
No Mother I shall leave you to your own conscience now its clearing up
We must go and plash up the mud a little musnt we Juno
This was addressed to the brown setter who had jumped up at the sound of the voices and laid her nose in an insinuating way on her masters leg
But I must go upstairs first and see Anne
I was called away to Tholers funeral just when I was going before
Its of no use child she cant speak to you
Kate says she has one of her worst headaches this morning
Oh she likes me to go and see her just the same shes never too ill to care about that
If you know how much of human speech is mere purposeless impulse or habit you will not wonder when I tell you that this identical objection had been made and had received the same kind of answer many hundred times in the course of the fifteen years that Mr Irwines sister Anne had been an invalid
Splendid old ladies who take a long time to dress in the morning have often slight sympathy with sickly daughters
But while Mr Irwine was still seated leaning back in his chair and stroking Junos head the servant came to the door and said If you please sir Joshua Rann wishes to speak with you if you are at liberty
Let him be shown in here said Mrs Irwine taking up her knitting
I always like to hear what Mr Rann has got to say
His shoes will be dirty but see that he wipes them Carroll
In two minutes Mr Rann appeared at the door with very deferential bows which however were far from conciliating Pug who gave a sharp bark and ran across the room to reconnoitre the strangers legs while the two puppies regarding Mr Ranns prominent calf and ribbed worsted stockings from a more sensuous point of view plunged and growled over them in great enjoyment
Meantime Mr Irwine turned round his chair and said Well Joshua anything the matter at Hayslope that youve come over this damp morning
Sit down sit down
Never mind the dogs give them a friendly kick
Here Pug you rascal
It is very pleasant to see some men turn round pleasant as a sudden rush of warm air in winter or the flash of firelight in the chill dusk
Mr Irwine was one of those men
He bore the same sort of resemblance to his mother that our loving memory of a friends face often bears to the face itself the lines were all more generous the smile brighter the expression heartier
If the outline had been less finely cut his face might have been called jolly but that was not the right word for its mixture of bonhomie and distinction
Thank Your Reverence answered Mr Rann endeavouring to look unconcerned about his legs but shaking them alternately to keep off the puppies Ill stand if you please as more becoming
I hope I see you an Mrs Irwine well an Miss Irwinean Miss Anne I hopes as well as usual
Yes Joshua thank you
You see how blooming my mother looks
She beats us younger people hollow
But whats the matter
Why sir I had to come to Broxon to deliver some work and I thought it but right to call and let you know the goinson as theres been i the village such as I hanna seen i my time and Ive lived in it man and boy sixty year come St Thomas and collected th Easter dues for Mr Blick before Your Reverence come into the parish and been at the ringin o every bell and the diggin o every grave and sung i the choir long afore Bartle Massey come from nobody knows where wi his countersingin and fine anthems as puts everybody out but himselfone takin it up after another like sheep ableatin i th fold
I know what belongs to bein a parish clerk and I know as I should be wantin i respect to Your Reverence an church an king if I was t allow such goinson wiout speakin
I was took by surprise an knowed nothin on it beforehand an I was so flustered I was clean as if Id lost my tools
I hanna slep more nor four hour this night as is past an gone an then it was nothin but nightmare as tired me worse nor wakin
Why what in the world is the matter Joshua
Have the thieves been at the church lead again
Thieves
No siran yet as I may say it is thieves an a thievin the church too
Its the Methodisses as is like to get th upper hand i th parish if Your Reverence an His Honour Squire Donnithorne doesna think well to say the word an forbid it
Not as Im adictatin to you sir Im not forgettin myself so far as to be wise above my betters
Howiver whether Im wise or no thats neither here nor there but what Ive got to say I sayas the young Methodis woman as is at Mester Poysers was a preachin an aprayin on the Green last night as sure as Im a stannin afore Your Reverence now
Preaching on the Green
said Mr Irwine looking surprised but quite serene
What that pale pretty young woman Ive seen at Poysers
I saw she was a Methodist or Quaker or something of that sort by her dress but I didnt know she was a preacher
Its a true word as I say sir rejoined Mr Rann compressing his mouth into a semicircular form and pausing long enough to indicate three notes of exclamation
She preached on the Green last night an shes laid hold of Chads Bess as the girls been i fits welly iver sin
Well Bessy Cranage is a heartylooking lass I daresay shell come round again Joshua
Did anybody else go into fits
No sir I canna say as they did
But theres no knowin whatll come if were t have such preachins as that agoin on ivery weektherell be no livin i th village
For them Methodisses make folks believe as if they take a mug o drink extry an make theirselves a bit comfortable theyll have to go to hell fort as sure as theyre born
Im not a tipplin man nor a drunkard nobody can say it on mebut I like a extry quart at Easter or Christmas time as is natral when were goin the rounds a singin an folks offert you for nothin or when Im a collectin the dues an I like a pint wi my pipe an a neighbourly chat at Mester Cassons now an then for I was brought up i the Church thank God an ha been a parish clerk this twoanthirty year I should know what the church religion is
Well whats your advice Joshua
What do you think should be done
Well Your Reverence Im not for takin any measures again the young woman
Shes well enough if shed let alone preachin an I hear as shes agoin away back to her own country soon
Shes Mr Poysers own niece an I donna wish to say whats anyways disrespectful o th family at th Hall Farm as Ive measured for shoes little an big welly iver sin Ive been a shoemaker
But theres that Will Maskery sir as is the rampageousest Methodis as can be an I make no doubt it was him as stirred up th young woman to preach last night an hell be abringin other folks to preach from Treddleson if his comb isnt cut a bit an I think as he should be let know as he isna t have the makin an mendin o church carts an implemens let alone stayin i that house an yard as is Squire Donnithornes
Well but you say yourself Joshua that you never knew any one come to preach on the Green before why should you think theyll come again
The Methodists dont come to preach in little villages like Hayslope where theres only a handful of labourers too tired to listen to them
They might almost as well go and preach on the Binton Hills
Will Maskery is no preacher himself I think
Nay sir hes no gift at stringin the words together wiout book hed be stuck fast like a cow i wet clay
But hes got tongue enough to speak disrespectful abouts neebors for he said as I was a blind Phariseeausin the Bible i that way to find nicknames for folks as are his elders an bettersand whats worse hes been heard to say very unbecomin words about Your Reverence for I could bring them as ud swear as he called you a dumb dog an a idle shepherd
Youll forgie me for sayin such things over again
Better not better not Joshua
Let evil words die as soon as theyre spoken
Will Maskery might be a great deal worse fellow than he is
He used to be a wild drunken rascal neglecting his work and beating his wife they told me now hes thrifty and decent and he and his wife look comfortable together
If you can bring me any proof that he interferes with his neighbours and creates any disturbance I shall think it my duty as a clergyman and a magistrate to interfere
But it wouldnt become wise people like you and me to be making a fuss about trifles as if we thought the Church was in danger because Will Maskery lets his tongue wag rather foolishly or a young woman talks in a serious way to a handful of people on the Green
We must live and let live Joshua in religion as well as in other things
You go on doing your duty as parish clerk and sexton as well as youve always done it and making those capital thick boots for your neighbours and things wont go far wrong in Hayslope depend upon it
Your Reverence is very good to say so an Im sensable as you not livin i the parish theres more upo my shoulders
To be sure and you must mind and not lower the Church in peoples eyes by seeming to be frightened about it for a little thing Joshua
I shall trust to your good sense now to take no notice at all of what Will Maskery says either about you or me
You and your neighbours can go on taking your pot of beer soberly when youve done your days work like good churchmen and if Will Maskery doesnt like to join you but to go to a prayermeeting at Treddleston instead let him thats no business of yours so long as he doesnt hinder you from doing what you like
And as to people saying a few idle words about us we must not mind that any more than the old churchsteeple minds the rooks cawing about it
Will Maskery comes to church every Sunday afternoon and does his wheelwrights business steadily in the weekdays and as long as he does that he must be let alone
Ah sir but when he comes to church he sits an shakes his head an looks as sour an as coxy when were asingin as I should like to fetch him a rap across the jowlGod forgie me an Mrs Irwine an Your Reverence too for speakin so afore you
An he said as our Christmas singin was no better nor the cracklin o thorns under a pot
Well hes got a bad ear for music Joshua
When people have wooden heads you know it cant be helped
He wont bring the other people in Hayslope round to his opinion while you go on singing as well as you do
Yes sir but it turns a mans stomach t hear the Scripture misused i that way
I know as much o the words o the Bible as he does an could say the Psalms right through i my sleep if you was to pinch me but I know better nor to take em to say my own say wi
I might as well take the Sacrimentcup home and use it at meals
Thats a very sensible remark of yours Joshua but as I said before While Mr Irwine was speaking the sound of a booted step and the clink of a spur were heard on the stone floor of the entrance hall and Joshua Rann moved hastily aside from the doorway to make room for some one who paused there and said in a ringing tenor voice Godson Arthurmay he come in
Come in come in godson
Mrs Irwine answered in the deep halfmasculine tone which belongs to the vigorous old woman and there entered a young gentleman in a ridingdress with his right arm in a sling whereupon followed that pleasant confusion of laughing interjections and handshakings and How are yous
mingled with joyous short barks and wagging of tails on the part of the canine members of the family which tells that the visitor is on the best terms with the visited
The young gentleman was Arthur Donnithorne known in Hayslope variously as the young squire the heir and the captain
He was only a captain in the Loamshire Militia but to the Hayslope tenants he was more intensely a captain than all the young gentlemen of the same rank in his Majestys regularshe outshone them as the planet Jupiter outshines the Milky Way
If you want to know more particularly how he looked call to your remembrance some tawnywhiskered brownlocked clearcomplexioned young Englishman whom you have met with in a foreign town and been proud of as a fellow countrymanwellwashed highbred whitehanded yet looking as if he could deliver well from the left shoulder and floor his man I will not be so much of a tailor as to trouble your imagination with the difference of costume and insist on the striped waistcoat longtailed coat and low topboots
Turning round to take a chair Captain Donnithorne said But dont let me interrupt Joshuas businesshe has something to say
Humbly begging Your Honours pardon said Joshua bowing low there was one thing I had to say to His Reverence as other things had drove out o my head
Out with it Joshua quickly
said Mr Irwine
Belike sir you havena heared as Thias Bedes deaddrownded this morning or more like overnight i the Willow Brook again the bridge right i front o the house
Ah
exclaimed both the gentlemen at once as if they were a good deal interested in the information
An Seth Bedes been to me this morning to say he wished me to tell Your Reverence as his brother Adam begged of you particular t allow his fathers grave to be dug by the White Thorn because his mothers set her heart on it on account of a dream as she had an theyd ha come theirselves to ask you but theyve so much to see after with the crowner an that an their mothers took on so an wants em to make sure o the spot for fear somebody else should take it
An if Your Reverence sees well and good Ill send my boy to tell em as soon as I get home an thats why I make bold to trouble you wi it His Honour being present
To be sure Joshua to be sure they shall have it
Ill ride round to Adam myself and see him
Send your boy however to say they shall have the grave lest anything should happen to detain me
And now good morning Joshua go into the kitchen and have some ale
Poor old Thias
said Mr Irwine when Joshua was gone
Im afraid the drink helped the brook to drown him
I should have been glad for the load to have been taken off my friend Adams shoulders in a less painful way
That fine fellow has been propping up his father from ruin for the last five or six years
Hes a regular trump is Adam said Captain Donnithorne
When I was a little fellow and Adam was a strapping lad of fifteen and taught me carpentering I used to think if ever I was a rich sultan I would make Adam my grandvizier
And I believe now he would bear the exaltation as well as any poor wise man in an Eastern story
If ever I live to be a largeacred man instead of a poor devil with a mortgaged allowance of pocketmoney Ill have Adam for my right hand
He shall manage my woods for me for he seems to have a better notion of those things than any man I ever met with and I know he would make twice the money of them that my grandfather does with that miserable old Satchell to manage who understands no more about timber than an old carp
Ive mentioned the subject to my grandfather once or twice but for some reason or other he has a dislike to Adam and I can do nothing
But come Your Reverence are you for a ride with me
Its splendid out of doors now
We can go to Adams together if you like but I want to call at the Hall Farm on my way to look at the whelps Poyser is keeping for me
You must stay and have lunch first Arthur said Mrs Irwine
Its nearly two
Carroll will bring it in directly
I want to go to the Hall Farm too said Mr Irwine to have another look at the little Methodist who is staying there
Joshua tells me she was preaching on the Green last night
Oh by Jove
said Captain Donnithorne laughing
Why she looks as quiet as a mouse
Theres something rather striking about her though
I positively felt quite bashful the first time I saw hershe was sitting stooping over her sewing in the sunshine outside the house when I rode up and called out without noticing that she was a stranger Is Martin Poyser at home
I declare when she got up and looked at me and just said Hes in the house I believe Ill go and call him I felt quite ashamed of having spoken so abruptly to her
She looked like St Catherine in a Quaker dress
Its a type of face one rarely sees among our common people
I should like to see the young woman Dauphin said Mrs Irwine
Make her come here on some pretext or other
I dont know how I can manage that Mother it will hardly do for me to patronize a Methodist preacher even if she would consent to be patronized by an idle shepherd as Will Maskery calls me
You should have come in a little sooner Arthur to hear Joshuas denunciation of his neighbour Will Maskery
The old fellow wants me to excommunicate the wheelwright and then deliver him over to the civil armthat is to say to your grandfatherto be turned out of house and yard
If I chose to interfere in this business now I might get up as pretty a story of hatred and persecution as the Methodists need desire to publish in the next number of their magazine
It wouldnt take me much trouble to persuade Chad Cranage and half a dozen other bullheaded fellows that they would be doing an acceptable service to the Church by hunting Will Maskery out of the village with ropeends and pitchforks and then when I had furnished them with half a sovereign to get gloriously drunk after their exertions I should have put the climax to as pretty a farce as any of my brother clergy have set going in their parishes for the last thirty years
It is really insolent of the man though to call you an idle shepherd and a dumb dog said Mrs Irwine
I should be inclined to check him a little there
You are too easytempered Dauphin
Why Mother you dont think it would be a good way of sustaining my dignity to set about vindicating myself from the aspersions of Will Maskery
Besides Im not so sure that they ARE aspersions
I AM a lazy fellow and get terribly heavy in my saddle not to mention that Im always spending more than I can afford in bricks and mortar so that I get savage at a lame beggar when he asks me for sixpence
Those poor lean cobblers who think they can help to regenerate mankind by setting out to preach in the morning twilight before they begin their days work may well have a poor opinion of me
But come let us have our luncheon
Isnt Kate coming to lunch
Miss Irwine told Bridget to take her lunch upstairs said Carroll she cant leave Miss Anne
Oh very well
Tell Bridget to say Ill go up and see Miss Anne presently
You can use your right arm quite well now Arthur Mr Irwine continued observing that Captain Donnithorne had taken his arm out of the sling
Yes pretty well but Godwin insists on my keeping it up constantly for some time to come
I hope I shall be able to get away to the regiment though in the beginning of August
Its a desperately dull business being shut up at the Chase in the summer months when one can neither hunt nor shoot so as to make ones self pleasantly sleepy in the evening
However we are to astonish the echoes on the 30th of July
My grandfather has given me carte blanche for once and I promise you the entertainment shall be worthy of the occasion
The world will not see the grand epoch of my majority twice
I think I shall have a lofty throne for you Godmamma or rather two one on the lawn and another in the ballroom that you may sit and look down upon us like an Olympian goddess
I mean to bring out my best brocade that I wore at your christening twenty years ago said Mrs Irwine
Ah I think I shall see your poor mother flitting about in her white dress which looked to me almost like a shroud that very day and it WAS her shroud only three months after and your little cap and christening dress were buried with her too
She had set her heart on that sweet soul
Thank God you take after your mothers family Arthur
If you had been a puny wiry yellow baby I wouldnt have stood godmother to you
I should have been sure you would turn out a Donnithorne
But you were such a broadfaced broadchested loudscreaming rascal I knew you were every inch of you a Tradgett
But you might have been a little too hasty there Mother said Mr Irwine smiling
Dont you remember how it was with Junos last pups
One of them was the very image of its mother but it had two or three of its fathers tricks notwithstanding
Nature is clever enough to cheat even you Mother
Nonsense child
Nature never makes a ferret in the shape of a mastiff
Youll never persuade me that I cant tell what men are by their outsides
If I dont like a mans looks depend upon it I shall never like HIM
I dont want to know people that look ugly and disagreeable any more than I want to taste dishes that look disagreeable
If they make me shudder at the first glance I say take them away
An ugly piggish or fishy eye now makes me feel quite ill its like a bad smell
Talking of eyes said Captain Donnithorne that reminds me that Ive got a book I meant to bring you Godmamma
It came down in a parcel from London the other day
I know you are fond of queer wizardlike stories
Its a volume of poems Lyrical Ballads
Most of them seem to be twaddling stuff but the first is in a different styleThe Ancient Mariner is the title
I can hardly make head or tail of it as a story but its a strange striking thing
Ill send it over to you and there are some other books that you may like to see Irwinepamphlets about Antinomianism and Evangelicalism whatever they may be
I cant think what the fellow means by sending such things to me
Ive written to him to desire that from henceforth he will send me no book or pamphlet on anything that ends in ISM
Well I dont know that Im very fond of isms myself but I may as well look at the pamphlets they let one see what is going on
Ive a little matter to attend to Arthur continued Mr Irwine rising to leave the room and then I shall be ready to set out with you
The little matter that Mr Irwine had to attend to took him up the old stone staircase part of the house was very old and made him pause before a door at which he knocked gently
Come in said a womans voice and he entered a room so darkened by blinds and curtains that Miss Kate the thin middleaged lady standing by the bedside would not have had light enough for any other sort of work than the knitting which lay on the little table near her
But at present she was doing what required only the dimmest light sponging the aching head that lay on the pillow with fresh vinegar
It was a small face that of the poor sufferer perhaps it had once been pretty but now it was worn and sallow
Miss Kate came towards her brother and whispered Dont speak to her she cant bear to be spoken to today
Annes eyes were closed and her brow contracted as if from intense pain
Mr Irwine went to the bedside and took up one of the delicate hands and kissed it a slight pressure from the small fingers told him that it was worthwhile to have come upstairs for the sake of doing that
He lingered a moment looking at her and then turned away and left the room treading very gentlyhe had taken off his boots and put on slippers before he came upstairs
Whoever remembers how many things he has declined to do even for himself rather than have the trouble of putting on or taking off his boots will not think this last detail insignificant
And Mr Irwines sisters as any person of family within ten miles of Broxton could have testified were such stupid uninteresting women
It was quite a pity handsome clever Mrs Irwine should have had such commonplace daughters
That fine old lady herself was worth driving ten miles to see any day her beauty her well preserved faculties and her oldfashioned dignity made her a graceful subject for conversation in turn with the Kings health the sweet new patterns in cotton dresses the news from Egypt and Lord Daceys lawsuit which was fretting poor Lady Dacey to death
But no one ever thought of mentioning the Miss Irwines except the poor people in Broxton village who regarded them as deep in the science of medicine and spoke of them vaguely as the gentlefolks
If any one had asked old Job Dummilow who gave him his flannel jacket he would have answered the gentlefolks last winter and widow Steene dwelt much on the virtues of the stuff the gentlefolks gave her for her cough
Under this name too they were used with great effect as a means of taming refractory children so that at the sight of poor Miss Annes sallow face several small urchins had a terrified sense that she was cognizant of all their worst misdemeanours and knew the precise number of stones with which they had intended to hit Farmer Brittons ducks
But for all who saw them through a less mythical medium the Miss Irwines were quite superfluous existencesinartistic figures crowding the canvas of life without adequate effect
Miss Anne indeed if her chronic headaches could have been accounted for by a pathetic story of disappointed love might have had some romantic interest attached to her but no such story had either been known or invented concerning her and the general impression was quite in accordance with the fact that both the sisters were old maids for the prosaic reason that they had never received an eligible offer
Nevertheless to speak paradoxically the existence of insignificant people has very important consequences in the world
It can be shown to affect the price of bread and the rate of wages to call forth many evil tempers from the selfish and many heroisms from the sympathetic and in other ways to play no small part in the tragedy of life
And if that handsome generousblooded clergyman the Rev
Adolphus Irwine had not had these two hopelessly maiden sisters his lot would have been shaped quite differently he would very likely have taken a comely wife in his youth and now when his hair was getting grey under the powder would have had tall sons and blooming daughterssuch possessions in short as men commonly think will repay them for all the labour they take under the sun
As it washaving with all his three livings no more than seven hundred ayear and seeing no way of keeping his splendid mother and his sickly sister not to reckon a second sister who was usually spoken of without any adjective in such ladylike ease as became their birth and habits and at the same time providing for a family of his ownhe remained you see at the age of eightandforty a bachelor not making any merit of that renunciation but saying laughingly if any one alluded to it that he made it an excuse for many indulgences which a wife would never have allowed him
And perhaps he was the only person in the world who did not think his sisters uninteresting and superfluous for his was one of those largehearted sweetblooded natures that never know a narrow or a grudging thought Epicurean if you will with no enthusiasm no selfscourging sense of duty but yet as you have seen of a sufficiently subtle moral fibre to have an unwearying tenderness for obscure and monotonous suffering
It was his largehearted indulgence that made him ignore his mothers hardness towards her daughters which was the more striking from its contrast with her doting fondness towards himself he held it no virtue to frown at irremediable faults
See the difference between the impression a man makes on you when you walk by his side in familiar talk or look at him in his home and the figure he makes when seen from a lofty historical level or even in the eyes of a critical neighbour who thinks of him as an embodied system or opinion rather than as a man
Mr Roe the travelling preacher stationed at Treddleston had included Mr Irwine in a general statement concerning the Church clergy in the surrounding district whom he described as men given up to the lusts of the flesh and the pride of life hunting and shooting and adorning their own houses asking what shall we eat and what shall we drink and wherewithal shall we be clothedcareless of dispensing the bread of life to their flocks preaching at best but a carnal and soulbenumbing morality and trafficking in the souls of men by receiving money for discharging the pastoral office in parishes where they did not so much as look on the faces of the people more than once ayear
The ecclesiastical historian too looking into parliamentary reports of that period finds honourable members zealous for the Church and untainted with any sympathy for the tribe of canting Methodists making statements scarcely less melancholy than that of Mr Roe
And it is impossible for me to say that Mr Irwine was altogether belied by the generic classification assigned him
He really had no very lofty aims no theological enthusiasm if I were closely questioned I should be obliged to confess that he felt no serious alarms about the souls of his parishioners and would have thought it a mere loss of time to talk in a doctrinal and awakening manner to old Feyther Taft or even to Chad Cranage the blacksmith
If he had been in the habit of speaking theoretically he would perhaps have said that the only healthy form religion could take in such minds was that of certain dim but strong emotions suffusing themselves as a hallowing influence over the family affections and neighbourly duties
He thought the custom of baptism more important than its doctrine and that the religious benefits the peasant drew from the church where his fathers worshipped and the sacred piece of turf where they lay buried were but slightly dependent on a clear understanding of the Liturgy or the sermon
Clearly the rector was not what is called in these days an earnest man he was fonder of church history than of divinity and had much more insight into mens characters than interest in their opinions he was neither laborious nor obviously selfdenying nor very copious in almsgiving and his theology you perceive was lax
His mental palate indeed was rather pagan and found a savouriness in a quotation from Sophocles or Theocritus that was quite absent from any text in Isaiah or Amos
But if you feed your young setter on raw flesh how can you wonder at its retaining a relish for uncooked partridge in afterlife
And Mr Irwines recollections of young enthusiasm and ambition were all associated with poetry and ethics that lay aloof from the Bible
On the other hand I must plead for I have an affectionate partiality towards the rectors memory that he was not vindictiveand some philanthropists have been so that he was not intolerantand there is a rumour that some zealous theologians have not been altogether free from that blemish that although he would probably have declined to give his body to be burned in any public cause and was far from bestowing all his goods to feed the poor he had that charity which has sometimes been lacking to very illustrious virtuehe was tender to other mens failings and unwilling to impute evil
He was one of those men and they are not the commonest of whom we can know the best only by following them away from the marketplace the platform and the pulpit entering with them into their own homes hearing the voice with which they speak to the young and aged about their own hearthstone and witnessing their thoughtful care for the everyday wants of everyday companions who take all their kindness as a matter of course and not as a subject for panegyric
Such men happily have lived in times when great abuses flourished and have sometimes even been the living representatives of the abuses
That is a thought which might comfort us a little under the opposite factthat it is better sometimes NOT to follow great reformers of abuses beyond the threshold of their homes
But whatever you may think of Mr Irwine now if you had met him that June afternoon riding on his grey cob with his dogs running beside himportly upright manly with a goodnatured smile on his finely turned lips as he talked to his dashing young companion on the bay mare you must have felt that however ill he harmonized with sound theories of the clerical office he somehow harmonized extremely well with that peaceful landscape
See them in the bright sunlight interrupted every now and then by rolling masses of cloud ascending the slope from the Broxton side where the tall gables and elms of the rectory predominate over the tiny whitewashed church
They will soon be in the parish of Hayslope the grey churchtower and village roofs lie before them to the left and farther on to the right they can just see the chimneys of the Hall Farm
Chapter VI The Hall Farm EVIDENTLY that gate is never opened for the long grass and the great hemlocks grow close against it and if it were opened it is so rusty that the force necessary to turn it on its hinges would be likely to pull down the square stonebuilt pillars to the detriment of the two stone lionesses which grin with a doubtful carnivorous affability above a coat of arms surmounting each of the pillars
It would be easy enough by the aid of the nicks in the stone pillars to climb over the brick wall with its smooth stone coping but by putting our eyes close to the rusty bars of the gate we can see the house well enough and all but the very corners of the grassy enclosure
It is a very fine old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery lichen which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the doorplace
But the windows are patched with wooden panes and the door I think is like the gateit is never opened
How it would groan and grate against the stone fioor if it were
For it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind a liveried lackey who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair
But at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a chancery suit and that the fruit from that grand double row of walnuttrees on the right hand of the enclosure would fall and rot among the grass if it were not that we heard the booming bark of dogs echoing from great buildings at the back
And now the half weaned calves that have been sheltering themselves in a gorse built hovel against the lefthand wall come out and set up a silly answer to that terrible bark doubtless supposing that it has reference to buckets of milk
Yes the house must be inhabited and we will see by whom for imagination is a licensed trespasser it has no fear of dogs but may climb over walls and peep in at windows with impunity
Put your face to one of the glass panes in the righthand window what do you see
A large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bare boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wool stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty cornbags
That is the furniture of the diningroom
And what through the lefthand window
Several clotheshorses a pillion a spinningwheel and an old box wide open and stuffed full of coloured rags
At the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll which so far as mutilation is concerned bears a strong resemblance to the finest Greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
Near it there is a little chair and the butt end of a boys leather longlashed whip
The history of the house is plain now
It was once the residence of a country squire whose family probably dwindling down to mere spinsterhood got merged in the more territorial name of Donnithorne
It was once the Hall it is now the Hall Farm
Like the life in some coast town that was once a wateringplace and is now a port where the genteel streets are silent and grassgrown and the docks and warehouses busy and resonant the life at the Hall has changed its focus and no longer radiates from the parlour but from the kitchen and the farmyard
Plenty of life there though this is the drowsiest time of the year just before hayharvest and it is the drowsiest time of the day too for it is close upon three by the sun and it is half past three by Mrs Poysers handsome eightday clock
But there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cowshed and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellowbilled ducks who are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible
There is quite a concert of noises the great bulldog chained against the stables is thrown into furious exasperation by the unwary approach of a cock too near the mouth of his kennel and sends forth a thundering bark which is answered by two fox hounds shut up in the opposite cowhouse the old topknotted hens scratching with their chicks among the straw set up a sympathetic croaking as the discomfited cock joins them a sow with her brood all very muddy as to the legs and curled as to the tail throws in some deep staccato notes our friends the calves are bleating from the home croft and under all a fine ear discerns the continuous hum of human voices
For the great barndoors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of Mr Goby the whittaw otherwise saddler who entertains them with the latest Treddleston gossip
It is certainly rather an unfortunate day that Alick the shepherd has chosen for having the whittaws since the morning turned out so wet and Mrs Poyser has spoken her mind pretty strongly as to the dirt which the extra nurnber of mens shoes brought into the house at dinnertime
Indeed she has not yet recovered her equanimity on the subject though it is now nearly three hours since dinner and the housefloor is perfectly clean again as clean as everything else in that wonderful house place where the only chance of collecting a few grains of dust would be to climb on the saltcoffer and put your finger on the high mantelshelf on which the glittering brass candlesticks are enjoying their summer sinecure for at this time of year of course every one goes to bed while it is yet light or at least light enough to discern the outline of objects after you have bruised your shins against them
Surely nowhere else could an oak clockcase and an oak table have got to such a polish by the hand genuine elbow polish as Mrs Poyser called it for she thanked God she never had any of your varnished rubbish in her house
Hetty Sorrel often took the opportunity when her aunts back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished surfaces for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes that were ranged on the shelves above the long deal dinnertable or in the hobs of the grate which always shone like jasper
Everything was looking at its brightest at this moment for the sun shone right on the pewter dishes and from their reflecting surfaces pleasant jets of light were thrown on mellow oak and bright brassand on a still pleasanter object than these for some of the rays fell on Dinahs finely moulded cheek and lit up her pale red hair to auburn as she bent over the heavy household linen which she was mending for her aunt
No scene could have been more peaceful if Mrs Poyser who was ironing a few things that still remained from the Mondays wash had not been making a frequent clinking with her iron and moving to and fro whenever she wanted it to cool carrying the keen glance of her bluegrey eye from the kitchen to the dairy where Hetty was making up the butter and from the dairy to the back kitchen where Nancy was taking the pies out of the oven
Do not suppose however that Mrs Poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a goodlooking woman not more than eightandthirty of fair complexion and sandy hair wellshapen lightfooted
The most conspicuous article in her attire was an ample checkered linen apron which almost covered her skirt and nothing could be plainer or less noticeable than her cap and gown for there was no weakness of which she was less tolerant than feminine vanity and the preference of ornament to utility
The family likeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris with the contrast between her keenness and Dinahs seraphic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary
Their eyes were just of the same colour but a striking test of the difference in their operation was seen in the demeanour of Trip the blackandtan terrier whenever that much suspected dog unwarily exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs Poysers glance
Her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came within earshot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrelorgan takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
The fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the whittaws and why consequently Mrs Poyser should scold Molly the housemaid with unusual severity
To all appearance Molly had got through her afterdinner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
But this blameless conduct according to Mrs Poyser shrouded a secret indulgence of unbecoming wishes which she now dragged forth and held up to Mollys view with cutting eloquence
Spinning indeed
It isnt spinning as youd be at Ill be bound and let you have your own way
I never knew your equals for gallowsness
To think of a gell o your age wanting to go and sit with halfadozen men
Id ha been ashamed to let the words pass over my lips if Id been you
And you as have been here ever since last Michaelmas and I hired you at Treddleson stattits without a bit o characteras I say you might be grateful to be hired in that way to a respectable place and you knew no more o what belongs to work when you come here than the mawkin i the field
As poor a twofisted thing as ever I saw you know you was
Who taught you to scrub a floor I should like to know
Why youd leave the dirt in heaps i the cornersanybody ud think youd never been brought up among Christians
And as for spinning why youve wasted as much as your wage i the flax youve spoiled learning to spin
And youve a right to feel that and not to go about as gaping and as thoughtless as if you was beholding to nobody
Comb the wool for the whittaws indeed
Thats what youd like to be doing is it
Thats the way with youthats the road youd all like to go headlongs to ruin
Youre never easy till youve got some sweetheart as is as big a fool as yourself you think youll be finely off when youre married I daresay and have got a threelegged stool to sit on and never a blanket to cover you and a bit o oatcake for your dinner as three children are asnatching at
Im sure I donna want t go wi the whittaws said Molly whimpering and quite overcome by this Dantean picture of her future ony we allays used to comb the wool for n at Mester Ottleys an so I just axed ye
I donna want to set eyes on the whittaws again I wish I may never stir if I do
Mr Ottleys indeed
Its fine talking o what you did at Mr Ottleys
Your missis there might like her floors dirted wi whittaws for what I know
Theres no knowing what people WONNA likesuch ways as Ive heard of
I never had a gell come into my house as seemed to know what cleaning was I think people live like pigs for my part
And as to that Betty as was dairymaid at Trents before she come to me shed ha left the cheeses without turning from weeks end to weeks end and the dairy thralls I might ha wrote my name on em when I come downstairs after my illness as the doctor said it was inflammationit was a mercy I got well of it
And to think o your knowing no better Molly and been here agoing i nine months and not for want o talking to neitherand what are you stanning there for like a jack as is run down instead o getting your wheel out
Youre a rare un for sitting down to your work a little while after its time to put by
Munny my irons twite told pease put it down to warm
The small chirruping voice that uttered this request came from a little sunnyhaired girl between three and four who seated on a high chair at the end of the ironing table was arduously clutching the handle of a miniature iron with her tiny fat fist and ironing rags with an assiduity that required her to put her little red tongue out as far as anatomy would allow
Cold is it my darling
Bless your sweet face
said Mrs Poyser who was remarkable for the facility with which she could relapse from her official objurgatory to one of fondness or of friendly converse
Never mind
Mothers done her ironing now
Shes going to put the ironing things away
Munny I tould ike to do into de barn to Tommy to see de whittawd
No no no Totty ud get her feet wet said Mrs Poyser carrying away her iron
Run into the dairy and see cousin Hetty make the butter
I tould ike a bit o pumtake rejoined Totty who seemed to be provided with several relays of requests at the same time taking the opportunity of her momentary leisure to put her fingers into a bowl of starch and drag it down so as to empty the contents with tolerable completeness on to the ironing sheet
Did ever anybody see the like
screamed Mrs Poyser running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream
The childs allays i mischief if your backs turned a minute
What shall I do to you you naughty naughty gell
Totty however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
The starch having been wiped up by Mollys help and the ironing apparatus put by Mrs Poyser took up her knitting which always lay ready at hand and was the work she liked best because she could carry it on automatically as she walked to and fro
But now she came and sat down opposite Dinah whom she looked at in a meditative way as she knitted her grey worsted stocking
You look th image o your Aunt Judith Dinah when you sit a sewing
I could almost fancy it was thirty years back and I was a little gell at home looking at Judith as she sat at her work after shed done the house up only it was a little cottage Fathers was and not a big rambling house as gets dirty i one corner as fast as you clean it in anotherbut for all that I could fancy you was your Aunt Judith only her hair was a deal darker than yours and she was stouter and broader i the shoulders
Judith and me allays hung together though she had such queer ways but your mother and her never could agree
Ah your mother little thought as shed have a daughter just cut out after the very pattern o Judith and leave her an orphan too for Judith to take care on and bring up with a spoon when SHE was in the graveyard at Stoniton
I allays said that o Judith as shed bear a pound weight any day to save anybody else carrying a ounce
And she was just the same from the first o my remembering her it made no difference in her as I could see when she took to the Methodists only she talked a bit different and wore a different sort o cap but shed never in her life spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent
She was a blessed woman said Dinah God had given her a loving selfforgetting nature and He perfected it by grace
And she was very fond of you too Aunt Rachel
I often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
When she had that bad illness and I was only eleven years old she used to say Youll have a friend on earth in your Aunt Rachel if Im taken from you for she has a kind heart and Im sure Ive found it so
I dont know how child anybody ud be cunning to do anything for you I think youre like the birds o th air and live nobody knows how
Id ha been glad to behave to you like a mothers sister if youd come and live i this country where theres some shelter and victual for man and beast and folks dont live on the naked hills like poultry ascratching on a gravel bank
And then you might get married to some decent man and thered be plenty ready to have you if youd only leave off that preaching as is ten times worse than anything your Aunt Judith ever did
And even if youd marry Seth Bede as is a poor woolgathering Methodist ands never like to have a penny beforehand I know your uncle ud help you with a pig and very like a cow for hes allays been goodnaturd to my kin for all theyre poor and made em welcome to the house and ud do for you Ill be bound as much as ever hed do for Hetty though shes his own niece
And theres linen in the house as I could well spare you for Ive got lots o sheeting and tableclothing and towelling as isnt made up
Theres a piece o sheeting I could give you as that squinting Kitty spunshe was a rare girl to spin for all she squinted and the children couldnt abide her and you know the spinnings going on constant and theres new linen wove twice as fast as the old wears out
But wheres the use o talking if ye wonna be persuaded and settle down like any other woman in her senses istead o wearing yourself out with walking and preaching and giving away every penny you get so as youve nothing saved against sickness and all the things youve got i the world I verily believe ud go into a bundle no bigger nor a double cheese
And all because youve got notions i your head about religion more nor whats i the Catechism and the Prayerbook
But not more than whats in the Bible Aunt said Dinah
Yes and the Bible too for that matter Mrs Poyser rejoined rather sharply else why shouldnt them as know best whats in the Biblethe parsons and people as have got nothing to do but learn itdo the same as you do
But for the matter o that if everybody was to do like you the world must come to a standstill for if everybody tried to do without house and home and with poor eating and drinking and was allays talking as we must despise the things o the world as you say I should like to know where the pick o the stock and the corn and the best newmilk cheeeses ud have to go
Everybody ud be wanting bread made o tail ends and everybody ud be running after everybody else to preach to em istead o bringing up their families and laying by against a bad harvest
It stands to sense as that cant be the right religion
Nay dear aunt you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families
Its quite right the land should be ploughed and sowed and the precious corn stored and the things of this life cared for and right that people should rejoice in their families and provide for them so that this is done in the fear of the Lord and that they are not unmindful of the souls wants while they are caring for the body
We can all be servants of God wherever our lot is cast but He gives us different sorts of work according as He fits us for it and calls us to it
I can no more help spending my life in trying to do what I can for the souls of others than you could help running if you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldnt rest without running to help her and comfort her
Ah said Mrs Poyser rising and walking towards the door I know it ud be just the same if I was to talk to you for hours
Youd make me the same answer at th end
I might as well talk to the running brook and tell it to stan still
The causeway outside the kitchen door was dry enough now for Mrs Poyser to stand there quite pleasantly and see what was going on in the yard the grey worsted stocking making a steady progress in her hands all the while
But she had not been standing there more than five minutes before she came in again and said to Dinah in rather a flurried awestricken tone If there isnt Captain Donnithorne and Mr Irwine acoming into the yard
Ill lay my life theyre come to speak about your preaching on the Green Dinah its you must answer em for Im dumb
Ive said enough aready about your bringing such disgrace upo your uncles family
I wouldnt ha minded if youd been Mr Poysers own niecefolks must put up wi their own kin as they put up wi their own nosesits their own flesh and blood
But to think of a niece o mine being cause o my husbands being turned out of his farm and me brought him no fortin but my savins Nay dear Aunt Rachel said Dinah gently youve no cause for such fears
Ive strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything Ive done
I didnt preach without direction
Direction
I know very well what you mean by direction said Mrs Poyser knitting in a rapid and agitated manner
When theres a bigger maggot than usial in your head you call it direction and then nothing can stir youyou look like the statty o the outside o Treddleson church astarin and a smilin whether its fair weather or foul
I hanna common patience with you
By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was plain they meant to come in
Mrs Poyser advanced to the door to meet them curtsying low and trembling between anger with Dinah and anxiety to conduct herself with perfect propriety on the occasion
For in those days the keenest of bucolic minds felt a whispering awe at the sight of the gentry such as of old men felt when they stood on tiptoe to watch the gods passing by in tall human shape
Well Mrs Poyser how are you after this stormy morning
said Mr Irwine with his stately cordiality
Our feet are quite dry we shall not soil your beautiful floor
Oh sir dont mention it said Mrs Poyser
Will you and the captain please to walk into the parlour
No indeed thank you Mrs Poyser said the captain looking eagerly round the kitchen as if his eye were seeking something it could not find
I delight in your kitchen
I think it is the most charming room I know
I should like every farmers wife to come and look at it for a pattern
Oh youre pleased to say so sir
Pray take a seat said Mrs Poyser relieved a little by this compliment and the captains evident goodhumour but still glancing anxiously at Mr Irwine who she saw was looking at Dinah and advancing towards her
Poyser is not at home is he
said Captain Donnithorne seating himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairydoor
No sir he isnt hes gone to Rosseter to see Mr West the factor about the wool
But theres Father i the barn sir if hed be of any use
No thank you Ill just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
I must come another day and see your husband I want to have a consultation with him about horses
Do you know when hes likely to be at liberty
Why sir you can hardly miss him except its o Treddleson marketdaythats of a Friday you know
For if hes anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
If wed got rid o the Scantlands we should have no outlying fields and I should be glad of it for if ever anything happens hes sure to be gone to the Scantlands
Things allays happen so contrairy if theyve a chance and its an unnatral thing to have one bit o your farm in one county and all the rest in another
Ah the Scantlands would go much better with Choyces farm especially as he wants dairyland and youve got plenty
I think yours is the prettiest farm on the estate though and do you know Mrs Poyser if I were going to marry and settle I should be tempted to turn you out and do up this fine old house and turn farmer myself
Oh sir said Mrs Poyser rather alarmed you wouldnt like it at all
As for farming its putting money into your pocket wi your right hand and fetching it out wi your left
As fur as I can see its raising victual for other folks and just getting a mouthful for yourself and your children as you go along
Not as youd be like a poor man as wants to get his breadyou could afford to lose as much money as you liked i farmingbut its poor fun losing money I should think though I understan its what the great folks i London play at more than anything
For my husband heard at market as Lord Daceys eldest son had lost thousands upo thousands to the Prince o Wales and they said my lady was going to pawn her jewels to pay for him
But you know more about that than I do sir
But as for farming sir I canna think as youd like it and this housethe draughts in it are enough to cut you through and its my opinion the floors upstairs are very rotten and the rats i the cellar are beyond anything
Why thats a terrible picture Mrs Poyser
I think I should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
But theres no chance of that
Im not likely to settle for the next twenty years till Im a stout gentleman of forty and my grandfather would never consent to part with such good tenants as you
Well sir if he thinks so well o Mr Poyser for a tenant I wish you could put in a word for him to allow us some new gates for the Five closes for my husbands been asking and asking till hes tired and to think o what hes done for the farm ands never had a penny allowed him be the times bad or good
And as Ive said to my husband often and often Im sure if the captain had anything to do with it it wouldnt be so
Not as I wish to speak disrespectful o them as have got the power i their hands but its more than flesh and blood ull bear sometimes to be toiling and striving and up early and down late and hardly sleeping a wink when you lie down for thinking as the cheese may swell or the cows may slip their calf or the wheat may grow green again i the sheafand after all at th end o the year its like as if youd been cooking a feast and had got the smell of it for your pains
Mrs Poyser once launched into conversation always sailed along without any check from her preliminary awe of the gentry
The confidence she felt in her own powers of exposition was a motive force that overcame all resistance
Im afraid I should only do harm instead of good if I were to speak about the gates Mrs Poyser said the captain though I assure you theres no man on the estate I would sooner say a word for than your husband
I know his farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling I dont believe theres one in the kingdom to beat it
By the by Ive never seen your dairy I must see your dairy Mrs
Poyser
Indeed sir its not fit for you to go in for Hettys in the middle o making the butter for the churning was thrown late and Im quite ashamed
This Mrs Poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her milkpans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
Oh Ive no doubt its in capital order
Take me in said the captain himself leading the way while Mrs Poyser followed
Chapter VII The Dairy THE dairy was certainly worth looking at it was a scene to sicken for with a sort of calenture in hot and dusty streetssuch coolness such purity such fresh fragrance of newpressed cheese of firm butter of wooden vessels perpetually bathed in pure water such soft colouring of red earthenware and creamy surfaces brown wood and polished tin grey limestone and rich orangered rust on the iron weights and hooks and hinges
But one gets only a confused notion of these details when they surround a distractingly pretty girl of seventeen standing on little pattens and rounding her dimpled arm to lift a pound of butter out of the scale
Hetty blushed a deep rosecolour when Captain Donnithorne entered the dairy and spoke to her but it was not at all a distressed blush for it was inwreathed with smiles and dimples and with sparkles from under long curled dark eyelashes and while her aunt was discoursing to him about the limited amount of milk that was to be spared for butter and cheese so long as the calves were not all weaned and a large quantity but inferior quality of milk yielded by the shorthorn which had been bought on experiment together with other matters which must be interesting to a young gentleman who would one day be a landlord Hetty tossed and patted her pound of butter with quite a selfpossessed coquettish air slyly conscious that no turn of her head was lost
There are various orders of beauty causing men to make fools of themselves in various styles from the desperate to the sheepish but there is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the heads not only of men but of all intelligent mammals even of women
It is a beauty like that of kittens or very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills or babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischiefa beauty with which you can never be angry but that you feel ready to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you
Hetty Sorrels was that sort of beauty
Her aunt Mrs Poyser who professed to despise all personal attractions and intended to be the severest of mentors continually gazed at Hettys charms by the sly fascinated in spite of herself and after administering such a scolding as naturally flowed from her anxiety to do well by her husbands niecewho had no mother of her own to scold her poor thingshe would often confess to her husband when they were safe out of hearing that she firmly believed the naughtier the little huzzy behaved the prettier she looked
It is of little use for me to tell you that Hettys cheek was like a rosepetal that dimples played about her pouting lips that her large dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes and that her curly hair though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at work stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead and about her white shelllike ears it is of little use for me to say how lovely was the contour of her pinkandwhite neckerchief tucked into her low plumcoloured stuff boddice or how the linen buttermaking apron with its bib seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses since it fell in such charming lines or how her brown stockings and thicksoled buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have had when empty of her foot and ankleof little use unless you have seen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders for otherwise though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman she would not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden
I might mention all the divine charms of a bright spring day but if you had never in your life utterly forgotten yourself in straining your eyes after the mounting lark or in wandering through the still lanes when the freshopened blossoms fill them with a sacred silent beauty like that of fretted aisles where would be the use of my descriptive catalogue
I could never make you know what I meant by a bright spring day
Hettys was a springtide beauty it was the beauty of young frisking things roundlimbed gambolling circumventing you by a false air of innocencethe innocence of a young star browed calf for example that being inclined for a promenade out of bounds leads you a severe steeplechase over hedge and ditch and only comes to a stand in the middle of a bog
And they are the prettiest attitudes and movements into which a pretty girl is thrown in making up buttertossing movements that give a charming curve to the arm and a sideward inclination of the round white neck little patting and rolling movements with the palm of the hand and nice adaptations and finishings which cannot at all be effected without a great play of the pouting mouth and the dark eyes
And then the butter itself seems to communicate a fresh charmit is so pure so sweetscented it is turned off the mould with such a beautiful firm surface like marble in a pale yellow light
Moreover Hetty was particularly clever at making up the butter it was the one performance of hers that her aunt allowed to pass without severe criticism so she handled it with all the grace that belongs to mastery
I hope you will be ready for a great holiday on the thirtieth of July Mrs Poyser said Captain Donnithorne when he had sufficiently admired the dairy and given several improvised opinions on Swede turnips and shorthorns
You know what is to happen then and I shall expect you to be one of the guests who come earliest and leave latest
Will you promise me your hand for two dances Miss Hetty
If I dont get your promise now I know I shall hardly have a chance for all the smart young farmers will take care to secure you
Hetty smiled and blushed but before she could answer Mrs Poyser interposed scandalized at the mere suggestion that the young squire could be excluded by any meaner partners
Indeed sir you are very kind to take that notice of her
And Im sure whenever youre pleased to dance with her shell be proud and thankful if she stood still all the rest o th evening
Oh no no that would be too cruel to all the other young fellows who can dance
But you will promise me two dances wont you
the captain continued determined to make Hetty look at him and speak to him
Hetty dropped the prettiest little curtsy and stole a halfshy halfcoquettish glance at him as she said Yes thank you sir
And you must bring all your children you know Mrs Poyser your little Totty as well as the boys
I want all the youngest children on the estate to be thereall those who will be fine young men and women when Im a bald old fellow
Oh dear sir that ull be a long time first said Mrs Poyser quite overcome at the young squires speaking so lightly of himself and thinking how her husband would be interested in hearing her recount this remarkable specimen of highborn humour
The captain was thought to be very full of his jokes and was a great favourite throughout the estate on account of his free manners
Every tenant was quite sure things would be different when the reins got into his handsthere was to be a millennial abundance of new gates allowances of lime and returns of ten per cent
But where is Totty today
he said
I want to see her
Where IS the little un Hetty
said Mrs Poyser
She came in here not long ago
I dont know
She went into the brewhouse to Nancy I think
The proud mother unable to resist the temptation to show her Totty passed at once into the back kitchen in search of her not however without misgivings lest something should have happened to render her person and attire unfit for presentation
And do you carry the butter to market when youve made it
said the Captain to Hetty meanwhile
Oh no sir not when its so heavy
Im not strong enough to carry it
Alick takes it on horseback
No Im sure your pretty arms were never meant for such heavy weights
But you go out a walk sometimes these pleasant evenings dont you
Why dont you have a walk in the Chase sometimes now its so green and pleasant
I hardly ever see you anywhere except at home and at church
Aunt doesnt like me to go awalking only when Im going somewhere said Hetty
But I go through the Chase sometimes
And dont you ever go to see Mrs Best the housekeeper
I think I saw you once in the housekeepers room
It isnt Mrs Best its Mrs Pomfret the ladys maid as I go to see
Shes teaching me tentstitch and the lacemending
Im going to tea with her tomorrow afternoon
The reason why there had been space for this teteatete can only be known by looking into the back kitchen where Totty had been discovered rubbing a stray bluebag against her nose and in the same moment allowing some liberal indigo drops to fall on her afternoon pinafore
But now she appeared holding her mothers handthe end of her round nose rather shiny from a recent and hurried application of soap and water
Here she is
said the captain lifting her up and setting her on the low stone shelf
Heres Totty
By the by whats her other name
She wasnt christened Totty
Oh sir we call her sadly out of her name
Charlottes her christened name
Its a name i Mr Poysers family his grandmother was named Charlotte
But we began with calling her Lotty and now its got to Totty
To be sure its more like a name for a dog than a Christian child
Tottys a capital name
Why she looks like a Totty
Has she got a pocket on
said the captain feeling in his own waistcoat pockets
Totty immediately with great gravity lifted up her frock and showed a tiny pink pocket at present in a state of collapse
It dot notin in it she said as she looked down at it very earnestly
No
What a pity
Such a pretty pocket
Well I think Ive got some things in mine that will make a pretty jingle in it
Yes
I declare Ive got five little round silver things and hear what a pretty noise they make in Tottys pink pocket
Here he shook the pocket with the five sixpences in it and Totty showed her teeth and wrinkled her nose in great glee but divining that there was nothing more to be got by staying she jumped off the shelf and ran away to jingle her pocket in the hearing of Nancy while her mother called after her Oh for shame you naughty gell
Not to thank the captain for what hes given you Im sure sir its very kind of you but shes spoiled shameful her father wont have her said nay in anything and theres no managing her
Its being the youngest and th only gell
Oh shes a funny little fatty I wouldnt have her different
But I must be going now for I suppose the rector is waiting for me
With a goodbye a bright glance and a bow to Hetty Arthur left the dairy
But he was mistaken in imagining himself waited for
The rector had been so much interested in his conversation with Dinah that he would not have chosen to close it earlier and you shall hear now what they had been saying to each other
Chapter VIII A Vocation DINAH who had risen when the gentlemen came in but still kept hold of the sheet she was mending curtsied respectfully when she saw Mr Irwine looking at her and advancing towards her
He had never yet spoken to her or stood face to face with her and her first thought as her eyes met his was What a wellfavoured countenance
Oh that the good seed might fall on that soil for it would surely flourish
The agreeable impression must have been mutual for Mr Irwine bowed to her with a benignant deference which would have been equally in place if she had been the most dignified lady of his acquaintance
You are only a visitor in this neighbourhood I think
were his first words as he seated himself opposite to her
No sir I come from Snowfield in Stonyshire
But my aunt was very kind wanting me to have rest from my work there because Id been ill and she invited me to come and stay with her for a while
Ah I remember Snowfield very well I once had occasion to go there
Its a dreary bleak place
They were building a cotton mill there but thats many years ago now
I suppose the place is a good deal changed by the employment that mill must have brought
It IS changed so far as the mill has brought people there who get a livelihood for themselves by working in it and make it better for the tradesfolks
I work in it myself and have reason to be grateful for thereby I have enough and to spare
But its still a bleak place as you say sirvery different from this country
You have relations living there probably so that you are attached to the place as your home
I had an aunt there once she brought me up for I was an orphan
But she was taken away seven years ago and I have no other kindred that I know of besides my Aunt Poyser who is very good to me and would have me come and live in this country which to be sure is a good land wherein they eat bread without scarceness
But Im not free to leave Snowfield where I was first planted and have grown deep into it like the small grass on the hill top
Ah I daresay you have many religious friends and companions there you are a Methodista Wesleyan I think
Yes my aunt at Snowfield belonged to the Society and I have cause to be thankful for the privileges I have had thereby from my earliest childhood
And have you been long in the habit of preaching
For I understand you preached at Hayslope last night
I first took to the work four years since when I was twenty one
Your Society sanctions womens preaching then
It doesnt forbid them sir when theyve a clear call to the work and when their ministry is owned by the conversion of sinners and the strengthening of Gods people
Mrs Fletcher as you may have heard about was the first woman to preach in the Society I believe before she was married when she was Miss Bosanquet and Mr Wesley approved of her undertaking the work
She had a great gift and there are many others now living who are precious fellowhelpers in the work of the ministry
I understand theres been voices raised against it in the Society of late but I cannot but think their counsel will come to nought
It isnt for men to make channels for Gods Spirit as they make channels for the watercourses and say Flow here but flow not there
But dont you find some danger among your peopleI dont mean to say that it is so with you far from itbut dont you find sometimes that both men and women fancy themselves channels for Gods Spirit and are quite mistaken so that they set about a work for which they are unfit and bring holy things into contempt
Doubtless it is so sometimes for there have been evildoers among us who have sought to deceive the brethren and some there are who deceive their own selves
But we are not without discipline and correction to put a check upon these things
Theres a very strict order kept among us and the brethren and sisters watch for each others souls as they that must give account
They dont go every one his own way and say Am I my brothers keeper
But tell meif I may ask and I am really interested in knowing ithow you first came to think of preaching
Indeed sir I didnt think of it at allId been used from the time I was sixteen to talk to the little children and teach them and sometimes I had had my heart enlarged to speak in class and was much drawn out in prayer with the sick
But I had felt no call to preach for when Im not greatly wrought upon Im too much given to sit still and keep by myself
It seems as if I could sit silent all day long with the thought of God overflowing my soulas the pebbles lie bathed in the Willow Brook
For thoughts are so greatarent they sir
They seem to lie upon us like a deep flood and its my besetment to forget where I am and everything about me and lose myself in thoughts that I could give no account of for I could neither make a beginning nor ending of them in words
That was my way as long as I can remember but sometimes it seemed as if speech came to me without any will of my own and words were given to me that came out as the tears come because our hearts are full and we cant help it
And those were always times of great blessing though I had never thought it could be so with me before a congregation of people
But sir we are led on like the little children by a way that we know not
I was called to preach quite suddenly and since then I have never been left in doubt about the work that was laid upon me
But tell me the circumstancesjust how it was the very day you began to preach
It was one Sunday I walked with brother Marlowe who was an aged man one of the local preachers all the way to HettonDeeps thats a village where the people get their living by working in the leadmines and where theres no church nor preacher but they live like sheep without a shepherd
Its better than twelve miles from Snowfield so we set out early in the morning for it was summertime and I had a wonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills where theres no trees you know sir as there is here to make the sky look smaller but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent and you feel the everlasting arms around you
But before we got to Hetton brother Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of falling for he overworked himself sadly at his years in watching and praying and walking so many miles to speak the Word as well as carrying on his trade of linenweaving
And when we got to the village the people were expecting him for hed appointed the time and the place when he was there before and such of them as cared to hear the Word of Life were assembled on a spot where the cottages was thickest so as others might be drawn to come
But he felt as he couldnt stand up to preach and he was forced to lie down in the first of the cottages we came to
So I went to tell the people thinking wed go into one of the houses and I would read and pray with them
But as I passed along by the cottages and saw the aged and trembling women at the doors and the hard looks of the men who seemed to have their eyes no more filled with the sight of the Sabbath morning than if they had been dumb oxen that never looked up to the sky I felt a great movement in my soul and I trembled as if I was shaken by a strong spirit entering into my weak body
And I went to where the little flock of people was gathered together and stepped on the low wall that was built against the green hillside and I spoke the words that were given to me abundantly
And they all came round me out of all the cottages and many wept over their sins and have since been joined to the Lord
That was the beginning of my preaching sir and Ive preached ever since
Dinah had let her work fall during this narrative which she uttered in her usual simple way but with that sincere articulate thrilling treble by which she always mastered her audience
She stooped now to gather up her sewing and then went on with it as before
Mr Irwine was deeply interested
He said to himself He must be a miserable prig who would act the pedagogue here one might as well go and lecture the trees for growing in their own shape
And you never feel any embarrassment from the sense of your youththat you are a lovely young woman on whom mens eyes are fixed
he said aloud
No Ive no room for such feelings and I dont believe the people ever take notice about that
I think sir when God makes His presence felt through us we are like the burning bush Moses never took any heed what sort of bush it washe only saw the brightness of the Lord
Ive preached to as rough ignorant people as can be in the villages about Snowfieldmen that looked very hard and wildbut they never said an uncivil word to me and often thanked me kindly as they made way for me to pass through the midst of them
THAT I can believethat I can well believe said Mr Irwine emphatically
And what did you think of your hearers last night now
Did you find them quiet and attentive
Very quiet sir but I saw no signs of any great work upon them except in a young girl named Bessy Cranage towards whom my heart yearned greatly when my eyes first fell on her blooming youth given up to folly and vanity
I had some private talk and prayer with her afterwards and I trust her heart is touched
But Ive noticed that in these villages where the people lead a quiet life among the green pastures and the still waters tilling the ground and tending the cattle theres a strange deadness to the Word as different as can be from the great towns like Leeds where I once went to visit a holy woman who preaches there
Its wonderful how rich is the harvest of souls up those highwalled streets where you seemed to walk as in a prisonyard and the ear is deafened with the sounds of worldly toil
I think maybe it is because the promise is sweeter when this life is so dark and weary and the soul gets more hungry when the body is ill at ease
Why yes our farmlabourers are not easily roused
They take life almost as slowly as the sheep and cows
But we have some intelligent workmen about here
I daresay you know the Bedes Seth Bede by the by is a Methodist
Yes I know Seth well and his brother Adam a little
Seth is a gracious young mansincere and without offence and Adam is like the patriarch Joseph for his great skill and knowledge and the kindness he shows to his brother and his parents
Perhaps you dont know the trouble that has just happened to them
Their father Matthias Bede was drowned in the Willow Brook last night not far from his own door
Im going now to see Adam
Ah their poor aged mother
said Dinah dropping her hands and looking before her with pitying eyes as if she saw the object of her sympathy
She will mourn heavily for Seth has told me shes of an anxious troubled heart
I must go and see if I can give her any help
As she rose and was beginning to fold up her work Captain Donnithorne having exhausted all plausible pretexts for remaining among the milkpans came out of the dairy followed by Mrs Poyser
Mr Irwine now rose also and advancing towards Dinah held out his hand and said Goodbye
I hear you are going away soon but this will not be the last visit you will pay your aunt so we shall meet again I hope
His cordiality towards Dinah set all Mrs Poysers anxieties at rest and her face was brighter than usual as she said Ive never asked after Mrs Irwine and the Miss Irwines sir I hope theyre as well as usual
Yes thank you Mrs Poyser except that Miss Anne has one of her bad headaches today
By the by we all liked that nice cream cheese you sent usmy mother especially
Im very glad indeed sir
It is but seldom I make one but I remembered Mrs Irwine was fond of em
Please to give my duty to her and to Miss Kate and Miss Anne
Theyve never been to look at my poultry this long while and Ive got some beautiful speckled chickens black and white as Miss Kate might like to have some of amongst hers
Well Ill tell her she must come and see them
Goodbye said the rector mounting his horse
Just ride slowly on Irwine said Captain Donnithorne mounting also
Ill overtake you in three minutes
Im only going to speak to the shepherd about the whelps
Goodbye Mrs Poyser tell your husband I shall come and have a long talk with him soon
Mrs Poyser curtsied duly and watched the two horses until they had disappeared from the yard amidst great excitement on the part of the pigs and the poultry and under the furious indignation of the bulldog who performed a Pyrrhic dance that every moment seemed to threaten the breaking of his chain
Mrs Poyser delighted in this noisy exit it was a fresh assurance to her that the farmyard was well guarded and that no loiterers could enter unobserved and it was not until the gate had closed behind the captain that she turned into the kitchen again where Dinah stood with her bonnet in her hand waiting to speak to her aunt before she set out for Lisbeth Bedes cottage
Mrs Poyser however though she noticed the bonnet deferred remarking on it until she had disburdened herself of her surprise at Mr Irwines behaviour
Why Mr Irwine wasnt angry then
What did he say to you Dinah
Didnt he scold you for preaching
No he was not at all angry he was very friendly to me
I was quite drawn out to speak to him I hardly know how for I had always thought of him as a worldly Sadducee
But his countenance is as pleasant as the morning sunshine
Pleasant
And what else did y expect to find him but pleasant
said Mrs Poyser impatiently resuming her knitting
I should think his countenance is pleasant indeed
And him a gentleman born ands got a mother like a picter
You may go the country round and not find such another woman turned sixtysix
Its summatlike to see such a man as that i the desk of a Sunday
As I say to Poyser its like looking at a full crop o wheat or a pasture with a fine dairy o cows in it it makes you think the worlds comfortablelike
But as for such creaturs as you Methodisses run after Id as soon go to look at a lot o bare ribbed runts on a common
Fine folks they are to tell you whats right as look as if theyd never tasted nothing better than baconsword and sourcake i their lives
But what did Mr Irwine say to you about that fools trick o preaching on the Green
He only said hed heard of it he didnt seem to feel any displeasure about it
But dear aunt dont think any more about that
He told me something that Im sure will cause you sorrow as it does me
Thias Bede was drowned last night in the Willow Brook and Im thinking that the aged mother will be greatly in need of comfort
Perhaps I can be of use to her so I have fetched my bonnet and am going to set out
Dear heart dear heart
But you must have a cup o tea first child said Mrs Poyser falling at once from the key of B with five sharps to the frank and genial C The kettles boiling well have it ready in a minute and the young uns ull be in and wanting theirs directly
Im quite willing you should go and see th old woman for youre one as is allays welcome in trouble Methodist or no Methodist but for the matter o that its the flesh and blood folks are made on as makes the difference
Some cheeses are made o skimmed milk and some o new milk and its no matter what you call em you may tell which is which by the look and the smell
But as to Thias Bede hes better out o the way nor inGod forgi me for saying sofor hes done little this ten year but make trouble for them as belonged to him and I think it ud be well for you to take a little bottle o rum for th old woman for I daresay shes got never a drop o nothing to comfort her inside
Sit down child and be easy for you shant stir out till youve had a cup o tea and so I tell you
During the latter part of this speech Mrs Poyser had been reaching down the teathings from the shelves and was on her way towards the pantry for the loaf followed close by Totty who had made her appearance on the rattling of the teacups when Hetty came out of the dairy relieving her tired arms by lifting them up and clasping her hands at the back of her head
Molly she said rather languidly just run out and get me a bunch of dockleaves the butters ready to pack up now
D you hear whats happened Hetty
said her aunt
No how should I hear anything
was the answer in a pettish tone
Not as youd care much I daresay if you did hear for youre too featherheaded to mind if everybody was dead so as you could stay upstairs adressing yourself for two hours by the clock
But anybody besides yourself ud mind about such things happening to them as think a deal more of you than you deserve
But Adam Bede and all his kin might be drownded for what youd careyoud be perking at the glass the next minute
Adam Bededrowned
said Hetty letting her arms fall and looking rather bewildered but suspecting that her aunt was as usual exaggerating with a didactic purpose
No my dear no said Dinah kindly for Mrs Poyser had passed on to the pantry without deigning more precise information
Not Adam
Adams father the old man is drowned
He was drowned last night in the Willow Brook
Mr Irwine has just told me about it
Oh how dreadful
said Hetty looking serious but not deeply affected and as Molly now entered with the dockleaves she took them silently and returned to the dairy without asking further questions
Chapter IX Hettys World WHILE she adjusted the broad leaves that set off the pale fragrant butter as the primrose is set off by its nest of green I am afraid Hetty was thinking a great deal more of the looks Captain Donnithorne had cast at her than of Adam and his troubles
Bright admiring glances from a handsome young gentleman with white hands a gold chain occasional regimentals and wealth and grandeur immeasurablethose were the warm rays that set poor Hettys heart vibrating and playing its little foolish tunes over and over again
We do not hear that Memnons statue gave forth its melody at all under the rushing of the mightiest wind or in response to any other influence divine or human than certain shortlived sunbeams of morning and we must learn to accommodate ourselves to the discovery that some of those cunningly fashioned instruments called human souls have only a very limited range of music and will not vibrate in the least under a touch that fills others with tremulous rapture or quivering agony
Hetty was quite used to the thought that people liked to look at her
She was not blind to the fact that young Luke Britton of Broxton came to Hayslope Church on a Sunday afternoon on purpose that he might see her and that he would have made much more decided advances if her uncle Poyser thinking but lightly of a young man whose fathers land was so foul as old Luke Brittons had not forbidden her aunt to encourage him by any civilities
She was aware too that Mr Craig the gardener at the Chase was over head and ears in love with her and had lately made unmistakable avowals in luscious strawberries and hyperbolical peas
She knew still better that Adam Bedetall upright clever brave Adam Bedewho carried such authority with all the people round about and whom her uncle was always delighted to see of an evening saying that Adam knew a fine sight more o the natur o things than those as thought themselves his bettersshe knew that this Adam who was often rather stern to other people and not much given to run after the lasses could be made to turn pale or red any day by a word or a look from her
Hettys sphere of comparison was not large but she couldnt help perceiving that Adam was something like a man always knew what to say about things could tell her uncle how to prop the hovel and had mended the churn in no time knew with only looking at it the value of the chestnuttree that was blown down and why the damp came in the walls and what they must do to stop the rats and wrote a beautiful hand that you could read off and could do figures in his heada degree of accomplishment totally unknown among the richest farmers of that countryside
Not at all like that slouching Luke Britton who when she once walked with him all the way from Broxton to Hayslope had only broken silence to remark that the grey goose had begun to lay
And as for Mr Craig the gardener he was a sensible man enough to be sure but he was knockkneed and had a queer sort of singsong in his talk moreover on the most charitable supposition he must be far on the way to forty
Hetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam and would be pleased for her to marry him
For those were times when there was no rigid demarcation of rank between the farmer and the respectable artisan and on the home hearth as well as in the public house they might be seen taking their jug of ale together the farmer having a latent sense of capital and of weight in parish affairs which sustained him under his conspicuous inferiority in conversation
Martin Poyser was not a frequenter of public houses but he liked a friendly chat over his own home brewed and though it was pleasant to lay down the law to a stupid neighbour who had no notion how to make the best of his farm it was also an agreeable variety to learn something from a clever fellow like Adam Bede
Accordingly for the last three years ever since he had superintended the building of the new barnAdam had always been made welcome at the Hall Farm especially of a winter evening when the whole family in patriarchal fashion master and mistress children and servants were assembled in that glorious kitchen at wellgraduated distances from the blazing fire
And for the last two years at least Hetty had been in the habit of hearing her uncle say Adam Bede may be working for wage now but hell be a masterman some day as sure as I sit in this chair
Mester Burge is in the right ont to want him to go partners and marry his daughter if its true what they say the woman as marries him ull have a good take bet Lady day or Michaelmas a remark which Mrs Poyser always followed up with her cordial assent
Ah she would say its all very fine having a readymade rich man but mayhappen hell be a readymade fool and its no use filling your pocket full o money if youve got a hole in the corner
Itll do you no good to sit in a springcart o your own if youve got a soft to drive you hell soon turn you over into the ditch
I allays said Id never marry a man as had got no brains for wheres the use of a woman having brains of her own if shes tackled to a geck as everybodys a laughing at
She might as well dress herself fine to sit backards on a donkey
These expressions though figurative sufficiently indicated the bent of Mrs Poysers mind with regard to Adam and though she and her husband might have viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a daughter of their own it was clear that they would have welcomed the match with Adam for a penniless niece
For what could Hetty have been but a servant elsewhere if her uncle had not taken her in and brought her up as a domestic help to her aunt whose health since the birth of Totty had not been equal to more positive labour than the superintendence of servants and children
But Hetty had never given Adam any steady encouragement
Even in the moments when she was most thoroughly conscious of his superiority to her other admirers she had never brought herself to think of accepting him
She liked to feel that this strong skilful keeneyed man was in her power and would have been indignant if he had shown the least sign of slipping from under the yoke of her coquettish tyranny and attaching himself to the gentle Mary Burge who would have been grateful enough for the most trifling notice from him
Mary Burge indeed
Such a sallowfaced girl if she put on a bit of pink ribbon she looked as yellow as a crowflower and her hair was as straight as a hank of cotton
And always when Adam stayed away for several weeks from the Hall Farm and otherwise made some show of resistance to his passion as a foolish one Hetty took care to entice him back into the net by little airs of meekness and timidity as if she were in trouble at his neglect
But as to marrying Adam that was a very different affair
There was nothing in the world to tempt her to do that
Her cheeks never grew a shade deeper when his name was mentioned she felt no thrill when she saw him passing along the causeway by the window or advancing towards her unexpectedly in the footpath across the meadow she felt nothing when his eyes rested on her but the cold triumph of knowing that he loved her and would not care to look at Mary Burge
He could no more stir in her the emotions that make the sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of a sun can stir the spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant
She saw him as he wasa poor man with old parents to keep who would not be able for a long while to come to give her even such luxuries as she shared in her uncles house
And Hettys dreams were all of luxuries to sit in a carpeted parlour and always wear white stockings to have some large beautiful ear rings such as were all the fashion to have Nottingham lace round the top of her gown and something to make her handkerchief smell nice like Miss Lydia Donnithornes when she drew it out at church and not to be obliged to get up early or be scolded by anybody
She thought if Adam had been rich and could have given her these things she loved him well enough to marry him
But for the last few weeks a new influence had come over Hetty vague atmospheric shaping itself into no selfconfessed hopes or prospects but producing a pleasant narcotic effect making her tread the ground and go about her work in a sort of dream unconscious of weight or effort and showing her all things through a soft liquid veil as if she were living not in this solid world of brick and stone but in a beatified world such as the sun lights up for us in the waters
Hetty had become aware that Mr Arthur Donnithorne would take a good deal of trouble for the chance of seeing her that he always placed himself at church so as to have the fullest view of her both sitting and standing that he was constantly finding reason for calling at the Hall Farm and always would contrive to say something for the sake of making her speak to him and look at him
The poor child no more conceived at present the idea that the young squire could ever be her lover than a bakers pretty daughter in the crowd whom a young emperor distinguishes by an imperial but admiring smile conceives that she shall be made empress
But the bakers daughter goes home and dreams of the handsome young emperor and perhaps weighs the flour amiss while she is thinking what a heavenly lot it must be to have him for a husband
And so poor Hetty had got a face and a presence haunting her waking and sleeping dreams bright soft glances had penetrated her and suffused her life with a strange happy languor
The eyes that shed those glances were really not half so fine as Adams which sometimes looked at her with a sad beseeching tenderness but they had found a ready medium in Hettys little silly imagination whereas Adams could get no entrance through that atmosphere
For three weeks at least her inward life had consisted of little else than living through in memory the looks and words Arthur had directed towards herof little else than recalling the sensations with which she heard his voice outside the house and saw him enter and became conscious that his eyes were fixed on her and then became conscious that a tall figure looking down on her with eyes that seemed to touch her was coming nearer in clothes of beautiful texture with an odour like that of a flowergarden borne on the evening breeze
Foolish thoughts
But all this happened you must remember nearly sixty years ago and Hetty was quite uneducateda simple farmers girl to whom a gentleman with a white hand was dazzling as an Olympian god
Until today she had never looked farther into the future than to the next time Captain Donnithorne would come to the Farm or the next Sunday when she should see him at church but now she thought perhaps he would try to meet her when she went to the Chase tomorrowand if he should speak to her and walk a little way when nobody was by
That had never happened yet and now her imagination instead of retracing the past was busy fashioning what would happen to morrowwhereabout in the Chase she should see him coming towards her how she should put her new rosecoloured ribbon on which he had never seen and what he would say to her to make her return his glancea glance which she would be living through in her memory over and over again all the rest of the day
In this state of mind how could Hetty give any feeling to Adams troubles or think much about poor old Thias being drowned
Young souls in such pleasant delirium as hers are as unsympathetic as butterflies sipping nectar they are isolated from all appeals by a barrier of dreamsby invisible looks and impalpable arms
While Hettys hands were busy packing up the butter and her head filled with these pictures of the morrow Arthur Donnithorne riding by Mr Irwines side towards the valley of the Willow Brook had also certain indistinct anticipations running as an undercurrent in his mind while he was listening to Mr Irwines account of Dinahindistinct yet strong enough to make him feel rather conscious when Mr Irwine suddenly said What fascinated you so in Mrs Poysers dairy Arthur
Have you become an amateur of damp quarries and skimming dishes
Arthur knew the rector too well to suppose that a clever invention would be of any use so he said with his accustomed frankness No I went to look at the pretty buttermaker Hetty Sorrel
Shes a perfect Hebe and if I were an artist I would paint her
Its amazing what pretty girls one sees among the farmers daughters when the men are such clowns
That common round red face one sees sometimes in the menall cheek and no features like Martin Poyserscomes out in the women of the famuly as the most charming phiz imaginable
Well I have no objection to your contemplating Hetty in an artistic light but I must not have you feeding her vanity and filling her little noddle with the notion that shes a great beauty attractive to fine gentlemen or you will spoil her for a poor mans wifehonest Craigs for example whom I have seen bestowing soft glances on her
The little puss seems already to have airs enough to make a husband as miserable as its a law of nature for a quiet man to be when he marries a beauty
Apropos of marrying I hope our friend Adam will get settled now the poor old mans gone
He will only have his mother to keep in future and Ive a notion that theres a kindness between him and that nice modest girl Mary Burge from something that fell from old Jonathan one day when I was talking to him
But when I mentioned the subject to Adam he looked uneasy and turned the conversation
I suppose the lovemaking doesnt run smooth or perhaps Adam hangs back till hes in a better position
He has independence of spirit enough for two menrather an excess of pride if anything
That would be a capital match for Adam
He would slip into old Burges shoes and make a fine thing of that building business Ill answer for him
I should like to see him well settled in this parish he would be ready then to act as my grandvizier when I wanted one
We could plan no end of repairs and improvements together
Ive never seen the girl though I thinkat least Ive never looked at her
Look at her next Sunday at churchshe sits with her father on the left of the readingdesk
You neednt look quite so much at Hetty Sorrel then
When Ive made up my mind that I cant afford to buy a tempting dog I take no notice of him because if he took a strong fancy to me and looked lovingly at me the struggle between arithmetic and inclination might become unpleasantly severe
I pique myself on my wisdom there Arthur and as an old fellow to whom wisdom had become cheap I bestow it upon you
Thank you
It may stand me in good stead some day though I dont know that I have any present use for it
Bless me
How the brook has overflowed
Suppose we have a canter now were at the bottom of the hill
That is the great advantage of dialogue on horseback it can be merged any minute into a trot or a canter and one might have escaped from Socrates himself in the saddle
The two friends were free from the necessity of further conversation till they pulled up in the lane behind Adams cottage
Chapter X Dinah Visits Lisbeth AT five oclock Lisbeth came downstairs with a large key in her hand it was the key of the chamber where her husband lay dead
Throughout the day except in her occasional outbursts of wailing grief she had been in incessant movement performing the initial duties to her dead with the awe and exactitude that belong to religious rites
She had brought out her little store of bleached linen which she had for long years kept in reserve for this supreme use
It seemed but yesterdaythat time so many midsummers ago when she had told Thias where this linen lay that he might be sure and reach it out for her when SHE died for she was the elder of the two
Then there had been the work of cleansing to the strictest purity every object in the sacred chamber and of removing from it every trace of common daily occupation
The small window which had hitherto freely let in the frosty moonlight or the warm summer sunrise on the working mans slumber must now be darkened with a fair white sheet for this was the sleep which is as sacred under the bare rafters as in ceiled houses
Lisbeth had even mended a longneglected and unnoticeable rent in the checkered bit of bedcurtain for the moments were few and precious now in which she would be able to do the smallest office of respect or love for the still corpse to which in all her thoughts she attributed some consciousness
Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them they can be injured by us they can be wounded they know all our penitence all our aching sense that their place is empty all the kisses we bestow on the smallest relic of their presence
And the aged peasant woman most of all believes that her dead are conscious
Decent burial was what Lisbeth had been thinking of for herself through years of thrift with an indistinct expectation that she should know when she was being carried to the churchyard followed by her husband and her sons and now she felt as if the greatest work of her life were to be done in seeing that Thias was buried decently before herunder the white thorn where once in a dream she had thought she lay in the coffin yet all the while saw the sunshine above and smelt the white blossoms that were so thick upon the thorn the Sunday she went to be churched after Adam was born
But now she had done everything that could be done today in the chamber of deathhad done it all herself with some aid from her sons in lifting for she would let no one be fetched to help her from the village not being fond of female neighbours generally and her favourite Dolly the old housekeeper at Mr Burges who had come to condole with her in the morning as soon as she heard of Thiass death was too dimsighted to be of much use
She had locked the door and now held the key in her hand as she threw herself wearily into a chair that stood out of its place in the middle of the house floor where in ordinary times she would never have consented to sit
The kitchen had had none of her attention that day it was soiled with the tread of muddy shoes and untidy with clothes and other objects out of place
But what at another time would have been intolerable to Lisbeths habits of order and cleanliness seemed to her now just what should be it was right that things should look strange and disordered and wretched now the old man had come to his end in that sad way the kitchen ought not to look as if nothing had happened
Adam overcome with the agitations and exertions of the day after his night of hard work had fallen asleep on a bench in the workshop and Seth was in the back kitchen making a fire of sticks that he might get the kettle to boil and persuade his mother to have a cup of tea an indulgence which she rarely allowed herself
There was no one in the kitchen when Lisbeth entered and threw herself into the chair
She looked round with blank eyes at the dirt and confusion on which the bright afternoons sun shone dismally it was all of a piece with the sad confusion of her mindthat confusion which belongs to the first hours of a sudden sorrow when the poor human soul is like one who has been deposited sleeping among the ruins of a vast city and wakes up in dreary amazement not knowing whether it is the growing or the dying daynot knowing why and whence came this illimitable scene of desolation or why he too finds himself desolate in the midst of it
At another time Lisbeths first thought would have been Where is Adam
but the sudden death of her husband had restored him in these hours to that first place in her affections which he had held sixandtwenty years ago
She had forgotten his faults as we forget the sorrows of our departed childhood and thought of nothing but the young husbands kindness and the old mans patience
Her eyes continued to wander blankly until Seth came in and began to remove some of the scattered things and clear the small round deal table that he might set out his mothers tea upon it
What art goin to do
she said rather peevishly
I want thee to have a cup of tea Mother answered Seth tenderly
Itll do thee good and Ill put two or three of these things away and make the house look more comfortable
Comfortable
How canst talk o main things comfortable
Let abe let abe
Theres no comfort for me no more she went on the tears coming when she began to speak now thy poor feythers gone as In washed for and mended an gots victual for him for thirty ear an him allays so pleased wi iverything I done for him an used to be so handy an do the jobs for me when I war ill an cumbered wi th babby an made me the posset an brought it upstairs as proud as could be an carried the lad as war as heavy as two children for five mile an neer grumbled all the way to Warson Wake cause I wanted to go an see my sister as war dead an gone the very next Christmas as eer come
An him to be drownded in the brook as we passed oer the day we war married an come home together an hed made them lots o shelves for me to put my plates an things on an showed em me as proud as could be cause he knowd I should be pleased
An he war to die an me not to know but to be asleepin i my bed as if I caredna nought about it
Eh
An me to live to see that
An us as war young folks once an thought we should do rarely when we war married
Let abe lad let abe
I wonna ha no tay
I carena if I neer ate nor drink no more
When one end o th bridge tumbles down wheres th use o th other stannin
I mays well die an foller my old man
Theres no knowin but hell want me
Here Lisbeth broke from words into moans swaying herself backwards and forwards on her chair
Seth always timid in his behaviour towards his mother from the sense that he had no influence over her felt it was useless to attempt to persuade or soothe her till this passion was past so he contented himself with tending the back kitchen fire and folding up his fathers clothes which had been hanging out to dry since morningafraid to move about in the room where his mother was lest he should irritate her further
But after Lisbeth had been rocking herself and moaning for some minutes she suddenly paused and said aloud to herself Ill go an see arter Adam for I canna think where hes gotten an I want him to go upstairs wi me afore its dark for the minutes to look at the corpse is like the meltin snow
Seth overheard this and coming into the kitchen again as his mother rose from her chair he said Adams asleep in the workshop mother
Theedst better not wake him
He was oerwrought with work and trouble
Wake him
Whos agoin to wake him
I shanna wake him wi lookin at him
I hanna seen the lad this two hourId welly forgot as hed eer growed up from a babby whens feyther carried him
Adam was seated on a rough bench his head supported by his arm which rested from the shoulder to the elbow on the long planing table in the middle of the workshop
It seemed as if he had sat down for a few minutes rest and had fallen asleep without slipping from his first attitude of sad fatigued thought
His face unwashed since yesterday looked pallid and clammy his hair was tossed shaggily about his forehead and his closed eyes had the sunken look which follows upon watching and sorrow
His brow was knit and his whole face had an expression of weariness and pain
Gyp was evidently uneasy for he sat on his haunches resting his nose on his masters stretchedout leg and dividing the time between licking the hand that hung listlessly down and glancing with a listening air towards the door
The poor dog was hungry and restless but would not leave his master and was waiting impatiently for some change in the scene
It was owing to this feeling on Gyps part that when Lisbeth came into the workshop and advanced towards Adam as noiselessly as she could her intention not to awaken him was immediately defeated for Gyps excitement was too great to find vent in anything short of a sharp bark and in a moment Adam opened his eyes and saw his mother standing before him
It was not very unlike his dream for his sleep had been little more than living through again in a fevered delirious way all that had happened since daybreak and his mother with her fretful grief was present to him through it all
The chief difference between the reality and the vision was that in his dream Hetty was continually coming before him in bodily presencestrangely mingling herself as an actor in scenes with which she had nothing to do
She was even by the Willow Brook she made his mother angry by coming into the house and he met her with her smart clothes quite wet through as he walked in the rain to Treddleston to tell the coroner
But wherever Hetty came his mother was sure to follow soon and when he opened his eyes it was not at all startling to see her standing near him
Eh my lad my lad
Lisbeth burst out immediately her wailing impulse returning for grief in its freshness feels the need of associating its loss and its lament with every change of scene and incident theest got nobody now but thy old mother to torment thee and be a burden to thee
Thy poor feyther ull neer anger thee no more an thy mother mays well go arter himthe sooner the betterfor Im no good to nobody now
One old coat ull do to patch another but its good for nought else
Theedst like to ha a wife to mend thy clothes an get thy victual better nor thy old mother
An I shall be nought but cumber asittin i th chimneycorner
Adam winced and moved uneasily he dreaded of all things to hear his mother speak of Hetty
But if thy feyther had lived hed neer ha wanted me to go to make room for another for he could no more ha done wiout me nor one side o the scissars can do wiout th other
Eh we should ha been both flung away together an then I shouldna ha seen this day an one buryin ud ha done for us both
Here Lisbeth paused but Adam sat in pained silencehe could not speak otherwise than tenderly to his mother today but he could not help being irritated by this plaint
It was not possible for poor Lisbeth to know how it affected Adam any more than it is possible for a wounded dog to know how his moans affect the nerves of his master
Like all complaining women she complained in the expectation of being soothed and when Adam said nothing she was only prompted to complain more bitterly
I know thee couldst do better wiout me for thee couldst go where thee likedst an marry them as thee likedst
But I donna want to say thee nay let thee bring home who thee wut Id neer open my lips to find faut for when folks is old an o no use they may think theirsens well off to get the bit an the sup though theyn to swallow ill words wit
An if theest set thy heart on a lass asll bring thee nought and waste all when thee mightst ha them as ud make a man on thee Ill say nought now thy feythers dead an drownded for Im no better nor an old haft when the blades gone
Adam unable to bear this any longer rose silently from the bench and walked out of the workshop into the kitchen
But Lisbeth followed him
Thee wutna go upstairs an see thy feyther then
In done everythin now an hed like thee to go an look at him for he war allays so pleased when thee wast mild to him
Adam turned round at once and said Yes mother let us go upstairs
Come Seth let us go together
They went upstairs and for five minutes all was silence
Then the key was turned again and there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs
But Adam did not come down again he was too weary and wornout to encounter more of his mothers querulous grief and he went to rest on his bed
Lisbeth no sooner entered the kitchen and sat down than she threw her apron over her head and began to cry and moan and rock herself as before
Seth thought She will be quieter by and by now we have been upstairs and he went into the back kitchen again to tend his little fire hoping that he should presently induce her to have some tea
Lisbeth had been rocking herself in this way for more than five minutes giving a low moan with every forward movement of her body when she suddenly felt a hand placed gently on hers and a sweet treble voice said to her Dear sister the Lord has sent me to see if I can be a comfort to you
Lisbeth paused in a listening attitude without removing her apron from her face
The voice was strange to her
Could it be her sisters spirit come back to her from the dead after all those years
She trembled and dared not look
Dinah believing that this pause of wonder was in itself a relief for the sorrowing woman said no more just yet but quietly took off her bonnet and then motioning silence to Seth who on hearing her voice had come in with a beating heart laid one hand on the back of Lisbeths chair and leaned over her that she might be aware of a friendly presence
Slowly Lisbeth drew down her apron and timidly she opened her dim dark eyes
She saw nothing at first but a facea pure pale face with loving grey eyes and it was quite unknown to her
Her wonder increased perhaps it WAS an angel
But in the same instant Dinah had laid her hand on Lisbeths again and the old woman looked down at it
It was a much smaller hand than her own but it was not white and delicate for Dinah had never worn a glove in her life and her hand bore the traces of labour from her childhood upwards
Lisbeth looked earnestly at the hand for a moment and then fixing her eyes again on Dinahs face said with something of restored courage but in a tone of surprise Why yere a workin woman
Yes I am Dinah Morris and I work in the cottonmill when I am at home
Ah
said Lisbeth slowly still wondering ye comed in so light like the shadow on the wall an spoke i my ear as I thought ye might be a sperrit
Yeve got amost the face o one as is a sittin on the grave i Adams new Bible
I come from the Hall Farm now
You know Mrs Poysershes my aunt and she has heard of your great affliction and is very sorry and Im come to see if I can be any help to you in your trouble for I know your sons Adam and Seth and I know you have no daughter and when the clergyman told me how the hand of God was heavy upon you my heart went out towards you and I felt a command to come and be to you in the place of a daughter in this grief if you will let me
Ah
I know who y are now y are a Methody like Seth hes tould me on you said Lisbeth fretfully her overpowering sense of pain returning now her wonder was gone
Yell make it out as troubles a good thing like HE allays does
But wheres the use o talkin to me athatn
Ye canna make the smart less wi talkin
Yell neer make me believe as its better for me not to ha my old man die ins bed if he must die an ha the parson to pray by him an me to sit by him an tell him neer to mind th ill words Ive gien him sometimes when I war angered an to gi him a bit an a sup as long as a bit an a sup hed swallow
But eh
To die i the cold water an us close to him an neer to know an me asleepin as if I neer belonged to him no more nor if hed been a journeyman tramp from nobody knows where
Here Lisbeth began to cry and rock herself again and Dinah said Yes dear friend your affliction is great
It would be hardness of heart to say that your trouble was not heavy to bear
God didnt send me to you to make light of your sorrow but to mourn with you if you will let me
If you had a table spread for a feast and was making merry with your friends you would think it was kind to let me come and sit down and rejoice with you because youd think I should like to share those good things but I should like better to share in your trouble and your labour and it would seem harder to me if you denied me that
You wont send me away
Youre not angry with me for coming
Nay nay angered
who said I war angered
It war good on you to come
An Seth why donna ye get her some tay
Ye war in a hurry to get some for me as had no need but ye donna think o gettin t for them as wants it
Sit ye down sit ye down
I thank you kindly for comin for its little wage ye get by walkin through the wet fields to see an old woman like meNay In got no daughter o my ownneer had onean I warna sorry for theyre poor queechy things gells is I allays wanted to ha lads as could fend for theirsens
An the lads ull be marryinI shall ha daughters eno an too many
But now do ye make the tay as ye like it for In got no taste i my mouth this dayits all one what I swallerits all got the taste o sorrow wit
Dinah took care not to betray that she had had her tea and accepted Lisbeths invitation very readily for the sake of persuading the old woman herself to take the food and drink she so much needed after a day of hard work and fasting
Seth was so happy now Dinah was in the house that he could not help thinking her presence was worth purchasing with a life in which grief incessantly followed upon grief but the next moment he reproached himselfit was almost as if he were rejoicing in his fathers sad death
Nevertheless the joy of being with Dinah WOULD triumphit was like the influence of climate which no resistance can overcome
And the feeling even suffused itself over his face so as to attract his mothers notice while she was drinking her tea
Thee mayst well talk o trouble bein a good thing Seth for thee thrivst ont
Thee lookst as if thee knowdst no more o care an cumber nor when thee wast a babby alyin awake i th cradle
For theedst allays lie still wi thy eyes open an Adam neer ud lie still a minute when he wakened
Thee wast allays like a bag o meal as can neer be bruisedthough for the matter o that thy poor feyther war just such another
But yeve got the same look too here Lisbeth turned to Dinah
I reckon its wi bein a Methody
Not as Im afindin faut wi ye fort for yeve no call to be frettin an somehow ye looken sorry too
Eh
Well if the Methodies are fond o trouble theyre like to thrive its a pity they canna hat all an take it away from them as donna like it
I could ha gien em plenty for when Id gotten my old man I war worreted from morn till night and now hes gone Id be glad for the worst oer again
Yes said Dinah careful not to oppose any feeling of Lisbeths for her reliance in her smallest words and deeds on a divine guidance always issued in that finest womans tact which proceeds from acute and ready sympathy yes I remember too when my dear aunt died I longed for the sound of her bad cough in the nights instead of the silence that came when she was gone
But now dear friend drink this other cup of tea and eat a little more
What
said Lisbeth taking the cup and speaking in a less querulous tone had ye got no feyther and mother then as ye war so sorry about your aunt
No I never knew a father or mother my aunt brought me up from a baby
She had no children for she was never married and she brought me up as tenderly as if Id been her own child
Eh shed fine work wi ye Ill warrant bringin ye up from a babby an her a lone womanits ill bringin up a cade lamb
But I daresay ye warna franzy for ye look as if yed neer been angered i your life
But what did ye do when your aunt died an why didna ye come to live in this country bein as Mrs Poysers your aunt too
Dinah seeing that Lisbeths attention was attracted told her the story of her early lifehow she had been brought up to work hard and what sort of place Snowfield was and how many people had a hard life thereall the details that she thought likely to interest Lisbeth
The old woman listened and forgot to be fretful unconsciously subject to the soothing influence of Dinahs face and voice
After a while she was persuaded to let the kitchen be made tidy for Dinah was bent on this believing that the sense of order and quietude around her would help in disposing Lisbeth to join in the prayer she longed to pour forth at her side
Seth meanwhile went out to chop wood for he surmised that Dinah would like to be left alone with his mother
Lisbeth sat watching her as she moved about in her still quick way and said at last Yeve got a notion o cleanin up
I wouldna mind hain ye for a daughter for ye wouldna spend the lads wage i fine clothes an waste
Yere not like the lasses o this countryside
I reckon folks is different at Snowfield from what they are here
They have a different sort of life many of em said Dinah they work at different thingssome in the mill and many in the mines in the villages round about
But the heart of man is the same everywhere and there are the children of this world and the children of light there as well as elsewhere
But weve many more Methodists there than in this country
Well I didna know as the Methody women war like ye for theres Will Maskerys wife as they says a big Methody isna pleasant to look at at all
Id as lief look at a tooad
An Im thinkin I wouldna mind if yed stay an sleep here for I should like to see ye i th house i th mornin
But mayhappen theyll be lookin for ye at Mester Poysers
No said Dinah they dont expect me and I should like to stay if youll let me
Well theres room In got my bed laid i th little room oer the back kitchen an ye can lie beside me
Id be glad to ha ye wi me to speak to i th night for yeve got a nice way o talkin
It puts me i mind o the swallows as was under the thack last ear when they fust begun to sing low an softlike i th mornin
Eh but my old man war fond o them birds
An so war Adam but theyn neer comed again this ear
Happen THEYRE dead too
There said Dinah now the kitchen looks tidy and now dear Motherfor Im your daughter tonight you knowI should like you to wash your face and have a clean cap on
Do you remember what David did when God took away his child from him
While the child was yet alive he fasted and prayed to God to spare it and he would neither eat nor drink but lay on the ground all night beseeching God for the child
But when he knew it was dead he rose up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes and ate and drank and when they asked him how it was that he seemed to have left off grieving now the child was dead he said While the child was yet alive I fasted and wept for I said Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me that the child may live
But now he is dead wherefore should I fast
Can I bring him back again
I shall go to him but he shall not return to me
Eh thats a true word said Lisbeth
Yea my old man wonna come back to me but I shall go to himthe sooner the better
Well ye may do as ye like wi me theres a clean cap i that drawer an Ill go i the back kitchen an wash my face
An Seth thee mayst reach down Adams new Bible wi th picters in an she shall read us a chapter
Eh I like them wordsI shall go to him but he wonna come back to me
Dinah and Seth were both inwardly offering thanks for the greater quietness of spirit that had come over Lisbeth
This was what Dinah had been trying to bring about through all her still sympathy and absence from exhortation
From her girlhood upwards she had had experience among the sick and the mourning among minds hardened and shrivelled through poverty and ignorance and had gained the subtlest perception of the mode in which they could best be touched and softened into willingness to receive words of spiritual consolation or warning
As Dinah expressed it she was never left to herself but it was always given her when to keep silence and when to speak
And do we not all agree to call rapid thought and noble impulse by the name of inspiration
After our subtlest analysis of the mental process we must still say as Dinah did that our highest thoughts and our best deeds are all given to us
And so there was earnest prayerthere was faith love and hope pouring forth that evening in the littie kitchen
And poor aged fretful Lisbeth without grasping any distinct idea without going through any course of religious emotions felt a vague sense of goodness and love and of something right lying underneath and beyond all this sorrowing life
She couldnt understand the sorrow but for these moments under the subduing influence of Dinahs spirit she felt that she must be patient and still
Chapter XI In the Cottage IT was but halfpast four the next morning when Dinah tired of lying awake listening to the birds and watching the growing light through the little window in the garret roof rose and began to dress herself very quietly lest she should disturb Lisbeth
But already some one else was astir in the house and had gone downstairs preceded by Gyp
The dogs pattering step was a sure sign that it was Adam who went down but Dinah was not aware of this and she thought it was more likely to be Seth for he had told her how Adam had stayed up working the night before
Seth however had only just awakened at the sound of the opening door
The exciting influence of the previous day heightened at last by Dinahs unexpected presence had not been counteracted by any bodily weariness for he had not done his ordinary amount of hard work and so when he went to bed it was not till he had tired himself with hours of tossing wakefulness that drowsiness came and led on a heavier morning sleep than was usual with him
But Adam had been refreshed by his long rest and with his habitual impatience of mere passivity he was eager to begin the new day and subdue sadness by his strong will and strong arm
The white mist lay in the valley it was going to be a bright warm day and he would start to work again when he had had his breakfast
Theres nothing but whats bearable as long as a man can work he said to himself the natur o things doesnt change though it seems as if ones own life was nothing but change
The square o four is sixteen and you must lengthen your lever in proportion to your weight is as true when a mans miserable as when hes happy and the best o working is it gives you a grip hold o things outside your own lot
As he dashed the cold water over his head and face he felt completely himself again and with his black eyes as keen as ever and his thick black hair all glistening with the fresh moisture he went into the workshop to look out the wood for his fathers coffin intending that he and Seth should carry it with them to Jonathan Burges and have the coffin made by one of the workmen there so that his mother might not see and hear the sad task going forward at home
He had just gone into the workshop when his quick ear detected a light rapid foot on the stairscertainly not his mothers
He had been in bed and asleep when Dinah had come in in the evening and now he wondered whose step this could be
A foolish thought came and moved him strangely
As if it could be Hetty
She was the last person likely to be in the house
And yet he felt reluctant to go and look and have the clear proof that it was some one else
He stood leaning on a plank he had taken hold of listening to sounds which his imagination interpreted for him so pleasantly that the keen strong face became suffused with a timid tenderness
The light footstep moved about the kitchen followed by the sound of the sweeping brush hardly making so much noise as the lightest breeze that chases the autumn leaves along the dusty path and Adams imagination saw a dimpled face with dark bright eyes and roguish smiles looking backward at this brush and a rounded figure just leaning a little to clasp the handle
A very foolish thoughtit could not be Hetty but the only way of dismissing such nonsense from his head was to go and see WHO it was for his fancy only got nearer and nearer to belief while he stood there listening
He loosed the plank and went to the kitchen door
How do you do Adam Bede
said Dinah in her calm treble pausing from her sweeping and fixing her mild grave eyes upon him
I trust you feel rested and strengthened again to bear the burden and heat of the day
It was like dreaming of the sunshine and awaking in the moonlight
Adam had seen Dinah several times but always at the Hall Farm where he was not very vividly conscious of any womans presence except Hettys and he had only in the last day or two begun to suspect that Seth was in love with her so that his attention had not hitherto been drawn towards her for his brothers sake
But now her slim figure her plain black gown and her pale serene face impressed him with all the force that belongs to a reality contrasted with a preoccupying fancy
For the first moment or two he made no answer but looked at her with the concentrated examining glance which a man gives to an object in which he has suddenly begun to be interested
Dinah for the first time in her life felt a painful selfconsciousness there was something in the dark penetrating glance of this strong man so different from the mildness and timidity of his brother Seth
A faint blush came which deepened as she wondered at it
This blush recalled Adam from his forgetfulness
I was quite taken by surprise it was very good of you to come and see my mother in her trouble he said in a gentle grateful tone for his quick mind told him at once how she came to be there
I hope my mother was thankful to have you he added wondering rather anxiously what had been Dinahs reception
Yes said Dinah resuming her work she seemed greatly comforted after a while and shes had a good deal of rest in the night by times
She was fast asleep when I left her
Who was it took the news to the Hall Farm
said Adam his thoughts reverting to some one there he wondered whether SHE had felt anything about it
It was Mr Irwine the clergyman told me and my aunt was grieved for your mother when she heard it and wanted me to come and so is my uncle Im sure now hes heard it but he was gone out to Rosseter all yesterday
Theyll look for you there as soon as youve got time to go for theres nobody round that hearth but whats glad to see you
Dinah with her sympathetic divination knew quite well that Adam was longing to hear if Hetty had said anything about their trouble she was too rigorously truthful for benevolent invention but she had contrived to say something in which Hetty was tacitly included
Love has a way of cheating itself consciously like a child who plays at solitary hideandseek it is pleased with assurances that it all the while disbelieves
Adam liked what Dinah had said so much that his mind was directly full of the next visit he should pay to the Hall Farm when Hetty would perhaps behave more kindly to him than she had ever done before
But you wont be there yourself any longer
he said to Dinah
No I go back to Snowfield on Saturday and I shall have to set out to Treddleston early to be in time for the Oakbourne carrier
So I must go back to the farm tonight that I may have the last day with my aunt and her children
But I can stay here all to day if your mother would like me and her heart seemed inclined towards me last night
Ah then shes sure to want you today
If mother takes to people at the beginning shes sure to get fond of em but shes a strange way of not liking young women
Though to be sure Adam went on smiling her not liking other young women is no reason why she shouldnt like you
Hitherto Gyp had been assisting at this conversation in motionless silence seated on his haunches and alternately looking up in his masters face to watch its expression and observing Dinahs movements about the kitchen
The kind smile with which Adam uttered the last words was apparently decisive with Gyp of the light in which the stranger was to be regarded and as she turned round after putting aside her sweepingbrush he trotted towards her and put up his muzzle against her hand in a friendly way
You see Gyp bids you welcome said Adam and hes very slow to welcome strangers
Poor dog
said Dinah patting the rough grey coat Ive a strange feeling about the dumb things as if they wanted to speak and it was a trouble to em because they couldnt
I cant help being sorry for the dogs always though perhaps theres no need
But they may well have more in them than they know how to make us understand for we cant say half what we feel with all our words
Seth came down now and was pleased to find Adam talking with Dinah he wanted Adam to know how much better she was than all other women
But after a few words of greeting Adam drew him into the workshop to consult about the coffin and Dinah went on with her cleaning
By six oclock they were all at breakfast with Lisbeth in a kitchen as clean as she could have made it herself
The window and door were open and the morning air brought with it a mingled scent of southernwood thyme and sweetbriar from the patch of garden by the side of the cottage
Dinah did not sit down at first but moved about serving the others with the warm porridge and the toasted oatcake which she had got ready in the usual way for she had asked Seth to tell her just what his mother gave them for breakfast
Lisbeth had been unusually silent since she came downstairs apparently requiring some time to adjust her ideas to a state of things in which she came down like a lady to find all the work done and sat still to be waited on
Her new sensations seemed to exclude the remembrance of her grief
At last after tasting the porridge she broke silence Ye might ha made the parridge worse she said to Dinah I can ate it wiout its turnin my stomach
It might ha been a trifle thicker an no harm an I allays putten a sprig o mint in mysen but hows ye t know that
The lads arena like to get folks as ll make their parridge as In made it for em its well if they get onybody as ll make parridge at all
But ye might do wi a bit o showin for yere a stirrin body in a mornin an yeve a light heel an yeve cleaned th house well enough for a mashift
Makeshift mother
said Adam
Why I think the house looks beautiful
I dont know how it could look better
Thee dostna know
Nay hows thee to know
Th men neer know whether the floors cleaned or catlicked
But theelt know when thee gets thy parridge burnt as its like enough to be when In gien oer makin it
Theelt think thy mother war good for summat then
Dinah said Seth do come and sit down now and have your breakfast
Were all served now
Aye come an sit ye downdo said Lisbeth an ate a morsel yed need arter bein upo your legs this hour an half aready
Come then she added in a tone of complaining affection as Dinah sat down by her side Ill be loath for ye t go but ye canna stay much longer I doubt
I could put up wi ye i th house better nor wi most folks
Ill stay till tonight if youre willing said Dinah
Id stay longer only Im going back to Snowfield on Saturday and I must be with my aunt tomorrow
Eh Id neer go back to that country
My old man come from that Stonyshire side but he left it when he war a young un an i the right ont too for he said as there war no wood there an it ud ha been a bad country for a carpenter
Ah said Adam I remember father telling me when I was a little lad that he made up his mind if ever he moved it should be southard
But Im not so sure about it
Bartle Massey saysand he knows the Southas the northern men are a finer breed than the southern harderheaded and strongerbodied and a deal taller
And then he says in some o those counties its as flat as the back o your hand and you can see nothing of a distance without climbing up the highest trees
I couldnt abide that
I like to go to work by a road thatll take me up a bit of a hill and see the fields for miles round me and a bridge or a town or a bit of a steeple here and there
It makes you feel the worlds a big place and theres other men working in it with their heads and hands besides yourself
I like th hills best said Seth when the clouds are over your head and you see the sun shining ever so far off over the Loamford way as Ive often done o late on the stormy days
It seems to me as if that was heaven where theres always joy and sunshine though this lifes dark and cloudy
Oh I love the Stonyshire side said Dinah I shouldnt like to set my face towards the countries where theyre rich in corn and cattle and the ground so level and easy to tread and to turn my back on the hills where the poor people have to live such a hard life and the men spend their days in the mines away from the sunlight
Its very blessed on a bleak cold day when the sky is hanging dark over the hill to feel the love of God in ones soul and carry it to the lonely bare stone houses where theres nothing else to give comfort
Eh
said Lisbeth thats very well for ye to talk as looks welly like the snowdropflowers as ha lived for days an days when In gethered em wi nothin but a drop o water an a peep o daylight but th hungry foulks had better leave th hungry country
It makes less mouths for the scant cake
But she went on looking at Adam donna thee talk o goin southard or northard an leavin thy feyther and mother i the churchyard an goin to a country as they know nothin on
Ill neer rest i my grave if I donna see thee i the churchyard of a Sunday
Donna fear mother said Adam
If I hadna made up my mind not to go I should ha been gone before now
He had finished his breakfast now and rose as he was speaking
What art goin to do
asked Lisbeth
Set about thy feythers coffin
No mother said Adam were going to take the wood to the village and have it made there
Nay my lad nay Lisbeth burst out in an eager wailing tone thee wotna let nobody make thy feythers coffin but thysen
Whod make it so well
An him as knowd what good work war ans got a son as is the head o the village an all Treddleson too for cleverness
Very well mother if thats thy wish Ill make the coffin at home but I thought thee wouldstna like to hear the work going on
An why shouldna I like t
Its the right thing to be done
An whats liking got to do wit
Its choice o mislikings is all In got i this world
One morsels as good as another when your mouths out o taste
Thee mun set about it now this mornin fust thing
I wonna ha nobody to touch the coffin but thee
Adams eyes met Seths which looked from Dinah to him rather wistfully
No Mother he said Ill not consent but Seth shall have a hand in it too if its to be done at home
Ill go to the village this forenoon because Mr Burge ull want to see me and Seth shall stay at home and begin the coffin
I can come back at noon and then he can go
Nay nay persisted Lisbeth beginning to cry In set my heart ont as thee shalt ma thy feythers coffin
Theet so stiff an masterful theet neer do as thy mother wants thee
Thee wast often angered wi thy feyther when he war alive thee must be the better to him now hes gone
Hed ha thought nothin ont for Seth to mas coffin
Say no more Adam say no more said Seth gently though his voice told that he spoke with some effort Mothers in the right
Ill go to work and do thee stay at home
He passed into the workshop immediately followed by Adam while Lisbeth automatically obeying her old habits began to put away the breakfast things as if she did not mean Dinah to take her place any longer
Dinah said nothing but presently used the opportunity of quietly joining the brothers in the workshop
They had already got on their aprons and paper caps and Adam was standing with his left hand on Seths shoulder while he pointed with the hammer in his right to some boards which they were looking at
Their backs were turned towards the door by which Dinah entered and she came in so gently that they were not aware of her presence till they heard her voice saying Seth Bede
Seth started and they both turned round
Dinah looked as if she did not see Adam and fixed her eyes on Seths face saying with calm kindness I wont say farewell
I shall see you again when you come from work
So as Im at the farm before dark it will be quite soon enough
Thank you Dinah I should like to walk home with you once more
Itll perhaps be the last time
There was a little tremor in Seths voice
Dinah put out her hand and said Youll have sweet peace in your mind today Seth for your tenderness and longsuffering towards your aged mother
She turned round and left the workshop as quickly and quietly as she had entered it
Adam had been observing her closely all the while but she had not looked at him
As soon as she was gone he said I dont wonder at thee for loving her Seth
Shes got a face like a lily
Seths soul rushed to his eyes and lips he had never yet confessed his secret to Adam but now he felt a delicious sense of disburdenment as he answered Aye Addy I do love hertoo much I doubt
But she doesna love me lad only as one child o God loves another
Shell never love any man as a husbandthats my belief
Nay lad theres no telling thee mustna lose heart
Shes made out o stuff with a finer grain than most o the women I can see that clear enough
But if shes better than they are in other things I canna think shell fall short of em in loving
No more was said
Seth set out to the village and Adam began his work on the coffin
God help the lad and me too he thought as he lifted the board
Were like enough to find life a tough jobhard work inside and out
Its a strange thing to think of a man as can lift a chair with his teeth and walk fifty mile on end trembling and turning hot and cold at only a look from one woman out of all the rest i the world
Its a mystery we can give no account of but no more we can of the sprouting o the seed for that matter
Chapter XII In the Wood THAT same Thursday morning as Arthur Donnithorne was moving about in his dressingroom seeing his welllooking British person reflected in the oldfashioned mirrors and stared at from a dingy olivegreen piece of tapestry by Pharaohs daughter and her maidens who ought to have been minding the infant Moses he was holding a discussion with himself which by the time his valet was tying the black silk sling over his shoulder had issued in a distinct practical resolution
I mean to go to Eagledale and fish for a week or so he said aloud
I shall take you with me Pym and set off this morning so be ready by halfpast eleven
The low whistle which had assisted him in arriving at this resolution here broke out into his loudest ringing tenor and the corridor as he hurried along it echoed to his favourite song from the Beggars Opera When the heart of a man is oppressed with care
Not an heroic strain nevertheless Arthur felt himself very heroic as he strode towards the stables to give his orders about the horses
His own approbation was necessary to him and it was not an approbation to be enjoyed quite gratuitously it must be won by a fair amount of merit
He had never yet forfeited that approbation and he had considerable reliance on his own virtues
No young man could confess his faults more candidly candour was one of his favourite virtues and how can a mans candour be seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of
But he had an agreeable confidence that his faults were all of a generous kindimpetuous warm blooded leonine never crawling crafty reptilian
It was not possible for Arthur Donnithorne to do anything mean dastardly or cruel
No
Im a devil of a fellow for getting myself into a hobble but I always take care the load shall fall on my own shoulders
Unhappily there is no inherent poetical justice in hobbles and they will sometimes obstinately refuse to inflict their worst consequences on the prime offender in spite of his loudly expressed wish
It was entirely owing to this deficiency in the scheme of things that Arthur had ever brought any one into trouble besides himself
He was nothing if not goodnatured and all his pictures of the future when he should come into the estate were made up of a prosperous contented tenantry adoring their landlord who would be the model of an English gentleman mansion in firstrate order all elegance and high tastejolly housekeeping finest stud in Loamshirepurse open to all public objectsin short everything as different as possible from what was now associated with the name of Donnithorne
And one of the first good actions he would perform in that future should be to increase Irwines income for the vicarage of Hayslope so that he might keep a carriage for his mother and sisters
His hearty affection for the rector dated from the age of frocks and trousers
It was an affection partly filial partly fraternal fraternal enough to make him like Irwines company better than that of most younger men and filial enough to make him shrink strongly from incurring Irwines disapprobation
You perceive that Arthur Donnithorne was a good fellowall his college friends thought him such
He couldnt bear to see any one uncomfortable he would have been sorry even in his angriest moods for any harm to happen to his grandfather and his Aunt Lydia herself had the benefit of that softheartedness which he bore towards the whole sex
Whether he would have selfmastery enough to be always as harmless and purely beneficent as his goodnature led him to desire was a question that no one had yet decided against him he was but twentyone you remember and we dont inquire too closely into character in the case of a handsome generous young fellow who will have property enough to support numerous peccadilloeswho if he should unfortunately break a mans legs in his rash driving will be able to pension him handsomely or if he should happen to spoil a womans existence for her will make it up to her with expensive bonbons packed up and directed by his own hand
It would be ridiculous to be prying and analytic in such cases as if one were inquiring into the character of a confidential clerk
We use round general gentlemanly epithets about a young man of birth and fortune and ladies with that fine intuition which is the distinguishing attribute of their sex see at once that he is nice
The chances are that he will go through life without scandalizing any one a seaworthy vessel that no one would refuse to insure
Ships certainly are liable to casualties which sometimes make terribly evident some flaw in their construction that would never have been discoverable in smooth water and many a good fellow through a disastrous combination of circumstances has undergone a like betrayal
But we have no fair ground for entertaining unfavourable auguries concerning Arthur Donnithorne who this morning proves himself capable of a prudent resolution founded on conscience
One thing is clear Nature has taken care that he shall never go far astray with perfect comfort and satisfaction to himself he will never get beyond that borderland of sin where he will be perpetually harassed by assaults from the other side of the boundary
He will never be a courtier of Vice and wear her orders in his button hole
It was about ten oclock and the sun was shining brilliantly everything was looking lovelier for the yesterdays rain
It is a pleasant thing on such a morning to walk along the wellrolled gravel on ones way to the stables meditating an excursion
But the scent of the stables which in a natural state of things ought to be among the soothing influences of a mans life always brought with it some irritation to Arthur
There was no having his own way in the stables everything was managed in the stingiest fashion
His grandfather persisted in retaining as head groom an old dolt whom no sort of lever could move out of his old habits and who was allowed to hire a succession of raw Loamshire lads as his subordinates one of whom had lately tested a new pair of shears by clipping an oblong patch on Arthurs bay mare
This state of things is naturally embittering one can put up with annoyances in the house but to have the stable made a scene of vexation and disgust is a point beyond what human flesh and blood can be expected to endure long together without danger of misanthropy
Old Johns wooden deepwrinkled face was the first object that met Arthurs eyes as he entered the stableyard and it quite poisoned for him the bark of the two bloodhounds that kept watch there
He could never speak quite patiently to the old blockhead
You must have Meg saddled for me and brought to the door at half past eleven and I shall want Rattler saddled for Pym at the same time
Do you hear
Yes I hear I hear Capn said old John very deliberately following the young master into the stable
John considered a young master as the natural enemy of an old servant and young people in general as a poor contrivance for carrying on the world
Arthur went in for the sake of patting Meg declining as far as possible to see anything in the stables lest he should lose his temper before breakfast
The pretty creature was in one of the inner stables and turned her mild head as her master came beside her
Little Trot a tiny spaniel her inseparable companion in the stable was comfortably curled up on her back
Well Meg my pretty girl said Arthur patting her neck well have a glorious canter this morning
Nay your honour I donna see as that can be said John
Not be
Why not
Why shes got lamed
Lamed confound you
What do you mean
Why th lad took her too close to Daltons hosses an one on em flung out at her an shes got her shank bruised o the near foreleg
The judicious historian abstains from narrating precisely what ensued
You understand that there was a great deal of strong language mingled with soothing whohos while the leg was examined that John stood by with quite as much emotion as if he had been a cunningly carved crabtree walkingstick and that Arthur Donnithorne presently repassed the iron gates of the pleasureground without singing as he went
He considered himself thoroughly disappointed and annoyed
There was not another mount in the stable for himself and his servant besides Meg and Rattler
It was vexatious just when he wanted to get out of the way for a week or two
It seemed culpable in Providence to allow such a combination of circumstances
To be shut up at the Chase with a broken arm when every other fellow in his regiment was enjoying himself at Windsorshut up with his grandfather who had the same sort of affection for him as for his parchment deeds
And to be disgusted at every turn with the management of the house and the estate
In such circumstances a man necessarily gets in an ill humour and works off the irritation by some excess or other
Salkeld would have drunk a bottle of port every day he muttered to himself but Im not well seasoned enough for that
Well since I cant go to Eagledale Ill have a gallop on Rattler to Norburne this morning and lunch with Gawaine
Behind this explicit resolution there lay an implicit one
If he lunched with Gawaine and lingered chatting he should not reach the Chase again till nearly five when Hetty would be safe out of his sight in the housekeepers room and when she set out to go home it would be his lazy time after dinner so he should keep out of her way altogether
There really would have been no harm in being kind to the little thing and it was worth dancing with a dozen ballroom belles only to look at Hetty for half an hour
But perhaps he had better not take any more notice of her it might put notions into her head as Irwine had hinted though Arthur for his part thought girls were not by any means so soft and easily bruised indeed he had generally found them twice as cool and cunning as he was himself
As for any real harm in Hettys case it was out of the question Arthur Donnithorne accepted his own bond for himself with perfect confidence
So the twelve oclock sun saw him galloping towards Norburne and by good fortune Halsell Common lay in his road and gave him some fine leaps for Rattler
Nothing like taking a few bushes and ditches for exorcising a demon and it is really astonishing that the Centaurs with their immense advantages in this way have left so bad a reputation in history
After this you will perhaps be surprised to hear that although Gawaine was at home the hand of the dial in the courtyard had scarcely cleared the last stroke of three when Arthur returned through the entrancegates got down from the panting Rattler and went into the house to take a hasty luncheon
But I believe there have been men since his day who have ridden a long way to avoid a rencontre and then galloped hastily back lest they should miss it
It is the favourite stratagem of our passions to sham a retreat and to turn sharp round upon us at the moment we have made up our minds that the day is our own
The capns been ridin the devils own pace said Dalton the coachman whose person stood out in high relief as he smoked his pipe against the stable wall when John brought up Rattler
An I wish hed get the devil to dos grooming forn growled John
Aye hed hev a deal haimabler groom nor what he has now observed Daltonand the joke appeared to him so good that being left alone upon the scene he continued at intervals to take his pipe from his mouth in order to wink at an imaginary audience and shake luxuriously with a silent ventral laughter mentally rehearsing the dialogue from the beginning that he might recite it with effect in the servants hall
When Arthur went up to his dressingroom again after luncheon it was inevitable that the debate he had had with himself there earlier in the day should flash across his mind but it was impossible for him now to dwell on the remembranceimpossible to recall the feelings and reflections which had been decisive with him then any more than to recall the peculiar scent of the air that had freshened him when he first opened his window
The desire to see Hetty had rushed back like an illstemmed current he was amazed himself at the force with which this trivial fancy seemed to grasp him he was even rather tremulous as he brushed his hairpooh
it was riding in that breakneck way
It was because he had made a serious affair of an idle matter by thinking of it as if it were of any consequence
He would amuse himself by seeing Hetty today and get rid of the whole thing from his mind
It was all Irwines fault
If Irwine had said nothing I shouldnt have thought half so much of Hetty as of Megs lameness
However it was just the sort of day for lolling in the Hermitage and he would go and finish Dr Moores Zeluco there before dinner
The Hermitage stood in Firtree Grovethe way Hetty was sure to come in walking from the Hall Farm
So nothing could be simpler and more natural meeting Hetty was a mere circumstance of his walk not its object
Arthurs shadow flitted rather faster among the sturdy oaks of the Chase than might have been expected from the shadow of a tired man on a warm afternoon and it was still scarcely four oclock when he stood before the tall narrow gate leading into the delicious labyrinthine wood which skirted one side of the Chase and which was called Firtree Grove not because the firs were many but because they were few
It was a wood of beeches and limes with here and there a light silverstemmed birchjust the sort of wood most haunted by the nymphs you see their white sunlit limbs gleaming athwart the boughs or peeping from behind the smooth sweeping outline of a tall lime you hear their soft liquid laughterbut if you look with a too curious sacrilegious eye they vanish behind the silvery beeches they make you believe that their voice was only a running brooklet perhaps they metamorphose themselves into a tawny squirrel that scampers away and mocks you from the topmost bough
It was not a grove with measured grass or rolled gravel for you to tread upon but with narrow hollow shaped earthy paths edged with faint dashes of delicate moss paths which look as if they were made by the free will of the trees and underwood moving reverently aside to look at the tall queen of the whitefooted nymphs
It was along the broadest of these paths that Arthur Donnithorne passed under an avenue of limes and beeches
It was a still afternoonthe golden light was lingering languidly among the upper boughs only glancing down here and there on the purple pathway and its edge of faintly sprinkled moss an afternoon in which destiny disguises her cold awful face behind a hazy radiant veil encloses us in warm downy wings and poisons us with violet scented breath
Arthur strolled along carelessly with a book under his arm but not looking on the ground as meditative men are apt to do his eyes WOULD fix themselves on the distant bend in the road round which a little figure must surely appear before long
Ah
There she comes
First a bright patch of colour like a tropic bird among the boughs then a tripping figure with a round hat on and a small basket under her arm then a deep blushing almost frightened but brightsmiling girl making her curtsy with a fluttered yet happy glance as Arthur came up to her
If Arthur had had time to think at all he would have thought it strange that he should feel fluttered too be conscious of blushing tooin fact look and feel as foolish as if he had been taken by surprise instead of meeting just what he expected
Poor things
It was a pity they were not in that golden age of childhood when they would have stood face to face eyeing each other with timid liking then given each other a little butterfly kiss and toddled off to play together
Arthur would have gone home to his silkcurtained cot and Hetty to her homespun pillow and both would have slept without dreams and tomorrow would have been a life hardly conscious of a yesterday
Arthur turned round and walked by Hettys side without giving a reason
They were alone together for the first time
What an overpowering presence that first privacy is
He actually dared not look at this little buttermaker for the first minute or two
As for Hetty her feet rested on a cloud and she was borne along by warm zephyrs she had forgotten her rosecoloured ribbons she was no more conscious of her limbs than if her childish soul had passed into a waterlily resting on a liquid bed and warmed by the midsummer sunbeams
It may seem a contradiction but Arthur gathered a certain carelessness and confidence from his timidity it was an entirely different state of mind from what he had expected in such a meeting with Hetty and full as he was of vague feeling there was room in those moments of silence for the thought that his previous debates and scruples were needless
You are quite right to choose this way of coming to the Chase he said at last looking down at Hetty it is so much prettier as well as shorter than coming by either of the lodges
Yes sir Hetty answered with a tremulous almost whispering voice
She didnt know one bit how to speak to a gentleman like Mr Arthur and her very vanity made her more coy of speech
Do you come every week to see Mrs
Pomfret
Yes sir every Thursday only when shes got to go out with Miss Donnithorne
And shes teaching you something is she
Yes sir the lacemending as she learnt abroad and the stockingmendingit looks just like the stocking you cant tell its been mended and she teaches me cuttingout too
What
are YOU going to be a ladys maid
I should like to be one very much indeed
Hetty spoke more audibly now but still rather tremulously she thought perhaps she seemed as stupid to Captain Donnithorne as Luke Britton did to her
I suppose Mrs Pomfret always expects you at this time
She expects me at four oclock
Im rather late today because my aunt couldnt spare me but the regular time is four because that gives us time before Miss Donnithornes bell rings
Ah then I must not keep you now else I should like to show you the Hermitage
Did you ever see it
No sir
This is the walk where we turn up to it
But we must not go now
Ill show it you some other time if youd like to see it
Yes please sir
Do you always come back this way in the evening or are you afraid to come so lonely a road
Oh no sir its never late I always set out by eight oclock and its so light now in the evening
My aunt would be angry with me if I didnt get home before nine
Perhaps Craig the gardener comes to take care of you
A deep blush overspread Hettys face and neck
Im sure he doesnt Im sure he never did I wouldnt let him I dont like him she said hastily and the tears of vexation had come so fast that before she had done speaking a bright drop rolled down her hot cheek
Then she felt ashamed to death that she was crying and for one long instant her happiness was all gone
But in the next she felt an arm steal round her and a gentle voice said Why Hetty what makes you cry
I didnt mean to vex you
I wouldnt vex you for the world you little blossom
Come dont cry look at me else I shall think you wont forgive me
Arthur had laid his hand on the soft arm that was nearest to him and was stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing entreaty
Hetty lifted her long dewy lashes and met the eyes that were bent towards her with a sweet timid beseeching look
What a space of time those three moments were while their eyes met and his arms touched her
Love is such a simple thing when we have only one andtwenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance as if she were a bud first opening her heart with wondering rapture to the morning
Such young unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches that touch softly and are at rest they mingle as easily as two brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and ripple with ever interlacing curves in the leafiest hidingplaces
While Arthur gazed into Hettys dark beseeching eyes it made no difference to him what sort of English she spoke and even if hoops and powder had been in fashion he would very likely not have been sensible just then that Hetty wanted those signs of high breeding
But they started asunder with beating hearts something had fallen on the ground with a rattling noise it was Hettys basket all her little workwomans matters were scattered on the path some of them showing a capability of rolling to great lengths
There was much to be done in picking up and not a word was spoken but when Arthur hung the basket over her arm again the poor child felt a strange difference in his look and manner
He just pressed her hand and said with a look and tone that were almost chilling to her I have been hindering you I must not keep you any longer now
You will be expected at the house
Goodbye
Without waiting for her to speak he turned away from her and hurried back towards the road that led to the Hermitage leaving Hetty to pursue her way in a strange dream that seemed to have begun in bewildering delight and was now passing into contrarieties and sadness
Would he meet her again as she came home
Why had he spoken almost as if he were displeased with her
And then run away so suddenly
She cried hardly knowing why
Arthur too was very uneasy but his feelings were lit up for him by a more distinct consciousness
He hurried to the Hermitage which stood in the heart of the wood unlocked the door with a hasty wrench slammed it after him pitched Zeluco into the most distant corner and thrusting his right hand into his pocket first walked four or five times up and down the scanty length of the little room and then seated himself on the ottoman in an uncomfortable stiff way as we often do when we wish not to abandon ourselves to feeling
He was getting in love with Hettythat was quite plain
He was ready to pitch everything elseno matter wherefor the sake of surrendering himself to this delicious feeling which had just disclosed itself
It was no use blinking the fact nowthey would get too fond of each other if he went on taking notice of her and what would come of it
He should have to go away in a few weeks and the poor little thing would be miserable
He MUST NOT see her alone again he must keep out of her way
What a fool he was for coming back from Gawaines
He got up and threw open the windows to let in the soft breath of the afternoon and the healthy scent of the firs that made a belt round the Hermitage
The soft air did not help his resolution as he leaned out and looked into the leafy distance
But he considered his resolution sufficiently fixed there was no need to debate with himself any longer
He had made up his mind not to meet Hetty again and now he might give himself up to thinking how immensely agreeable it would be if circumstances were different how pleasant it would have been to meet her this evening as she came back and put his arm round her again and look into her sweet face
He wondered if the dear little thing were thinking of him tootwenty to one she was
How beautiful her eyes were with the tear on their lashes
He would like to satisfy his soul for a day with looking at them and he MUST see her againhe must see her simply to remove any false impression from her mind about his manner to her just now
He would behave in a quiet kind way to herjust to prevent her from going home with her head full of wrong fancies
Yes that would be the best thing to do after all
It was a long whilemore than an hour before Arthur had brought his meditations to this point but once arrived there he could stay no longer at the Hermitage
The time must be filled up with movement until he should see Hetty again
And it was already late enough to go and dress for dinner for his grandfathers dinner hour was six
Chapter XIII Evening in the Wood IT happened that Mrs Pomfret had had a slight quarrel with Mrs Best the housekeeper on this Thursday morninga fact which had two consequences highly convenient to Hetty
It caused Mrs Pomfret to have tea sent up to her own room and it inspired that exemplary ladys maid with so lively a recollection of former passages in Mrs Bests conduct and of dialogues in which Mrs Best had decidedly the inferiority as an interlocutor with Mrs Pomfret that Hetty required no more presence of mind than was demanded for using her needle and throwing in an occasional yes or no
She would have wanted to put on her hat earlier than usual only she had told Captain Donnithorne that she usually set out about eight oclock and if he SHOULD go to the Grove again expecting to see her and she should be gone
Would he come
Her little butterfly soul fluttered incessantly between memory and dubious expectation
At last the minutehand of the oldfashioned brazenfaced timepiece was on the last quarter to eight and there was every reason for its being time to get ready for departure
Even Mrs Pomfrets preoccupied mind did not prevent her from noticing what looked like a new flush of beauty in the little thing as she tied on her hat before the lookingglass
That child gets prettier and prettier every day I do believe was her inward comment
The mores the pity
Shell get neither a place nor a husband any the sooner for it
Sober welltodo men dont like such pretty wives
When I was a girl I was more admired than if I had been so very pretty
However shes reason to be grateful to me for teaching her something to get her bread with better than farmhouse work
They always told me I was goodnaturedand thats the truth and to my hurt too else theres them in this house that wouldnt be here now to lord it over me in the housekeepers room
Hetty walked hastily across the short space of pleasureground which she had to traverse dreading to meet Mr Craig to whom she could hardly have spoken civilly
How relieved she was when she had got safely under the oaks and among the fern of the Chase
Even then she was as ready to be startled as the deer that leaped away at her approach
She thought nothing of the evening light that lay gently in the grassy alleys between the fern and made the beauty of their living green more visible than it had been in the overpowering flood of noon she thought of nothing that was present
She only saw something that was possible Mr Arthur Donnithorne coming to meet her again along the Firtree Grove
That was the foreground of Hettys picture behind it lay a bright hazy somethingdays that were not to be as the other days of her life had been
It was as if she had been wooed by a rivergod who might any time take her to his wondrous halls below a watery heaven
There was no knowing what would come since this strange entrancing delight had come
If a chest full of lace and satin and jewels had been sent her from some unknown source how could she but have thought that her whole lot was going to change and that tomorrow some still more bewildering joy would befall her
Hetty had never read a novel if she had ever seen one I think the words would have been too hard for her how then could she find a shape for her expectations
They were as formless as the sweet languid odours of the garden at the Chase which had floated past her as she walked by the gate
She is at another gate nowthat leading into Firtree Grove
She enters the wood where it is already twilight and at every step she takes the fear at her heart becomes colder
If he should not come
Oh how dreary it wasthe thought of going out at the other end of the wood into the unsheltered road without having seen him
She reaches the first turning towards the Hermitage walking slowlyhe is not there
She hates the leveret that runs across the path she hates everything that is not what she longs for
She walks on happy whenever she is coming to a bend in the road for perhaps he is behind it
No
She is beginning to cry her heart has swelled so the tears stand in her eyes she gives one great sob while the corners of her mouth quiver and the tears roll down
She doesnt know that there is another turning to the Hermitage that she is close against it and that Arthur Donnithorne is only a few yards from her full of one thought and a thought of which she only is the object
He is going to see Hetty again that is the longing which has been growing through the last three hours to a feverish thirst
Not of course to speak in the caressing way into which he had unguardedly fallen before dinner but to set things right with her by a kindness which would have the air of friendly civility and prevent her from running away with wrong notions about their mutual relation
If Hetty had known he was there she would not have cried and it would have been better for then Arthur would perhaps have behaved as wisely as he had intended
As it was she started when he appeared at the end of the sidealley and looked up at him with two great drops rolling down her cheeks
What else could he do but speak to her in a soft soothing tone as if she were a brighteyed spaniel with a thorn in her foot
Has something frightened you Hetty
Have you seen anything in the wood
Dont be frightenedIll take care of you now
Hetty was blushing so she didnt know whether she was happy or miserable
To be crying againwhat did gentlemen think of girls who cried in that way
She felt unable even to say no but could only look away from him and wipe the tears from her cheek
Not before a great drop had fallen on her rosecoloured strings she knew that quite well
Come be cheerful again
Smile at me and tell me whats the matter
Come tell me
Hetty turned her head towards him whispered I thought you wouldnt come and slowly got courage to lift her eyes to him
That look was too much he must have had eyes of Egyptian granite not to look too lovingly in return
You little frightened bird
Little tearful rose
Silly pet
You wont cry again now Im with you will you
Ah he doesnt know in the least what he is saying
This is not what he meant to say
His arm is stealing round the waist again it is tightening its clasp he is bending his face nearer and nearer to the round cheek his lips are meeting those pouting childlips and for a long moment time has vanished
He may be a shepherd in Arcadia for aught he knows he may be the first youth kissing the first maiden he may be Eros himself sipping the lips of Psycheit is all one
There was no speaking for minutes after
They walked along with beating hearts till they came within sight of the gate at the end of the wood
Then they looked at each other not quite as they had looked before for in their eyes there was the memory of a kiss
But already something bitter had begun to mingle itself with the fountain of sweets already Arthur was uncomfortable
He took his arm from Hettys waist and said Here we are almost at the end of the Grove
I wonder how late it is he added pulling out his watch
Twenty minutes past eightbut my watch is too fast
However Id better not go any further now
Trot along quickly with your little feet and get home safely
Goodbye
He took her hand and looked at her halfsadly half with a constrained smile
Hettys eyes seemed to beseech him not to go away yet but he patted her cheek and said Goodbye again
She was obliged to turn away from him and go on
As for Arthur he rushed back through the wood as if he wanted to put a wide space between himself and Hetty
He would not go to the Hermitage again he remembered how he had debated with himself there before dinner and it had all come to nothingworse than nothing
He walked right on into the Chase glad to get out of the Grove which surely was haunted by his evil genius
Those beeches and smooth limesthere was something enervating in the very sight of them but the strong knotted old oaks had no bending languor in themthe sight of them would give a man some energy
Arthur lost himself among the narrow openings in the fern winding about without seeking any issue till the twilight deepened almost to night under the great boughs and the hare looked black as it darted across his path
He was feeling much more strongly than he had done in the morning it was as if his horse had wheeled round from a leap and dared to dispute his mastery
He was dissatisfied with himself irritated mortified
He no sooner fixed his mind on the probable consequences of giving way to the emotions which had stolen over him todayof continuing to notice Hetty of allowing himself any opportunity for such slight caresses as he had been betrayed into alreadythan he refused to believe such a future possible for himself
To flirt with Hetty was a very different affair from flirting with a pretty girl of his own station that was understood to be an amusement on both sides or if it became serious there was no obstacle to marriage
But this little thing would be spoken ill of directly if she happened to be seen walking with him and then those excellent people the Poysers to whom a good name was as precious as if they had the best blood in the land in their veinshe should hate himself if he made a scandal of that sort on the estate that was to be his own some day and among tenants by whom he liked above all to be respected
He could no more believe that he should so fall in his own esteem than that he should break both his legs and go on crutches all the rest of his life
He couldnt imagine himself in that position it was too odious too unlike him
And even if no one knew anything about it they might get too fond of each other and then there could be nothing but the misery of parting after all
No gentleman out of a ballad could marry a farmers niece
There must be an end to the whole thing at once
It was too foolish
And yet he had been so determined this morning before he went to Gawaines and while he was there something had taken hold of him and made him gallop back
It seemed he couldnt quite depend on his own resolution as he had thought he could he almost wished his arm would get painful again and then he should think of nothing but the comfort it would be to get rid of the pain
There was no knowing what impulse might seize him tomorrow in this confounded place where there was nothing to occupy him imperiously through the livelong day
What could he do to secure himself from any more of this folly
There was but one resource
He would go and tell Irwinetell him everything
The mere act of telling it would make it seem trivial the temptation would vanish as the charm of fond words vanishes when one repeats them to the indifferent
In every way it would help him to tell Irwine
He would ride to Broxton Rectory the first thing after breakfast tomorrow
Arthur had no sooner come to this determination than he began to think which of the paths would lead him home and made as short a walk thither as he could
He felt sure he should sleep now he had had enough to tire him and there was no more need for him to think
Chapter XIV The Return Home WHILE that parting in the wood was happening there was a parting in the cottage too and Lisbeth had stood with Adam at the door straining her aged eyes to get the last glimpse of Seth and Dinah as they mounted the opposite slope
Eh Im loath to see the last on her she said to Adam as they turned into the house again
Id ha been willin t ha her about me till I died and went to lie by my old man
Shed make it easier dyinshe spakes so gentle an moves about so still
I could be fast sure that pictur was drawed for her i thy new Bibleth angel asittin on the big stone by the grave
Eh I wouldna mind hain a daughter like that but nobody neer marries them as is good for aught
Well Mother I hope thee WILT have her for a daughter for Seths got a liking for her and I hope shell get a liking for Seth in time
Wheres th use o talkin athatn
She caresna for Seth
Shes goin away twenty mile aff
Hows she to get a likin for him Id like to know
No more nor the cake ull come wiout the leaven
Thy figurin books might ha tould thee better nor that I should think else thee mightst as well read the commin print as Seth allays does
Nay Mother said Adam laughing the figures tell us a fine deal and we couldnt go far without em but they dont tell us about folkss feelings
Its a nicer job to calculate THEM
But Seths as goodhearted a lad as ever handled a tool and plenty o sense and goodlooking too and hes got the same way o thinking as Dinah
He deserves to win her though theres no denying shes a rare bit o workmanship
You dont see such women turned off the wheel every day
Eh theet allays stick up for thy brother
Theest been just the same eer sin ye war little uns together
Thee wart allays for halving iverything wi him
But whats Seth got to do with marryin as is ony threeantwenty
Hed more need to learn an lay by sixpence
An as for his desarving hershes two ear older nor Seth shes pretty near as old as thee
But thats the way folks mun allays choose by contrairies as if they must be sorted like the porka bit o good meat wi a bit o offal
To the feminine mind in some of its moods all things that might be receive a temporary charm from comparison with what is and since Adam did not want to marry Dinah himself Lisbeth felt rather peevish on that scoreas peevish as she would have been if he HAD wanted to marry her and so shut himself out from Mary Burge and the partnership as effectually as by marrying Hetty
It was more than halfpast eight when Adam and his mother were talking in this way so that when about ten minutes later Hetty reached the turning of the lane that led to the farmyard gate she saw Dinah and Seth approaching it from the opposite direction and waited for them to come up to her
They too like Hetty had lingered a little in their walk for Dinah was trying to speak words of comfort and strength to Seth in these parting moments
But when they saw Hetty they paused and shook hands Seth turned homewards and Dinah came on alone
Seth Bede would have come and spoken to you my dear she said as she reached Hetty but hes very full of trouble tonight
Hetty answered with a dimpled smile as if she did not quite know what had been said and it made a strange contrast to see that sparkling selfengrossed loveliness looked at by Dinahs calm pitying face with its open glance which told that her heart lived in no cherished secrets of its own but in feelings which it longed to share with all the world
Hetty liked Dinah as well as she had ever liked any woman how was it possible to feel otherwise towards one who always put in a kind word for her when her aunt was finding fault and who was always ready to take Totty off her handslittle tiresome Totty that was made such a pet of by every one and that Hetty could see no interest in at all
Dinah had never said anything disapproving or reproachful to Hetty during her whole visit to the Hall Farm she had talked to her a great deal in a serious way but Hetty didnt mind that much for she never listened whatever Dinah might say she almost always stroked Hettys cheek after it and wanted to do some mending for her
Dinah was a riddle to her Hetty looked at her much in the same way as one might imagine a little perching bird that could only flutter from bough to bough to look at the swoop of the swallow or the mounting of the lark but she did not care to solve such riddles any more than she cared to know what was meant by the pictures in the Pilgrims Progress or in the old folio Bible that Marty and Tommy always plagued her about on a Sunday
Dinah took her hand now and drew it under her own arm
You look very happy tonight dear child she said
I shall think ot you often when Im at Snowfield and see your face before me as it is now
Its a strange thingsometimes when Im quite alone sitting in my room with my eyes closed or walking over the hills the people Ive seen and known if its only been for a few days are brought before me and I hear their voices and see them look and move almost plainer than I ever did when they were really with me so as I could touch them
And then my heart is drawn out towards them and I feel their lot as if it was my own and I take comfort in spreading it before the Lord and resting in His love on their behalf as well as my own
And so I feel sure you will come before me
She paused a moment but Hetty said nothing
It has been a very precious time to me Dinah went on last night and todayseeing two such good sons as Adam and Seth Bede
They are so tender and thoughtful for their aged mother
And she has been telling me what Adam has done for these many years to help his father and his brother its wonderful what a spirit of wisdom and knowledge he has and how hes ready to use it all in behalf of them that are feeble
And Im sure he has a loving spirit too
Ive noticed it often among my own people round Snowfield that the strong skilful men are often the gentlest to the women and children and its pretty to see em carrying the little babies as if they were no heavier than little birds
And the babies always seem to like the strong arm best
I feel sure it would be so with Adam Bede
Dont you think so Hetty
Yes said Hetty abstractedly for her mind had been all the while in the wood and she would have found it difficult to say what she was assenting to
Dinah saw she was not inclined to talk but there would not have been time to say much more for they were now at the yardgate
The still twilight with its dying western red and its few faint struggling stars rested on the farmyard where there was not a sound to be heard but the stamping of the carthorses in the stable
It was about twenty minutes after sunset
The fowls were all gone to roost and the bulldog lay stretched on the straw outside his kennel with the blackandtan terrier by his side when the fallingto of the gate disturbed them and set them barking like good officials before they had any distinct knowledge of the reason
The barking had its effect in the house for as Dinah and Hetty approached the doorway was filled by a portly figure with a ruddy blackeyed face which bore in it the possibility of looking extremely acute and occasionally contemptuous on marketdays but had now a predominant aftersupper expression of hearty good nature
It is well known that great scholars who have shown the most pitiless acerbity in their criticism of other mens scholarship have yet been of a relenting and indulgent temper in private life and I have heard of a learned man meekly rocking the twins in the cradle with his left hand while with his right he inflicted the most lacerating sarcasms on an opponent who had betrayed a brutal ignorance of Hebrew
Weaknesses and errors must be forgivenalas
they are not alien to usbut the man who takes the wrong side on the momentous subject of the Hebrew points must be treated as the enemy of his race
There was the same sort of antithetic mixture in Martin Poyser he was of so excellent a disposition that he had been kinder and more respectful than ever to his old father since he had made a deed of gift of all his property and no man judged his neighbours more charitably on all personal matters but for a farmer like Luke Britton for example whose fallows were not well cleaned who didnt know the rudiments of hedging and ditching and showed but a small share of judgment in the purchase of winter stock Martin Poyser was as hard and implacable as the northeast wind
Luke Britton could not make a remark even on the weather but Martin Poyser detected in it a taint of that unsoundness and general ignorance which was palpable in all his farming operations
He hated to see the fellow lift the pewter pint to his mouth in the bar of the Royal George on marketday and the mere sight of him on the other side of the road brought a severe and critical expression into his black eyes as different as possible from the fatherly glance he bent on his two nieces as they approached the door
Mr Poyser had smoked his evening pipe and now held his hands in his pockets as the only resource of a man who continues to sit up after the days business is done
Why lasses yere rather late tonight he said when they reached the little gate leading into the causeway
The mothers begun to fidget about you an shes got the little un ill An how did you leave the old woman Bede Dinah
Is she much down about the old man
Hed been but a poor bargain to her this five year
Shes been greatly distressed for the loss of him said Dinah but shes seemed more comforted today
Her son Adams been at home all day working at his fathers coffin and she loves to have him at home
Shes been talking about him to me almost all the day
She has a loving heart though shes sorely given to fret and be fearful
I wish she had a surer trust to comfort her in her old age
Adams sure enough said Mr Poyser misunderstanding Dinahs wish
Theres no fear but hell yield well i the threshing
Hes not one o them as is all straw and no grain
Ill be bond for him any day as hell be a good son to the last
Did he say hed be coming to see us soon
But come in come in he added making way for them I hadnt need keep y out any longer
The tall buildings round the yard shut out a good deal of the sky but the large window let in abundant light to show every corner of the houseplace
Mrs Poyser seated in the rockingchair which had been brought out of the righthand parlour was trying to soothe Totty to sleep
But Totty was not disposed to sleep and when her cousins entered she raised herself up and showed a pair of flushed cheeks which looked fatter than ever now they were defined by the edge of her linen nightcap
In the large wickerbottomed armchair in the lefthand chimney nook sat old Martin Poyser a hale but shrunken and bleached image of his portly blackhaired sonhis head hanging forward a little and his elbows pushed backwards so as to allow the whole of his forearm to rest on the arm of the chair
His blue handkerchief was spread over his knees as was usual indoors when it was not hanging over his head and he sat watching what went forward with the quiet OUTWARD glance of healthy old age which disengaged from any interest in an inward drama spies out pins upon the floor follows ones minutest motions with an unexpectant purposeless tenacity watches the flickering of the flame or the sungleams on the wall counts the quarries on the floor watches even the hand of the clock and pleases itself with detecting a rhythm in the tick
What a time o night this is to come home Hetty
said Mrs Poyser
Look at the clock do why its going on for halfpast nine and Ive sent the gells to bed this halfhour and late enough too when theyve got to get up at half after four and the mowers bottles to fill and the baking and heres this blessed child wi the fever for what I know and as wakeful as if it was dinnertime and nobody to help me to give her the physic but your uncle and fine work theres been and half of it spilt on her nightgownits well if shes swallowed more nor ull make her worse istead o better
But folks as have no mind to be o use have allays the luck to be out o the road when theres anything to be done
I did set out before eight aunt said Hetty in a pettish tone with a slight toss of her head
But this clocks so much before the clock at the Chase theres no telling what time itll be when I get here
What
Youd be wanting the clock set by gentlefolkss time would you
An sit up burnin candle an lie abed wi the sun abakin you like a cowcumber i the frame
The clock hasnt been put forrard for the first time today I reckon
The fact was Hetty had really forgotten the difference of the clocks when she told Captain Donnithorne that she set out at eight and this with her lingering pace had made her nearly half an hour later than usual
But here her aunts attention was diverted from this tender subject by Totty who perceiving at length that the arrival of her cousins was not likely to bring anything satisfactory to her in particular began to cry Munny munny in an explosive manner
Well then my pet Mothers got her Mother wont leave her Totty be a good dilling and go to sleep now said Mrs Poyser leaning back and rocking the chair while she tried to make Totty nestle against her
But Totty only cried louder and said Dont yock
So the mother with that wondrous patience which love gives to the quickest temperament sat up again and pressed her cheek against the linen nightcap and kissed it and forgot to scold Hetty any longer
Come Hetty said Martin Poyser in a conciliatory tone go and get your supper i the pantry as the things are all put away an then you can come and take the little un while your aunt undresses herself for she wont lie down in bed without her mother
An I reckon YOU could eat a bit Dinah for they dont keep much of a house down there
No thank you Uncle said Dinah I ate a good meal before I came away for Mrs Bede would make a kettlecake for me
I dont want any supper said Hetty taking off her hat
I can hold Totty now if Aunt wants me
Why what nonsense that is to talk
said Mrs Poyser
Do you think you can live wiout eatin an nourish your inside wi stickin red ribbons on your head
Go an get your supper this minute child theres a nice bit o cold pudding i the safe just what youre fond of
Hetty complied silently by going towards the pantry and Mrs Poyser went on speaking to Dinah
Sit down my dear an look as if you knowed what it was to make yourself a bit comfortable i the world
I warrant the old woman was glad to see you since you stayed so long
She seemed to like having me there at last but her sons say she doesnt like young women about her commonly and I thought just at first she was almost angry with me for going
Eh its a poor lookout when th ould folks doesna like the young uns said old Martin bending his head down lower and seeming to trace the pattern of the quarries with his eye
Aye its ill livin in a henroost for them as doesnt like fleas said Mrs Poyser
Weve all had our turn at bein young I reckon bet good luck or ill But she must learn to commodate herself to young women said Mr Poyser for it isnt to be counted on as Adam and Seth ull keep bachelors for the next ten year to please their mother
That ud be unreasonable
It isnt right for old nor young nayther to make a bargain all o their own side
Whats good for ones good all round i the long run
Im no friend to young fellows a marrying afore they know the difference atween a crab an a apple but they may wait oer long
To be sure said Mrs Poyser if you go past your dinnertime therell be little relish o your meat
You turn it oer an oer wi your fork an dont eat it after all
You find faut wi your meat an the fauts all i your own stomach
Hetty now came back from the pantry and said I can take Totty now Aunt if you like
Come Rachel said Mr Poyser as his wife seemed to hesitate seeing that Totty was at last nestling quietly theedst better let Hetty carry her upstairs while thee takst thy things off
Theet tired
Its time thee wast in bed
Theet bring on the pain in thy side again
Well she may hold her if the child ull go to her said Mrs Poyser
Hetty went close to the rockingchair and stood without her usual smile and without any attempt to entice Totty simply waiting for her aunt to give the child into her hands
Wilt go to Cousin Hetty my dilling while mother gets ready to go to bed
Then Totty shall go into Mothers bed and sleep there all night
Before her mother had done speaking Totty had given her answer in an unmistakable manner by knitting her brow setting her tiny teeth against her underlip and leaning forward to slap Hetty on the arm with her utmost force
Then without speaking she nestled to her mother again
Hey hey said Mr Poyser while Hetty stood without moving not go to Cousin Hetty
Thats like a babby
Tottys a little woman an not a babby
Its no use trying to persuade her said Mrs Poyser
She allays takes against Hetty when she isnt well
Happen shell go to Dinah
Dinah having taken off her bonnet and shawl had hitherto kept quietly seated in the background not liking to thrust herself between Hetty and what was considered Hettys proper work
But now she came forward and putting out her arms said Come Totty come and let Dinah carry her upstairs along with Mother poor poor Mother
shes so tiredshe wants to go to bed
Totty turned her face towards Dinah and looked at her an instant then lifted herself up put out her little arms and let Dinah lift her from her mothers lap
Hetty turned away without any sign of ill humour and taking her hat from the table stood waiting with an air of indifference to see if she should be told to do anything else
You may make the door fast now Poyser Alicks been come in this long while said Mrs Poyser rising with an appearance of relief from her low chair
Get me the matches down Hetty for I must have the rushlight burning i my room
Come Father
The heavy wooden bolts began to roll in the house doors and old Martin prepared to move by gathering up his blue handkerchief and reaching his bright knobbed walnuttree stick from the corner
Mrs Poyser then led the way out of the kitchen followed by the gandfather and Dinah with Totty in her armsall going to bed by twilight like the birds
Mrs Poyser on her way peeped into the room where her two boys lay just to see their ruddy round cheeks on the pillow and to hear for a moment their light regular breathing
Come Hetty get to bed said Mr Poyser in a soothing tone as he himself turned to go upstairs
You didna mean to be late Ill be bound but your aunts been worrited today
Goodnight my wench goodnight
Chapter XV The Two BedChambers HETTY and Dinah both slept in the second story in rooms adjoining each other meagrely furnished rooms with no blinds to shut out the light which was now beginning to gather new strength from the rising of the moonmore than enough strength to enable Hetty to move about and undress with perfect comfort
She could see quite well the pegs in the old painted linenpress on which she hung her hat and gown she could see the head of every pin on her red cloth pincushion she could see a reflection of herself in the old fashioned lookingglass quite as distinct as was needful considering that she had only to brush her hair and put on her nightcap
A queer old lookingglass
Hetty got into an ill temper with it almost every time she dressed
It had been considered a handsome glass in its day and had probably been bought into the Poyser family a quarter of a century before at a sale of genteel household furniture
Even now an auctioneer could say something for it it had a great deal of tarnished gilding about it it had a firm mahogany base well supplied with drawers which opened with a decided jerk and sent the contents leaping out from the farthest corners without giving you the trouble of reaching them above all it had a brass candlesocket on each side which would give it an aristocratic air to the very last
But Hetty objected to it because it had numerous dim blotches sprinkled over the mirror which no rubbing would remove and because instead of swinging backwards and forwards it was fixed in an upright position so that she could only get one good view of her head and neck and that was to be had only by sitting down on a low chair before her dressingtable
And the dressingtable was no dressingtable at all but a small old chest of drawers the most awkward thing in the world to sit down before for the big brass handles quite hurt her knees and she couldnt get near the glass at all comfortably
But devout worshippers never allow inconveniences to prevent them from performing their religious rites and Hetty this evening was more bent on her peculiar form of worship than usual
Having taken off her gown and white kerchief she drew a key from the large pocket that hung outside her petticoat and unlocking one of the lower drawers in the chest reached from it two short bits of wax candlesecretly bought at Treddlestonand stuck them in the two brass sockets
Then she drew forth a bundle of matches and lighted the candles and last of all a small redframed shilling lookingglass without blotches
It was into this small glass that she chose to look first after seating herself
She looked into it smiling and turning her head on one side for a minute then laid it down and took out her brush and comb from an upper drawer
She was going to let down her hair and make herself look like that picture of a lady in Miss Lydia Donnithornes dressingroom
It was soon done and the dark hyacinthine curves fell on her neck
It was not heavy massive merely rippling hair but soft and silken running at every opportunity into delicate rings
But she pushed it all backward to look like the picture and form a dark curtain throwing into relief her round white neck
Then she put down her brush and comb and looked at herself folding her arms before her still like the picture
Even the old mottled glass couldnt help sending back a lovely image none the less lovely because Hettys stays were not of white satinsuch as I feel sure heroines must generally wear but of a dark greenish cotton texture
Oh yes
She was very pretty
Captain Donnithorne thought so
Prettier than anybody about Hayslopeprettier than any of the ladies she had ever seen visiting at the Chaseindeed it seemed fine ladies were rather old and uglyand prettier than Miss Bacon the millers daughter who was called the beauty of Treddleston
And Hetty looked at herself tonight with quite a different sensation from what she had ever felt before there was an invisible spectator whose eye rested on her like morning on the flowers
His soft voice was saying over and over again those pretty things she had heard in the wood his arm was round her and the delicate rosescent of his hair was with her still
The vainest woman is never thoroughly conscious of her own beauty till she is loved by the man who sets her own passion vibrating in return
But Hetty seemed to have made up her mind that something was wanting for she got up and reached an old black lace scarf out of the linenpress and a pair of large earrings out of the sacred drawer from which she had taken her candles
It was an old old scarf full of rents but it would make a becoming border round her shoulders and set off the whiteness of her upper arm
And she would take out the little earrings she had in her earsoh how her aunt had scolded her for having her ears boredand put in those large ones
They were but coloured glass and gilding but if you didnt know what they were made of they looked just as well as what the ladies wore
And so she sat down again with the large earrings in her ears and the black lace scarf adjusted round her shoulders
She looked down at her arms no arms could be prettier down to a little way below the elbowthey were white and plump and dimpled to match her cheeks but towards the wrist she thought with vexation that they were coarsened by butter making and other work that ladies never did
Captain Donnithorne couldnt like her to go on doing work he would like to see her in nice clothes and thin shoes and white stockings perhaps with silk clocks to them for he must love her very muchno one else had ever put his arm round her and kissed her in that way
He would want to marry her and make a lady of her she could hardly dare to shape the thoughtyet how else could it be
Marry her quite secretly as Mr James the doctors assistant married the doctors niece and nobody ever found it out for a long while after and then it was of no use to be angry
The doctor had told her aunt all about it in Hettys hearing
She didnt know how it would be but it was quite plain the old Squire could never be told anything about it for Hetty was ready to faint with awe and fright if she came across him at the Chase
He might have been earthborn for what she knew
It had never entered her mind that he had been young like other men he had always been the old Squire at whom everybody was frightened
Oh it was impossible to think how it would be
But Captain Donnithorne would know he was a great gentleman and could have his way in everything and could buy everything he liked
And nothing could be as it had been again perhaps some day she should be a grand lady and ride in her coach and dress for dinner in a brocaded silk with feathers in her hair and her dress sweeping the ground like Miss Lydia and Lady Dacey when she saw them going into the diningroom one evening as she peeped through the little round window in the lobby only she should not be old and ugly like Miss Lydia or all the same thickness like Lady Dacey but very pretty with her hair done in a great many different ways and sometimes in a pink dress and sometimes in a white one she didnt know which she liked best and Mary Burge and everybody would perhaps see her going out in her carriageor rather they would HEAR of it it was impossible to imagine these things happening at Hayslope in sight of her aunt
At the thought of all this splendour Hetty got up from her chair and in doing so caught the little redframed glass with the edge of her scarf so that it fell with a bang on the floor but she was too eagerly occupied with her vision to care about picking it up and after a momentary start began to pace with a pigeonlike stateliness backwards and forwards along her room in her coloured stays and coloured skirt and the old black lace scarf round her shoulders and the great glass earrings in her ears
How pretty the little puss looks in that odd dress
It would be the easiest folly in the world to fall in love with her there is such a sweet babylike roundness about her face and figure the delicate dark rings of hair lie so charmingly about her ears and neck her great dark eyes with their long eyelashes touch one so strangely as if an imprisoned frisky sprite looked out of them
Ah what a prize the man gets who wins a sweet bride like Hetty
How the men envy him who come to the wedding breakfast and see her hanging on his arm in her white lace and orange blossoms
The dear young round soft flexible thing
Her heart must be just as soft her temper just as free from angles her character just as pliant
If anything ever goes wrong it must be the husbands fault there he can make her what he likesthat is plain
And the lover himself thinks so too the little darling is so fond of him her little vanities are so bewitching he wouldnt consent to her being a bit wiser those kittenlike glances and movements are just what one wants to make ones hearth a paradise
Every man under such circumstances is conscious of being a great physiognomist
Nature he knows has a language of her own which she uses with strict veracity and he considers himself an adept in the language
Nature has written out his brides character for him in those exquisite lines of cheek and lip and chin in those eyelids delicate as petals in those long lashes curled like the stamen of a flower in the dark liquid depths of those wonderful eyes
How she will dote on her children
She is almost a child herself and the little pink round things will hang about her like florets round the central flower and the husband will look on smiling benignly able whenever he chooses to withdraw into the sanctuary of his wisdom towards which his sweet wife will look reverently and never lift the curtain
It is a marriage such as they made in the golden age when the men were all wise and majestic and the women all lovely and loving
It was very much in this way that our friend Adam Bede thought about Hetty only he put his thoughts into different words
If ever she behaved with cold vanity towards him he said to himself it is only because she doesnt love me well enough and he was sure that her love whenever she gave it would be the most precious thing a man could possess on earth
Before you despise Adam as deficient in penetration pray ask yourself if you were ever predisposed to believe evil of any pretty womanif you ever COULD without hard headbreaking demonstration believe evil of the ONE supremely pretty woman who has bewitched you
No people who love downy peaches are apt not to think of the stone and sometimes jar their teeth terribly against it
Arthur Donnithorne too had the same sort of notion about Hetty so far as he had thought of her nature of all
He felt sure she was a dear affectionate good little thing
The man who awakes the wondering tremulous passion of a young girl always thinks her affectionate and if he chances to look forward to future years probably imagines himself being virtuously tender to her because the poor thing is so clingingly fond of him
God made these dear women soand it is a convenient arrangement in case of sickness
After all I believe the wisest of us must be beguiled in this way sometimes and must think both better and worse of people than they deserve
Nature has her language and she is not unveracious but we dont know all the intricacies of her syntax just yet and in a hasty reading we may happen to extract the very opposite of her real meaning
Long dark eyelashes nowwhat can be more exquisite
I find it impossible not to expect some depth of soul behind a deep grey eye with a long dark eyelash in spite of an experience which has shown me that they may go along with deceit peculation and stupidity
But if in the reaction of disgust I have betaken myself to a fishy eye there has been a surprising similarity of result
One begins to suspect at length that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals or else that the eyelashes express the disposition of the fair ones grandmother which is on the whole less important to us
No eyelashes could be more beautiful than Hettys and now while she walks with her pigeonlike stateliness along the room and looks down on her shoulders bordered by the old black lace the dark fringe shows to perfection on her pink cheek
They are but dim illdefined pictures that her narrow bit of an imagination can make of the future but of every picture she is the central figure in fine clothes Captain Donnithorne is very close to her putting his arm round her perhaps kissing her and everybody else is admiring and envying herespecially Mary Burge whose new print dress looks very contemptible by the side of Hettys resplendent toilette
Does any sweet or sad memory mingle with this dream of the futureany loving thought of her second parentsof the children she had helped to tendof any youthful companion any pet animal any relic of her own childhood even
Not one
There are some plants that have hardly any roots you may tear them from their native nook of rock or wall and just lay them over your ornamental flowerpot and they blossom none the worse
Hetty could have cast all her past life behind her and never cared to be reminded of it again
I think she had no feeling at all towards the old house and did not like the Jacobs Ladder and the long row of hollyhocks in the garden better than other flowersperhaps not so well
It was wonderful how little she seemed to care about waiting on her uncle who had been a good father to hershe hardly ever remembered to reach him his pipe at the right time without being told unless a visitor happened to be there who would have a better opportunity of seeing her as she walked across the hearth
Hetty did not understand how anybody could be very fond of middleaged people
And as for those tiresome children Marty and Tommy and Totty they had been the very nuisance of her lifeas bad as buzzing insects that will come teasing you on a hot day when you want to be quiet
Marty the eldest was a baby when she first came to the farm for the children born before him had died and so Hetty had had them all three one after the other toddling by her side in the meadow or playing about her on wet days in the halfempty rooms of the large old house
The boys were out of hand now but Totty was still a daylong plague worse than either of the others had been because there was more fuss made about her
And there was no end to the making and mending of clothes
Hetty would have been glad to hear that she should never see a child again they were worse than the nasty little lambs that the shepherd was always bringing in to be taken special care of in lambing time for the lambs WERE got rid of sooner or later
As for the young chickens and turkeys Hetty would have hated the very word hatching if her aunt had not bribed her to attend to the young poultry by promising her the proceeds of one out of every brood
The round downy chicks peeping out from under their mothers wing never touched Hetty with any pleasure that was not the sort of prettiness she cared about but she did care about the prettiness of the new things she would buy for herself at Treddleston Fair with the money they fetched
And yet she looked so dimpled so charming as she stooped down to put the soaked bread under the hencoop that you must have been a very acute personage indeed to suspect her of that hardness
Molly the housemaid with a turnup nose and a protuberant jaw was really a tenderhearted girl and as Mrs Poyser said a jewel to look after the poultry but her stolid face showed nothing of this maternal delight any more than a brown earthenware pitcher will show the light of the lamp within it
It is generally a feminine eye that first detects the moral deficiencies hidden under the dear deceit of beauty so it is not surprising that Mrs Poyser with her keenness and abundant opportunity for observation should have formed a tolerably fair estimate of what might be expected from Hetty in the way of feeling and in moments of indignation she had sometimes spoken with great openness on the subject to her husband
Shes no better than a peacock as ud strut about on the wall and spread its tail when the sun shone if all the folks i the parish was dying theres nothing seems to give her a turn i th inside not even when we thought Totty had tumbled into the pit
To think o that dear cherub
And we found her wi her little shoes stuck i the mud an crying fit to break her heart by the far horsepit
But Hetty never minded it I could see though shes been at the nussin o the child ever since it was a babby
Its my belief her hearts as hard as a pebble
Nay nay said Mr Poyser thee mustnt judge Hetty too hard
Them young gells are like the unripe grain theyll make good meal by and by but theyre squashy as yet
Theet see Hetty ll be all right when shes got a good husband and children of her own
I dont want to be hard upo the gell
Shes got cliver fingers of her own and can be useful enough when she likes and I should miss her wi the butter for shes got a cool hand
An let be what may Id strive to do my part by a niece o yoursan THAT Ive done for Ive taught her everything as belongs to a house an Ive told her her duty often enough though God knows Ive no breath to spare an that catchin pain comes on dreadful by times
Wi them three gells in the house Id need have twice the strength to keep em up to their work
Its like having roast meat at three fires as soon as youve basted one anothers burnin
Hetty stood sufficiently in awe of her aunt to be anxious to conceal from her so much of her vanity as could be hidden without too great a sacrifice
She could not resist spending her money in bits of finery which Mrs Poyser disapproved but she would have been ready to die with shame vexation and fright if her aunt had this moment opened the door and seen her with her bits of candle lighted and strutting about decked in her scarf and earrings
To prevent such a surprise she always bolted her door and she had not forgotten to do so tonight
It was well for there now came a light tap and Hetty with a leaping heart rushed to blow out the candles and throw them into the drawer
She dared not stay to take out her earrings but she threw off her scarf and let it fall on the floor before the light tap came again
We shall know how it was that the light tap came if we leave Hetty for a short time and return to Dinah at the moment when she had delivered Totty to her mothers arms and was come upstairs to her bedroom adjoining Hettys
Dinah delighted in her bedroom window
Being on the second story of that tall house it gave her a wide view over the fields
The thickness of the wall formed a broad step about a yard below the window where she could place her chair
And now the first thing she did on entering her room was to seat herself in this chair and look out on the peaceful fields beyond which the large moon was rising just above the hedgerow elms
She liked the pasture best where the milch cows were lying and next to that the meadow where the grass was halfmown and lay in silvered sweeping lines
Her heart was very full for there was to be only one more night on which she would look out on those fields for a long time to come but she thought little of leaving the mere scene for to her bleak Snowfield had just as many charms
She thought of all the dear people whom she had learned to care for among these peaceful fields and who would now have a place in her loving remembrance for ever
She thought of the struggles and the weariness that might lie before them in the rest of their lifes journey when she would be away from them and know nothing of what was befalling them and the pressure of this thought soon became too strong for her to enjoy the unresponding stillness of the moonlit fields
She closed her eyes that she might feel more intensely the presence of a Love and Sympathy deeper and more tender than was breathed from the earth and sky
That was often Dinahs mode of praying in solitude
Simply to close her eyes and to feel herself enclosed by the Divine Presence then gradually her fears her yearning anxieties for others melted away like icecrystals in a warm ocean
She had sat in this way perfectly still with her hands crossed on her lap and the pale light resting on her calm face for at least ten minutes when she was startled by a loud sound apparently of something falling in Hettys room
But like all sounds that fall on our ears in a state of abstraction it had no distinct character but was simply loud and startling so that she felt uncertain whether she had interpreted it rightly
She rose and listened but all was quiet afterwards and she reflected that Hetty might merely have knocked something down in getting into bed
She began slowly to undress but now owing to the suggestions of this sound her thoughts became concentrated on Hettythat sweet young thing with life and all its trials before herthe solemn daily duties of the wife and motherand her mind so unprepared for them all bent merely on little foolish selfish pleasures like a child hugging its toys in the beginning of a long toilsome journey in which it will have to bear hunger and cold and unsheltered darkness
Dinah felt a double care for Hetty because she shared Seths anxious interest in his brothers lot and she had not come to the conclusion that Hetty did not love Adam well enough to marry him
She saw too clearly the absence of any warm selfdevoting love in Hettys nature to regard the coldness of her behaviour towards Adam as any indication that he was not the man she would like to have for a husband
And this blank in Hettys nature instead of exciting Dinahs dislike only touched her with a deeper pity the lovely face and form affected her as beauty always affects a pure and tender mind free from selfish jealousies
It was an excellent divine gift that gave a deeper pathos to the need the sin the sorrow with which it was mingled as the canker in a lilywhite bud is more grievous to behold than in a common potherb
By the time Dinah had undressed and put on her nightgown this feeling about Hetty had gathered a painful intensity her imagination had created a thorny thicket of sin and sorrow in which she saw the poor thing struggling torn and bleeding looking with tears for rescue and finding none
It was in this way that Dinahs imagination and sympathy acted and reacted habitually each heightening the other
She felt a deep longing to go now and pour into Hettys ear all the words of tender warning and appeal that rushed into her mind
But perhaps Hetty was already asleep
Dinah put her ear to the partition and heard still some slight noises which convinced her that Hetty was not yet in bed
Still she hesitated she was not quite certain of a divine direction the voice that told her to go to Hetty seemed no stronger that the other voice which said that Hetty was weary and that going to her now in an unseasonable moment would only tend to close her heart more obstinately
Dinah was not satisfied without a more unmistakable guidance than those inward voices
There was light enough for her if she opened her Bible to discern the text sufficiently to know what it would say to her
She knew the physiognomy of every page and could tell on what book she opened sometimes on what chapter without seeing title or number
It was a small thick Bible worn quite round at the edges
Dinah laid it sideways on the window ledge where the light was strongest and then opened it with her forefinger
The first words she looked at were those at the top of the lefthand page And they all wept sore and fell on Pauls neck and kissed him
That was enough for Dinah she had opened on that memorable parting at Ephesus when Paul had felt bound to open his heart in a last exhortation and warning
She hesitated no longer but opening her own door gently went and tapped on Hettys
We know she had to tap twice because Hetty had to put out her candles and throw off her black lace scarf but after the second tap the door was opened immediately
Dinah said Will you let me come in Hetty
and Hetty without speaking for she was confused and vexed opened the door wider and let her in
What a strange contrast the two figures made visible enough in that mingled twilight and moonlight
Hetty her cheeks flushed and her eyes glistening from her imaginary drama her beautiful neck and arms bare her hair hanging in a curly tangle down her back and the baubles in her ears
Dinah covered with her long white dress her pale face full of subdued emotion almost like a lovely corpse into which the soul has returned charged with sublimer secrets and a sublimer love
They were nearly of the same height Dinah evidently a little the taller as she put her arm round Hettys waist and kissed her forehead
I knew you were not in bed my dear she said in her sweet clear voice which was irritating to Hetty mingling with her own peevish vexation like music with jangling chains for I heard you moving and I longed to speak to you again tonight for it is the last but one that I shall be here and we dont know what may happen tomorrow to keep us apart
Shall I sit down with you while you do up your hair
Oh yes said Hetty hastily turning round and reaching the second chair in the room glad that Dinah looked as if she did not notice her earrings
Dinah sat down and Hetty began to brush together her hair before twisting it up doing it with that air of excessive indifference which belongs to confused selfconsciousness
But the expression of Dinahs eyes gradually relieved her they seemed unobservant of all details
Dear Hetty she said It has been borne in upon my mind to night that you may some day be in troubletrouble is appointed for us all here below and there comes a time when we need more comfort and help than the things of this life can give
I want to tell you that if ever you are in trouble and need a friend that will always feel for you and love you you have got that friend in Dinah Morris at Snowfield and if you come to her or send for her shell never forget this night and the words she is speaking to you now
Will you remember it Hetty
Yes said Hetty rather frightened
But why should you think I shall be in trouble
Do you know of anything
Hetty had seated herself as she tied on her cap and now Dinah leaned forwards and took her hands as she answered Because dear trouble comes to us all in this life we set our hearts on things which it isnt Gods will for us to have and then we go sorrowing the people we love are taken from us and we can joy in nothing because they are not with us sickness comes and we faint under the burden of our feeble bodies we go astray and do wrong and bring ourselves into trouble with our fellowmen
There is no man or woman born into this world to whom some of these trials do not fall and so I feel that some of them must happen to you and I desire for you that while you are young you should seek for strength from your Heavenly Father that you may have a support which will not fail you in the evil day
Dinah paused and released Hettys hands that she might not hinder her
Hetty sat quite still she felt no response within herself to Dinahs anxious affection but Dinahs words uttered with solemn pathetic distinctness affected her with a chill fear
Her flush had died away almost to paleness she had the timidity of a luxurious pleasureseeking nature which shrinks from the hint of pain
Dinah saw the effect and her tender anxious pleading became the more earnest till Hetty full of a vague fear that something evil was some time to befall her began to cry
It is our habit to say that while the lower nature can never understand the higher the higher nature commands a complete view of the lower
But I think the higher nature has to learn this comprehension as we learn the art of vision by a good deal of hard experience often with bruises and gashes incurred in taking things up by the wrong end and fancying our space wider than it is
Dinah had never seen Hetty affected in this way before and with her usual benignant hopefulness she trusted it was the stirring of a divine impulse
She kissed the sobbing thing and began to cry with her for grateful joy
But Hetty was simply in that excitable state of mind in which there is no calculating what turn the feelings may take from one moment to another and for the first time she became irritated under Dinahs caress
She pushed her away impatiently and said with a childish sobbing voice Dont talk to me so Dinah
Why do you come to frighten me
Ive never done anything to you
Why cant you let me be
Poor Dinah felt a pang
She was too wise to persist and only said mildly Yes my dear youre tired I wont hinder you any longer
Make haste and get into bed
Goodnight
She went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she had been a ghost but once by the side of her own bed she threw herself on her knees and poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that filled her heart
As for Hetty she was soon in the wood againher waking dreams being merged in a sleeping life scarcely more fragmentary and confused
Chapter XVI Links ARTHUR DONNITHORNE you remember is under an engagement with himself to go and see Mr Irwine this Friday morning and he is awake and dressing so early that he determines to go before breakfast instead of after
The rector he knows breakfasts alone at halfpast nine the ladies of the family having a different breakfasthour Arthur will have an early ride over the hill and breakfast with him
One can say everything best over a meal
The progress of civilization has made a breakfast or a dinner an easy and cheerful substitute for more troublesome and disagreeable ceremonies
We take a less gloomy view of our errors now our father confessor listens to us over his egg and coffee
We are more distinctly conscious that rude penances are out of the question for gentlemen in an enlightened age and that mortal sin is not incompatible with an appetite for muffins
An assault on our pockets which in more barbarous times would have been made in the brusque form of a pistolshot is quite a wellbred and smiling procedure now it has become a request for a loan thrown in as an easy parenthesis between the second and third glasses of claret
Still there was this advantage in the old rigid forms that they committed you to the fulfilment of a resolution by some outward deed when you have put your mouth to one end of a hole in a stone wall and are aware that there is an expectant ear at the other end you are more likely to say what you came out with the intention of saying than if you were seated with your legs in an easy attitude under the mahogany with a companion who will have no reason to be surprised if you have nothing particular to say
However Arthur Donnithorne as he winds among the pleasant lanes on horseback in the morning sunshine has a sincere determination to open his heart to the rector and the swirling sound of the scythe as he passes by the meadow is all the pleasanter to him because of this honest purpose
He is glad to see the promise of settled weather now for getting in the hay about which the farmers have been fearful and there is something so healthful in the sharing of a joy that is general and not merely personal that this thought about the hayharvest reacts on his state of mind and makes his resolution seem an easier matter
A man about town might perhaps consider that these influences were not to be felt out of a childs storybook but when you are among the fields and hedgerows it is impossible to maintain a consistent superiority to simple natural pleasures
Arthur had passed the village of Hayslope and was approaching the Broxton side of the hill when at a turning in the road he saw a figure about a hundred yards before him which it was impossible to mistake for any one else than Adam Bede even if there had been no grey tailless shepherddog at his heels
He was striding along at his usual rapid pace and Arthur pushed on his horse to overtake him for he retained too much of his boyish feeling for Adam to miss an opportunity of chatting with him
I will not say that his love for that good fellow did not owe some of its force to the love of patronage our friend Arthur liked to do everything that was handsome and to have his handsome deeds recognized
Adam looked round as he heard the quickening clatter of the horses heels and waited for the horseman lifting his paper cap from his head with a bright smile of recognition
Next to his own brother Seth Adam would have done more for Arthur Donnithorne than for any other young man in the world
There was hardly anything he would not rather have lost than the twofeet ruler which he always carried in his pocket it was Arthurs present bought with his pocketmoney when he was a fairhaired lad of eleven and when he had profited so well by Adams lessons in carpentering and turning as to embarrass every female in the house with gifts of superfluous threadreels and round boxes
Adam had quite a pride in the little squire in those early days and the feeling had only become slightly modified as the fairhaired lad had grown into the whiskered young man
Adam I confess was very susceptible to the influence of rank and quite ready to give an extra amount of respect to every one who had more advantages than himself not being a philosopher or a proletaire with democratic ideas but simply a stoutlimbed clever carpenter wlth a large fund of reverence in his nature which inclined him to admit all established claims unless he saw very clear grounds for questioning them
He had no theories about setting the world to rights but he saw there was a great deal of damage done by building with illseasoned timberby ignorant men in fine clothes making plans for outhouses and workshops and the like without knowing the bearings of thingsby slovenly joiners work and by hasty contracts that could never be fulfilled without ruining somebody and he resolved for his part to set his face against such doings
On these points he would have maintained his opinion against the largest landed proprietor in Loamshire or Stonyshire either but he felt that beyond these it would be better for him to defer to people who were more knowing than himself
He saw as plainly as possible how ill the woods on the estate were managed and the shameful state of the farmbuildings and if old Squire Donnithorne had asked him the effect of this mismanagement he would have spoken his opinion without flinching but the impulse to a respectful demeanour towards a gentleman would have been strong within him all the while
The word gentleman had a spell for Adam and as he often said he couldnt abide a fellow who thought he made himself fine by being coxy tos betters
I must remind you again that Adam had the blood of the peasant in his veins and that since he was in his prime half a century ago you must expect some of his characteristics to be obsolete
Towards the young squire this instinctive reverence of Adams was assisted by boyish memories and personal regard so you may imagine that he thought far more of Arthurs good qualities and attached far more value to very slight actions of his than if they had been the qualities and actions of a common workman like himself
He felt sure it would be a fine day for everybody about Hayslope when the young squire came into the estatesuch a generous open hearted disposition as he had and an uncommon notion about improvements and repairs considering he was only just coming of age
Thus there was both respect and affection in the smile with which he raised his paper cap as Arthur Donnithorne rode up
Well Adam how are you
said Arthur holding out his hand
He never shook hands with any of the farmers and Adam felt the honour keenly
I could swear to your back a long way off
Its just the same back only broader as when you used to carry me on it
Do you remember
Aye sir I remember
It ud be a poor lookout if folks didnt remember what they did and said when they were lads
We should think no more about old friends than we do about new uns then
Youre going to Broxton I suppose
said Arthur putting his horse on at a slow pace while Adam walked by his side
Are you going to the rectory
No sir Im going to see about Bradwells barn
Theyre afraid of the roof pushing the walls out and Im going to see what can be done with it before we send the stuff and the workmen
Why Burge trusts almost everything to you now Adam doesnt he
I should think he will make you his partner soon
He will if hes wise
Nay sir I dont see as hed be much the better off for that
A foreman if hes got a conscience and delights in his work will do his business as well as if he was a partner
I wouldnt give a penny for a man as ud drive a nail in slack because he didnt get extra pay for it
I know that Adam I know you work for him as well as if you were working for yourself
But you would have more power than you have now and could turn the business to better account perhaps
The old man must give up his business sometime and he has no son I suppose hell want a soninlaw who can take to it
But he has rather grasping fingers of his own I fancy
I daresay he wants a man who can put some money into the business
If I were not as poor as a rat I would gladly invest some money in that way for the sake of having you settled on the estate
Im sure I should profit by it in the end
And perhaps I shall be better off in a year or two
I shall have a larger allowance now Im of age and when Ive paid off a debt or two I shall be able to look about me
Youre very good to say so sir and Im not unthankful
But Adam continued in a decided toneI shouldnt like to make any offers to Mr Burge or t have any made for me
I see no clear road to a partnership
If he should ever want to dispose of the business that ud be a different matter
I should be glad of some money at a fair interest then for I feel sure I could pay it off in time
Very well Adam said Arthur remembering what Mr Irwine had said about a probable hitch in the lovemaking between Adam and Mary Burge well say no more about it at present
When is your father to be buried
On Sunday sir Mr Irwines coming earlier on purpose
I shall be glad when its over for I think my mother ull perhaps get easier then
It cuts one sadly to see the grief of old people theyve no way o working it off and the new spring brings no new shoots out on the withered tree
Ah youve had a good deal of trouble and vexation in your life Adam
I dont think youve ever been harebrained and light hearted like other youngsters
Youve always had some care on your mind
Why yes sir but thats nothing to make a fuss about
If were men and have mens feelings I reckon we must have mens troubles
We cant be like the birds as fly from their nest as soon as theyve got their wings and never know their kin when they see em and get a fresh lot every year
Ive had enough to be thankful for Ive allays had health and strength and brains to give me a delight in my work and I count it a great thing as Ive had Bartle Masseys nightschool to go to
Hes helped me to knowledge I could never ha got by myself
What a rare fellow you are Adam
said Arthur after a pause in which he had looked musingly at the big fellow walking by his side
I could hit out better than most men at Oxford and yet I believe you would knock me into next week if I were to have a baltle with you
God forbid I should ever do that sir said Adam looking round at Arthur and smiling
I used to fight for fun but Ive never done that since I was the cause o poor Gil Tranter being laid up for a fortnight
Ill never fight any man again only when he behaves like a scoundrel
If you get hold of a chap thats got no shame nor conscience to stop him you must try what you can do by bunging his eyes up
Arthur did not laugh for he was preoccupied with some thought that made him say presently I should think now Adam you never have any struggles within yourself
I fancy you would master a wish that you had made up your mind it was not quite right to indulge as easily as you would knock down a drunken fellow who was quarrelsome with you
I mean you are never shillyshally first making up your mind that you wont do a thing and then doing it after all
Well said Adam slowly after a moments hesitation no
I dont remember ever being seesaw in that way when Id made my mind up as you say that a thing was wrong
It takes the taste out o my mouth for things when I know I should have a heavy conscience after em
Ive seen pretty clear ever since I could cast up a sum as you can never do whats wrong without breeding sin and trouble more than you can ever see
Its like a bit o bad workmanshipyou never see th end o the mischief itll do
And its a poor lookout to come into the world to make your fellowcreatures worse off instead o better
But theres a difference between the things folks call wrong
Im not for making a sin of every little fools trick or bit o nonsense anybody may be let into like some o them dissenters
And a man may have two minds whether it isnt worthwhile to get a bruise or two for the sake of a bit o fun
But it isnt my way to be see saw about anything I think my fault lies th other way
When Ive said a thing if its only to myself its hard for me to go back
Yes thats just what I expected of you said Arthur
Youve got an iron will as well as an iron arm
But however strong a mans resolution may be it costs him something to carry it out now and then
We may determine not to gather any cherries and keep our hands sturdily in our pockets but we cant prevent our mouths from watering
Thats true sir but theres nothing like settling with ourselves as theres a deal we must do without i this life
Its no use looking on life as if it was Treddleson Fair where folks only go to see shows and get fairings
If we do we shall find it different
But wheres the use o me talking to you sir
You know better than I do
Im not so sure of that Adam
Youve had four or five years of experience more than Ive had and I think your life has been a better school to you than college has been to me
Why sir you seem to think o college something like what Bartle Massey does
He says college mostly makes people like bladders just good for nothing but t hold the stuff as is poured into em
But hes got a tongue like a sharp blade Bartle hasit never touches anything but it cuts
Heres the turning sir
I must bid you goodmorning as youre going to the rectory
Goodbye Adam goodbye
Arthur gave his horse to the groom at the rectory gate and walked along the gravel towards the door which opened on the garden
He knew that the rector always breakfasted in his study and the study lay on the left hand of this door opposite the diningroom
It was a small low room belonging to the old part of the house dark with the sombre covers of the books that lined the walls yet it looked very cheery this morning as Arthur reached the open window
For the morning sun fell aslant on the great glass globe with gold fish in it which stood on a scagliola pillar in front of the readyspread bachelor breakfasttable and by the side of this breakfasttable was a group which would have made any room enticing
In the crimson damask easychair sat Mr Irwine with that radiant freshness which he always had when he came from his morning toilet his finely formed plump white hand was playing along Junos brown curly back and close to Junos tail which was wagging with calm matronly pleasure the two brown pups were rolling over each other in an ecstatic duet of worrying noises
On a cushion a little removed sat Pug with the air of a maiden lady who looked on these familiarities as animal weaknesses which she made as little show as possible of observing
On the table at Mr Irwines elbow lay the first volume of the Foulis AEschylus which Arthur knew well by sight and the silver coffee pot which Carroll was bringing in sent forth a fragrant steam which completed the delights of a bachelor breakfast
Hallo Arthur thats a good fellow
Youre just in time said Mr Irwine as Arthur paused and stepped in over the low window sill
Carroll we shall want more coffee and eggs and havent you got some cold fowl for us to eat with that ham
Why this is like old days Arthur you havent been to breakfast with me these five years
It was a tempting morning for a ride before breakfast said Arthur and I used to like breakfasting with you so when I was reading with you
My grandfather is always a few degrees colder at breakfast than at any other hour in the day
I think his morning bath doesnt agree with him
Arthur was anxious not to imply that he came with any special purpose
He had no sooner found himself in Mr Irwines presence than the confidence which he had thought quite easy before suddenly appeared the most difficult thing in the world to him and at the very moment of shaking hands he saw his purpose in quite a new light
How could he make Irwine understand his position unless he told him those little scenes in the wood and how could he tell them without looking like a fool
And then his weakness in coming back from Gawaines and doing the very opposite of what he intended
Irwine would think him a shilly shally fellow ever after
However it must come out in an unpremeditated way the conversation might lead up to it
I like breakfasttime better than any other moment in the day said Mr Irwine
No dust has settled on ones mind then and it presents a clear mirror to the rays of things
I always have a favourite book by me at breakfast and I enjoy the bits I pick up then so much that regularly every morning it seems to me as if I should certainly become studious again
But presently Dent brings up a poor fellow who has killed a hare and when Ive got through my justicing as Carroll calls it Im inclined for a ride round the glebe and on my way back I meet with the master of the workhouse who has got a long story of a mutinous pauper to tell me and so the day goes on and Im always the same lazy fellow before evening sets in
Besides one wants the stimulus of sympathy and I have never had that since poor DOyley left Treddleston
If you had stuck to your books well you rascal I should have had a pleasanter prospect before me
But scholarship doesnt run in your family blood
No indeed
Its well if I can remember a little inapplicable Latin to adorn my maiden speech in Parliament six or seven years hence
Cras ingens iterabimus aequor and a few shreds of that sort will perhaps stick to me and I shall arrange my opinions so as to introduce them
But I dont think a knowledge of the classics is a pressing want to a country gentleman as far as I can see hed much better have a knowledge of manures
Ive been reading your friend Arthur Youngs books lately and theres nothing I should like better than to carry out some of his ideas in putting the farmers on a better management of their land and as he says making what was a wild country all of the same dark hue bright and variegated with corn and cattle
My grandfather will never let me have any power while he lives but theres nothing I should like better than to undertake the Stonyshire side of the estateits in a dismal conditionand set improvements on foot and gallop about from one place to another and overlook them
I should like to know all the labourers and see them touching their hats to me with a look of goodwill
Bravo Arthur
A man who has no feeling for the classics couldnt make a better apology for coming into the world than by increasing the quantity of food to maintain scholarsand rectors who appreciate scholars
And whenever you enter on your career of model landlord may I be there to see
Youll want a portly rector to complete the picture and take his tithe of all the respect and honour you get by your hard work
Only dont set your heart too strongly on the goodwill you are to get in consequence
Im not sure that men are the fondest of those who try to be useful to them
You know Gawaine has got the curses of the whole neighbourhood upon him about that enclosure
You must make it quite clear to your mind which you are most bent upon old boy popularity or usefulnesselse you may happen to miss both
Oh
Gawaine is harsh in his manners he doesnt make himself personally agreeable to his tenants
I dont believe theres anything you cant prevail on people to do with kindness
For my part I couldnt live in a neighbourhood where I was not respected and beloved
And its very pleasant to go among the tenants here they seem all so well inclined to me I suppose it seems only the other day to them since I was a little lad riding on a pony about as big as a sheep
And if fair allowances were made to them and their buildings attended to one could persuade them to farm on a better plan stupid as they are
Then mind you fall in love in the right place and dont get a wife who will drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of yourself
My mother and I have a little discussion about you sometimes she says I ll never risk a single prophecy on Arthur until I see the woman he falls in love with
She thinks your ladylove will rule you as the moon rules the tides
But I feel bound to stand up for you as my pupil you know and I maintain that youre not of that watery quality
So mind you dont disgrace my judgment
Arthur winced under this speech for keen old Mrs Irwines opinion about him had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen
This to be sure was only another reason for persevering in his intention and getting an additional security against himself
Nevertheless at this point in the conversation he was conscious of increased disinclination to tell his story about Hetty
He was of an impressible nature and lived a great deal in other peoples opinions and feelings concerning himself and the mere fact that he was in the presence of an intimate friend who had not the slightest notion that he had had any such serious internal struggle as he came to confide rather shook his own belief in the seriousness of the struggle
It was not after all a thing to make a fuss about and what could Irwine do for him that he could not do for himself
He would go to Eagledale in spite of Megs lamenessgo on Rattler and let Pym follow as well as he could on the old hack
That was his thought as he sugared his coffee but the next minute as he was lifting the cup to his lips he remembered how thoroughly he had made up his mind last night to tell Irwine
No
He would not be vacillating againhe WOULD do what he had meant to do this time
So it would be well not to let the personal tone of the conversation altogether drop
If they went to quite indifferent topics his difficulty would be heightened
It had required no noticeable pause for this rush and rebound of feeling before he answered But I think it is hardly an argument against a mans general strength of character that he should be apt to be mastered by love
A fine constitution doesnt insure one against smallpox or any other of those inevitable diseases
A man may be very firm in other matters and yet be under a sort of witchery from a woman
Yes but theres this difference between love and smallpox or bewitchment eitherthat if you detect the disease at an early stage and try change of air there is every chance of complete escape without any further development of symptoms
And there are certain alternative doses which a man may administer to himself by keeping unpleasant consequences before his mind this gives you a sort of smoked glass through which you may look at the resplendent fair one and discern her true outline though Im afraid by the by the smoked glass is apt to be missing just at the moment it is most wanted
I daresay now even a man fortified with a knowledge of the classics might be lured into an imprudent marriage in spite of the warning given him by the chorus in the Prometheus
The smile that flitted across Arthurs face was a faint one and instead of following Mr Irwines playful lead he said quite seriouslyYes thats the worst of it
Its a desperately vexatious thing that after all ones reflections and quiet determinations we should be ruled by moods that one cant calculate on beforehand
I dont think a man ought to be blamed so much if he is betrayed into doing things in that way in spite of his resolutions
Ah but the moods lie in his nature my boy just as much as his reflections did and more
A man can never do anything at variance with his own nature
He carries within him the germ of his most exceptional action and if we wise people make eminent fools of ourselves on any particular occasion we must endure the legitimate conclusion that we carry a few grains of folly to our ounce of wisdom
Well but one may be betrayed into doing things by a combination of circumstances which one might never have done otherwise
Why yes a man cant very well steal a banknote unless the banknote lies within convenient reach but he wont make us think him an honest man because he begins to howl at the banknote for falling in his way
But surely you dont think a man who struggles against a temptation into which he falls at last as bad as the man who never struggles at all
No certainly I pity him in proportion to his struggles for they foreshadow the inward suffering which is the worst form of Nemesis
Consequences are unpitying
Our deeds carry their terrible consequences quite apart from any fluctuations that went beforeconsequences that are hardly ever confined to ourselves
And it is best to fix our minds on that certainty instead of considering what may be the elements of excuse for us
But I never knew you so inclined for moral discussion Arthur
Is it some danger of your own that you are considering in this philosophical general way
In asking this question Mr Irwine pushed his plate away threw himself back in his chair and looked straight at Arthur
He really suspected that Arthur wanted to tell him something and thought of smoothing the way for him by this direct question
But he was mistaken
Brought suddenly and involuntarily to the brink of confession Arthur shrank back and felt less disposed towards it than ever
The conversation had taken a more serious tone than he had intendedit would quite mislead Irwinehe would imagine there was a deep passion for Hetty while there was no such thing
He was conscious of colouring and was annoyed at his boyishness
Oh no no danger he said as indifferently as he could
I dont know that I am more liable to irresolution than other people only there are little incidents now and then that set one speculating on what might happen in the future
Was there a motive at work under this strange reluctance of Arthurs which had a sort of backstairs influence not admitted to himself
Our mental business is carried on much in the same way as the business of the State a great deal of hard work is done by agents who are not acknowledged
In a piece of machinery too I believe there is often a small unnoticeable wheel which has a great deal to do with the motion of the large obvious ones
Possibly there was some such unrecognized agent secretly busy in Arthurs mind at this momentpossibly it was the fear lest he might hereafter find the fact of having made a confession to the rector a serious annoyance in case he should NOT be able quite to carry out his good resolutions
I dare not assert that it was not so
The human soul is a very complex thing
The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr Irwines mind as he looked inquiringly at Arthur but his disclaiming indifferent answer confirmed the thought which had quickly followedthat there could be nothing serious in that direction
There was no probability that Arthur ever saw her except at church and at her own home under the eye of Mrs Poyser and the hint he had given Arthur about her the other day had no more serious meaning than to prevent him from noticing her so as to rouse the little chits vanity and in this way perturb the rustic drama of her life
Arthur would soon join his regiment and be far away no there could be no danger in that quarter even if Arthurs character had not been a strong security against it
His honest patronizing pride in the goodwill and respect of everybody about him was a safeguard even against foolish romance still more against a lower kind of folly
If there had been anything special on Arthurs mind in the previous conversation it was clear he was not inclined to enter into details and Mr Irwine was too delicate to imply even a friendly curiosity
He perceived a change of subject would be welcome and said By the way Arthur at your colonels birthday fete there were some transparencies that made a great effect in honour of Britannia and Pitt and the Loamshire Militia and above all the generous youth the hero of the day
Dont you think you should get up something of the same sort to astonish our weak minds
The opportunity was gone
While Arthur was hesitating the rope to which he might have clung had drifted awayhe must trust now to his own swimming
In ten minutes from that time Mr Irwine was called for on business and Arthur bidding him goodbye mounted his horse again with a sense of dissatisfaction which he tried to quell by determining to set off for Eagledale without an hours delay
Book Two Chapter XVII In Which the Story Pauses a Little THIS Rector of Broxton is little better than a pagan
I hear one of my readers exclaim
How much more edifying it would have been if you had made him give Arthur some truly spiritual advice
You might have put into his mouth the most beautiful thingsquite as good as reading a sermon
Certainly I could if I held it the highest vocation of the novelist to represent things as they never have been and never will be
Then of course I might refashion life and character entirely after my own liking I might select the most unexceptionable type of clergyman and put my own admirable opinions into his mouth on all occasions
But it happens on the contrary that my strongest effort is to avoid any such arbitrary picture and to give a faithful account of men and things as they have mirrored themselves in my mind
The mirror is doubtless defective the outlines will sometimes be disturbed the reflection faint or confused but I feel as much bound to tell you as precisely as I can what that reflection is as if I were in the witnessbox narrating my experience on oath
Sixty years agoit is a long time so no wonder things have changedall clergymen were not zealous indeed there is reason to believe that the number of zealous clergymen was small and it is probable that if one among the small minority had owned the livings of Broxton and Hayslope in the year 1799 you would have liked him no better than you like Mr Irwine
Ten to one you would have thought him a tasteless indiscreet methodistical man
It is so very rarely that facts hit that nice medium required by our own enlightened opinions and refined taste
Perhaps you will say Do improve the facts a little then make them more accordant with those correct views which it is our privilege to possess
The world is not just what we like do touch it up with a tasteful pencil and make believe it is not quite such a mixed entangled affair
Let all people who hold unexceptionable opinions act unexceptionably
Let your most faulty characters always be on the wrong side and your virtuous ones on the right
Then we shall see at a glance whom we are to condemn and whom we are to approve
Then we shall be able to admire without the slightest disturbance of our prepossessions we shall hate and despise with that true ruminant relish which belongs to undoubting confidence
But my good friend what will you do then with your fellow parishioner who opposes your husband in the vestry
With your newly appointed vicar whose style of preaching you find painfully below that of his regretted predecessor
With the honest servant who worries your soul with her one failing
With your neighbour Mrs Green who was really kind to you in your last illness but has said several illnatured things about you since your convalescence
Nay with your excellent husband himself who has other irritating habits besides that of not wiping his shoes
These fellowmortals every one must be accepted as they are you can neither straighten their noses nor brighten their wit nor rectify their dispositions and it is these peopleamongst whom your life is passedthat it is needful you should tolerate pity and love it is these more or less ugly stupid inconsistent people whose movements of goodness you should be able to admire for whom you should cherish all possible hopes all possible patience
And I would not even if I had the choice be the clever novelist who could create a world so much better than this in which we get up in the morning to do our daily work that you would be likely to turn a harder colder eye on the dusty streets and the common green fieldson the real breathing men and women who can be chilled by your indifference or injured by your prejudice who can be cheered and helped onward by your fellow feeling your forbearance your outspoken brave justice
So I am content to tell my simple story without trying to make things seem better than they were dreading nothing indeed but falsity which in spite of ones best efforts there is reason to dread
Falsehood is so easy truth so difficult
The pencil is conscious of a delightful facility in drawing a griffinthe longer the claws and the larger the wings the better but that marvellous facility which we mistook for genius is apt to forsake us when we want to draw a real unexaggerated lion
Examine your words well and you will find that even when you have no motive to be false it is a very hard thing to say the exact truth even about your own immediate feelingsmuch harder than to say something fine about them which is NOT the exact truth
It is for this rare precious quality of truthfulness that I delight in many Dutch paintings which loftyminded people despise
I find a source of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a monotonous homely existence which has been the fate of so many more among my fellowmortals than a life of pomp or of absolute indigence of tragic suffering or of worldstirring actions
I turn without shrinking from cloudborne angels from prophets sibyls and heroic warriors to an old woman bending over her flowerpot or eating her solitary dinner while the noonday light softened perhaps by a screen of leaves falls on her mobcap and just touches the rim of her spinningwheel and her stone jug and all those cheap common things which are the precious necessaries of life to heror I turn to that village wedding kept between four brown walls where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance with a highshouldered broadfaced bride while elderly and middleaged friends look on with very irregular noses and lips and probably with quartpots in their hands but with an expression of unmistakable contentment and goodwill
Foh
says my idealistic friend what vulgar details
What good is there in taking all these pains to give an exact likeness of old women and clowns
What a low phase of life
What clumsy ugly people
But bless us things may be lovable that are not altogether handsome I hope
I am not at all sure that the majority of the human race have not been ugly and even among those lords of their kind the British squat figures illshapen nostrils and dingy complexions are not startling exceptions
Yet there is a great deal of family love amongst us
I have a friend or two whose class of features is such that the Apollo curl on the summit of their brows would be decidedly trying yet to my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for them and their miniaturesflattering but still not lovelyare kissed in secret by motherly lips
I have seen many an excellent matron who could have never in her best days have been handsome and yet she had a packet of yellow loveletters in a private drawer and sweet children showered kisses on her sallow cheeks
And I believe there have been plenty of young heroes of middle stature and feeble beards who have felt quite sure they could never love anything more insignificant than a Diana and yet have found themselves in middle life happily settled with a wife who waddles
Yes
Thank God human feeling is like the mighty rivers that bless the earth it does not wait for beautyit flows with resistless force and brings beauty with it
All honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form
Let us cultivate it to the utmost in men women and childrenin our gardens and in our houses
But let us love that other beauty too which lies in no secret of proportion but in the secret of deep human sympathy
Paint us an angel if you can with a floating violet robe and a face paled by the celestial light paint us yet oftener a Madonna turning her mild face upward and opening her arms to welcome the divine glory but do not impose on us any aesthetic rules which shall banish from the region of Art those old women scraping carrots with their workworn hands those heavy clowns taking holiday in a dingy pothouse those rounded backs and stupid weatherbeaten faces that have bent over the spade and done the rough work of the worldthose homes with their tin pans their brown pitchers their rough curs and their clusters of onions
In this world there are so many of these common coarse people who have no picturesque sentimental wretchedness
It is so needful we should remember their existence else we may happen to leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy and frame lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes
Therefore let Art always remind us of them therefore let us always have men ready to give the loving pains of a life to the faithful representing of commonplace thingsmen who see beauty in these commonplace things and delight in showing how kindly the light of heaven falls on them
There are few prophets in the world few sublimely beautiful women few heroes
I cant afford to give all my love and reverence to such rarities I want a great deal of those feelings for my everyday fellowmen especially for the few in the foreground of the great multitude whose faces I know whose hands I touch for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy
Neither are picturesque lazzaroni or romantic criminals half so frequent as your common labourer who gets his own bread and eats it vulgarly but creditably with his own pocketknife
It is more needful that I should have a fibre of sympathy connecting me with that vulgar citizen who weighs out my sugar in a vilely assorted cravat and waistcoat than with the handsomest rascal in red scarf and green feathersmore needful that my heart should swell with loving admiration at some trait of gentle goodness in the faulty people who sit at the same hearth with me or in the clergyman of my own parish who is perhaps rather too corpulent and in other respects is not an Oberlin or a Tillotson than at the deeds of heroes whom I shall never know except by hearsay or at the sublimest abstract of all clerical graces that was ever conceived by an able novelist
And so I come back to Mr Irwine with whom I desire you to be in perfect charity far as he may be from satisfying your demands on the clerical character
Perhaps you think he was notas he ought to have beena living demonstration of the benefits attached to a national church
But I am not sure of that at least I know that the people in Broxton and Hayslope would have been very sorry to part with their clergyman and that most faces brightened at his approach and until it can be proved that hatred is a better thing for the soul than love I must believe that Mr Irwines influence in his parish was a more wholesome one than that of the zealous Mr Ryde who came there twenty years afterwards when Mr Irwine had been gathered to his fathers
It is true Mr Ryde insisted strongly on the doctrines of the Reformation visited his flock a great deal in their own homes and was severe in rebuking the aberrations of the fleshput a stop indeed to the Christmas rounds of the church singers as promoting drunkenness and too light a handling of sacred things
But I gathered from Adam Bede to whom I talked of these matters in his old age that few clergymen could be less successful in winning the hearts of their parishioners than Mr Ryde
They learned a great many notions about doctrine from him so that almost every churchgoer under fifty began to distinguish as well between the genuine gospel and what did not come precisely up to that standard as if he had been born and bred a Dissenter and for some time after his arrival there seemed to be quite a religious movement in that quiet rural district
But said Adam Ive seen pretty clear ever since I was a young un as religions something else besides notions
It isnt notions sets people doing the right thingits feelings
Its the same with the notions in religion as it is with mathmaticsa man may be able to work problems straight off ins head as he sits by the fire and smokes his pipe but if he has to make a machine or a building he must have a will and a resolution and love something else better than his own ease
Somehow the congregation began to fall off and people began to speak light o Mr Ryde
I believe he meant right at bottom but you see he was sourishtempered and was for beating down prices with the people as worked for him and his preaching wouldnt go down well with that sauce
And he wanted to be like my lord judge i the parish punishing folks for doing wrong and he scolded em from the pulpit as if hed been a Ranter and yet he couldnt abide the Dissenters and was a deal more set against em than Mr Irwine was
And then he didnt keep within his income for he seemed to think at first gooff that six hundred ayear was to make him as big a man as Mr Donnithorne
Thats a sore mischief Ive often seen with the poor curates jumping into a bit of a living all of a sudden
Mr Ryde was a deal thought on at a distance I believe and he wrote books but as for mathmatics and the natur o things he was as ignorant as a woman
He was very knowing about doctrines and used to call em the bulwarks of the Reformation but Ive always mistrusted that sort o learning as leaves folks foolish and unreasonable about business
Now Mester Irwine was as different as could be as quickhe understood what you meant in a minute and he knew all about building and could see when youd made a good job
And he behaved as much like a gentleman to the farmers and th old women and the labourers as he did to the gentry
You never saw HIM interfering and scolding and trying to play th emperor
Ah he was a fine man as ever you set eyes on and so kind tos mother and sisters
That poor sickly Miss Anne he seemed to think more of her than of anybody else in the world
There wasnt a soul in the parish had a word to say against him and his servants stayed with him till they were so old and pottering he had to hire other folks to do their work
Well I said that was an excellent way of preaching in the weekdays but I daresay if your old friend Mr Irwine were to come to life again and get into the pulpit next Sunday you would be rather ashamed that he didnt preach better after all your praise of him
Nay nay said Adam broadening his chest and throwing himself back in his chair as if he were ready to meet all inferences nobody has ever heard me say Mr Irwine was much of a preacher
He didnt go into deep speritial experience and I know there s a deal in a mans inward life as you cant measure by the square and say Do this and that ll follow and Do that and this ll follow
Theres things go on in the soul and times when feelings come into you like a rushing mighty wind as the Scripture says and part your life in two amost so you look back on yourself as if you was somebody else
Those are things as you cant bottle up in a do this and do that and Ill go so far with the strongest Methodist ever youll find
That shows me theres deep speritial things in religion
You cant make much out wi talking about it but you feel it
Mr Irwine didnt go into those thingshe preached short moral sermons and that was all
But then he acted pretty much up to what he said he didnt set up for being so different from other folks one day and then be as like em as two peas the next
And he made folks love him and respect him and that was better nor stirring up their gall wi being overbusy
Mrs Poyser used to sayyou know she would have her word about everythingshe said Mr Irwine was like a good meal o victual you were the better for him without thinking on it and Mr Ryde was like a dose o physic he gripped you and worreted you and after all he left you much the same
But didnt Mr Ryde preach a great deal more about that spiritual part of religion that you talk of Adam
Couldnt you get more out of his sermons than out of Mr
Irwines
Eh I knowna
He preached a deal about doctrines
But Ive seen pretty clear ever since I was a young un as religions something else besides doctrines and notions
I look at it as if the doctrines was like finding names for your feelings so as you can talk of em when youve never known em just as a man may talk o tools when he knows their names though hes never so much as seen em still less handled em
Ive heard a deal o doctrine i my time for I used to go after the Dissenting preachers along wi Seth when I was a lad o seventeen and got puzzling myself a deal about th Arminians and the Calvinists
The Wesleyans you know are strong Arminians and Seth who could never abide anything harsh and was always for hoping the best held fast by the Wesleyans from the very first but I thought I could pick a hole or two in their notions and I got disputing wi one o the class leaders down at Treddleson and harassed him so first o this side and then o that till at last he said Young man its the devil making use o your pride and conceit as a weapon to war against the simplicity o the truth
I couldnt help laughing then but as I was going home I thought the man wasnt far wrong
I began to see as all this weighing and sifting what this text means and that text means and whether folks are saved all by Gods grace or whether there goes an ounce o their own will tot was no part o real religion at all
You may talk o these things for hours on end and youll only be all the more coxy and conceited fort
So I took to going nowhere but to church and hearing nobody but Mr Irwine for he said notning but what was good and what youd be the wiser for remembering
And I found it better for my soul to be humble before the mysteries o Gods dealings and not be making a clatter about what I could never understand
And theyre poor foolish questions after all for what have we got either inside or outside of us but what comes from God
If weve got a resolution to do right He gave it us I reckon first or last but I see plain enough we shall never do it without a resolution and thats enough for me
Adam you perceive was a warm admirer perhaps a partial judge of Mr Irwine as happily some of us still are of the people we have known familiarly
Doubtless it will be despised as a weakness by that lofty order of minds who pant after the ideal and are oppressed by a general sense that their emotions are of too exquisite a character to find fit objects among their everyday fellowmen
I have often been favoured with the confidence of these select natures and find them to concur in the experience that great men are overestimated and small men are insupportable that if you would love a woman without ever looking back on your love as a folly she must die while you are courting her and if you would maintain the slightest belief in human heroism you must never make a pilgrimage to see the hero
I confess I have often meanly shrunk from confessing to these accomplished and acute gentlemen what my own experience has been
I am afraid I have often smiled with hypocritical assent and gratified them with an epigram on the fleeting nature of our illusions which any one moderately acquainted with French literature can command at a moments notice
Human converse I think some wise man has remarked is not rigidly sincere
But I herewith discharge my conscience and declare that I have had quite enthusiastic movements of admiration towards old gentlemen who spoke the worst English who were occasionally fretful in their temper and who had never moved in a higher sphere of influence than that of parish overseer and that the way in which I have come to the conclusion that human nature is lovablethe way I have learnt something of its deep pathos its sublime mysterieshas been by living a great deal among people more or less commonplace and vulgar of whom you would perhaps hear nothing very surprising if you were to inquire about them in the neighbourhoods where they dwelt
Ten to one most of the small shopkeepers in their vicinity saw nothing at all in them
For I have observed this remarkable coincidence that the select natures who pant after the ideal and find nothing in pantaloons or petticoats great enough to command their reverence and love are curiously in unison with the narrowest and pettiest
For example I have often heard Mr Gedge the landlord of the Royal Oak who used to turn a bloodshot eye on his neighbours in the village of Shepperton sum up his opinion of the people in his own parishand they were all the people he knewin these emphatic words Aye sir Ive said it often and Ill say it again theyre a poor lot i this parisha poor lot sir big and little
I think he had a dim idea that if he could migrate to a distant parish he might find neighbours worthy of him and indeed he did subsequently transfer himself to the Saracens Head which was doing a thriving business in the back street of a neighbouring markettown
But oddly enough he has found the people up that back street of precisely the same stamp as the inhabitants of Sheppertona poor lot sir big and little and them as comes for a go o gin are no better than them as comes for a pint o twopennya poor lot
Chapter XVIII Church HETTY Hetty dont you know church begins at two and its gone half after one aready
Have you got nothing better to think on this good Sunday as poor old Thias Bedes to be put into the ground and him drownded i th dead o the night as its enough to make ones back run cold but you must be dizening yourself as if there was a wedding istid of a funeral
Well Aunt said Hetty I cant be ready so soon as everybody else when Ive got Tottys things to put on
And Id ever such work to make her stand still
Hetty was coming downstairs and Mrs Poyser in her plain bonnet and shawl was standing below
If ever a girl looked as if she had been made of roses that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock
For her hat was trimmed with pink and her frock had pink spots sprinkled on a white ground
There was nothing but pink and white about her except in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes
Mrs Poyser was provoked at herself for she could hardly keep from smiling as any mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things
So she turned without speaking and joined the group outside the house door followed by Hetty whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on
And now the little procession set off
Mr Poyser was in his Sunday suit of drab with a redandgreen waistcoat and a green watchribbon having a large cornelian seal attached pendant like a plumbline from that promontory where his watchpocket was situated a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck and excellent grey ribbed stockings knitted by Mrs Poysers own hand setting off the proportions of his leg
Mr Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg and suspected that the growing abuse of topboots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf
Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face which was good humour itself as he said Come Hetty come little uns
and giving his arm to his wife led the way through the causeway gate into the yard
The little uns addressed were Marty and Tommy boys of nine and seven in little fustian tailed coats and kneebreeches relieved by rosy cheeks and black eyes looking as much like their father as a very small elephant is like a very large one
Hetty walked between them and behind came patient Molly whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the road for Totty having speedily recovered from her threatened fever had insisted on going to church today and especially on wearing her redandblack necklace outside her tippet
And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this afternoon for there had been heavy showers in the morning though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the horizon
You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the farmyard
The cocks and hens seemed to know it and made only crooning subdued noises the very bulldog looked less savage as if he would have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual
The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not to labour
It was asleep itself on the mossgrown cowshed on the group of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked under their wings on the old black sow stretched languidly on the straw while her largest young one found an excellent springbed on his mothers fat ribs on Alick the shepherd in his new smockfrock taking an uneasy siesta halfsitting halfstanding on the granary steps
Alick was of opinion that church like other luxuries was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the weather and the ewes on his mind
Church
NayIn gotten summat else to think on was an answer which he often uttered in a tone of bitter significance that silenced further question
I feel sure Alick meant no irreverence indeed I know that his mind was not of a speculative negative cast and he would on no account have missed going to church on Christmas Day Easter Sunday and Whissuntide
But he had a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies like other nonproductive employments were intended for people who had leisure
Theres Father astanding at the yardgate said Martin Poyser
I reckon he wants to watch us down the field
Its wonderful what sight he has and him turned seventyfive
Ah I often think its wi th old folks as it is wi the babbies said Mrs Poyser theyre satisfied wi looking no matter what theyre looking at
Its God Amightys way o quietening em I reckon afore they go to sleep
Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching and held it wide open leaning on his stickpleased to do this bit of work for like all old men whose life has been spent in labour he liked to feel that he was still usefulthat there was a better crop of onions in the garden because he was by at the sowingand that the cows would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on
He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays but not very regularly at other times on wet Sundays or whenever he had a touch of rheumatism he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis instead
Theyll ha putten Thias Bede i the ground afore ye get to the churchyard he said as his son came up
It ud ha been better luck if theyd ha buried him i the forenoon when the rain was fallin theres no likelihoods of a drop now an the moon lies like a boat there dost see
Thats a sure sign o fair weather theres a many as is false but thats sure
Aye aye said the son Im in hopes itll hold up now
Mind what the parson says mind what the parson says my lads said Grandfather to the blackeyed youngsters in kneebreeches conscious of a marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling a little secretly during the sermon
Doodbye Dandad said Totty
Me doin to church
Me dot my netlace on
Dive me a peppermint
Grandad shaking with laughter at this deep little wench slowly transferred his stick to his left hand which held the gate open and slowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had fixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation
And when they were all gone the old man leaned on the gate again watching them across the lane along the Home Close and through the far gate till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge
For the hedgerows in those days shut out ones view even on the bettermanaged farms and this afternoon the dogroses were tossing out their pink wreaths the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach peeping high up out of a holly bush and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path
There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them pass at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of cows standing one behind the other extremely slow to understand that their large bodies might be in the way at the far gate there was the mare holding her head over the bars and beside her the livercoloured foal with its head towards its mothers flank apparently still much embarrassed by its own straddling existence
The way lay entirely through Mr Poysers own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went along while Mrs Poyser was ready to supply a running commentary on them all
The woman who manages a dairy has a large share in making the rent so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on stock and their keepan exercise which strengthens her understanding so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most other subjects
Theres that shorthorned Sally she said as they entered the Home Close and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud and looking at her with a sleepy eye
I begin to hate the sight o the cow and I say now what I said three weeks ago the sooner we get rid of her the better for theres that little yallow cow as doesnt give half the milk and yet Ive twice as much butter from her
Why theet not like the women in general said Mr Poyser they like the shorthorns as give such a lot o milk
Theres Chownes wife wants him to buy no other sort
Whats it sinnify what Chownes wife likes
A poor soft thing wi no more headpiece nor a sparrow
Shed take a big cullender to strain her lard wi and then wonder as the scratchins run through
Ive seen enough of her to know as Ill niver take a servant from her house againall huggermuggerand youd niver know when you went in whether it was Monday or Friday the wash draggin on to th end o the week and as for her cheese I know well enough it rose like a loaf in a tin last year
And then she talks o the weather bein i fault as theres folks ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i their boots
Well Chownes been wanting to buy Sally so we can get rid of her if thee likst said Mr Poyser secretly proud of his wifes superior power of putting two and two together indeed on recent marketdays he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of shorthorns
Aye them as choose a soft for a wife mays well buy up the shorthorns for if you get your head stuck in a bog your legs mays well go after it
Eh
Talk o legs theres legs for you Mrs Poyser continued as Totty who had been set down now the road was dry toddled on in front of her father and mother
Theres shapes
An shes got such a long foot shell be her fathers own child
Aye shell be welly such a one as Hetty i ten years time ony shes got THY coloured eyes
I niver remember a blue eye i my family my mother had eyes as black as sloes just like Hettys
The child ull be none the worse for having summat as isnt like Hetty
An Im none for having her so overpretty
Though for the matter o that theres people wi light hair an blue eyes as pretty as them wi black
If Dinah had got a bit o colour in her cheeks an didnt stick that Methodist cap on her head enough to frighten the cows folks ud think her as pretty as Hetty
Nay nay said Mr Poyser with rather a contemptuous emphasis thee dostna know the pints of a woman
The men ud niver run after Dinah as they would after Hetty
What care I what the men ud run after
Its well seen what choice the most of em know how to make by the poor draggletails o wives you see like bits o gauze ribbin good for nothing when the colours gone
Well well thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice when I married thee said Mr Poyser who usually settled little conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort and thee wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year ago
I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a house
Theres Chownes wife ugly enough to turn the milk an save the rennet but shell niver save nothing any other way
But as for Dinah poor child shes niver likely to be buxom as long as shell make her dinner o cake and water for the sake o giving to them as want
She provoked me past bearing sometimes and as I told her she went clean again the Scriptur for that says Love your neighbour as yourself but I said if you loved your neighbour no better nor you do yourself Dinah its little enough youd do for him
Youd be thinking he might do well enough on a halfempty stomach
Eh I wonder where she is this blessed Sunday
Sitting by that sick woman I daresay as shed set her heart on going to all of a sudden
Ah it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head when she might ha stayed wi us all summer and eaten twice as much as she wanted and it ud niver ha been missed
She made no odds in th house at all for she sat as still at her sewing as a bird on the nest and was uncommon nimble at running to fetch anything
If Hetty gets married theedst like to ha Dinah wi thee constant
Its no use thinking o that said Mrs Poyser
You might as well beckon to the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come an live here comfortable like other folks
If anything could turn her I should ha turned her for Ive talked to her for a hour on end and scolded her too for shes my own sisters child and it behoves me to do what I can for her
But eh poor thing as soon as shed said us goodbye an got into the cart an looked back at me with her pale face as is welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven I begun to be frightened to think o the set downs Id given her for it comes over you sometimes as if shed a way o knowing the rights o things more nor other folks have
But Ill niver give in as thats cause shes a Methodist no more nor a white calfs white cause it eats out o the same bucket wi a black un
Nay said Mr Poyser with as near an approach to a snarl as his goodnature would allow Im no opinion o the Methodists
Its ony tradesfolks as turn Methodists you nuver knew a farmer bitten wi them maggots
Theres maybe a workman now an then as isnt overclever ats work takes to preachin an that like Seth Bede
But you see Adam as has got one o the best headpieces hereabout knows better hes a good Churchman else Id never encourage him for a sweetheart for Hetty
Why goodness me said Mrs Poyser who had looked back while her husband was speaking look where Molly is with them lads
Theyre the fields length behind us
How COULD you let em do so Hetty
Anybody might as well set a pictur to watch the children as you
Run back and tell em to come on
Mr and Mrs Poyser were now at the end of the second field so they set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the true Loamshire stile and awaited the loiterers Totty observing with complacency Dey naughty naughty boysme dood
The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great excitement to Marty and Tommy who saw a perpetual drama going on in the hedgerows and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers
Marty was quite sure he saw a yellowhammer on the boughs of the great ash and while he was peeping he missed the sight of a whitethroated stoat which had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy
Then there was a little greenfinch just fledged fluttering along the ground and it seemed quite possible to catch it till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush
Hetty could not be got to give any heed to these things so Molly was called on for her ready sympathy and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told and said Lawks
whenever she was expected to wonder
Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to them that her aunt was angry but Marty ran on first shouting Weve found the speckled turkeys nest Mother
with the instinctive confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault
Ah said Mrs Poyser really forgetting all discipline in this pleasant surprise thats a good lad why where is it
Down in ever such a hole under the hedge
I saw it first looking after the greenfinch and she sat on th nest
You didnt frighten her I hope said the mother else shell forsake it
No I went away as still as still and whispered to Mollydidnt I Molly
Well well now come on said Mrs Poyser and walk before Father and Mother and take your little sister by the hand
We must go straight on now
Good boys dont look after the birds of a Sunday
But Mother said Marty you said youd give halfacrown to find the speckled turkeys nest
Maynt I have the halfcrown put into my moneybox
Well see about that my lad if you walk along now like a good boy
The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at their eldestborns acuteness but on Tommys round face there was a cloud
Mother he said halfcrying Martys got ever so much more money in his box nor Ive got in mine
Munny me want halfatoun in my bots said Totty
Hush hush hush said Mrs Poyser did ever anybody hear such naughty children
Nobody shall ever see their moneyboxes any more if they dont make haste and go on to church
This dreadful threat had the desired effect and through the two remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any serious interruption notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles alias bullheads which the lads looked at wistfully
The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh tomorrow was not a cheering sight to Mr Poyser who during hay and corn harvest had often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest but no temptation would have induced him to carry on any fieldwork however early in the morning on a Sunday for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen sweltered while he was ploughing on Good Friday
That was a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing and with wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would have nothing to do since money got by such means would never prosper
It amost makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines so he observed as they passed through the Big Meadow
But its poor foolishness to think o saving by going against your conscience
Theres that Jim Wakefield as they used to call Gentleman Wakefield used to do the same of a Sunday as o weekdays and took no heed to right or wrong as if there was nayther God nor devil
An whats he come to
Why I saw him myself last marketday acarrying a basket wi oranges int
Ah to be sure said Mrs Poyser emphatically you make but a poor trap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi wickedness
The money as is got sos like to burn holes i your pocket
Id niver wish us to leave our lads a sixpence but what was got i the rightful way
And as for the weather theres One above makes it and we must put up wit its nothing of a plague to what the wenches are
Notwithstanding the interruption in their walk the excellent habit which Mrs Poysers clock had of taking time by the forelock had secured their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter to two though almost every one who meant to go to church was already within the churchyard gates
Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers like Timothys Bess who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling as women feel in that position that nothing else can be expected of them
It was not entirely to see Thias Bedes funeral that the people were standing about the churchyard so long before service began that was their common practice
The women indeed usually entered the church at once and the farmers wives talked in an undertone to each other over the tall pews about their illnesses and the total failure of doctors stuff recommending dandelion tea and other homemade specifics as far preferableabout the servants and their growing exorbitance as to wages whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could see herabout the bad price Mr Dingall the Treddleston grocer was giving for butter and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to his solvency notwithstanding that Mrs Dingall was a sensible woman and they were all sorry for HER for she had very good kin
Meantime the men lingered outside and hardly any of them except the singers who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through entered the church until Mr Irwine was in the desk
They saw no reason for that premature entrancewhat could they do in church if they were there before service beganand they did not conceive that any power in the universe could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about busness
Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance today for he has got his clean Sunday face which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger
But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the farmers for Chad was accustomed to say that a workingman must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on weekdays by which evilsounding rule of conduct he meant what was after all rather virtuous than otherwise namely that men who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect
Chad and the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn where the burial was going forward but Sandy Jim and several of the farmlabourers made a group round it and stood with their hats off as fellowmourners with the mother and sons
Others held a midway position sometimes watching the group at the grave sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers who stood in a knot near the church door and were now joined by Martin Poyser while his family passed into the church
On the outside of this knot stood Mr Casson the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms in his most striking attitudethat is to say with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat his left hand in his breeches pocket and his head very much on one side looking on the whole like an actor who has only a monosyllabic part entrusted to him but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge who held his hands behind him and leaned forward coughing asthmatically with an inward scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash
The talk was in rather a lower tone than usual today hushed a little by the sound of Mr Irwines voice reading the final prayers of the burialservice
They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances against Satchell the Squires bailiff who played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr Donnithorne himself for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber
This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door
And soon they became suddenly silent for Mr Irwines voice had ceased and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church
They all moved aside and stood with their hats off while Mr Irwine passed
Adam and Seth were coming next with their mother between them for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk and was not yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry
But there was a pause before the three mourners came on Lisbeth had turned round to look again towards the grave
Ah
There was nothing now but the brown earth under the white thorn
Yet she cried less today than she had done any day since her husbands death
Along with all her grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a burial and in Mr Irwines reading a special service for her husband and besides she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him
She felt this counterexcitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with her sons towards the church door and saw the friendly sympathetic nods of their fellowparishioners
The mother and sons passed into the church and one by one the loiterers followed though some still lingered without the sight of Mr Donnithornes carriage which was winding slowly up the hill perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste
But presently the sound of the bassoon and the keybugles burst forth the evening hymn which always opened the service had begun and every one must now enter and take his place
I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for anything except for the grey age of its oaken pewsgreat square pews mostly ranged on each side of a narrow aisle
It was free indeed from the modern blemish of galleries
The choir had two narrow pews to themselves in the middle of the righthand row so that it was a short process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass and return to his desk after the singing was over
The pulpit and desk grey and old as the pews stood on one side of the arch leading into the chancel which also had its grey square pews for Mr Donnithornes family and servants
Yet I assure you these grey pews with the buffwashed walls gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats
And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel for the pulpit and Mr Donnithornes own pew had handsome crimson cloth cushions and to close the vista there was a crimson altarcloth embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydias own hand
But even without the crimson cloth the effect must have been warm and cheering when Mr Irwine was in the desk looking benignly round on that simple congregationon the hardy old men with bent knees and shoulders perhaps but with vigour left for much hedge clipping and thatching on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stonecutters and carpenters on the halfdozen welltodo farmers with their applecheeked families and on the clean old women mostly farmlabourers wives with their bit of snowwhite capborder under their black bonnets and with their withered arms bare from the elbow folded passively over their chests
For none of the old people held bookswhy should they
Not one of them could read
But they knew a few good words by heart and their withered lips now and then moved silently following the service without any very clear comprehension indeed but with a simple faith in its efflcacy to ward off harm and bring blessing
And now all faces were visible for all were standing upthe little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey pews while good Bishop Kens evening hymn was being sung to one of those lively psalmtunes which died out with the last generation of rectors and choral parish clerks
Melodies die out like the pipe of Pan with the ears that love them and listen for them
Adam was not in his usual place among the singers today for he sat with his mother and Seth and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent tooall the more agreeable for Mr Joshua Rann who gave out his bass notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery
I beseech you to imagine Mr Irwine looking round on this scene in his ample white surplice that became him so well with his powdered hair thrown back his rich brown complexion and his finely cut nostril and upper lip for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul beams out
And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the old windows with their desultory patches of yellow red and blue that threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall
I think as Mr Irwine looked round today his eyes rested an instant longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his family
And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible not to wander thither and rest on that round pinkandwhite figure
But Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glancesshe was absorbed in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church for the carriage must surely be at the churchgate by this time
She had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday evening and oh how long the time had seemed
Things had gone on just the same as ever since that evening the wonders that had happened then had brought no changes after them they were already like a dream
When she heard the church door swinging her heart beat so she dared not look up
She felt that her aunt was curtsying she curtsied herself
That must be old Mr Donnithornehe always came first the wrinkled small old man peering round with shortsighted glances at the bowing and curtsying congregation then she knew Miss Lydia was passing and though Hetty liked so much to look at her fashionable little coal scuttle bonnet with the wreath of small roses round it she didnt mind it today
But there were no more curtsiesno he was not come she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the housekeepers black bonnet and the ladys maids beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydias and then the powdered heads of the butler and footman
No he was not there yet she would look nowshe might be mistakenfor after all she had not looked
So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the chancelthere was no one but old Mr Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief and Miss Lydia opening the large giltedged prayerbook
The chill disappointment was too hard to bear
She felt herself turning pale her lips trembling she was ready to cry
Oh what SHOULD she do
Everybody would know the reason they would know she was crying because Arthur was not there
And Mr Craig with the wonderful hothouse plant in his buttonhole was staring at her she knew
It was dreadfully long before the General Confession began so that she could kneel down
Two great drops WOULD fall then but no one saw them except goodnatured Molly for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her
Molly unable to imagine any cause for tears in church except faintness of which she had a vague traditional knowledge drew out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smellingbottle and after much labour in pulling the cork out thrust the narrow neck against Hettys nostrils
It donna smell she whispered thinking this was a great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones they did you good without biting your nose
Hetty pushed it away peevishly but this little flash of temper did what the salts could not have doneit roused her to wipe away the traces of her tears and try with all her might not to shed any more
Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little nature she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at or pointed at with any other feeling than admiration she would have pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should know a secret she did not want them to know
What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings while Mr Irwine was pronouncing the solemn Absolution in her deaf ears and through all the tones of petition that followed
Anger lay very close to disappointment and soon won the victory over the conjectures her small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthurs absence on the supposition that he really wanted to come really wanted to see her again
And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically because all the rest were rising the colour had returned to her cheeks even with a heightened glow for she was framing little indignant speeches to herself saying she hated Arthur for giving her this painshe would like him to suffer too
Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in her soul her eyes were bent down on her prayerbook and the eyelids with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever
Adam Bede thought so as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees
But Adams thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service they rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church service was a channel to him this afternoon as a certain consciousness of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our moments of keen sensibility
And to Adam the church service was the best channel he could have found for his mingled regret yearning and resignation its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts of faith and praise its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of its collects seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could have done as to those early Christians who had worshipped from their childhood upwards in catacombs the torchlight and shadows must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the streets
The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object but in its subtle relations to our own past no wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing oberver who might as well put on his spectacles to discern odours
But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village nooks in the kingdoma reason of which I am sure you have not the slightest suspicion
It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann
Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances
I believe after all he got it chiefly from Nature who had poured some of her music into this honest conceited soul as she had been known to do into other narrow souls before his
She had given him at least a fine bass voice and a musical ear but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses
The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence subsiding at the end of the last word into a sort of faint resonance like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello I can compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs
This may seem a strange mode of speaking about the reading of a parish clerka man in rusty spectacles with stubbly hair a large occiput and a prominent crown
But that is Natures way she will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune and not give him the slightest hint of it and takes care that some narrowbrowed fellow trolling a ballad in the corner of a pothouse shall be as true to his intervals as a bird
Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing and it was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the desk to the choir
Still more today it was a special occasion for an old man familiar to all the parish had died a sad deathnot in his bed a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasantand now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure
Moreover Bartle Massey was not at church and Joshuas importance in the choir suffered no eclipse
It was a solemn minor strain they sang
The old psalmtunes have many a wail among them and the words Thou sweepst us off as with a flood We vanish hence like dreams seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias
The mother and sons listened each with peculiar feelings
Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good it was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days while he was living
The more there was said about her husband the more there was done for him surely the safer he would be
It was poor Lisbeths blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some other love
Seth who was easily touched shed tears and tried to recall as he had done continually since his fathers death all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and reconcilement for was it not written in the very psalm they were singing that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by time
Adam had never been unable to join in a psalm before
He had known plenty of trouble and vexation since he had been a lad but this was the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice and strangely enough it was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever gone out of his reach
He had not been able to press his fathers hand before their parting and say Father you know it was all right between us I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad you forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then
Adam thought but little today of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his father his thoughts ran constantly on what the old mans feelings had been in moments of humiliation when he had held down his head before the rebukes of his son
When our indignation is borne in submissive silence we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own generosity if not justice how much more when the object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence and we have seen his face for the last time in the meekness of death
Ah
I was always too hard Adam said to himself
Its a sore fault in me as Im so hot and out o patience with people when they do wrong and my heart gets shut up against em so as I cant bring myself to forgive em
I see clear enough theres more pride nor love in my soul for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him
And there went plenty o pride and temper to the strokes as the devil WILL be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins
Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself
Its allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still but the real tough job for me ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my own pride
It seems to me now if I was to find Father at home tonight I should behave different but theres no knowingperhaps nothing ud be a lesson to us if it didnt come too late
Its well we should feel as lifes a reckoning we cant make twice over theres no real making amends in this world any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right
This was the keynote to which Adams thoughts had perpetually returned since his fathers death and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger emphasis
So was the sermon which Mr Irwine had chosen with reference to Thiass funeral
It spoke briefly and simply of the words In the midst of life we are in deathhow the present moment is all we can call our own for works of mercy of righteous dealing and of family tenderness
All very old truthsbut what we thought the oldest truth becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives
For when men want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects that we may measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness
Then came the moment of the final blessing when the forever sublime words The peace of God which passeth all understanding seemed to blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation and then the quiet rising the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon the fathers collecting the prayerbooks until all streamed out through the old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk their simple civilities and their invitations to tea for on a Sunday every one was ready to receive a guestit was the day when all must be in their best clothes and their best humour
Mr and Mrs Poyser paused a minute at the church gate they were waiting for Adam to Come up not being contented to go away without saying a kind word to the widow and her sons
Well Mrs Bede said Mrs Poyser as they walked on together you must keep up your heart husbands and wives must be content when theyve lived to rear their children and see one anothers hair grey
Aye aye said Mr Poyser they wonna have long to wait for one another then anyhow
And yeve got two o the strappingst sons i th country and well you may for I remember poor Thias as fine a broadshouldered fellow as need to be and as for you Mrs Bede why youre straighter i the back nor half the young women now
Eh said Lisbeth its poor luck for the platter to wear well when its broke i two
The sooner Im laid under the thorn the better
Im no good to nobody now
Adam never took notice of his mothers little unjust plaints but Seth said Nay Mother thee mustna say so
Thy sons ull never get another mother
Thats true lad thats true said Mr Poyser and its wrong on us to give way to grief Mrs Bede for its like the children cryin when the fathers and mothers take things from em
Theres One above knows better nor us
Ah said Mrs Poyser an its poor work allays settin the dead above the livin
We shall all on us be dead some time I reckonit ud be better if folks ud make much on us beforehand istid o beginnin when were gone
Its but little good youll do awatering the last years crop
Well Adam said Mr Poyser feeling that his wifes words were as usual rather incisive than soothing and that it would be well to change the subject youll come and see us again now I hope
I hanna had a talk with you this long while and the missis here wants you to see what can be done with her best spinningwheel for its got broke and itll be a nice job to mend ittherell want a bit o turning
Youll come as soon as you can now will you
Mr Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking as if to see where Hetty was for the children were running on before
Hetty was not without a companion and she had besides more pink and white about her than ever for she held in her hand the wonderful pinkandwhite hothouse plant with a very long namea Scotch name she supposed since people said Mr Craig the gardener was Scotch
Adam took the opportunity of looking round too and I am sure you will not require of him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression on Hettys face as she listened to the gardeners small talk
Yet in her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side for she would perhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church
Not that she cared to ask him the question but she hoped the information would be given spontaneously for Mr Craig like a superior man was very fond of giving information
Mr Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were received coldly for to shift ones point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind we are none of us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble understandingit is possible they see hardly anything in us
Moreover Mr Craig was a man of sober passions and was already in his tenth year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood
It is true that now and then when he had been a little heated by an extra glass of grog he had been heard to say of Hetty that the lass was well enough and that a man might do worse but on convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly
Martin Poyser held Mr Craig in honour as a man who knew his business and who had great lights concerning soils and compost but he was less of a favourite with Mrs Poyser who had more than once said in confidence to her husband Youre mighty fond o Craig but for my part I think hes welly like a cock as thinks the suns rose o purpose to hear him crow
For the rest Mr Craig was an estimable gardener and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself
He had also high shoulders and high cheekbones and hung his head forward a little as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets
I think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch and not his bringing up for except that he had a stronger burr in his accent his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people about him
But a gardener is Scotch as a French teacher is Parisian
Well Mr Poyser he said before the good slow farmer had time to speak yell not be carrying your hay tomorrow Im thinking
The glass sticks at change and ye may rely upo my word as well ha more downfall afore twentyfour hours is past
Ye see that darkishblue cloud there upo the rizonye know what I mean by the rizon where the land and sky seems to meet
Aye aye I see the cloud said Mr Poyser rizon or no rizon
Its right oer Mike Holdsworths fallow and a foul fallow it is
Well you mark my words as that cloud ull spread oer the sky pretty nigh as quick as youd spread a tarpaulin over one o your hayricks
Its a great thing to ha studied the look o the clouds
Lord bless you
Th metorological almanecks can learn me nothing but theres a pretty sight o things I could let THEM up to if theyd just come to me
And how are you Mrs
Poyser thinking o getherin the red currants soon I reckon
Youd a deal better gether em afore theyre oerripe wi such weather as weve got to look forward to
How do ye do Mistress Bede
Mr Craig continued without a pause nodding by the way to Adam and Seth
I hope y enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries as I sent Chester with th other day
If ye want vegetables while yere in trouble ye know where to come to
Its well known Im not giving other folks things away for when Ive supplied the house the garden s my own spekilation and it isna every man th old squire could get as ud be equil to the undertaking let alone asking whether hed be willing Ive got to run my calkilation fine I can tell you to make sure o getting back the money as I pay the squire
I should like to see some o them fellows as make the almanecks looking as far before their noses as Ive got to do every year as comes
They look pretty fur though said Mr Poyser turning his head on one side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone
Why what could come truer nor that pictur o the cock wi the big spurs as has got its head knocked down wi th anchor an th firin an the ships behind
Why that pictur was made afore Christmas and yit its come as true as th Bible
Why th cocks France an th anchors Nelsonan they told us that beforehand
Peeeeeh
said Mr Craig
A man doesna want to see fur to know as th English ull beat the French
Why I know upo good authority as its a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high an they live upo spoonmeat mostly
I knew a man as his father had a particular knowledge o the French
I should like to know what them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur
Why it ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him his arms thicker nor a Frenchmans body Ill be bound for they pinch theirsells in wi stays and its easy enough for theyve got nothing i their insides
Where IS the captain as he wasna at church today
said Adam
I was talking to him o Friday and he said nothing about his going away
Oh hes only gone to Eagledale for a bit o fishing I reckon hell be back again afore many days are oer for hes to be at all th arranging and preparing o things for the comin o age o the 30th o July
But hes fond o getting away for a bit now and then
Him and th old squire fit one another like frost and flowers
Mr Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation but the subject was not developed farther for now they had reached the turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say goodbye
The gardener too would have had to turn off in the same direction if he had not accepted Mr Poysers invitation to tea
Mrs Poyser duly seconded the invitation for she would have held it a deep disgrace not to make her neighbours welcome to her house personal likes and dislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom
Moreover Mr Craig had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall Farm and Mrs Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had nothing to say again him ony it was a pity he couldna be hatched oer again an hatched different
So Adam and Seth with their mother between them wound their way down to the valley and up again to the old house where a saddened memory had taken the place of a long long anxietywhere Adam would never have to ask again as he entered Wheres Father
And the other family party with Mr Craig for company went back to the pleasant bright houseplace at the Hall Farmall with quiet minds except Hetty who knew now where Arthur was gone but was only the more puzzled and uneasy
For it appeared that his absence was quite voluntary he need not have gonehe would not have gone if he had wanted to see her
She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday nights vision was not to be fulfilled and in this moment of chill bare wintry disappointment and doubt she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again of meeting his loving glance and hearing his soft words with that eager yearning which one may call the growing pain of passion
Chapter XIX Adam on a Working Day NOTWITHSTANDING Mr Craigs prophecy the darkblue cloud dispersed itself without having produced the threatened consequences
The weatheras he observed the next morning the weather you see s a ticklish thing an a fool ull hit ont sometimes when a wise man misses thats why the almanecks get so much credit
Its one o them chancy things as fools thrive on
This unreasonable behaviour of the weather however could displease no one else in Hayslope besides Mr Craig
All hands were to be out in the meadows this morning as soon as the dew had risen the wives and daughters did double work in every farmhouse that the maids might give their help in tossing the hay and when Adam was marching along the lanes with his basket of tools over his shoulder he caught the sound of jocose talk and ringing laughter from behind the hedges
The jocose talk of haymakers is best at a distance like those clumsy bells round the cows necks it has rather a coarse sound when it comes close and may even grate on your ears painfully but heard from far off it mingles very prettily with the other joyous sounds of nature
Mens muscles move better when their souls are making merry music though their merriment is of a poor blundering sort not at all like the merriment of birds
And perhaps there is no time in a summers day more cheering than when the warmth of the sun is just beginning to triumph over the freshness of the morningwhen there is just a lingering hint of early coolness to keep off languor under the delicious influence of warmth
The reason Adam was walking along the lanes at this time was because his work for the rest of the day lay at a countryhouse about three miles off which was being put in repair for the son of a neighbouring squire and he had been busy since early morning with the packing of panels doors and chimney pieces in a waggon which was now gone on before him while Jonathan Burge himself had ridden to the spot on horseback to await its arrival and direct the workmen
This little walk was a rest to Adam and he was unconsciously under the charm of the moment
It was summer morning in his heart and he saw Hetty in the sunshinea sunshine without glare with slanting rays that tremble between the delicate shadows of the leaves
He thought yesterday when he put out his hand to her as they came out of church that there was a touch of melancholy kindness in her face such as he had not seen before and he took it as a sign that she had some sympathy with his family trouble
Poor fellow
That touch of melancholy came from quite another source but how was he to know
We look at the one little womans face we love as we look at the face of our mother earth and see all sorts of answers to our own yearnings
It was impossible for Adam not to feel that what had happened in the last week had brought the prospect of marriage nearer to him
Hitherto he had felt keenly the danger that some other man might step in and get possession of Hettys heart and hand while he himself was still in a position that made him shrink from asking her to accept him
Even if he had had a strong hope that she was fond of himand his hope was far from being stronghe had been too heavily burdened with other claims to provide a home for himself and Hettya home such as he could expect her to be content with after the comfort and plenty of the Farm
Like all strong natures Adam had confidence in his ability to achieve something in the future he felt sure he should some day if he lived be able to maintain a family and make a good broad path for himself but he had too cool a head not to estimate to the full the obstacles that were to be overcome
And the time would be so long
And there was Hetty like a brightcheeked apple hanging over the orchard wall within sight of everybody and everybody must long for her
To be sure if she loved him very much she would be content to wait for him but DID she love him
His hopes had never risen so high that he had dared to ask her
He was clearsighted enough to be aware that her uncle and aunt would have looked kindly on his suit and indeed without this encouragement he would never have persevered in going to the Farm but it was impossible to come to any but fluctuating conclusions about Hettys feelings
She was like a kitten and had the same distractingly pretty looks that meant nothing for everybody that came near her
But now he could not help saying to himself that the heaviest part of his burden was removed and that even before the end of another year his circumstances might be brought into a shape that would allow him to think of marrying
It would always be a hard struggle with his mother he knew she would be jealous of any wife he might choose and she had set her mind especially against Hettyperhaps for no other reason than that she suspected Hetty to be the woman he HAD chosen
It would never do he feared for his mother to live in the same house with him when he was married and yet how hard she would think it if he asked her to leave him
Yes there was a great deal of pain to be gone through with his mother but it was a case in which he must make her feel that his will was strongit would be better for her in the end
For himself he would have liked that they should all live together till Seth was married and they might have built a bit themselves to the old house and made more room
He did not like to part wi th lad they had hardly every been separated for more than a day since they were born
But Adam had no sooner caught his imagination leaping forward in this waymaking arrangements for an uncertain futurethan he checked himself
A pretty building Im making without either bricks or timber
Im up i the garret aready and havent so much as dug the foundation
Whenever Adam was strongly convinced of any proposition it took the form of a principle in his mind it was knowledge to be acted on as much as the knowledge that damp will cause rust
Perhaps here lay the secret of the hardness he had accused himself of he had too little fellowfeeling with the weakness that errs in spite of foreseen consequences
Without this fellowfeeling how are we to get enough patience and charity towards our stumbling falling companions in the long and changeful journey
And there is but one way in which a strong determined soul can learn itby getting his heartstrings bound round the weak and erring so that he must share not only the outward consequence of their error but their inward suffering
That is a long and hard lesson and Adam had at present only learned the alphabet of it in his fathers sudden death which by annihilating in an instant all that had stimulated his indignation had sent a sudden rush of thought and memory over what had claimed his pity and tenderness
But it was Adams strength not its correlative hardness that influenced his meditations this morning
He had long made up his mind that it would be wrong as well as foolish for him to marry a blooming young girl so long as he had no other prospect than that of growing poverty with a growing family
And his savings had been so constantly drawn upon besides the terrible sweep of paying for Seths substitute in the militia that he had not enough money beforehand to furnish even a small cottage and keep something in reserve against a rainy day
He had good hope that he should be firmer on his legs by and by but he could not be satisfied with a vague confidence in his arm and brain he must have definite plans and set about them at once
The partnership with Jonathan Burge was not to be thought of at presentthere were things implicitly tacked to it that he could not accept but Adam thought that he and Seth might carry on a little business for themselves in addition to their journeymans work by buying a small stock of superior wood and making articles of household furniture for which Adam had no end of contrivances
Seth might gain more by working at separate jobs under Adams direction than by his journeymans work and Adam in his overhours could do all the nice work that required peculiar skill
The money gained in this way with the good wages he received as foreman would soon enable them to get beforehand with the world so sparingly as they would all live now
No sooner had this little plan shaped itself in his mind than he began to be busy with exact calculations about the wood to be bought and the particular article of furniture that should be undertaken firsta kitchen cupboard of his own contrivance with such an ingenious arrangement of slidingdoors and bolts such convenient nooks for stowing household provender and such a symmetrical result to the eye that every good housewife would be in raptures with it and fall through all the gradations of melancholy longing till her husband promised to buy it for her
Adam pictured to himself Mrs Poyser examining it with her keen eye and trying in vain to find out a deficiency and of course close to Mrs Poyser stood Hetty and Adam was again beguiled from calculations and contrivances into dreams and hopes
Yes he would go and see her this eveningit was so long since he had been at the Hall Farm
He would have liked to go to the nightschool to see why Bartle Massey had not been at church yesterday for he feared his old friend was ill but unless he could manage both visits this last must be put off till to morrowthe desire to be near Hetty and to speak to her again was too strong
As he made up his mind to this he was coming very near to the end of his walk within the sound of the hammers at work on the refitting of the old house
The sound of tools to a clever workman who loves his work is like the tentative sounds of the orchestra to the violinist who has to bear his part in the overture the strong fibres begin their accustomed thrill and what was a moment before joy vexation or ambition begins its change into energy
All passion becomes strength when it has an outlet from the narrow limits of our personal lot in the labour of our right arm the cunning of our right hand or the still creative activity of our thought
Look at Adam through the rest of the day as he stands on the scaffolding with the twofeet ruler in his hand whistling low while he considers how a difficulty about a floorjoist or a windowframe is to be overcome or as he pushes one of the younger workmen aside and takes his place in upheaving a weight of timber saying Let alone lad
Theest got too much gristle i thy bones yet or as he fixes his keen black eyes on the motions of a workman on the other side of the room and warns him that his distances are not right
Look at this broadshouldered man with the bare muscular arms and the thick firm black hair tossed about like trodden meadowgrass whenever he takes off his paper cap and with the strong barytone voice bursting every now and then into loud and solemn psalmtunes as if seeking an outlet for superfluous strength yet presently checking himself apparently crossed by some thought which jars with the singing
Perhaps if you had not been already in the secret you might not have guessed what sad memories what warm affection what tender fluttering hopes had their home in this athletic body with the broken fingernailsin this rough man who knew no better lyrics than he could find in the Old and New Version and an occasional hymn who knew the smallest possible amount of profane history and for whom the motion and shape of the earth the course of the sun and the changes of the seasons lay in the region of mystery just made visible by fragmentary knowledge
It had cost Adam a great deal of trouble and work in overhours to know what he knew over and above the secrets of his handicraft and that acquaintance with mechanics and figures and the nature of the materials he worked with which was made easy to him by inborn inherited facultyto get the mastery of his pen and write a plain hand to spell without any other mistakes than must in fairness be attributed to the unreasonable character of orthography rather than to any deficiency in the speller and moreover to learn his musical notes and partsinging
Besides all this he had read his Bible including the apocryphal books Poor Richards Almanac Taylors Holy Living and Dying The Pilgrims Progress with Bunyans Life and Holy War a great deal of Baileys Dictionary Valentine and Orson and part of a History of Babylon which Bartle Massey had lent him
He might have had many more books from Bartle Massey but he had no time for reading the commin print as Lisbeth called it so busy as he was with figures in all the leisure moments which he did not fill up with extra carpentry
Adam you perceive was by no means a marvellous man nor properly speaking a genius yet I will not pretend that his was an ordinary character among workmen and it would not be at all a safe conclusion that the next best man you may happen to see with a basket of tools over his shoulder and a paper cap on his head has the strong conscience and the strong sense the blended susceptibility and selfcommand of our friend Adam
He was not an average man
Yet such men as he are reared here and there in every generation of our peasant artisanswith an inheritance of affections nurtured by a simple family life of common need and common industry and an inheritance of faculties trained in skilful courageous labour they make their way upwards rarely as geniuses most commonly as painstaking honest men with the skill and conscience to do well the tasks that lie before them
Their lives have no discernible echo beyond the neighbourhood where they dwelt but you are almost sure to find there some good piece of road some building some application of mineral produce some improvement in farming practice some reform of parish abuses with which their names are associated by one or two generations after them
Their employers were the richer for them the work of their hands has worn well and the work of their brains has guided well the hands of other men
They went about in their youth in flannel or paper caps in coats black with coaldust or streaked with lime and red paint in old age their white hairs are seen in a place of honour at church and at market and they tell their welldressed sons and daughters seated round the bright hearth on winter evenings how pleased they were when they first earned their twopence aday
Others there are who die poor and never put off the workmans coal on weekdays
They have not had the art of getting rich but they are men of trust and when they die before the work is all out of them it is as if some main screw had got loose in a machine the master who employed them says Where shall I find their like
Chapter XX Adam Visits the Hall Farm ADAM came back from his work in the empty waggonthat was why he had changed his clothesand was ready to set out to the Hall Farm when it still wanted a quarter to seven
Whats thee got thy Sunday cloose on for
said Lisbeth complainingly as he came downstairs
Thee artna goin to th school i thy best coat
No Mother said Adam quietly
Im going to the Hall Farm but mayhap I may go to the school after so thee mustna wonder if Im a bit late
Seth ull be at home in half an hourhes only gone to the village so thee wutna mind
Eh an whats thee got thy best cloose on for to go to th Hall Farm
The Poyser folks seed thee in em yesterday I warrand
What dost mean by turnin workiday into Sunday athatn
Its poor keepin company wi folks as donna like to see thee i thy workin jacket
Goodbye mother I cant stay said Adam putting on his hat and going out
But he had no sooner gone a few paces beyond the door than Lisbeth became uneasy at the thought that she had vexed him
Of course the secret of her objection to the best clothes was her suspicion that they were put on for Hettys sake but deeper than all her peevishness lay the need that her son should love her
She hurried after him and laid hold of his arm before he had got halfway down to the brook and said Nay my lad thee wutna go away angered wi thy mother an her got nought to do but to sit by hersen an think on thee
Nay nay Mother said Adam gravely and standing still while he put his arm on her shoulder Im not angered
But I wish for thy own sake theedst be more contented to let me do what Ive made up my mind to do
Ill never be no other than a good son to thee as long as we live
But a man has other feelings besides what he owes tos father and mother and thee oughtna to want to rule over me body and soul
And thee must make up thy mind as Ill not give way to thee where Ive a right to do what I like
So let us have no more words about it
Eh said Lisbeth not willing to show that she felt the real bearing of Adams words and who likes to see thee i thy best cloose better nor thy mother
An when theest got thy face washed as clean as the smooth white pibble an thy hair combed so nice and thy eyes asparklinwhat else is there as thy old mother should like to look at half so well
An thee shat put on thy Sunday cloose when thee likst for meIll neer plague thee no moor aboutn
Well well goodbye mother said Adam kissing her and hurrying away
He saw there was no other means of putting an end to the dialogue
Lisbeth stood still on the spot shading her eyes and looking after him till he was quite out of sight
She felt to the full all the meaning that had lain in Adams words and as she lost sight of him and turned back slowly into the house she said aloud to herselffor it was her way to speak her thoughts aloud in the long days when her husband and sons were at their workEh hell be tellin me as hes goin to bring her home one o these days an shell be missis oer me and I mun look on belike while she uses the blueedged platters and breaks em mayhap though theres neer been one broke sin my old man an me bought em at the fair twenty ear come next Whis suntide
Eh
she went on still louder as she caught up her knitting from the table but shell neer knit the lads stockins nor foot em nayther while I live an when Im gone hell bethink him as nobody ull neer fits leg an foot as his old mother did
Shell know nothin o narrowin an heelin I warrand an shell make a long toe as he canna gets boot on
Thats what comes o marrin young wenches
I war gone thirty an th feyther too afore we war married an young enough too
Shell be a poor dratchell by then SHES thirty amarrin a thatn afore her teeths all come
Adam walked so fast that he was at the yardgate before seven
Martin Poyser and the grandfather were not yet come in from the meadow every one was in the meadow even to the blackandtan terrierno one kept watch in the yard but the bulldog and when Adam reached the housedoor which stood wide open he saw there was no one in the bright clean houseplace
But he guessed where Mrs Poyser and some one else would be quite within hearing so he knocked on the door and said in his strong voice Mrs Poyser within
Come in Mr Bede come in Mrs Poyser called out from the dairy
She always gave Adam this title when she received him in her own house
You may come into the dairy if you will for I canna justly leave the cheese
Adam walked into the dairy where Mrs Poyser and Nancy were crushing the first evening cheese
Why you might think you war come to a deadhouse said Mrs Poyser as he stood in the open doorway theyre all i the meadow but Martins sure to be in afore long for theyre leaving the hay cocked tonight ready for carrying first thing tomorrow
Ive been forced t have Nancy in upo count as Hetty must gether the red currants tonight the fruit allays ripens so contrairy just when every hands wanted
An theres no trustin the children to gether it for they put more into their own mouths nor into the basket you might as well set the wasps to gether the fruit
Adam longed to say he would go into the garden till Mr Poyser came in but he was not quite courageous enough so he said I could be looking at your spinningwheel then and see what wants doing to it
Perhaps it stands in the house where I can find it
No Ive put it away in the righthand parlour but let it be till I can fetch it and show it you
Id be glad now if youd go into the garden and tell Hetty to send Totty in
The child ull run in if shes told an I know Hettys lettin her eat too many currants
Ill be much obliged to you Mr Bede if youll go and send her in an theres the York and Lankester roses beautiful in the garden nowyoull like to see em
But youd like a drink o whey first praps I know youre fond o whey as most folks is when they hanna got to crush it out
Thank you Mrs Poyser said Adam a drink o wheys allays a treat to me
Id rather have it than beer any day
Aye aye said Mrs Poyser reaching a small white basin that stood on the shelf and dipping it into the wheytub the smell o breads sweet t everybody but the baker
The Miss Irwines allays say Oh Mrs Poyser I envy you your dairy and I envy you your chickens and what a beautiful thing a farmhouse is to be sure
An I say Yes a farmhouse is a fine thing for them as look on an dont know the liftin an the stannin an the worritin o th inside as belongs tot
Why Mrs Poyser you wouldnt like to live anywhere else but in a farmhouse so well as you manage it said Adam taking the basin and there can be nothing to look at pleasanter nor a fine milch cow standing up tots knees in pasture and the new milk frothing in the pail and the fresh butter ready for market and the calves and the poultry
Heres to your health and may you allays have strength to look after your own dairy and set a pattern t all the farmers wives in the country
Mrs Poyser was not to be caught in the weakness of smiling at a compliment but a quiet complacency overspread her face like a stealing sunbeam and gave a milder glance than usual to her blue grey eyes as she looked at Adam drinking the whey
Ah
I think I taste that whey nowwith a flavour so delicate that one can hardly distinguish it from an odour and with that soft gliding warmth that fills ones imagination with a still happy dreaminess
And the light music of the dropping whey is in my ears mingling with the twittering of a bird outside the wire network windowthe window overlooking the garden and shaded by tall Guelder roses
Have a little more Mr
Bede
said Mrs Poyser as Adam set down the basin
No thank you Ill go into the garden now and send in the little lass
Aye do and tell her to come to her mother in the dairy
Adam walked round by the rickyard at present empty of ricks to the little wooden gate leading into the gardenonce the well tended kitchengarden of a manorhouse now but for the handsome brick wall with stone coping that ran along one side of it a true farmhouse garden with hardy perennial flowers unpruned fruit trees and kitchen vegetables growing together in careless half neglected abundance
In that leafy flowery bushy time to look for any one in this garden was like playing at hideandseek
There were the tall hollyhocks beginning to flower and dazzle the eye with their pink white and yellow there were the syringas and Guelder roses all large and disorderly for want of trimming there were leafy walls of scarlet beans and late peas there was a row of bushy filberts in one direction and in another a huge appletree making a barren circle under its lowspreading boughs
But what signified a barren patch or two
The garden was so large
There was always a superfluity of broad beansit took nine or ten of Adams strides to get to the end of the uncut grass walk that ran by the side of them and as for other vegetables there was so much more room than was necessary for them that in the rotation of crops a large flourishing bed of groundsel was of yearly occurrence on one spot or other
The very rosetrees at which Adam stopped to pluck one looked as if they grew wild they were all huddled together in bushy masses now flaunting with wideopen petals almost all of them of the streaked pinkand white kind which doubtless dated from the union of the houses of York and Lancaster
Adam was wise enough to choose a compact Provence rose that peeped out halfsmothered by its flaunting scentless neighbours and held it in his handhe thought he should be more at ease holding something in his handas he walked on to the far end of the garden where he remembered there was the largest row of curranttrees not far off from the great yewtree arbour
But he had not gone many steps beyond the roses when he heard the shaking of a bough and a boys voice saying Now then Totty hold out your pinnytheres a duck
The voice came from the boughs of a tall cherrytree where Adam had no difficulty in discerning a small bluepinafored figure perched in a commodious position where the fruit was thickest
Doubtless Totty was below behind the screen of peas
Yeswith her bonnet hanging down her back and her fat face dreadfully smeared with red juice turned up towards the cherrytree while she held her little round hole of a mouth and her redstained pinafore to receive the promised downfall
I am sorry to say more than half the cherries that fell were hard and yellow instead of juicy and red but Totty spent no time in useless regrets and she was already sucking the third juiciest when Adam said There now Totty youve got your cherries
Run into the house with em to Mothershe wants youshes in the dairy
Run in this minute theres a good little girl
He lifted her up in his strong arms and kissed her as he spoke a ceremony which Totty regarded as a tiresome interruption to cherryeating and when he set her down she trotted off quite silently towards the house sucking her cherries as she went along
Tommy my lad take care youre not shot for a little thieving bird said Adam as he walked on towards the curranttrees
He could see there was a large basket at the end of the row Hetty would not be far off and Adam already felt as if she were looking at him
Yet when he turned the corner she was standing with her back towards him and stooping to gather the lowhanging fruit
Strange that she had not heard him coming
Perhaps it was because she was making the leaves rustle
She started when she became conscious that some one was nearstarted so violently that she dropped the basin with the currants in it and then when she saw it was Adam she turned from pale to deep red
That blush made his heart beat with a new happiness
Hetty had never blushed at seeing him before
I frightened you he said with a delicious sense that it didnt signify what he said since Hetty seemed to feel as much as he did let ME pick the currants up
That was soon done for they had only fallen in a tangled mass on the grassplot and Adam as he rose and gave her the basin again looked straight into her eyes with the subdued tenderness that belongs to the first moments of hopeful love
Hetty did not turn away her eyes her blush had subsided and she met his glance with a quiet sadness which contented Adam because it was so unlike anything he had seen in her before
Theres not many more currants to get she said I shall soon ha done now
Ill help you said Adam and he fetched the large basket which was nearly full of currants and set it close to them
Not a word more was spoken as they gathered the currants
Adams heart was too full to speak and he thought Hetty knew all that was in it
She was not indifferent to his presence after all she had blushed when she saw him and then there was that touch of sadness about her which must surely mean love since it was the opposite of her usual manner which had often impressed him as indifference
And he could glance at her continually as she bent over the fruit while the level evening sunbeams stole through the thick appletree boughs and rested on her round cheek and neck as if they too were in love with her
It was to Adam the time that a man can least forget in afterlife the time when he believes that the first woman he has ever loved betrays by a slight somethinga word a tone a glance the quivering of a lip or an eyelidthat she is at least beginning to love him in return
The sign is so slight it is scarcely perceptible to the ear or eyehe could describe it to no oneit is a mere feathertouch yet it seems to have changed his whole being to have merged an uneasy yearning into a delicious unconsciousness of everything but the present moment
So much of our early gladness vanishes utterly from our memory we can never recall the joy with which we laid our heads on our mothers bosom or rode on our fathers back in childhood
Doubtless that joy is wrought up into our nature as the sunlight of longpast mornings is wrought up in the soft mellowness of the apricot but it is gone for ever from our imagination and we can only BELIEVE in the joy of childhood
But the first glad moment in our first love is a vision which returns to us to the last and brings with it a thrill of feeling intense and special as the recurrent sensation of a sweet odour breathed in a faroff hour of happiness
It is a memory that gives a more exquisite touch to tenderness that feeds the madness of jealousy and adds the last keenness to the agony of despair
Hetty bending over the red bunches the level rays piercing the screen of appletree boughs the length of bushy garden beyond his own emotion as he looked at her and believed that she was thinking of him and that there was no need for them to talkAdam remembered it all to the last moment of his life
And Hetty
You know quite well that Adam was mistaken about her
Like many other men he thought the signs of love for another were signs of love towards himself
When Adam was approaching unseen by her she was absorbed as usual in thinking and wondering about Arthurs possible return
The sound of any mans footstep would have affected her just in the same wayshe would have FELT it might be Arthur before she had time to see and the blood that forsook her cheek in the agitation of that momentary feeling would have rushed back again at the sight of any one else just as much as at the sight of Adam
He was not wrong in thinking that a change had come over Hetty the anxieties and fears of a first passion with which she was trembling had become stronger than vanity had given her for the first time that sense of helpless dependence on anothers feeling which awakens the clinging deprecating womanhood even in the shallowest girl that can ever experience it and creates in her a sensibility to kindness which found her quite hard before
For the first time Hetty felt that there was something soothing to her in Adams timid yet manly tenderness
She wanted to be treated lovinglyoh it was very hard to bear this blank of absence silence apparent indifference after those moments of glowing love
She was not afraid that Adam would tease her with lovemaking and flattering speeches like her other admirers he had always been so reserved to her she could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong brave man loved her and was near her
It never entered into her mind that Adam was pitiable toothat Adam too must suffer one day
Hetty we know was not the first woman that had behaved more gently to the man who loved her in vain because she had herself begun to love another
It was a very old story but Adam knew nothing about it so he drank in the sweet delusion
Thatll do said Hetty after a little while
Aunt wants me to leave some on the trees
Ill take em in now
Its very well I came to carry the basket said Adam for it ud ha been too heavy for your little arms
No I could ha carried it with both hands
Oh I daresay said Adam smiling and been as long getting into the house as a little ant carrying a caterpillar
Have you ever seen those tiny fellows carrying things four times as big as themselves
No said Hetty indifferently not caring to know the difficulties of ant life
Oh I used to watch em often when I was a lad
But now you see I can carry the basket with one arm as if it was an empty nutshell and give you th other arm to lean on
Wont you
Such big arms as mine were made for little arms like yours to lean on
Hetty smiled faintly and put her arm within his
Adam looked down at her but her eyes were turned dreamily towards another corner of the garden
Have you ever been to Eagledale
she said as they walked slowly along
Yes said Adam pleased to have her ask a question about himself
Ten years ago when I was a lad I went with father to see about some work there
Its a wonderful sightrocks and caves such as you never saw in your life
I never had a right notion o rocks till I went there
How long did it take to get there
Why it took us the best part o two days walking
But its nothing of a days journey for anybody as has got a firstrate nag
The captain ud get there in nine or ten hours Ill be bound hes such a rider
And I shouldnt wonder if hes back again tomorrow hes too active to rest long in that lonely place all by himself for theres nothing but a bit of a inn i that part where hes gone to fish
I wish hed got th estate in his hands that ud be the right thing for him for it ud give him plenty to do and hed dot well too for all hes so young hes got better notions o things than many a man twice his age
He spoke very handsome to me th other day about lending me money to set up i business and if things came round that way Id rather be beholding to him nor to any man i the world
Poor Adam was led on to speak about Arthur because he thought Hetty would be pleased to know that the young squire was so ready to befriend him the fact entered into his future prospects which he would like to seem promising in her eyes
And it was true that Hetty listened with an interest which brought a new light into her eyes and a halfsmile upon her lips
How pretty the roses are now
Adam continued pausing to look at them
See
I stole the prettiest but I didna mean to keep it myself
I think these as are all pink and have got a finer sort o green leaves are prettier than the striped uns dont you
He set down the basket and took the rose from his buttonhole
It smells very sweet he said those striped uns have no smell
Stick it in your frock and then you can put it in water after
It ud be a pity to let it fade
Hetty took the rose smiling as she did so at the pleasant thought that Arthur could so soon get back if he liked
There was a flash of hope and happiness in her mind and with a sudden impulse of gaiety she did what she had very often done beforestuck the rose in her hair a little above the left ear
The tender admiration in Adams face was slightly shadowed by reluctant disapproval
Hettys love of finery was just the thing that would most provoke his mother and he himself disliked it as much as it was possible for him to dislike anything that belonged to her
Ah he said thats like the ladies in the pictures at the Chase theyve mostly got flowers or feathers or gold things i their hair but somehow I dont like to see em they allays put me i mind o the painted women outside the shows at Treddleson Fair
What can a woman have to set her off better than her own hair when it curls so like yours
If a womans young and pretty I think you can see her good looks all the better for her being plain dressed
Why Dinah Morris looks very nice for all she wears such a plain cap and gown
It seems to me as a womans face doesna want flowers its almost like a flower itself
Im sure yours is
Oh very well said Hetty with a little playful pout taking the rose out of her hair
Ill put one o Dinahs caps on when we go in and youll see if I look better in it
She left one behind so I can take the pattern
Nay nay I dont want you to wear a Methodist cap like Dinahs
I daresay its a very ugly cap and I used to think when I saw her here as it was nonsense for her to dress different t other people but I never rightly noticed her till she came to see mother last week and then I thought the cap seemed to fit her face somehow as th acorncup fits th acorn and I shouldnt like to see her so well without it
But youve got another sort o face Id have you just as you are now without anything t interfere with your own looks
Its like when a mans singing a good tuneyou dont want t hear bells tinkling and interfering wi the sound
He took her arm and put it within his again looking down on her fondly
He was afraid she should think he had lectured her imagining as we are apt to do that she had perceived all the thoughts he had only halfexpressed
And the thing he dreaded most was lest any cloud should come over this evenings happiness
For the world he would not have spoken of his love to Hetty yet till this commencing kindness towards him should have grown into unmistakable love
In his imagination he saw long years of his future life stretching before him blest with the right to call Hetty his own he could be content with very little at present
So he took up the basket of currants once more and they went on towards the house
The scene had quite changed in the halfhour that Adam had been in the garden
The yard was full of life now Marty was letting the screaming geese through the gate and wickedly provoking the gander by hissing at him the granarydoor was groaning on its hinges as Alick shut it after dealing out the corn the horses were being led out to watering amidst much barking of all the three dogs and many whups from Tim the ploughman as if the heavy animals who held down their meek intelligent heads and lifted their shaggy feet so deliberately were likely to rush wildly in every direction but the right
Everybody was come back from the meadow and when Hetty and Adam entered the houseplace Mr Poyser was seated in the threecornered chair and the grandfather in the large armchair opposite looking on with pleasant expectation while the supper was being laid on the oak table
Mrs Poyser had laid the cloth herselfa cloth made of homespun linen with a shining checkered pattern on it and of an agreeable whiteybrown hue such as all sensible housewives like to seenone of your bleached shoprag that would wear into holes in no time but good homespun that would last for two generations
The cold veal the fresh lettuces and the stuffed chine might well look tempting to hungry men who had dined at halfpast twelve oclock
On the large deal table against the wall there were bright pewter plates and spoons and cans ready for Alick and his companions for the master and servants ate their supper not far off each other which was all the pleasanter because if a remark about tomorrow mornings work occurred to Mr Poyser Alick was at hand to hear it
Well Adam Im glad to see ye said Mr Poyser
What
yeve been helping Hetty to gether the currans eh
Come sit ye down sit ye down
Why its pretty near a threeweek since y had your supper with us and the missis has got one of her rare stuffed chines
Im glad yere come
Hetty said Mrs Poyser as she looked into the basket of currants to see if the fruit was fine run upstairs and send Molly down
Shes putting Totty to bed and I want her to draw th ale for Nancys busy yet i the dairy
You can see to the child
But whativer did you let her run away from you along wi Tommy for and stuff herself wi fruit as she cant eat a bit o good victual
This was said in a lower tone than usual while her husband was talking to Adam for Mrs Poyser was strict in adherence to her own rules of propriety and she considered that a young girl was not to be treated sharply in the presence of a respectable man who was courting her
That would not be fairplay every woman was young in her turn and had her chances of matrimony which it was a point of honour for other women not to spoiljust as one marketwoman who has sold her own eggs must not try to balk another of a customer
Hetty made haste to run away upstairs not easily finding an answer to her aunts question and Mrs Poyser went out to see after Marty and Tommy and bring them in to supper
Soon they were all seatedthe two rosy lads one on each side by the pale mother a place being left for Hetty between Adam and her uncle
Alick too was come in and was seated in his far corner eating cold broad beans out of a large dish with his pocketknife and finding a flavour in them which he would not have exchanged for the finest pineapple
What a time that gell is drawing th ale to be sure
said Mrs Poyser when she was dispensing her slices of stuffed chine
I think she sets the jug under and forgets to turn the tap as theres nothing you cant believe o them wenches theyll set the empty kettle o the fire and then come an hour after to see if the water boils
Shes drawin for the men too said Mr Poyser
Thee shouldst ha told her to bring our jug up first
Told her
said Mrs Poyser
Yes I might spend all the wind i my body an take the bellows too if I was to tell them gells everything as their own sharpness wonna tell em
Mr Bede will you take some vinegar with your lettuce
Aye youre i the right not
It spoils the flavour o the chine to my thinking
Its poor eating where the flavour o the meat lies i the cruets
Theres folks as make bad butter and trusten to the salt t hide it
Mrs Poysers attention was here diverted by the appearance of Molly carrying a large jug two small mugs and four drinking cans all full of ale or small beeran interesting example of the prehensile power possessed by the human hand
Poor Mollys mouth was rather wider open than usual as she walked along with her eyes fixed on the double cluster of vessels in her hands quite innocent of the expression in her mistresss eye
Molly I niver knew your equilsto think o your poor mother as is a widow an I took you wi as good as no character an the times an times Ive told you Molly had not seen the lightning and the thunder shook her nerves the more for the want of that preparation
With a vague alarmed sense that she must somehow comport herself differently she hastened her step a little towards the far deal table where she might set down her canscaught her foot in her apron which had become untied and fell with a crash and a splash into a pool of beer whereupon a tittering explosion from Marty and Tommy and a serious Ello
from Mr Poyser who saw his draught of ale unpleasantly deferred
There you go
resumed Mrs Poyser in a cutting tone as she rose and went towards the cupboard while Molly began dolefully to pick up the fragments of pottery
Its what I told you ud come over and over again and theres your months wage gone and more to pay for that jug as Ive had i the house this ten year and nothing ever happened tot before but the crockery youve broke sin here in th house youve been ud make a parson swearGod forgi me for saying soan if it had been boiling wort out o the copper it ud ha been the same and youd ha been scalded and very like lamed for life as theres no knowing but what you will be some day if you go on for anybody ud think youd got the St Vituss Dance to see the things youve throwed down
Its a pity but what the bits was stacked up for you to see though its neither seeing nor hearing as ull make much odds to youanybody ud think you war casehardened
Poor Mollys tears were dropping fast by this time and in her desperation at the lively movement of the beerstream towards Alicks legs she was converting her apron into a mop while Mrs Poyser opening the cupboard turned a blighting eye upon her
Ah she went on youll do no good wi crying an making more wet to wipe up
Its all your own wilfulness as I tell you for theres nobody no call to break anything if theyll only go the right way to work
But wooden folks had need ha wooden things t handle
And here must I take the brownandwhite jug as its niver been used three times this year and go down i the cellar myself and belike catch my death and be laid up wi inflammation Mrs Poyser had turned round from the cupboard with the brownand white jug in her hand when she caught sight of something at the other end of the kitchen perhaps it was because she was already trembling and nervous that the apparition had so strong an effect on her perhaps jugbreaking like other crimes has a contagious influence
However it was she stared and started like a ghost seer and the precious brownandwhite jug fell to the ground parting for ever with its spout and handle
Did ever anybody see the like
she said with a suddenly lowered tone after a moments bewildered glance round the room
The jugs are bewitched I think
Its them nasty glazed handlesthey slip oer the finger like a snail
Why theest let thy own whip fly i thy face said her husband who had now joined in the laugh of the young ones
Its all very fine to look on and grin rejoined Mrs Poyser but theres times when the crockery seems alive an flies out o your hand like a bird
Its like the glass sometimes ull crack as it stands
What is to be broke WILL be broke for I never dropped a thing i my life for want o holding it else I should never ha kept the crockery all these ears as I bought at my own wedding
And Hetty are you mad
Whativer do you mean by coming down i that way and making one think as theres a ghost a walking i th house
A new outbreak of laughter while Mrs Poyser was speaking was caused less by her sudden conversion to a fatalistic view of jug breaking than by that strange appearance of Hetty which had startled her aunt
The little minx had found a black gown of her aunts and pinned it close round her neck to look like Dinahs had made her hair as flat as she could and had tied on one of Dinahs highcrowned borderless net caps
The thought of Dinahs pale grave face and mild grey eyes which the sight of the gown and cap brought with it made it a laughable surprise enough to see them replaced by Hettys round rosy cheeks and coquettish dark eyes
The boys got off their chairs and jumped round her clapping their hands and even Alick gave a low ventral laugh as he looked up from his beans
Under cover of the noise Mrs Poyser went into the back kitchen to send Nancy into the cellar with the great pewter measure which had some chance of being free from bewitchment
Why Hetty lass are ye turned Methodist
said Mr Poyser with that comfortable slow enjoyment of a laugh which one only sees in stout people
You must pull your face a deal longer before youll do for one mustna she Adam
How come you put them things on eh
Adam said he liked Dinahs cap and gown better nor my clothes said Hetty sitting down demurely
He says folks looks better in ugly clothes
Nay nay said Adam looking at her admiringly I only said they seemed to suit Dinah
But if Id said youd look pretty in em I should ha said nothing but what was true
Why thee thoughtst Hetty war a ghost didstna
said Mr Poyser to his wife who now came back and took her seat again
Thee lookdst as scared as scared
It little sinnifies how I looked said Mrs Poyser looks ull mend no jugs nor laughing neither as I see
Mr Bede Im sorry youve to wait so long for your ale but its coming in a minute
Make yourself at home wi th cold potatoes I know you like em
Tommy Ill send you to bed this minute if you dont give over laughing
What is there to laugh at I should like to know
Id sooner cry nor laugh at the sight o that poor things cap and theres them as ud be better if they could make theirselves like her i more ways nor putting on her cap
It little becomes anybody i this house to make fun o my sisters child an her just gone away from us as it went to my heart to part wi her
An I know one thing as if trouble was to come an I was to be laid up i my bed an the children was to dieas theres no knowing but what they willan the murrain was to come among the cattle again an everything went to rack an ruin I say we might be glad to get sight o Dinahs cap again wi her own face under it border or no border
For shes one o them things as looks the brightest on a rainy day and loves you the best when youre most i need ont
Mrs Poyser you perceive was aware that nothing would be so likely to expel the comic as the terrible
Tommy who was of a susceptible disposition and very fond of his mother and who had besides eaten so many cherries as to have his feelings less under command than usual was so affected by the dreadful picture she had made of the possible future that he began to cry and the goodnatured father indulgent to all weaknesses but those of negligent farmers said to Hetty Youd better take the things off again my lass it hurts your aunt to see em
Hetty went upstairs again and the arrival of the ale made an agreeable diversion for Adam had to give his opinion of the new tap which could not be otherwise than complimentary to Mrs Poyser and then followed a discussion on the secrets of good brewing the folly of stinginess in hopping and the doubtful economy of a farmers making his own malt
Mrs Poyser had so many opportunities of expressing herself with weight on these subjects that by the time supper was ended the alejug refilled and Mr Poysers pipe alight she was once more in high good humour and ready at Adams request to fetch the broken spinningwheel for his inspection
Ah said Adam looking at it carefully heres a nice bit o turning wanted
Its a pretty wheel
I must have it up at the turningshop in the village and do it there for Ive no convenence for turning at home
If youll send it to Mr Burges shop i the morning Ill get it done for you by Wednesday
Ive been turning it over in my mind he continued looking at Mr Poyser to make a bit more convenence at home for nice jobs o cabinetmaking
Ive always done a deal at such little things in odd hours and theyre profitable for theres more workmanship nor material in em
I look for me and Seth to get a little business for ourselves i that way for I know a man at Rosseter as ull take as many things as we should make besides what we could get orders for round about
Mr Poyser entered with interest into a project which seemed a step towards Adams becoming a masterman and Mrs Poyser gave her approbation to the scheme of the movable kitchen cupboard which was to be capable of containing grocery pickles crockery and houselinen in the utmost compactness without confusion
Hetty once more in her own dress with her neckerchief pushed a little backwards on this warm evening was seated picking currants near the window where Adam could see her quite well
And so the time passed pleasantly till Adam got up to go
He was pressed to come again soon but not to stay longer for at this busy time sensible people would not run the risk of being sleepy at five oclock in the morning
I shall take a step farther said Adam and go on to see Mester Massey for he wasnt at church yesterday and Ive not seen him for a week past
Ive never hardly known him to miss church before
Aye said Mr Poyser weve heared nothing about him for its the boys hollodays now so we can give you no account
But youll niver think o going there at this hour o the night
said Mrs Poyser folding up her knitting
Oh Mester Massey sits up late said Adam
An the night schools not over yet
Some o the men dont come till late theyve got so far to walk
And Bartle himselfs never in bed till its gone eleven
I wouldna have him to live wi me then said Mrs Poyser a dropping candlegrease about as youre like to tumble down o the floor the first thing i the morning
Aye eleven oclocks lateits late said old Martin
I neer sot up so i MY life not to say as it warna a marrin or a christenin or a wake or th harvest supper
Eleven oclocks late
Why I sit up till after twelve often said Adam laughing but it isnt t eat and drink extry its to work extry
Goodnight Mrs Poyser goodnight Hetty
Hetty could only smile and not shake hands for hers were dyed and damp with currantjuice but all the rest gave a hearty shake to the large palm that was held out to them and said Come again come again
Aye think o that now said Mr Poyser when Adam was out of on the causeway
Sitting up till past twelve to do extry work
Yell not find many men o sixan twenty as ull do to put i the shafts wi him
If you can catch Adam for a husband Hetty youll ride i your own springcart some day Ill be your warrant
Hetty was moving across the kitchen with the currants so her uncle did not see the little toss of the head with which she answered him
To ride in a springcart seemed a very miserable lot indeed to her now
Chapter XXI The NightSchool and the Schoolmaster Bartle Masseys was one of a few scattered houses on the edge of a common which was divided by the road to Treddleston
Adam reached it in a quarter of an hour after leaving the Hall Farm and when he had his hand on the doorlatch he could see through the curtainless window that there were eight or nine heads bending over the desks lighted by thin dips
When he entered a reading lesson was going forward and Bartle Massey merely nodded leaving him to take his place where he pleased
He had not come for the sake of a lesson tonight and his mind was too full of personal matters too full of the last two hours he had passed in Hettys presence for him to amuse himself with a book till school was over so he sat down in a corner and looked on with an absent mind
It was a sort of scene which Adam had beheld almost weekly for years he knew by heart every arabesque flourish in the framed specimen of Bartle Masseys handwriting which hung over the schoolmasters head by way of keeping a lofty ideal before the minds of his pupils he knew the backs of all the books on the shelf running along the whitewashed wall above the pegs for the slates he knew exactly how many grains were gone out of the ear of Indian corn that hung from one of the rafters he had long ago exhausted the resources of his imagination in trying to think how the bunch of leathery seaweed had looked and grown in its native element and from the place where he sat he could make nothing of the old map of England that hung against the opposite wall for age had turned it of a fine yellow brown something like that of a wellseasoned meerschaum
The drama that was going on was almost as familiar as the scene nevertheless habit had not made him indifferent to it and even in his present selfabsorbed mood Adam felt a momentary stirring of the old fellowfeeling as he looked at the rough men painfully holding pen or pencil with their cramped hands or humbly labouring through their reading lesson
The reading class now seated on the form in front of the schoolmasters desk consisted of the three most backward pupils
Adam would have known it only by seeing Bartle Masseys face as he looked over his spectacles which he had shifted to the ridge of his nose not requiring them for present purposes
The face wore its mildest expression the grizzled bushy eyebrows had taken their more acute angle of compassionate kindness and the mouth habitually compressed with a pout of the lower lip was relaxed so as to be ready to speak a helpful word or syllable in a moment
This gentle expression was the more interesting because the schoolmasters nose an irregular aquiline twisted a little on one side had rather a formidable character and his brow moreover had that peculiar tension which always impresses one as a sign of a keen impatient temperament the blue veins stood out like cords under the transparent yellow skin and this intimidating brow was softened by no tendency to baldness for the grey bristly hair cut down to about an inch in length stood round it in as close ranks as ever
Nay Bill nay Bartle was saying in a kind tone as he nodded to Adam begin that again and then perhaps itll come to you what dry spells
Its the same lesson you read last week you know
Bill was a sturdy fellow aged fourandtwenty an excellent stonesawyer who could get as good wages as any man in the trade of his years but he found a reading lesson in words of one syllable a harder matter to deal with than the hardest stone he had ever had to saw
The letters he complained were so uncommon alike there was no tellin em one from another the sawyers business not being concerned with minute differences such as exist between a letter with its tail turned up and a letter with its tail turned down
But Bill had a firm determination that he would learn to read founded chiefly on two reasons first that Tom Hazelow his cousin could read anything right off whether it was print or writing and Tom had sent him a letter from twenty miles off saying how he was prospering in the world and had got an overlookers place secondly that Sam Phillips who sawed with him had learned to read when he was turned twenty and what could be done by a little fellow like Sam Phillips Bill considered could be done by himself seeing that he could pound Sam into wet clay if circumstances required it
So here he was pointing his big finger towards three words at once and turning his head on one side that he might keep better hold with his eye of the one word which was to be discriminated out of the group
The amount of knowledge Bartle Massey must possess was something so dim and vast that Bills imagination recoiled before it he would hardly have ventured to deny that the schoolmaster might have something to do in bringing about the regular return of daylight and the changes in the weather
The man seated next to Bill was of a very different type he was a Methodist brickmaker who after spending thirty years of his life in perfect satisfaction with his ignorance had lately got religion and along with it the desire to read the Bible
But with him too learning was a heavy business and on his way out tonight he had offered as usual a special prayer for help seeing that he had undertaken this hard task with a single eye to the nourishment of his soulthat he might have a greater abundance of texts and hymns wherewith to banish evil memories and the temptations of old habitor in brief language the devil
For the brickmaker had been a notorious poacher and was suspected though there was no good evidence against him of being the man who had shot a neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg
However that might be it is certain that shortly after the accident referred to which was coincident with the arrival of an awakening Methodist preacher at Treddleston a great change had been observed in the brickmaker and though he was still known in the neighbourhood by his old sobriquet of Brimstone there was nothing he held in so much horror as any further transactions with that evilsmelling element
He was a broadchested fellow
with a fervid temperament which helped him better in imbibing religious ideas than in the dry process of acquiring the mere human knowledge of the alphabet
Indeed he had been already a little shaken in his resolution by a brother Methodist who assured him that the letter was a mere obstruction to the Spirit and expressed a fear that Brimstone was too eager for the knowledge that puffeth up
The third beginner was a much more promising pupil
He was a tall but thin and wiry man nearly as old as Brimstone with a very pale face and hands stained a deep blue
He was a dyer who in the course of dipping homespun wool and old womens petticoats had got fired with the ambition to learn a great deal more about the strange secrets of colour
He had already a high reputation in the district for his dyes and he was bent on discovering some method by which he could reduce the expense of crimsons and scarlets
The druggist at Treddleston had given him a notion that he might save himself a great deal of labour and expense if he could learn to read and so he had begun to give his spare hours to the nightschool resolving that his little chap should lose no time in coming to Mr Masseys dayschool as soon as he was old enough
It was touching to see these three big men with the marks of their hard labour about them anxiously bending over the worn books and painfully making out The grass is green The sticks are dry The corn is ripea very hard lesson to pass to after columns of single words all alike except in the first letter
It was almost as if three rough animals were making humble efforts to learn how they might become human
And it touched the tenderest fibre in Bartle Masseys nature for such fullgrown children as these were the only pupils for whom he had no severe epithets and no impatient tones
He was not gifted with an imperturbable temper and on musicnights it was apparent that patience could never be an easy virtue to him but this evening as he glances over his spectacles at Bill Downes the sawyer who is turning his head on one side with a desperate sense of blankness before the letters dry his eyes shed their mildest and most encouraging light
After the reading class two youths between sixteen and nineteen came up with the imaginary bills of parcels which they had been writing out on their slates and were now required to calculate offhanda test which they stood with such imperfect success that Bartle Massey whose eyes had been glaring at them ominously through his spectacles for some minutes at length burst out in a bitter highpitched tone pausing between every sentence to rap the floor with a knobbed stick which rested between his legs
Now you see you dont do this thing a bit better than you did a fortnight ago and Ill tell you whats the reason
You want to learn accountsthats well and good
But you think all you need do to learn accounts is to come to me and do sums for an hour or so two or three times aweek and no sooner do you get your caps on and turn out of doors again than you sweep the whole thing clean out of your mind
You go whistling about and take no more care what youre thinking of than if your heads were gutters for any rubbish to swill through that happened to be in the way and if you get a good notion in em its pretty soon washed out again
You think knowledge is to be got cheapyoull come and pay Bartle Massey sixpence aweek and hell make you clever at figures without your taking any trouble
But knowledge isnt to be got with paying sixpence let me tell you
If youre to know figures you must turn em over in your heads and keep your thoughts fixed on em
Theres nothing you cant turn into a sum for theres nothing but whats got number in iteven a fool
You may say to yourselves Im one fool and Jacks another if my fools head weighed four pound and Jacks three pound three ounces and three quarters how many pennyweights heavier would my head be than Jacks
A man that had got his heart in learning figures would make sums for himself and work em in his head
When he sat at his shoemaking hed count his stitches by fives and then put a price on his stitches say half a farthing and then see how much money he could get in an hour and then ask himself how much money hed get in a day at that rate and then how much ten workmen would get working three or twenty or a hundred years at that rateand all the while his needle would be going just as fast as if he left his head empty for the devil to dance in
But the long and the short of it isIll have nobody in my nightschool that doesnt strive to learn what he comes to learn as hard as if he was striving to get out of a dark hole into broad daylight
Ill send no man away because hes stupid if Billy Taft the idiot wanted to learn anything Id not refuse to teach him
But Ill not throw away good knowledge on people who think they can get it by the sixpennorth and carry it away with em as they would an ounce of snuff
So never come to me again if you cant show that youve been working with your own heads instead of thinking that you can pay for mine to work for you
Thats the last word Ive got to say to you
With this final sentence Bartle Massey gave a sharper rap than ever with his knobbed stick and the discomfited lads got up to go with a sulky look
The other pupils had happily only their writingbooks to show in various stages of progress from pot hooks to round text and mere penstrokes however perverse were less exasperating to Bartle than false arithmetic
He was a little more severe than usual on Jacob Storeys Zs of which poor Jacob had written a pageful all with their tops turned the wrong way with a puzzled sense that they were not right somehow
But he observed in apology that it was a letter you never wanted hardly and he thought it had only been there to finish off th alphabet like though ampusand  would ha done as well for what he could see
At last the pupils had all taken their hats and said their Good nights and Adam knowing his old masters habits rose and said Shall I put the candles out Mr
Massey
Yes my boy yes all but this which Ill carry into the house and just lock the outer door now youre near it said Bartle getting his stick in the fitting angle to help him in descending from his stool
He was no sooner on the ground than it became obvious why the stick was necessarythe left leg was much shorter than the right
But the schoolmaster was so active with his lameness that it was hardly thought of as a misfortune and if you had seen him make his way along the schoolroom floor and up the step into his kitchen you would perhaps have understood why the naughty boys sometimes felt that his pace might be indefinitely quickened and that he and his stick might overtake them even in their swiftest run
The moment he appeared at the kitchen door with the candle in his hand a faint whimpering began in the chimneycorner and a brown andtancoloured bitch of that wiselooking breed with short legs and long body known to an unmechanical generation as turnspits came creeping along the floor wagging her tail and hesitating at every other step as if her affections were painfully divided between the hamper in the chimneycorner and the master whom she could not leave without a greeting
Well Vixen well then how are the babbies
said the schoolmaster making haste towards the chimneycorner and holding the candle over the low hamper where two extremely blind puppies lifted up their heads towards the light from a nest of flannel and wool
Vixen could not even see her master look at them without painful excitement she got into the hamper and got out again the next moment and behaved with true feminine folly though looking all the while as wise as a dwarf with a large oldfashioned head and body on the most abbreviated legs
Why youve got a family I see Mr
Massey
said Adam smiling as he came into the kitchen
Hows that
I thought it was against the law here
Law
Whats the use o law when a mans once such a fool as to let a woman into his house
said Bartle turning away from the hamper with some bitterness
He always called Vixen a woman and seemed to have lost all consciousness that he was using a figure of speech
If Id known Vixen was a woman Id never have held the boys from drowning her but when Id got her into my hand I was forced to take to her
And now you see what shes brought me tothe sly hypocritical wenchBartle spoke these last words in a rasping tone of reproach and looked at Vixen who poked down her head and turned up her eyes towards him with a keen sense of opprobriumand contrived to be brought to bed on a Sunday at churchtime
Ive wished again and again Id been a bloody minded man that I could have strangled the mother and the brats with one cord
Im glad it was no worse a cause kept you from church said Adam
I was afraid you must be ill for the first time i your life
And I was particularly sorry not to have you at church yesterday
Ah my boy I know why I know why said Bartle kindly going up to Adam and raising his hand up to the shoulder that was almost on a level with his own head
Youve had a rough bit o road to get over since I saw youa rough bit o road
But Im in hopes there are better times coming for you
Ive got some news to tell you
But I must get my supper first for Im hungry Im hungry
Sit down sit down
Bartel went into his little pantry and brought out an excellent homebaked loaf for it was his one extravagance in these dear times to eat bread once aday instead of oatcake and he justified it by observing that what a schoolmaster wanted was brains and oatcake ran too much to bone instead of brains
Then came a piece of cheese and a quart jug with a crown of foam upon it
He placed them all on the round deal table which stood against his large armchair in the chimneycorner with Vixens hamper on one side of it and a windowshelf with a few books piled up in it on the other
The table was as clean as if Vixen had been an excellent housewife in a checkered apron so was the quarry floor and the old carved oaken press table and chairs which in these days would be bought at a high price in aristocratic houses though in that period of spiderlegs and inlaid cupids Bartle had got them for an old song where as free from dust as things could be at the end of a summers day
Now then my boy draw up draw up
Well not talk about business till weve had our supper
No man can be wise on an empty stomach
But said Bartle rising from his chair again I must give Vixen her supper too confound her
Though shell do nothing with it but nourish those unnecessary babbies
Thats the way with these womentheyve got no headpieces to nourish and so their food all runs either to fat or to brats
He brought out of the pantry a dish of scraps which Vixen at once fixed her eyes on and jumped out of her hamper to lick up with the utmost dispatch
Ive had my supper Mr Massey said Adam so Ill look on while you eat yours
Ive been at the Hall Farm and they always have their supper betimes you know they dont keep your late hours
I know little about their hours said Bartle dryly cutting his bread and not shrinking from the crust
Its a house I seldom go into though Im fond of the boys and Martin Poysers a good fellow
Theres too many women in the house for me I hate the sound of womens voices theyre always either abuzz or asqueak always either abuzz or asqueak
Mrs Poyser keeps at the top o the talk like a fife and as for the young lasses Id as soon look at watergrubs
I know what theyll turn tostinging gnats stinging gnats
Here take some ale my boy its been drawn for youits been drawn for you
Nay Mr Massey said Adam who took his old friends whim more seriously than usual tonight dont be so hard on the creaturs God has made to be companions for us
A workingman ud be badly off without a wife to see to th house and the victual and make things clean and comfortable
Nonsense
Its the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever believed to say a woman makes a house comfortable
Its a story got up because the women are there and something must be found for em to do
I tell you there isnt a thing under the sun that needs to be done at all but what a man can do better than a woman unless its bearing children and they do that in a poor makeshift way it had better ha been left to the menit had better ha been left to the men
I tell you a woman ull bake you a pie every week of her life and never come to see that the hotter th oven the shorter the time
I tell you a woman ull make your porridge every day for twenty years and never think of measuring the proportion between the meal and the milka little more or less shell think doesnt signify
The porridge WILL be awkard now and then if its wrong its summat in the meal or its summat in the milk or its summat in the water
Look at me
I make my own bread and theres no difference between one batch and another from years end to years end but if Id got any other woman besides Vixen in the house I must pray to the Lord every baking to give me patience if the bread turned out heavy
And as for cleanliness my house is cleaner than any other house on the Common though the half of em swarm with women
Will Bakers lad comes to help me in a morning and we get as much cleaning done in one hour without any fuss as a woman ud get done in three and all the while be sending buckets o water after your ankles and let the fender and the fireirons stand in the middle o the floor half the day for you to break your shins against em
Dont tell me about God having made such creatures to be companions for us
I dont say but He might make Eve to be a companion to Adam in Paradisethere was no cooking to be spoilt there and no other woman to cackle with and make mischief though you see what mischief she did as soon as shed an opportunity
But its an impious unscriptural opinion to say a womans a blessing to a man now you might as well say adders and wasps and foxes and wild beasts are a blessing when theyre only the evils that belong to this state o probation which its lawful for a man to keep as clear of as he can in this life hoping to get quit of em for ever in anotherhoping to get quit of em for ever in another
Bartle had become so excited and angry in the course of his invective that he had forgotten his supper and only used the knife for the purpose of rapping the table with the haft
But towards the close the raps became so sharp and frequent and his voice so quarrelsome that Vixen felt it incumbent on her to jump out of the hamper and bark vaguely
Quiet Vixen
snarled Bartle turning round upon her
Youre like the rest o the womenalways putting in your word before you know why
Vixen returned to her hamper again in humiliation and her master continued his supper in a silence which Adam did not choose to interrupt he knew the old man would be in a better humour when he had had his supper and lighted his pipe
Adam was used to hear him talk in this way but had never learned so much of Bartles past life as to know whether his view of married comfort was founded on experience
On that point Bartle was mute and it was even a secret where he had lived previous to the twenty years in which happily for the peasants and artisans of this neighbourhood he had been settled among them as their only schoolmaster
If anything like a question was ventured on this subject Bartle always replied Oh Ive seen many placesIve been a deal in the south and the Loamshire men would as soon have thought of asking for a particular town or village in Africa as in the south
Now then my boy said Bartle at last when he had poured out his second mug of ale and lighted his pipe now then well have a little talk
But tell me first have you heard any particular news today
No said Adam not as I remember
Ah theyll keep it close theyll keep it close I daresay
But I found it out by chance and its news that may concern you Adam else Im a man that dont know a superficial square foot from a solid
Here Bartle gave a series of fierce and rapid puffs looking earnestly the while at Adam
Your impatient loquacious man has never any notion of keeping his pipe alight by gentle measured puffs he is always letting it go nearly out and then punishing it for that negligence
At last he said Satchells got a paralytic stroke
I found it out from the lad they sent to Treddleston for the doctor before seven oclock this morning
Hes a good way beyond sixty you know its much if he gets over it
Well said Adam I daresay thered be more rejoicing than sorrow in the parish at his being laid up
Hes been a selfish talebearing mischievous fellow but after all theres nobody hes done so much harm to as to th old squire
Though its the squire himself as is to blamemaking a stupid fellow like that a sort o manofallwork just to save th expense of having a proper steward to look after th estate
And hes lost more by ill management o the woods Ill be bound than ud pay for two stewards
If hes laid on the shelf its to be hoped hell make way for a better man but I dont see how its like to make any difference to me
But I see it but I see it said Bartle and others besides me
The captains coming of age nowyou know that as well as I do and its to be expected hell have a little more voice in things
And I know and you know too what ud be the captains wish about the woods if there was a fair opportunity for making a change
Hes said in plenty of peoples hearing that hed make you manager of the woods tomorrow if hed the power
Why Carroll Mr Irwines butler heard him say so to the parson not many days ago
Carroll looked in when we were smoking our pipes o Saturday night at Cassons and he told us about it and whenever anybody says a good word for you the parsons ready to back it that Ill answer for
It was pretty well talked over I can tell you at Cassons and one and another had their fling at you for if donkeys set to work to sing youre pretty sure what the tunell be
Why did they talk it over before Mr
Burge
said Adam or wasnt he there o Saturday
Oh he went away before Carroll came and Cassonhes always for setting other folks right you knowwould have it Burge was the man to have the management of the woods
A substantial man says he with pretty near sixty years experience o timber it ud be all very well for Adam Bede to act under him but it isnt to be supposed the squire ud appoint a young fellow like Adam when theres his elders and betters at hand
But I said Thats a pretty notion o yours Casson
Why Burge is the man to buy timber would you put the woods into his hands and let him make his own bargains
I think you dont leave your customers to score their own drink do you
And as for age what thats worth depends on the quality o the liquor
Its pretty well known whos the backbone of Jonathan Burges business
I thank you for your good word Mr Massey said Adam
But for all that Casson was partly i the right for once
Theres not much likelihood that th old squire ud ever consent t employ me
I offended him about two years ago and hes never forgiven me
Why how was that
You never told me about it said Bartle
Oh it was a bit o nonsense
Id made a frame for a screen for Miss Lyddyshes allays making something with her worstedwork you knowand shed given me particular orders about this screen and there was as much talking and measuring as if wed been planning a house
However it was a nice bit o work and I liked doing it for her
But you know those little friggling things take a deal o time
I only worked at it in overhoursoften late at nightand I had to go to Treddleston over an over again about little bits o brass nails and such gear and I turned the little knobs and the legs and carved th open work after a pattern as nice as could be
And I was uncommon pleased with it when it was done
And when I took it home Miss Lyddy sent for me to bring it into her drawingroom so as she might give me directions about fastening on the workvery fine needlework Jacob and Rachel a kissing one another among the sheep like a pictureand th old squire was sitting there for he mostly sits with her
Well she was mighty pleased with the screen and then she wanted to know what pay she was to give me
I didnt speak at randomyou know its not my way Id calculated pretty close though I hadnt made out a bill and I said One pound thirty
That was paying for the materals and paying me but none too much for my work
Th old squire looked up at this and peered in his way at the screen and said One pound thirteen for a gimcrack like that
Lydia my dear if you must spend money on these things why dont you get them at Rosseter instead of paying double price for clumsy work here
Such things are not work for a carpenter like Adam
Give him a guinea and no more
Well Miss Lyddy I reckon believed what he told her and shes not overfond o parting with the money herselfshes not a bad woman at bottom but shes been brought up under his thumb so she began fidgeting with her purse and turned as red as her ribbon
But I made a bow and said No thank you madam Ill make you a present o the screen if you please
Ive charged the regular price for my work and I know its done well and I know begging His Honours pardon that you couldnt get such a screen at Rosseter under two guineas
Im willing to give you my workits been done in my own time and nobodys got anything to do with it but me but if Im paid I cant take a smaller price than I asked because that ud be like saying Id asked more than was just
With your leave madam Ill bid you goodmorning
I made my bow and went out before shed time to say any more for she stood with the purse in her hand looking almost foolish
I didnt mean to be disrespectful and I spoke as polite as I could but I can give in to no man if he wants to make it out as Im trying to overreach him
And in the evening the footman brought me the one pound thirteen wrapped in paper
But since then Ive seen pretty clear as th old squire cant abide me
Thats likely enough thats likely enough said Bartle meditatively
The only way to bring him round would be to show him what was for his own interest and that the captain may do that the captain may do
Nay I dont know said Adam the squires cute enough but it takes something else besides cuteness to make folks see whatll be their interest in the long run
It takes some conscience and belief in right and wrong I see that pretty clear
Youd hardly ever bring round th old squire to believe hed gain as much in a straightforard way as by tricks and turns
And besides Ive not much mind to work under him I dont want to quarrel with any gentleman more particular an old gentleman turned eighty and I know we couldnt agree long
If the captain was master o th estate it ud be different hes got a conscience and a will to do right and Id sooner work for him nor for any man living
Well well my boy if good luck knocks at your door dont you put your head out at window and tell it to be gone about its business thats all
You must learn to deal with odd and even in life as well as in figures
I tell you now as I told you ten years ago when you pommelled young Mike Holdsworth for wanting to pass a bad shilling before you knew whether he was in jest or earnestyoure overhasty and proud and apt to set your teeth against folks that dont square to your notions
Its no harm for me to be a bit fiery and stiffbackedIm an old schoolmaster and shall never want to get on to a higher perch
But wheres the use of all the time Ive spent in teaching you writing and mapping and mensuration if youre not to get forard in the world and show folks theres some advantage in having a head on your shoulders instead of a turnip
Do you mean to go on turning up your nose at every opportunity because its got a bit of a smell about it that nobody finds out but yourself
Its as foolish as that notion o yours that a wife is to make a workingman comfortable
Stuff and nonsense
Stuff and nonsense
Leave that to fools that never got beyond a sum in simple addition
Simple addition enough
Add one fool to another fool and in six years time six fools moretheyre all of the same denomination big and littles nothing to do with the sum
During this rather heated exhortation to coolness and discretion the pipe had gone out and Bartle gave the climax to his speech by striking a light furiously after which he puffed with fierce resolution fixing his eye still on Adam who was trying not to laugh
Theres a good deal o sense in what you say Mr Massey Adam began as soon as he felt quite serious as there always is
But youll give in that its no business o mine to be building on chances that may never happen
What Ive got to do is to work as well as I can with the tools and materals Ive got in my hands
If a good chance comes to me Ill think o what youve been saying but till then Ive got nothing to do but to trust to my own hands and my own headpiece
Im turning over a little plan for Seth and me to go into the cabinetmaking a bit by ourselves and win a extra pound or two in that way
But its getting late nowitll be pretty near eleven before Im at home and Mother may happen to lie awake shes more fidgety nor usual now
So Ill bid you goodnight
Well well well go to the gate with youits a fine night said Bartle taking up his stick
Vixen was at once on her legs and without further words the three walked out into the starlight by the side of Bartles potatobeds to the little gate
Come to the music o Friday night if you can my boy said the old man as he closed the gate after Adam and leaned against it
Aye aye said Adam striding along towards the streak of pale road
He was the only object moving on the wide common
The two grey donkeys just visible in front of the gorse bushes stood as still as limestone imagesas still as the greythatched roof of the mud cottage a little farther on
Bartle kept his eye on the moving figure till it passed into the darkness while Vixen in a state of divided affection had twice run back to the house to bestow a parenthetic lick on her puppies
Aye aye muttered the schoolmaster as Adam disappeared there you go stalking alongstalking along but you wouldnt have been what you are if you hadnt had a bit of old lame Bartle inside you
The strongest calf must have something to suck at
Theres plenty of these big lumbering fellows ud never have known their A B C if it hadnt been for Bartle Massey
Well well Vixen you foolish wench what is it what is it
I must go in must I
Aye aye Im never to have a will o my own any more
And those pupswhat do you think Im to do with em when theyre twice as big as you
For Im pretty sure the father was that hulking bull terrier of Will Bakerswasnt he now eh you sly hussy
Here Vixen tucked her tail between her legs and ran forward into the house
Subjects are sometimes broached which a wellbred female will ignore
But wheres the use of talking to a woman with babbies
continued Bartle
Shes got no conscienceno conscience its all run to milk
Book Three Chapter XXII Going to the Birthday Feast THE thirtieth of July was come and it was one of those halfdozen warm days which sometimes occur in the middle of a rainy English summer
No rain had fallen for the last three or four days and the weather was perfect for that time of the year there was less dust than usual on the darkgreen hedgerows and on the wild camomile that starred the roadside yet the grass was dry enough for the little children to roll on it and there was no cloud but a long dash of light downy ripple high high up in the faroff blue sky
Perfect weather for an outdoor July merrymaking yet surely not the best time of year to be born in
Nature seems to make a hot pause just then all the loveliest flowers are gone the sweet time of early growth and vague hopes is past and yet the time of harvest and ingathering is not come and we tremble at the possible storms that may ruin the precious fruit in the moment of its ripeness
The woods are all one dark monotonous green the waggonloads of hay no longer creep along the lanes scattering their sweetsmelling fragments on the blackberry branches the pastures are often a little tanned yet the corn has not got its last splendour of red and gold the lambs and calves have lost all traces of their innocent frisky prettiness and have become stupid young sheep and cows
But it is a time of leisure on the farm that pause between hay and cornharvest and so the farmers and labourers in Hayslope and Broxton thought the captain did well to come of age just then when they could give their undivided minds to the flavour of the great cask of ale which had been brewed the autumn after the heir was born and was to be tapped on his twentyfirst birthday
The air had been merry with the ringing of churchbells very early this morning and every one had made haste to get through the needful work before twelve when it would be time to think of getting ready to go to the Chase
The midday sun was streaming into Hettys bedchamber and there was no blind to temper the heat with which it fell on her head as she looked at herself in the old specked glass
Still that was the only glass she had in which she could see her neck and arms for the small hanging glass she had fetched out of the next room the room that had been Dinahswould show her nothing below her little chin and that beautiful bit of neck where the roundness of her cheek melted into another roundness shadowed by dark delicate curls
And today she thought more than usual about her neck and arms for at the dance this evening she was not to wear any neckerchief and she had been busy yesterday with her spotted pinkandwhite frock that she might make the sleeves either long or short at will
She was dressed now just as she was to be in the evening with a tucker made of real lace which her aunt had lent her for this unparalleled occasion but with no ornaments besides she had even taken out her small round earrings which she wore every day
But there was something more to be done apparently before she put on her neckerchief and long sleeves which she was to wear in the daytime for now she unlocked the drawer that held her private treasures
It is more than a month since we saw her unlock that drawer before and now it holds new treasures so much more precious than the old ones that these are thrust into the corner
Hetty would not care to put the large coloured glass earrings into her ears now for see
she has got a beautiful pair of gold and pearls and garnet lying snugly in a pretty little box lined with white satin
Oh the delight of taking out that little box and looking at the earrings
Do not reason about it my philosphical reader and say that Hetty being very pretty must have known that it did not signify whether she had on any ornaments or not and that moreover to look at ear rings which she could not possibly wear out of her bedroom could hardly be a satisfaction the essence of vanity being a reference to the impressions produced on others you will never understand womens natures if you are so excessively rational
Try rather to divest yourself of all your rational prejudices as much as if you were studying the psychology of a canary bird and only watch the movements of this pretty round creature as she turns her head on one side with an unconscious smile at the earrings nestled in the little box
Ah you think it is for the sake of the person who has given them to her and her thoughts are gone back now to the moment when they were put into her hands
No else why should she have cared to have earrings rather than anything else
And I know that she had longed for earrings from among all the ornaments she could imagine
Little little ears
Arthur had said pretending to pinch them one evening as Hetty sat beside him on the grass without her hat
I wish I had some pretty earrings
she said in a moment almost before she knew what she was sayingthe wish lay so close to her lips it WOULD flutter past them at the slightest breath
And the next dayit was only last weekArthur had ridden over to Rosseter on purpose to buy them
That little wish so naively uttered seemed to him the prettiest bit of childishness he had never heard anything like it before and he had wrapped the box up in a great many covers that he might see Hetty unwrapping it with growing curiosity till at last her eyes flashed back their new delight into his
No she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at the earrings for now she is taking them out of the box not to press them to her lips but to fasten them in her earsonly for one moment to see how pretty they look as she peeps at them in the glass against the wall with first one position of the head and then another like a listening bird
It is impossible to be wise on the subject of earrings as one looks at her what should those delicate pearls and crystals be made for if not for such ears
One cannot even find fault with the tiny round hole which they leave when they are taken out perhaps waternixies and such lovely things without souls have these little round holes in their ears by nature ready to hang jewels in
And Hetty must be one of them it is too painful to think that she is a woman with a womans destiny before hera woman spinning in young ignorance a light web of folly and vain hopes which may one day close round her and press upon her a rancorous poisoned garment changing all at once her fluttering trivial butterfly sensations into a life of deep human anguish
But she cannot keep in the earrings long else she may make her uncle and aunt wait
She puts them quickly into the box again and shuts them up
Some day she will be able to wear any earrings she likes and already she lives in an invisible world of brilliant costumes shimmering gauze soft satin and velvet such as the ladys maid at the Chase has shown her in Miss Lydias wardrobe
She feels the bracelets on her arms and treads on a soft carpet in front of a tall mirror
But she has one thing in the drawer which she can venture to wear today because she can hang it on the chain of darkbrown berries which she has been used to wear on grand days with a tiny flat scentbottle at the end of it tucked inside her frock and she must put on her brown berries her neck would look so unfinished without it
Hetty was not quite as fond of the locket as of the earrings though it was a handsome large locket with enamelled flowers at the back and a beautiful gold border round the glass which showed a lightbrown slightly waving lock forming a background for two little dark rings
She must keep it under her clothes and no one would see it
But Hetty had another passion only a little less strong than her love of finery and that other passion made her like to wear the locket even hidden in her bosom
She would always have worn it if she had dared to encounter her aunts questions about a ribbon round her neck
So now she slipped it on along her chain of darkbrown berries and snapped the chain round her neck
It was not a very long chain only allowing the locket to hang a little way below the edge of her frock
And now she had nothing to do but to put on her long sleeves her new white gauze neckerchief and her straw hat trimmed with white today instead of the pink which had become rather faded under the July sun
That hat made the drop of bitterness in Hettys cup today for it was not quite neweverybody would see that it was a little tanned against the white ribbonand Mary Burge she felt sure would have a new hat or bonnet on
She looked for consolation at her fine white cotton stockings they really were very nice indeed and she had given almost all her spare money for them
Hettys dream of the future could not make her insensible to triumph in the present
To be sure Captain Donnithorne loved her so that he would never care about looking at other people but then those other people didnt know how he loved her and she was not satisfied to appear shabby and insignificant in their eyes even for a short space
The whole party was assembled in the houseplace when Hetty went down all of course in their Sunday clothes and the bells had been ringing so this morning in honour of the captains twenty first birthday and the work had all been got done so early that Marty and Tommy were not quite easy in their minds until their mother had assured them that going to church was not part of the days festivities
Mr Poyser had once suggested that the house should be shut up and left to take care of itself for said he theres no danger of anybodys breaking ineverybodyll be at the Chase thieves an all
If we lock th house up all the men can go its a day they wonna see twice i their lives
But Mrs Poyser answered with great decision I never left the house to take care of itself since I was a missis and I never will
Theres been illlooking tramps enoo about the place this last week to carry off every ham an every spoon wen got and they all collogue together them tramps as its a mercy they hanna come and poisoned the dogs and murdered us all in our beds afore we knowed some Friday night when wen got the money in th house to pay the men
And its like enough the tramps know where were going as well as we do oursens for if Old Harry wants any work done you may be sure hell find the means
Nonsense about murdering us in our beds said Mr Poyser Ive got a gun i our room hanna I
and theest got ears as ud find it out if a mouse was gnawing the bacon
Howiver if thee wouldstna be easy Alick can stay at home i the forepart o the day and Tim can come back towrds five oclock and let Alick have his turn
They may let Growler loose if anybody offers to do mischief and theres Alicks dog too ready enough to set his tooth in a tramp if Alick gives him a wink
Mrs Poyser accepted this compromise but thought it advisable to bar and bolt to the utmost and now at the last moment before starting Nancy the dairymaid was closing the shutters of the houseplace although the window lying under the immediate observation of Alick and the dogs might have been supposed the least likely to be selected for a burglarious attempt
The covered cart without springs was standing ready to carry the whole family except the menservants
Mr Poyser and the grandfather sat on the seat in front and within there was room for all the women and children the fuller the cart the better because then the jolting would not hurt so much and Nancys broad person and thick arms were an excellent cushion to be pitched on
But Mr Poyser drove at no more than a walking pace that there might be as little risk of jolting as possible on this warm day and there was time to exchange greetings and remarks with the footpassengers who were going the same way specking the paths between the green meadows and the golden cornfields with bits of movable bright coloura scarlet waistcoat to match the poppies that nodded a little too thickly among the corn or a darkblue neckerchief with ends flaunting across a brandnew white smock frock
All Broxton and all Hayslope were to be at the Chase and make merry there in honour of th heir and the old men and women who had never been so far down this side of the hill for the last twenty years were being brought from Broxton and Hayslope in one of the farmers waggons at Mr Irwines suggestion
The churchbells had struck up again nowa last tune before the ringers came down the hill to have their share in the festival and before the bells had finished other music was heard approaching so that even Old Brown the sober horse that was drawing Mr Poysers cart began to prick up his ears
It was the band of the Benefit Club which had mustered in all its glory that is to say in brightblue scarfs and blue favours and carrying its banner with the motto Let brotherly love continue encircling a picture of a stonepit
The carts of course were not to enter the Chase
Every one must get down at the lodges and the vehicles must be sent back
Why the Chase is like a fair aready said Mrs Poyser as she got down from the cart and saw the groups scattered under the great oaks and the boys running about in the hot sunshine to survey the tall poles surmounted by the fluttering garments that were to be the prize of the successful climbers
I should ha thought there wasna so many people i the two parishes
Mercy on us
How hot it is out o the shade
Come here Totty else your little face ull be burnt to a scratchin
They might ha cooked the dinners i that open space an saved the fires
I shall go to Mrs Bests room an sit down
Stop a bit stop a bit said Mr Poyser
Theres th waggin coming wi th old folks int itll be such a sight as wonna come oer again to see em get down an walk along all together
You remember some on em i their prime eh Father
Aye aye said old Martin walking slowly under the shade of the lodge porch from which he could see the aged party descend
I remember Jacob Taft walking fifty mile after the Scotch raybels when they turned back from Stoniton
He felt himself quite a youngster with a long life before him as he saw the Hayslope patriarch old Feyther Taft descend from the waggon and walk towards him in his brown nigbtcap and leaning on his two sticks
Well Mester Taft shouted old Martin at the utmost stretch of his voicefor though he knew the old man was stone deaf he could not omit the propriety of a greetingyoure hearty yet
You can enjoy yoursen today forall youre ninety an better
Your sarvant mesters your sarvant said Feyther Taft in a treble tone perceiving that he was in company
The aged group under care of sons or daughters themselves worn and grey passed on along the leastwinding carriageroad towards the house where a special table was prepared for them while the Poyser party wisely struck across the grass under the shade of the great trees but not out of view of the housefront with its sloping lawn and flowerbeds or of the pretty striped marquee at the edge of the lawn standing at right angles with two larger marquees on each side of the open green space where the games were to be played
The house would have been nothing but a plain square mansion of Queen Annes time but for the remnant of an old abbey to which it was united at one end in much the same way as one may sometimes see a new farmhouse rising high and prim at the end of older and lower farmoffices
The fine old remnant stood a little backward and under the shadow of tall beeches but the sun was now on the taller and more advanced front the blinds were all down and the house seemed asleep in the hot midday
It made Hetty quite sad to look at it Arthur must be somewhere in the back rooms with the grand company where he could not possibly know that she was come and she should not see him for a long long whilenot till after dinner when they said he was to come up and make a speech
But Hetty was wrong in part of her conjecture
No grand company was come except the Irwines for whom the carriage had been sent early and Arthur was at that moment not in a back room but walking with the rector into the broad stone cloisters of the old abbey where the long tables were laid for all the cottage tenants and the farmservants
A very handsome young Briton he looked to day in high spirits and a brightblue frockcoat the highest modehis arm no longer in a sling
So openlooking and candid too but candid people have their secrets and secrets leave no lines in young faces
Upon my word he said as they entered the cool cloisters I think the cottagers have the best of it these cloisters make a delightful diningroom on a hot day
That was capital advice of yours Irwine about the dinnersto let them be as orderly and comfortable as possible and only for the tenants especially as I had only a limited sum after all for though my grandfather talked of a carte blanche he couldnt make up his mind to trust me when it came to the point
Never mind youll give more pleasure in this quiet way said Mr Irwine
In this sort of thing people are constantly confounding liberality with riot and disorder
It sounds very grand to say that so many sheep and oxen were roasted whole and everybody ate who liked to come but in the end it generally happens that no one has had an enjoyable meal
If the people get a good dinner and a moderate quantity of ale in the middle of the day theyll be able to enjoy the games as the day cools
You cant hinder some of them from getting too much towards evening but drunkenness and darkness go better together than drunkenness and daylight
Well I hope there wont be much of it
Ive kept the Treddleston people away by having a feast for them in the town and Ive got Casson and Adam Bede and some other good fellows to look to the giving out of ale in the booths and to take care things dont go too far
Come let us go up above now and see the dinnertables for the large tenants
They went up the stone staircase leading simply to the long gallery above the cloisters a gallery where all the dusty worthless old pictures had been banished for the last three generationsmouldy portraits of Queen Elizabeth and her ladies General Monk with his eye knocked out Daniel very much in the dark among the lions and Julius Caesar on horseback with a high nose and laurel crown holding his Commentaries in his hand
What a capital thing it is that they saved this piece of the old abbey
said Arthur
If Im ever master here I shall do up the gallery in firstrate style
Weve got no room in the house a third as large as this
That second table is for the farmers wives and children Mrs Best said it would be more comfortable for the mothers and children to be by themselves
I was determined to have the children and make a regular family thing of it
I shall be the old squire to those little lads and lasses some day and theyll tell their children what a much finer young fellow I was than my own son
Theres a table for the women and children below as well
But you will see them allyou will come up with me after dinner I hope
Yes to be sure said Mr Irwine
I wouldnt miss your maiden speech to the tenantry
And there will be something else youll like to hear said Arthur
Let us go into the library and Ill tell you all about it while my grandfather is in the drawingroom with the ladies
Something that will surpsise you he continued as they sat down
My grandfather has come round after all
What about Adam
Yes I should have ridden over to tell you about it only I was so busy
You know I told you I had quite given up arguing the matter with himI thought it was hopelessbut yesterday morning he asked me to come in here to him before I went out and astonished me by saying that he had decided on all the new arrangements he should make in consequence of old Satchell being obliged to lay by work and that he intended to employ Adam in superintending the woods at a salary of a guinea aweek and the use of a pony to be kept here
I believe the secret of it is he saw from the first it would be a profitable plan but he had some particular dislike of Adam to get overand besides the fact that I propose a thing is generally a reason with him for rejecting it
Theres the most curious contradiction in my grandfather I know he means to leave me all the money he has saved and he is likely enough to have cut off poor Aunt Lydia who has been a slave to him all her life with only five hundred ayear for the sake of giving me all the more and yet I sometimes think he positively hates me because Im his heir
I believe if I were to break my neck he would feel it the greatest misfortune that could befall him and yet it seems a pleasure to him to make my life a series of petty annoyances
Ah my boy it is not only womans love that is two greek words omitted as old AEschylus calls it
Theres plenty of unloving love in the world of a masculine kind
But tell me about Adam
Has he accepted the post
I dont see that it can be much more profitable than his present work though to be sure it will leave him a good deal of time on his own hands
Well I felt some doubt about it when I spoke to him and he seemed to hesitate at first
His objection was that he thought he should not be able to satisfy my grandfather
But I begged him as a personal favour to me not to let any reason prevent him from accepting the place if he really liked the employment and would not be giving up anything that was more profitable to him
And he assured me he should like it of all thingsit would be a great step forward for him in business and it would enable him to do what he had long wished to do to give up working for Burge
He says he shall have plenty of time to superintend a little business of his own which he and Seth will carry on and will perhaps be able to enlarge by degrees
So he has agreed at last and I have arranged that he shall dine with the large tenants today and I mean to announce the appointment to them and ask them to drink Adams health
Its a little drama Ive got up in honour of my friend Adam
Hes a fine fellow and I like the opportunity of letting people know that I think so
A drama in which friend Arthur piques himself on having a pretty part to play said Mr Irwine smiling
But when he saw Arthur colour he went on relentingly My part you know is always that of the old fogy who sees nothing to admire in the young folks
I dont like to admit that Im proud of my pupil when he does graceful things
But I must play the amiable old gentleman for once and second your toast in honour of Adam
Has your grandfather yielded on the other point too and agreed to have a respectable man as steward
Oh no said Arthur rising from his chair with an air of impatience and walking along the room with his hands in his pockets
Hes got some project or other about letting the Chase Farm and bargaining for a supply of milk and butter for the house
But I ask no questions about itit makes me too angry
I believe he means to do all the business himself and have nothing in the shape of a steward
Its amazing what energy he has though
Well well go to the ladies now said Mr Irwine rising too
I want to tell my mother what a splendid throne youve prepared for her under the marquee
Yes and we must be going to luncheon too said Arthur
It must be two oclock for there is the gong beginning to sound for the tenants dinners
Chapter XXIII DinnerTime WHEN Adam heard that he was to dine upstairs with the large tenants he felt rather uncomfortable at the idea of being exalted in this way above his mother and Seth who were to dine in the cloisters below
But Mr Mills the butler assured him that Captain Donnithorne had given particular orders about it and would be very angry if Adam was not there
Adam nodded and went up to Seth who was standing a few yards off
Seth lad he said the captain has sent to say Im to dine upstairshe wishes it particular Mr Mills says so I suppose it ud be behaving ill for me not to go
But I dont like sitting up above thee and mother as if I was better than my own flesh and blood
Theet not take it unkind I hope
Nay nay lad said Seth thy honours our honour and if thee getst respect theest won it by thy own deserts
The further I see thee above me the better so long as thee feelst like a brother to me
Its because o thy being appointed over the woods and its nothing but whats right
Thats a place o trust and theet above a common workman now
Aye said Adam but nobody knows a word about it yet
I havent given notice to Mr Burge about leaving him and I dont like to tell anybody else about it before he knows for hell be a good bit hurt I doubt
People ull be wondering to see me there and theyll like enough be guessing the reason and asking questions for theres been so much talk up and down about my having the place this last three weeks
Well thee canst say thee wast ordered to come without being told the reason
Thats the truth
And mother ull be fine and joyful about it
Lets go and tell her
Adam was not the only guest invited to come upstairs on other grounds than the amount he contributed to the rentroll
There were other people in the two parishes who derived dignity from their functions rather than from their pocket and of these Bartle Massey was one
His lame walk was rather slower than usual on this warm day so Adam lingered behind when the bell rang for dinner that he might walk up with his old friend for he was a little too shy to join the Poyser party on this public occasion
Opportunities of getting to Hettys side would be sure to turn up in the course of the day and Adam contented himself with that for he disliked any risk of being joked about Hettythe big outspoken fearless man was very shy and diffident as to his love making
Well Mester Massey said Adam as Bartle came up Im going to dine upstairs with you today the captains sent me orders
Ah
said Bartle pausing with one hand on his back
Then theres something in the windtheres something in the wind
Have you heard anything about what the old squire means to do
Why yes said Adam Ill tell you what I know because I believe you can keep a still tongue in your head if you like and I hope youll not let drop a word till its common talk for Ive particular reasons against its being known
Trust to me my boy trust to me
Ive got no wife to worm it out of me and then run out and cackle it in everybodys hearing
If you trust a man let him be a bachelorlet him be a bachelor
Well then it was so far settled yesterday that Im to take the management o the woods
The captain sent for me t offer it me when I was seeing to the poles and things here and Ive agreed tot
But if anybody asks any questions upstairs just you take no notice and turn the talk to something else and Ill be obliged to you
Now let us go on for were pretty nigh the last I think
I know what to do never fear said Bartle moving on
The news will be good sauce to my dinner
Aye aye my boy youll get on
Ill back you for an eye at measuring and a headpiece for figures against any man in this county and youve had good teachingyouve had good teaching
When they got upstairs the question which Arthur had left unsettled as to who was to be president and who vice was still under discussion so that Adams entrance passed without remark
It stands to sense Mr Casson was saying as old Mr Poyser as is th oldest man i the room should sit at top o the table
I wasnt butler fifteen year without learning the rights and the wrongs about dinner
Nay nay said old Martin In gien up to my son Im no tenant now let my son take my place
Th ould foulks ha had their turn they mun make way for the young uns
I should ha thought the biggest tenant had the best right more nor th oldest said Luke Britton who was not fond of the critical Mr Poyser theres Mester Holdsworth has more land nor anybody else on th estate
Well said Mr Poyser suppose we say the man wi the foulest land shall sit at top then whoever gets th honour therell be no envying on him
Eh heres Mester Massey said Mr Craig who being a neutral in the dispute had no interest but in conciliation the schoolmaster ought to be able to tell you whats right
Whos to sit at top o the table Mr
Massey
Why the broadest man said Bartle and then he wont take up other folks room and the next broadest must sit at bottom
This happy mode of settling the dispute produced much laughtera smaller joke would have sufficed for that Mr Casson however did not feel it compatible with his dignity and superior knowledge to join in the laugh until it turned out that he was fixed on as the second broadest man
Martin Poyser the younger as the broadest was to be president and Mr Casson as next broadest was to be vice
Owing to this arrangement Adam being of course at the bottom of the table fell under the immediate observation of Mr Casson who too much occupied with the question of precedence had not hitherto noticed his entrance
Mr Casson we have seen considered Adam rather lifted up and pepperylike he thought the gentry made more fuss about this young carpenter than was necessary they made no fuss about Mr Casson although he had been an excellent butler for fifteen years
Well Mr Bede youre one o them as mounts hupards apace he said when Adam sat down
Youve niver dined here before as I remember
No Mr Casson said Adam in his strong voice that could be heard along the table Ive never dined here before but I come by Captain Donnithornes wish and I hope its not disagreeable to anybody here
Nay nay said several voices at once were glad yere come
Whos got anything to say again it
And yell sing us Over the hills and far away after dinner wonna ye
said Mr Chowne
Thats a song Im uncommon fond on
Peeh
said Mr Craig its not to be named by side o the Scotch tunes
Ive never cared about singing myself Ive had something better to do
A man thats got the names and the natur o plants ins head isna likely to keep a hollow place t hold tunes in
But a second cousin o mine a drovier was a rare hand at remembering the Scotch tunes
Hed got nothing else to think on
The Scotch tunes
said Bartle Massey contemptuously Ive heard enough o the Scotch tunes to last me while I live
Theyre fit for nothing but to frighten the birds withthats to say the English birds for the Scotch birds may sing Scotch for what I know
Give the lads a bagpipe instead of a rattle and Ill answer for it the corn ll be safe
Yes theres folks as find a pleasure in undervallying what they know but little about said Mr Craig
Why the Scotch tunes are just like a scolding nagging woman Bartle went on without deigning to notice Mr Craigs remark
They go on with the same thing over and over again and never come to a reasonable end
Anybody ud think the Scotch tunes had always been asking a question of somebody as deaf as old Taft and had never got an answer yet
Adam minded the less about sitting by Mr Casson because this position enabled him to see Hetty who was not far off him at the next table
Hetty however had not even noticed his presence yet for she was giving angry attention to Totty who insisted on drawing up her feet on to the bench in antique fashion and thereby threatened to make dusty marks on Hettys pinkandwhite frock
No sooner were the little fat legs pushed down than up they came again for Tottys eyes were too busy in staring at the large dishes to see where the plum pudding was for her to retain any consciousness of her legs
Hetty got quite out of patience and at last with a frown and pout and gathering tears she said Oh dear Aunt I wish youd speak to Totty she keeps putting her legs up so and messing my frock
Whats the matter wi the child
She can niver please you said the mother
Let her come by the side o me then
I can put up wi her
Adam was looking at Hetty and saw the frown and pout and the dark eyes seeming to grow larger with pettish halfgathered tears
Quiet Mary Burge who sat near enough to see that Hetty was cross and that Adams eyes were fixed on her thought that so sensible a man as Adam must be reflecting on the small value of beauty in a woman whose temper was bad
Mary was a good girl not given to indulge in evil feelings but she said to herself that since Hetty had a bad temper it was better Adam should know it
And it was quite true that if Hetty had been plain she would have looked very ugly and unamiable at that moment and no ones moral judgment upon her would have been in the least beguiled
But really there was something quite charming in her pettishness it looked so much more like innocent distress than ill humour and the severe Adam felt no movement of disapprobation he only felt a sort of amused pity as if he had seen a kitten setting up its back or a little bird with its feathers ruffled
He could not gather what was vexing her but it was impossible to him to feel otherwise than that she was the prettiest thing in the world and that if he could have his way nothing should ever vex her any more
And presently when Totty was gone she caught his eye and her face broke into one of its brightest smiles as she nodded to him
It was a bit of flirtationshe knew Mary Burge was looking at them
But the smile was like wine to Adam
Chapter XXIV The HealthDrinking WHEN the dinner was over and the first draughts from the great cask of birthday ale were brought up room was made for the broad Mr Poyser at the side of the table and two chairs were placed at the head
It had been settled very definitely what Mr Poyser was to do when the young squire should appear and for the last five minutes he had been in a state of abstraction with his eyes fixed on the dark picture opposite and his hands busy with the loose cash and other articles in his breeches pockets
When the young squire entered with Mr Irwine by his side every one stood up and this moment of homage was very agreeable to Arthur
He liked to feel his own importance and besides that he cared a great deal for the goodwill of these people he was fond of thinking that they had a hearty special regard for him
The pleasure he felt was in his face as he said My grandfather and I hope all our friends here have enjoyed their dinner and find my birthday ale good
Mr Irwine and I are come to taste it with you and I am sure we shall all like anything the better that the rector shares with us
All eyes were now turned on Mr Poyser who with his hands still busy in his pockets began with the deliberateness of a slow striking clock
Captain my neighbours have put it upo me to speak for em today for where folks think pretty much alike one spokesmans as good as a score
And though weve mayhappen got contrairy ways o thinking about a many thingsone man lays down his land one way an another anotheran Ill not take it upon me to speak to no mans farming but my ownthis Ill say as were all o one mind about our young squire
Weve pretty nigh all on us known you when you war a little un an weve niver known anything on you but what was good an honorable
You speak fair an y act fair an were joyful when we look forrard to your being our landlord for we blieve you mean to do right by everybody an ull make no mans bread bitter to him if you can help it
Thats what I mean an thats what we all mean and when a mans said what he means hed better stop for th ale ull be none the better for stannin
An Ill not say how we like th ale yet for we couldna well taste it till wed drunk your health in it but the dinner was good an if theres anybody hasna enjoyed it it must be the fault of his own inside
An as for the rectors company its well known as thats welcome t all the parish wherever he may be an I hope an we all hope as hell live to see us old folks an our children grown to men an women an Your Honour a family man
Ive no more to say as concerns the present time an so well drink our young squires healththree times three
Hereupon a glorious shouting a rapping a jingling a clattering and a shouting with plentiful da capo pleasanter than a strain of sublimest music in the ears that receive such a tribute for the first time
Arthur had felt a twinge of conscience during Mr Poysers speech but it was too feeble to nullify the pleasure he felt in being praised
Did he not deserve what was said of him on the whole
If there was something in his conduct that Poyser wouldnt have liked if he had known it why no mans conduct will bear too close an inspection and Poyser was not likely to know it and after all what had he done
Gone a little too far perhaps in flirtation but another man in his place would have acted much worse and no harm would comeno harm should come for the next time he was alone with Hetty he would explain to her that she must not think seriously of him or of what had passed
It was necessary to Arthur you perceive to be satisfied with himself
Uncomfortable thoughts must be got rid of by good intentions for the future which can be formed so rapidly that he had time to be uncomfortable and to become easy again before Mr Poysers slow speech was finished and when it was time for him to speak he was quite lighthearted
I thank you all my good friends and neighbours Arthur said for the good opinion of me and the kind feelings towards me which Mr Poyser has been expressing on your behalf and on his own and it will always be my heartiest wish to deserve them
In the course of things we may expect that if I live I shall one day or other be your landlord indeed it is on the ground of that expectation that my grandfather has wished me to celebrate this day and to come among you now and I look forward to this position not merely as one of power and pleasure for myself but as a means of benefiting my neighbours
It hardly becomes so young a man as I am to talk much about farming to you who are most of you so much older and are men of experience still I have interested myself a good deal in such matters and learned as much about them as my opportunities have allowed and when the course of events shall place the estate in my hands it will be my first desire to afford my tenants all the encouragement a landlord can give them in improving their land and trying to bring about a better practice of husbandry
It will be my wish to be looked on by all my deserving tenants as their best friend and nothing would make me so happy as to be able to respect every man on the estate and to be respected by him in return
It is not my place at present to enter into particulars I only meet your good hopes concerning me by telling you that my own hopes correspond to them that what you expect from me I desire to fulfil and I am quite of Mr Poysers opinion that when a man has said what he means he had better stop
But the pleasure I feel in having my own health drunk by you would not be perfect if we did not drink the health of my grandfather who has filled the place of both parents to me
I will say no more until you have joined me in drinking his health on a day when he has wished me to appear among you as the future representative of his name and family
Perhaps there was no one present except Mr Irwine who thoroughly understood and approved Arthurs graceful mode of proposing his grandfathers health
The farmers thought the young squire knew well enough that they hated the old squire and Mrs Poyser said hed better not ha stirred a kettle o sour broth
The bucolic mind does not readily apprehend the refinements of good taste
But the toast could not be rejected and when it had been drunk Arthur said I thank you both for my grandfather and myself and now there is one more thing I wish to tell you that you may share my pleasure about it as I hope and believe you will
I think there can be no man here who has not a respect and some of you I am sure have a very high regard for my friend Adam Bede
It is well known to every one in this neighbourhood that there is no man whose word can be more depended on than his that whatever he undertakes to do he does well and is as careful for the interests of those who employ him as for his own
Im proud to say that I was very fond of Adam when I was a little boy and I have never lost my old feeling for himI think that shows that I know a good fellow when I find him
It has long been my wish that he should have the management of the woods on the estate which happen to be very valuable not only because I think so highly of his character but because he has the knowledge and the skill which fit him for the place
And I am happy to tell you that it is my grandfathers wish too and it is now settled that Adam shall manage the woodsa change which I am sure will be very much for the advantage of the estate and I hope you will by and by join me in drinking his health and in wishing him all the prosperity in life that he deserves
But there is a still older friend of mine than Adam Bede present and I need not tell you that it is Mr Irwine
Im sure you will agree with me that we must drink no other persons health until we have drunk his
I know you have all reason to love him but no one of his parishioners has so much reason as I
Come charge your glasses and let us drink to our excellent rectorthree times three
This toast was drunk with all the enthusiasm that was wanting to the last and it certainly was the most picturesque moment in the scene when Mr Irwine got up to speak and all the faces in the room were turned towards him
The superior refinement of his face was much more striking than that of Arthurs when seen in comparison with the people round them
Arthurs was a much commoner British face and the splendour of his newfashioned clothes was more akin to the young farmers taste in costume than Mr Irwines powder and the wellbrushed but wellworn black which seemed to be his chosen suit for great occasions for he had the mysterious secret of never wearing a newlooking coat
This is not the first time by a great many he said that I have had to thank my parishioners for giving me tokens of their goodwill but neighbourly kindness is among those things that are the more precious the older they get
Indeed our pleasant meeting today is a proof that when what is good comes of age and is likely to live there is reason for rejoicing and the relation between us as clergyman and parishioners came of age two years ago for it is threeandtwenty years since I first came among you and I see some tall finelooking young men here as well as some blooming young women that were far from looking as pleasantly at me when I christened them as I am happy to see them looking now
But Im sure you will not wonder when I say that among all those young men the one in whom I have the strongest interest is my friend Mr Arthur Donnithorne for whom you have just expressed your regard
I had the pleasure of being his tutor for several years and have naturally had opportunities of knowing him intimately which cannot have occurred to any one else who is present and I have some pride as well as pleasure in assuring you that I share your high hopes concerning him and your confidence in his possession of those qualities which will make him an excellent landlord when the time shall come for him to take that important position among you
We feel alike on most matters on which a man who is getting towards fifty can feel in common with a young man of oneandtwenty and he has just been expressing a feeling which I share very heartily and I would not willingly omit the opportunity of saying so
That feeling is his value and respect for Adam Bede
People in a high station are of course more thought of and talked about and have their virtues more praised than those whose lives are passed in humble everyday work but every sensible man knows how necessary that humble everyday work is and how important it is to us that it should be done well
And I agree with my friend Mr Arthur Donnithorne in feeling that when a man whose duty lies in that sort of work shows a character which would make him an example in any station his merit should be acknowledged
He is one of those to whom honour is due and his friends should delight to honour him
I know Adam Bede wellI know what he is as a workman and what he has been as a son and brotherand I am saying the simplest truth when I say that I respect him as much as I respect any man living
But I am not speaking to you about a stranger some of you are his intimate friends and I believe there is not one here who does not know enough of him to join heartily in drinking his health
As Mr Irwine paused Arthur jumped up and filling his glass said A bumper to Adam Bede and may he live to have sons as faithful and clever as himself
No hearer not even Bartle Massey was so delighted with this toast as Mr Poyser
Tough work as his first speech had been he would have started up to make another if he had not known the extreme irregularity of such a course
As it was he found an outlet for his feeling in drinking his ale unusually fast and setting down his glass with a swing of his arm and a determined rap
If Jonathan Burge and a few others felt less comfortable on the occasion they tried their best to look contented and so the toast was drunk with a goodwill apparently unanimous
Adam was rather paler than usual when he got up to thank his friends
He was a good deal moved by this public tributevery naturally for he was in the presence of all his little world and it was uniting to do him honour
But he felt no shyness about speaking not being troubled with small vanity or lack of words he looked neither awkward nor embarrassed but stood in his usual firm upright attitude with his head thrown a little backward and his hands perfectly still in that rough dignity which is peculiar to intelligent honest wellbuilt workmen who are never wondering what is their business in the world
Im quite taken by surprise he said
I didnt expect anything o this sort for its a good deal more than my wages
But Ive the more reason to be grateful to you Captain and to you Mr Irwine and to all my friends here whove drunk my health and wished me well
It ud be nonsense for me to be saying I dont at all deserve th opinion you have of me that ud be poor thanks to you to say that youve known me all these years and yet havent sense enough to find out a great deal o the truth about me
You think if I undertake to do a bit o work Ill do it well be my pay big or littleand thats true
Id be ashamed to stand before you here if it wasna true
But it seems to me thats a mans plain duty and nothing to be conceited about and its pretty clear to me as Ive never done more than my duty for let us do what we will its only making use o the sperrit and the powers that ha been given to us
And so this kindness o yours Im sure is no debt you owe me but a free gift and as such I accept it and am thankful
And as to this new employment Ive taken in hand Ill only say that I took it at Captain Donnithornes desire and that Ill try to fulfil his expectations
Id wish for no better lot than to work under him and to know that while I was getting my own bread I was taking care of his intrests
For I believe hes one o those gentlemen as wishes to do the right thing and to leave the world a bit better than he found it which its my belief every man may do whether hes gentle or simple whether he sets a good bit o work going and finds the money or whether he does the work with his own hands
Theres no occasion for me to say any more about what I feel towards him I hope to show it through the rest o my life in my actions
There were various opinions about Adams speech some of the women whispered that he didnt show himself thankful enough and seemed to speak as proud as could be but most of the men were of opinion that nobody could speak more straightforard and that Adam was as fine a chap as need to be
While such observations were being buzzed about mingled with wonderings as to what the old squire meant to do for a bailiff and whether he was going to have a steward the two gentlemen had risen and were walking round to the table where the wives and children sat
There was none of the strong ale here of course but wine and dessert sparkling gooseberry for the young ones and some good sherry for the mothers
Mrs Poyser was at the head of this table and Totty was now seated in her lap bending her small nose deep down into a wineglass in search of the nuts floating there
How do you do Mrs
Poyser
said Arthur
Werent you pleased to hear your husband make such a good speech today
Oh sir the men are mostly so tonguetiedyoure forced partly to guess what they mean as you do wi the dumb creaturs
What
you think you could have made it better for him
said Mr Irwine laughing
Well sir when I want to say anything I can mostly find words to say it in thank God
Not as Im afinding faut wi my husband for if hes a man o few words what he says hell stand to
Im sure I never saw a prettier party than this Arthur said looking round at the applecheeked children
My aunt and the Miss Irwines will come up and see you presently
They were afraid of the noise of the toasts but it would be a shame for them not to see you at table
He walked on speaking to the mothers and patting the children while Mr Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and nodding at a distance that no ones attention might be disturbed from the young squire the hero of the day
Arthur did not venture to stop near Hetty but merely bowed to her as he passed along the opposite side
The foolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent neglect even when she knows it to be the mask of love
Hetty thought this was going to be the most miserable day she had had for a long while a moment of chill daylight and reality came across her dream Arthur who had seemed so near to her only a few hours before was separated from her as the hero of a great procession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd
Chapter XXV The Games THE great dance was not to begin until eight oclock but for any lads and lasses who liked to dance on the shady grass before then there was music always at handfor was not the band of the Benefit Club capable of playing excellent jigs reels and hornpipes
And besides this there was a grand band hired from Rosseter who with their wonderful windinstruments and puffed out cheeks were themselves a delightful show to the small boys and girls
To say nothing of Joshua Ranns fiddle which by an act of generous forethought he had provided himself with in case any one should be of sufficiently pure taste to prefer dancing to a solo on that instrument
Meantime when the sun had moved off the great open space in front of the house the games began
There were of course wellsoaped poles to be climbed by the boys and youths races to be run by the old women races to be run in sacks heavy weights to be lifted by the strong men and a long list of challenges to such ambitious attempts as that of walking as many yards possible on one leg feats in which it was generally remarked that Wiry Ben being the lissomst springest fellow i the country was sure to be pre eminent
To crown all there was to be a donkeyracethat sublimest of all races conducted on the grand socialistic idea of everybody encouraging everybody elses donkey and the sorriest donkey winning
And soon after four o ciock splendid old Mrs Irwine in her damask satin and jewels and black lace was led out by Arthur followed by the whole family party to her raised seat under the striped marquee where she was to give out the prizes to the victors
Staid formal Miss Lydia had requested to resign that queenly office to the royal old lady and Arthur was pleased with this opportunity of gratifying his godmothers taste for stateliness
Old Mr Donnithorne the delicately clean finely scented withered old man led out Miss Irwine with his air of punctilious acid politeness Mr Gawaine brought Miss Lydia looking neutral and stiff in an elegant peachblossom silk and Mr Irwine came last with his pale sister Anne
No other friend of the family besides Mr Gawaine was invited today there was to be a grand dinner for the neighbouring gentry on the morrow but today all the forces were required for the entertainment of the tenants
There was a sunk fence in front of the marquee dividing the lawn from the park but a temporary bridge had been made for the passage of the victors and the groups of people standing or seated here and there on benches stretched on each side of the open space from the white marquees up to the sunk fence
Upon my word its a pretty sight said the old lady in her deep voice when she was seated and looked round on the bright scene with its darkgreen background and its the last feteday Im likely to see unless you make haste and get married Arthur
But take care you get a charming bride else I would rather die without seeing her
Youre so terribly fastidious Godmother said Arthur Im afraid I should never satisfy you with my choice
Well I wont forgive you if shes not handsome
I cant be put off with amiability which is always the excuse people are making for the existence of plain people
And she must not be silly that will never do because youll want managing and a silly woman cant manage you
Who is that tall young man Dauphin with the mild face
There standing without his hat and taking such care of that tall old woman by the side of himhis mother of course
I like to see that
What dont you know him Mother
said Mr Irwine
That is Seth Bede Adams brothera Methodist but a very good fellow
Poor Seth has looked rather downhearted of late I thought it was because of his fathers dying in that sad way but Joshua Rann tells me he wanted to marry that sweet little Methodist preacher who was here about a month ago and I suppose she refused him
Ah I remember hearing about her
But there are no end of people here that I dont know for theyre grown up and altered so since I used to go about
What excellent sight you have
said old Mr Donnithorne who was holding a double glass up to his eyes to see the expression of that young mans face so far off
His face is nothing but a pale blurred spot to me
But I fancy I have the advantage of you when we come to look close
I can read small print without spectacles
Ah my dear sir you began with being very nearsighted and those nearsighted eyes always wear the best
I want very strong spectacles to read with but then I think my eyes get better and better for things at a distance
I suppose if I could live another fifty years I should be blind to everything that wasnt out of other peoples sight like a man who stands in a well and sees nothing but the stars
See said Arthur the old women are ready to set out on their race now
Which do you bet on Gawaine
The longlegged one unless theyre going to have several heats and then the little wiry one may win
There are the Poysers Mother not far off on the right hand said Miss Irwine
Mrs Poyser is looking at you
Do take notice of her
To be sure I will said the old lady giving a gracious bow to Mrs Poyser
A woman who sends me such excellent creamcheese is not to be neglected
Bless me
What a fat child that is she is holding on her knee
But who is that pretty girl with dark eyes
That is Hetty Sorrel said Miss Lydia Donnithorne Martin Poysers niecea very likely young person and welllooking too
My maid has taught her fine needlework and she has mended some lace of mine very respectably indeedvery respectably
Why she has lived with the Poysers six or seven years Mother you must have seen her said Miss Irwine
No Ive never seen her childat least not as she is now said Mrs Irwine continuing to look at Hetty
Welllooking indeed
Shes a perfect beauty
Ive never seen anything so pretty since my young days
What a pity such beauty as that should be thrown away among the farmers when its wanted so terribly among the good families without fortune
I daresay now shell marry a man who would have thought her just as pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair
Arthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs Irwine was speaking of her
He feigned not to hear and to be occupied with something on the opposite side
But he saw her plainly enough without looking saw her in heightened beauty because he heard her beauty praisedfor other mens opinion you know was like a native climate to Arthurs feelings it was the air on which they thrived the best and grew strong
Yes
She was enough to turn any mans head any man in his place would have done and felt the same
And to give her up after all as he was determined to do would be an act that he should always look back upon with pride
No Mother and Mr Irwine replying to her last words I cant agree with you there
The common people are not quite so stupid as you imagine
The commonest man who has his ounce of sense and feeling is conscious of the difference between a lovely delicate woman and a coarse one
Even a dog feels a difference in their presence
The man may be no better able than the dog to explain the influence the more refined beauty has on him but he feels it
Bless me Dauphin what does an old bachelor like you know about it
Oh that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than married men because they have time for more general contemplation
Your fine critic of woman must never shackle his judgment by calling one woman his own
But as an example of what I was saying that pretty Methodist preacher I mentioned just now told me that she had preached to the roughest miners and had never been treated with anything but the utmost respect and kindness by them
The reason isthough she doesnt know itthat theres so much tenderness refinement and purity about her
Such a woman as that brings with her airs from heaven that the coarsest fellow is not insensible to
Heres a delicate bit of womanhood or girlhood coming to receive a prize I suppose said Mr Gawaine
She must be one of the racers in the sacks who had set off before we came
The bit of womanhood was our old acquaintance Bessy Cranage otherwise Chads Bess whose large red cheeks and blowsy person had undergone an exaggeration of colour which if she had happened to be a heavenly body would have made her sublime
Bessy I am sorry to say had taken to her earrings again since Dinahs departure and was otherwise decked out in such small finery as she could muster
Any one who could have looked into poor Bessys heart would have seen a striking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and Hettys
The advantage perhaps would have been on Bessys side in the matter of feeling
But then you see they were so very different outside
You would have been inclined to box Bessys ears and you would have longed to kiss Hetty
Bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race partly from mere hedonish gaiety partly because of the prize
Some one had said there were to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes and she approached the marquee fanning herself with her handkerchief but with exultation sparkling in her round eyes
Here is the prize for the first sackrace said Miss Lydia taking a large parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and giving it to Mrs Irwine before Bessy came up an excellent grogram gown and a piece of flannel
You didnt think the winner was to be so young I suppose Aunt
said Arthur
Couldnt you find something else for this girl and save that grimlooking gown for one of the older women
I have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial said Miss Lydia adjusting her own lace I should not think of encouraging a love of finery in young women of that class
I have a scarlet cloak but that is for the old woman who wins
This speech of Miss Lydias produced rather a mocking expression in Mrs Irwines face as she looked at Arthur while Bessy came up and dropped a series of curtsies
This is Bessy Cranage mother said Mr Irwine kindly Chad Cranages daughter
You remember Chad Cranage the blacksmith
Yes to be sure said Mrs Irwine
Well Bessy here is your prizeexcellent warm things for winter
Im sure you have had hard work to win them this warm day
Bessys lip fell as she saw the ugly heavy gownwhich felt so hot and disagreeable too on this July day and was such a great ugly thing to carry
She dropped her curtsies again without looking up and with a growing tremulousness about the corners of her mouth and then turned away
Poor girl said Arthur I think shes disappointed
I wish it had been something more to her taste
Shes a boldlooking young person observed Miss Lydia
Not at all one I should like to encourage
Arthur silently resolved that he would make Bessy a present of money before the day was over that she might buy something more to her mind but she not aware of the consolation in store for her turned out of the open space where she was visible from the marquee and throwing down the odious bundle under a tree began to cryvery much tittered at the while by the small boys
In this situation she was descried by her discreet matronly cousin who lost no time in coming up having just given the baby into her husbands charge
Whats the matter wi ye
said Bess the matron taking up the bundle and examining it
Yen sweltered yoursen I reckon running that fools race
An here theyn gien you lots o good grogram and flannel as should ha been gien by good rights to them as had the sense to keep away from such foolery
Ye might spare me a bit o this grogram to make clothes for the ladye war neer illnatured Bess I neer said that on ye
Ye may take it all for what I care said Bess the maiden with a pettish movement beginning to wipe away her tears and recover herself
Well I could do wit if so be ye want to get rid ont said the disinterested cousin walking quickly away with the bundle lest Chads Bess should change her mind
But that bonnycheeked lass was blessed with an elasticity of spirits that secured her from any rankling grief and by the time the grand climax of the donkeyrace came on her disappointment was entirely lost in the delightful excitement of attempting to stimulate the last donkey by hisses while the boys applied the argument of sticks
But the strength of the donkey mind lies in adopting a course inversely as the arguments urged which well considered requires as great a mental force as the direct sequence and the present donkey proved the firstrate order of his intelligence by coming to a dead standstill just when the blows were thickest
Great was the shouting of the crowd radiant the grinning of Bill Downes the stonesawyer and the fortunate rider of this superior beast which stood calm and stifflegged in the midst of its triumph
Arthur himself had provided the prizes for the men and Bill was made happy with a splendid pocketknife supplied with blades and gimlets enough to make a man at home on a desert island
He had hardly returned from the marquee with the prize in his hand when it began to be understood that Wiry Ben proposed to amuse the company before the gentry went to dinner with an impromptu and gratuitous performancenamely a hornpipe the main idea of which was doubtless borrowed but this was to be developed by the dancer in so peculiar and complex a manner that no one could deny him the praise of originality
Wiry Bens pride in his dancingan accomplishment productive of great effect at the yearly Wakehad needed only slightly elevating by an extra quantity of good ale to convince him that the gentry would be very much struck with his performance of his hornpipe and he had been decidedly encouraged in this idea by Joshua Rann who observed that it was nothing but right to do something to please the young squire in return for what he had done for them
You will be the less surprised at this opinion in so grave a personage when you learn that Ben had requested Mr Rann to accompany him on the fiddle and Joshua felt quite sure that though there might not be much in the dancing the music would make up for it
Adam Bede who was present in one of the large marquees where the plan was being discussed told Ben he had better not make a fool of himselfa remark which at once fixed Bens determination he was not going to let anything alone because Adam Bede turned up his nose at it
Whats this whats this
said old Mr Donnithorne
Is it something youve arranged Arthur
Heres the clerk coming with his fiddle and a smart fellow with a nosegay in his buttonhole
No said Arthur I know nothing about it
By Jove hes going to dance
Its one of the carpentersI forget his name at this moment
Its Ben CranageWiry Ben they call him said Mr Irwine rather a loose fish I think
Anne my dear I see that fiddle scraping is too much for you youre getting tired
Let me take you in now that you may rest till dinner
Miss Anne rose assentingly and the good brother took her away while Joshuas preliminary scrapings burst into the White Cockade from which he intended to pass to a variety of tunes by a series of transitions which his good ear really taught him to execute with some skill
It would have been an exasperating fact to him if he had known it that the general attention was too thoroughly absorbed by Bens dancing for any one to give much heed to the music
Have you ever seen a real English rustic perform a solo dance
Perhaps you have only seen a ballet rustic smiling like a merry countryman in crockery with graceful turns of the haunch and insinuating movements of the head
That is as much like the real thing as the Bird Waltz is like the song of birds
Wiry Ben never smiled he looked as serious as a dancing monkeyas serious as if he had been an experimental philosopher ascertaining in his own person the amount of shaking and the varieties of angularity that could be given to the human limbs
To make amends for the abundant laughter in the striped marquee Arthur clapped his hands continually and cried Bravo
But Ben had one admirer whose eyes followed his movements with a fervid gravity that equalled his own
It was Martin Poyser who was seated on a bench with Tommy between his legs
What dost think o that
he said to his wife
He goes as pat to the music as if he was made o clockwork
I used to be a pretty good un at dancing myself when I was lighter but I could niver ha hit it just to th hair like that
Its little matter what his limbs are to my thinking returned Mrs Poyser
Hes empty enough i the upper story or hed niver come jigging an stamping i that way like a mad grasshopper for the gentry to look at him
Theyre fit to die wi laughing I can see
Well well so much the better it amuses em said Mr Poyser who did not easily take an irritable view of things
But theyre going away now t have their dinner I reckon
Well move about a bit shall we and see what Adam Bedes doing
Hes got to look after the drinking and things I doubt he hasna had much fun
Chapter XXVI The Dance ARTHUR had chosen the entrancehall for the ballroom very wisely for no other room could have heen so airy or would have had the advantage of the wide doors opening into the garden as well as a ready entrance into the other rooms
To be sure a stone floor was not the pleasantest to dance on but then most of the dancers had known what it was to enjoy a Christmas dance on kitchen quarries
It was one of those entrancehalls which make the surrounding rooms look like closetswith stucco angels trumpets and flowerwreaths on the lofty ceiling and great medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the walls alternating with statues in niches
Just the sort of place to be ornamented well with green boughs and Mr Craig had been proud to show his taste and his hothouse plants on the occasion
The broad steps of the stone staircase were covered with cushions to serve as seats for the children who were to stay till halfpast nine with the servant maids to see the dancing and as this dance was confined to the chief tenants there was abundant room for every one
The lights were charmingly disposed in colouredpaper lamps high up among green boughs and the farmers wives and daughters as they peeped in believed no scene could be more splendid they knew now quite well in what sort of rooms the king and queen lived and their thoughts glanced with some pity towards cousins and acquaintances who had not this fine opportunity of knowing how things went on in the great world
The lamps were already lit though the sun had not long set and there was that calm light out of doors in which we seem to see all objects more distinctly than in the broad day
It was a pretty scene outside the house the farmers and their families were moving about the lawn among the flowers and shrubs or along the broad straight road leading from the east front where a carpet of mossy grass spread on each side studded here and there with a dark flatboughed cedar or a grand pyramidal fir sweeping the ground with its branches all tipped with a fringe of paler green
The groups of cottagers in the park were gradually diminishing the young ones being attracted towards the lights that were beginning to gleam from the windows of the gallery in the abbey which was to be their dancingroom and some of the sober elder ones thinking it time to go home quietly
One of these was Lisbeth Bede and Seth went with hernot from filial attention only for his conscience would not let him join in dancing
It had been rather a melancholy day to Seth Dinah had never been more constantly present with him than in this scene where everything was so unlike her
He saw her all the more vividly after looking at the thoughtless faces and gaycoloured dresses of the young womenjust as one feels the beauty and the greatness of a pictured Madonna the more when it has been for a moment screened from us by a vulgar head in a bonnet
But this presence of Dinah in his mind only helped him to bear the better with his mothers mood which had been becoming more and more querulous for the last hour
Poor Lisbeth was suffering from a strange conflict of feelings
Her joy and pride in the honour paid to her darling son Adam was beginning to be worsted in the conflict with the jealousy and fretfulness which had revived when Adam came to tell her that Captain Donnithorne desired him to join the dancers in the hall
Adam was getting more and more out of her reach she wished all the old troubles back again for then it mattered more to Adam what his mother said and did
Eh its fine talkin o dancin she said an thy father not a five week ins grave
An I wish I war there too istid o bein left to take up merrier folkss room above ground
Nay dont look at it i that way Mother said Adam who was determined to be gentle to her today
I dont mean to danceI shall only look on
And since the captain wishes me to be there it ud look as if I thought I knew better than him to say as Id rather not stay
And thee knowst how hes behaved to me today
Eh theet do as thee likst for thy old mothers got no right t hinder thee
Shes nought but th old husk and theest slipped away from her like the ripe nut
Well Mother said Adam Ill go and tell the captain as it hurts thy feelings for me to stay and Id rather go home upo that account he wont take it ill then I daresay and Im willing
He said this with some effort for he really longed to be near Hetty this evening
Nay nay I wonna ha thee do thatthe young squire ull be angered
Go an do what theet ordered to do an me and Seth ull go whome
I know its a grit honour for thee to be so looked onan whos to be prouder on it nor thy mother
Hadna she the cumber o rearin thee an doin for thee all these ears
Well goodbye then Mothergoodbye ladremember Gyp when you get home said Adam turning away towards the gate of the pleasuregrounds where he hoped he might be able to join the Poysers for he had been so occupied throughout the afternoon that he had had no time to speak to Hetty
His eye soon detected a distant group which he knew to be the right one returning to the house along the broad gravel road and he hastened on to meet them
Why Adam Im glad to get sight on y again said Mr Poyser who was carrying Totty on his arm
Youre going t have a bit o fun I hope now your works all done
And heres Hetty has promised no end o partners an Ive just been askin her if shed agreed to dance wi you an she says no
Well I didnt think o dancing tonight said Adam already tempted to change his mind as he looked at Hetty
Nonsense
said Mr Poyser
Why everybodys goin to dance to night all but th old squire and Mrs Irwine
Mrs Bests been tellin us as Miss Lyddy and Miss Irwine ull dance an the young squire ull pick my wife for his first partner t open the ball so shell be forced to dance though shes laid by ever sin the Christmas afore the little un was born
You canna for shame stand still Adam an you a fine young fellow and can dance as well as anybody
Nay nay said Mrs Poyser it ud be unbecomin
I know the dancins nonsense but if you stick at everything because its nonsense you wonna go far i this life
When your broths ready made for you you mun swallow the thickenin or else let the broth alone
Then if Hetty ull dance with me said Adam yielding either to Mrs Poysers argument or to something else Ill dance whichever dance shes free
Ive got no partner for the fourth dance said Hetty Ill dance that with you if you like
Ah said Mr Poyser but you mun dance the first dance Adam else itll look particler
Theres plenty o nice partners to pick an choose from an its hard for the gells when the men stan by and dont ask em
Adam felt the justice of Mr Poysers observation it would not do for him to dance with no one besides Hetty and remembering that Jonathan Burge had some reason to feel hurt today he resolved to ask Miss Mary to dance with him the first dance if she had no other partner
Theres the big clock strikin eight said Mr Poyser we must make haste in now else the squire and the ladies ull be in afore us an that wouldna look well
When they had entered the hall and the three children under Mollys charge had been seated on the stairs the foldingdoors of the drawingroom were thrown open and Arthur entered in his regimentals leading Mrs Irwine to a carpetcovered dais ornamented with hothouse plants where she and Miss Anne were to be seated with old Mr Donnithorne that they might look on at the dancing like the kings and queens in the plays
Arthur had put on his uniform to please the tenants he said who thought as much of his militia dignity as if it had been an elevation to the premiership
He had not the least objection to gratify them in that way his uniform was very advantageous to his figure
The old squire before sitting down walked round the hall to greet the tenants and make polite speeches to the wives he was always polite but the farmers had found out after long puzzling that this polish was one of the signs of hardness
It was observed that he gave his most elaborate civility to Mrs Poyser tonight inquiring particularly about her health recommending her to strengthen herself with cold water as he did and avoid all drugs
Mrs Poyser curtsied and thanked him with great self command but when he had passed on she whispered to her husband Ill lay my life hes brewin some nasty turn against us
Old Harry doesna wag his tail so for nothin
Mr Poyser had no time to answer for now Arthur came up and said Mrs Poyser Im come to request the favour of your hand for the first dance and Mr Poyser you must let me take you to my aunt for she claims you as her partner
The wifes pale cheek flushed with a nervous sense of unwonted honour as Arthur led her to the top of the room but Mr Poyser to whom an extra glass had restored his youthful confidence in his good looks and good dancing walked along with them quite proudly secretly flattering himself that Miss Lydia had never had a partner in HER life who could lift her off the ground as he would
In order to balance the honours given to the two parishes Miss Irwine danced with Luke Britton the largest Broxton farmer and Mr Gawaine led out Mrs Britton
Mr Irwine after seating his sister Anne had gone to the abbey gallery as he had agreed with Arthur beforehand to see how the merriment of the cottagers was prospering
Meanwhile all the less distinguished couples had taken their places Hetty was led out by the inevitable Mr Craig and Mary Burge by Adam and now the music struck up and the glorious countrydance best of all dances began
Pity it was not a boarded floor
Then the rhythmic stamping of the thick shoes would have been better than any drums
That merry stamping that gracious nodding of the head that waving bestowal of the handwhere can we see them now
That simple dancing of wellcovered matrons laying aside for an hour the cares of house and dairy remembering but not affecting youth not jealous but proud of the young maidens by their sidethat holiday sprightliness of portly husbands paying little compliments to their wives as if their courting days were come againthose lads and lasses a little confused and awkward with their partners having nothing to sayit would be a pleasant variety to see all that sometimes instead of low dresses and large skirts and scanning glances exploring costumes and languid men in lacquered boots smiling with double meaning
There was but one thing to mar Martin Poysers pleasure in this dance it was that he was always in close contact with Luke Britton that slovenly farmer
He thought of throwing a little glazed coldness into his eye in the crossing of hands but then as Miss Irwine was opposite to him instead of the offensive Luke he might freeze the wrong person
So he gave his face up to hilarity unchilled by moral judgments
How Hettys heart beat as Arthur approached her
He had hardly looked at her today now he must take her hand
Would he press it
Would he look at her
She thought she would cry if he gave her no sign of feeling
Now he was therehe had taken her hand yes he was pressing it
Hetty turned pale as she looked up at him for an instant and met his eyes before the dance carried him away
That pale look came upon Arthur like the beginning of a dull pain which clung to him though he must dance and smile and joke all the same
Hetty would look so when he told her what he had to tell her and he should never be able to bear ithe should be a fool and give way again
Hettys look did not really mean so much as he thought it was only the sign of a struggle between the desire for him to notice her and the dread lest she should betray the desire to others
But Hettys face had a language that transcended her feelings
There are faces which nature charges with a meaning and pathos not belonging to the single human soul that flutters beneath them but speaking the joys and sorrows of foregone generationseyes that tell of deep love which doubtless has been and is somewhere but not paired with these eyesperhaps paired with pale eyes that can say nothing just as a national language may be instinct with poetry unfelt by the lips that use it
That look of Hettys oppressed Arthur with a dread which yet had something of a terrible unconfessed delight in it that she loved him too well
There was a hard task before him for at that moment he felt he would have given up three years of his youth for the happiness of abandoning himself without remorse to his passion for Hetty
These were the incongruous thoughts in his mind as he led Mrs Poyser who was panting with fatigue and secretly resolving that neither judge nor jury should force her to dance another dance to take a quiet rest in the diningroom where supper was laid out for the guests to come and take it as they chose
Ive desired Hetty to remember as shes got to dance wi you sir said the good innocent woman for shes so thoughtless shed be like enough to go an engage herself for ivery dance
So I told her not to promise too many
Thank you Mrs Poyser said Arthur not without a twinge
Now sit down in this comfortable chair and here is Mills ready to give you what you would like best
He hurried away to seek another matronly partner for due honour must be paid to the married women before he asked any of the young ones and the countrydances and the stamping and the gracious nodding and the waving of the hands went on joyously
At last the time had come for the fourth dancelonged for by the strong grave Adam as if he had been a delicatehanded youth of eighteen for we are all very much alike when we are in our first love and Adam had hardly ever touched Hettys hand for more than a transient greetinghad never danced with her but once before
His eyes had followed her eagerly tonight in spite of himself and had taken in deeper draughts of love
He thought she behaved so prettily so quietly she did not seem to be flirting at all she smiled less than usual there was almost a sweet sadness about her
God bless her
he said inwardly Id make her life a happy un if a strong arm to work for her and a heart to love her could do it
And then there stole over him delicious thoughts of coming home from work and drawing Hetty to his side and feeling her cheek softly pressed against his till he forgot where he was and the music and the tread of feet might have been the falling of rain and the roaring of the wind for what he knew
But now the third dance was ended and he might go up to her and claim her hand
She was at the far end of the hall near the staircase whispering with Molly who had just given the sleeping Totty into her arms before running to fetch shawls and bonnets from the landing
Mrs Poyser had taken the two boys away into the diningroom to give them some cake before they went home in the cart with Grandfather and Molly was to follow as fast as possible
Let me hold her said Adam as Molly turned upstairs the children are so heavy when theyre asleep
Hetty was glad of the relief for to hold Totty in her arms standing was not at all a pleasant variety to her
But this second transfer had the unfortunate effect of rousing Totty who was not behind any child of her age in peevishness at an unseasonable awaking
While Hetty was in the act of placing her in Adams arms and had not yet withdrawn her own Totty opened her eyes and forthwith fought out with her left fist at Adams arm and with her right caught at the string of brown beads round Hettys neck
The locket leaped out from her frock and the next moment the string was broken and Hetty helpless saw beads and locket scattered wide on the floor
My locket my locket
she said in a loud frightened whisper to Adam never mind the beads
Adam had already seen where the locket fell for it had attracted his glance as it leaped out of her frock
It had fallen on the raised wooden dais where the band sat not on the stone floor and as Adam picked it up he saw the glass with the dark and light locks of hair under it
It had fallen that side upwards so the glass was not broken
He turned it over on his hand and saw the enamelled gold back
It isnt hurt he said as he held it towards Hetty who was unable to take it because both her hands were occupied with Totty
Oh it doesnt matter I dont mind about it said Hetty who had been pale and was now red
Not matter
said Adam gravely
You seemed very frightened about it
Ill hold it till youre ready to take it he added quietly closing his hand over it that she might not think he wanted to look at it again
By this time Molly had come with bonnet and shawl and as soon as she had taken Totty Adam placed the locket in Hettys hand
She took it with an air of indifference and put it in her pocket in her heart vexed and angry with Adam because he had seen it but determined now that she would show no more signs of agitation
See she said theyre taking their places to dance let us go
Adam assented silently
A puzzled alarm had taken possession of him
Had Hetty a lover he didnt know of
For none of her relations he was sure would give her a locket like that and none of her admirers with whom he was acquainted was in the position of an accepted lover as the giver of that locket must be
Adam was lost in the utter impossibility of finding any person for his fears to alight on
He could only feel with a terrible pang that there was something in Hettys life unknown to him that while he had been rocking himself in the hope that she would come to love him she was already loving another
The pleasure of the dance with Hetty was gone his eyes when they rested on her had an uneasy questioning expression in them he could think of nothing to say to her and she too was out of temper and disinclined to speak
They were both glad when the dance was ended
Adam was determined to stay no longer no one wanted him and no one would notice if he slipped away
As soon as he got out of doors he began to walk at his habitual rapid pace hurrying along without knowing why busy with the painful thought that the memory of this day so full of honour and promise to him was poisoned for ever
Suddenly when he was far on through the Chase he stopped startled by a flash of reviving hope
After all he might be a fool making a great misery out of a trifle
Hetty fond of finery as she was might have bought the thing herself
It looked too expensive for thatit looked like the things on white satin in the great jewellers shop at Rosseter
But Adam had very imperfect notions of the value of such things and he thought it could certainly not cost more than a guinea
Perhaps Hetty had had as much as that in Christmas boxes and there was no knowing but she might have been childish enough to spend it in that way she was such a young thing and she couldnt help loving finery
But then why had she been so frightened about it at first and changed colour so and afterwards pretended not to care
Oh that was because she was ashamed of his seeing that she had such a smart thingshe was conscious that it was wrong for her to spend her money on it and she knew that Adam disapproved of finery
It was a proof she cared about what he liked and disliked
She must have thought from his silence and gravity afterwards that he was very much displeased with her that he was inclined to be harsh and severe towards her foibles
And as he walked on more quietly chewing the cud of this new hope his only uneasiness was that he had behaved in a way which might chill Hettys feeling towards him
For this last view of the matter must be the true one
How could Hetty have an accepted lover quite unknown to him
She was never away from her uncles house for more than a day she could have no acquaintances that did not come there and no intimacies unknown to her uncle and aunt
It would be folly to believe that the locket was given to her by a lover
The little ring of dark hair he felt sure was her own he could form no guess about the light hair under it for he had not seen it very distinctly
It might be a bit of her fathers or mothers who had died when she was a child and she would naturally put a bit of her own along with it
And so Adam went to bed comforted having woven for himself an ingenious web of probabilitiesthe surest screen a wise man can place between himself and the truth
His last waking thoughts melted into a dream that he was with Hetty again at the Hall Farm and that he was asking her to forgive him for being so cold and silent
And while he was dreaming this Arthur was leading Hetty to the dance and saying to her in low hurried tones I shall be in the wood the day after tomorrow at seven come as early as you can
And Hettys foolish joys and hopes which had flown away for a little space scared by a mere nothing now all came fluttering back unconscious of the real peril
She was happy for the first time this long day and wished that dance would last for hours
Arthur wished it too it was the last weakness he meant to indulge in and a man never lies with more delicious languor under the influence of a passion than when he has persuaded himself that he shall subdue it tomorrow
But Mrs Poysers wishes were quite the reverse of this for her mind was filled with dreary forebodings as to the retardation of tomorrow mornings cheese in consequence of these late hours
Now that Hetty had done her duty and danced one dance with the young squire Mr Poyser must go out and see if the cart was come back to fetch them for it was halfpast ten oclock and notwithstanding a mild suggestion on his part that it would be bad manners for them to be the first to go Mrs Poyser was resolute on the point manners or no manners
What
Going already Mrs
Poyser
said old Mr Donnithorne as she came to curtsy and take leave I thought we should not part with any of our guests till eleven
Mrs Irwine and I who are elderly people think of sitting out the dance till then
Oh Your Honour its all right and proper for gentlefolks to stay up by candlelighttheyve got no cheese on their minds
Were late enough as it is an theres no lettin the cows know as they mustnt want to be milked so early tomorrow mornin
So if youll please t excuse us well take our leave
Eh
she said to her husband as they set off in the cart Id sooner ha brewin day and washin day together than one o these pleasurin days
Theres no work so tirin as danglin about an starin an not rightly knowin what youre goin to do next and keepin your face i smilin order like a grocer o marketday for fear people shouldna think you civil enough
An youve nothing to show fort when its done if it isnt a yallow face wi eatin things as disagree
Nay nay said Mr Poyser who was in his merriest mood and felt that he had had a great day a bit o pleasurings good for thee sometimes
An thee dancst as well as any of em for Ill back thee against all the wives i the parish for a light foot an ankle
An it was a great honour for the young squire to ask thee firstI reckon it was because I sat at th head o the table an made the speech
An Hetty tooshe never had such a partner beforea fine young gentleman in regmentals
Itll serve you to talk on Hetty when youre an old womanhow you danced wi th young squire the day he come o age
Book Four Chapter XXVII A crisis IT was beyond the middle of Augustnearly three weeks after the birthday feast
The reaping of the wheat had begun in our north midland county of Loamshire but the harvest was likely still to be retarded by the heavy rains which were causing inundations and much damage throughout the country
From this last trouble the Broxton and Hayslope farmers on their pleasant uplands and in their brookwatered valleys had not suffered and as I cannot pretend that they were such exceptional farmers as to love the general good better than their own you will infer that they were not in very low spirits about the rapid rise in the price of bread so long as there was hope of gathering in their own corn undamaged and occasional days of sunshine and drying winds flattered this hope
The eighteenth of August was one of these days when the sunshine looked brighter in all eyes for the gloom that went before
Grand masses of cloud were hurried across the blue and the great round hills behind the Chase seemed alive with their flying shadows the sun was hidden for a moment and then shone out warm again like a recovered joy the leaves still green were tossed off the hedgerow trees by the wind around the farmhouses there was a sound of clapping doors the apples fell in the orchards and the stray horses on the green sides of the lanes and on the common had their manes blown about their faces
And yet the wind seemed only part of the general gladness because the sun was shining
A merry day for the children who ran and shouted to see if they could top the wind with their voices and the grownup people too were in good spirits inclined to believe in yet finer days when the wind had fallen
If only the corn were not ripe enough to be blown out of the husk and scattered as untimely seed
And yet a day on which a blighting sorrow may fall upon a man
For if it be true that Nature at certain moments seems charged with a presentiment of one individual lot must it not also be true that she seems unmindful unconscious of another
For there is no hour that has not its births of gladness and despair no morning brightness that does not bring new sickness to desolation as well as new forces to genius and love
There are so many of us and our lots are so different what wonder that Natures mood is often in harsh contrast with the great crisis of our lives
We are children of a large family and must learn as such children do not to expect that our hurts will be made much ofto be content with little nurture and caressing and help each other the more
It was a busy day with Adam who of late had done almost double work for he was continuing to act as foreman for Jonathan Burge until some satisfactory person could be found to supply his place and Jonathan was slow to find that person
But he had done the extra work cheerfully for his hopes were buoyant again about Hetty
Every time she had seen him since the birthday she had seemed to make an effort to behave all the more kindly to him that she might make him understand she had forgiven his silence and coldness during the dance
He had never mentioned the locket to her again too happy that she smiled at himstill happier because he observed in her a more subdued air something that he interpreted as the growth of womanly tenderness and seriousness
Ah
he thought again and again shes only seventeen shell be thoughtful enough after a while
And her aunt allays says how clever she is at the work
Shell make a wife as Motherll have no occasion to grumble at after all
To be sure he had only seen her at home twice since the birthday for one Sunday when he was intending to go from church to the Hall Farm Hetty had joined the party of upper servants from the Chase and had gone home with themalmost as if she were inclined to encourage Mr Craig
Shes takin too much likin to them folks i the house keepers room Mrs Poyser remarked
For my part I was never overfond o gentlefolkss servantstheyre mostly like the fine ladies fat dogs nayther good for barking nor butchers meat but ony for show
And another evening she was gone to Treddleston to buy some things though to his great surprise as he was returning home he saw her at a distance getting over a stile quite out of the Treddleston road
But when he hastened to her she was very kind and asked him to go in again when he had taken her to the yard gate
She had gone a little farther into the fields after coming from Treddleston because she didnt want to go in she said it was so nice to be out of doors and her aunt always made such a fuss about it if she wanted to go out
Oh do come in with me
she said as he was going to shake hands with her at the gate and he could not resist that
So he went in and Mrs Poyser was contented with only a slight remark on Hettys being later than was expected while Hetty who had looked out of spirits when he met her smiled and talked and waited on them all with unusual promptitude
That was the last time he had seen her but he meant to make leisure for going to the Farm tomorrow
Today he knew was her day for going to the Chase to sew with the ladys maid so he would get as much work done as possible this evening that the next might be clear
One piece of work that Adam was superintending was some slight repairs at the Chase Farm which had been hitherto occupied by Satchell as bailiff but which it was now rumoured that the old squire was going to let to a smart man in topboots who had been seen to ride over it one day
Nothing but the desire to get a tenant could account for the squires undertaking repairs though the Saturdayevening party at Mr Cassons agreed over their pipes that no man in his senses would take the Chase Farm unless there was a bit more ploughland laid to it
However that might be the repairs were ordered to be executed with all dispatch and Adam acting for Mr Burge was carrying out the order with his usual energy
But today having been occupied elsewhere he had not been able to arrive at the Chase Farm till late in the afternoon and he then discovered that some old roofing which he had calculated on preserving had given way
There was clearly no good to be done with this part of the building without pulling it all down and Adam immediately saw in his mind a plan for building it up again so as to make the most convenient of cowsheds and calfpens with a hovel for implements and all without any great expense for materials
So when the workmen were gone he sat down took out his pocketbook and busied himself with sketching a plan and making a specification of the expenses that he might show it to Burge the next morning and set him on persuading the squire to consent
To make a good job of anything however small was always a pleasure to Adam and he sat on a block with his book resting on a planingtable whistling low every now and then and turning his head on one side with a just perceptible smile of gratificationof pride too for if Adam loved a bit of good work he loved also to think I did it
And I believe the only people who are free from that weakness are those who have no work to call their own
It was nearly seven before he had finished and put on his jacket again and on giving a last look round he observed that Seth who had been working here today had left his basket of tools behind him
Why th lads forgot his tools thought Adam and hes got to work up at the shop to morrow
There never was such a chap for woolgathering hed leave his head behind him if it was loose
However its lucky Ive seen em Ill carry em home
The buildings of the Chase Farm lay at one extremity of the Chase at about ten minutes walking distance from the Abbey
Adam had come thither on his pony intending to ride to the stables and put up his nag on his way home
At the stables he encountered Mr Craig who had come to look at the captains new horse on which he was to ride away the day after tomorrow and Mr Craig detained him to tell how all the servants were to collect at the gate of the courtyard to wish the young squire luck as he rode out so that by the time Adam had got into the Chase and was striding along with the basket of tools over his shoulder the sun was on the point of setting and was sending level crimson rays among the great trunks of the old oaks and touching every bare patch of ground with a transient glory that made it look like a jewel dropt upon the grass
The wind had fallen now and there was only enough breeze to stir the delicatestemmed leaves
Any one who had been sitting in the house all day would have been glad to walk now but Adam had been quite enough in the open air to wish to shorten his way home and he bethought himself that he might do so by striking across the Chase and going through the Grove where he had never been for years
He hurried on across the Chase stalking along the narrow paths between the fern with Gyp at his heels not lingering to watch the magnificent changes of the lighthardly once thinking of ityet feeling its presence in a certain calm happy awe which mingled itself with his busy workingday thoughts
How could he help feeling it
The very deer felt it and were more timid
Presently Adams thoughts recurred to what Mr Craig had said about Arthur Donnithorne and pictured his going away and the changes that might take place before he came back then they travelled back affectionately over the old scenes of boyish companionship and dwelt on Arthurs good qualities which Adam had a pride in as we all have in the virtues of the superior who honours us
A nature like Adams with a great need of love and reverence in it depends for so much of its happiness on what it can believe and feel about others
And he had no ideal world of dead heroes he knew little of the life of men in the past he must find the beings to whom he could cling with loving admiration among those who came within speech of him
These pleasant thoughts about Arthur brought a milder expression than usual into his keen rough face perhaps they were the reason why when he opened the old green gate leading into the Grove he paused to pat Gyp and say a kind word to him
After that pause he strode on again along the broad winding path through the Grove
What grand beeches
Adam delighted in a fine tree of all things as the fishermans sight is keenest on the sea so Adams perceptions were more at home with trees than with other objects
He kept them in his memory as a painter does with all the flecks and knots in their bark all the curves and angles of their boughs and had often calculated the height and contents of a trunk to a nicety as he stood looking at it
No wonder that notwithstanding his desire to get on he could not help pausing to look at a curious large beech which he had seen standing before him at a turning in the road and convince himself that it was not two trees wedded together but only one
For the rest of his life he remembered that moment when he was calmly examining the beech as a man remembers his last glimpse of the home where his youth was passed before the road turned and he saw it no more
The beech stood at the last turning before the Grove ended in an archway of boughs that let in the eastern light and as Adam stepped away from the tree to continue his walk his eyes fell on two figures about twenty yards before him
He remained as motionless as a statue and turned almost as pale
The two figures were standing opposite to each other with clasped hands about to part and while they were bending to kiss Gyp who had been running among the brushwood came out caught sight of them and gave a sharp bark
They separated with a startone hurried through the gate out of the Grove and the other turning round walked slowly with a sort of saunter towards Adam who still stood transfixed and pale clutching tighter the stick with which he held the basket of tools over his shoulder and looking at the approaching figure with eyes in which amazement was fast turning to fierceness
Arthur Donnithorne looked flushed and excited he had tried to make unpleasant feelings more bearable by drinking a little more wine than usual at dinner today and was still enough under its flattering influence to think more lightly of this unwishedfor rencontre with Adam than he would otherwise have done
After all Adam was the best person who could have happened to see him and Hetty togetherhe was a sensible fellow and would not babble about it to other people
Arthur felt confident that he could laugh the thing off and explain it away
And so he sauntered forward with elaborate carelessnesshis flushed face his evening dress of fine cloth and fine linen his hands halfthrust into his waistcoat pockets all shone upon by the strange evening light which the light clouds had caught up even to the zenith and were now shedding down between the topmost branches above him
Adam was still motionless looking at him as he came up
He understood it all nowthe locket and everything else that had been doubtful to him a terrible scorching light showed him the hidden letters that changed the meaning of the past
If he had moved a muscle he must inevitably have sprung upon Arthur like a tiger and in the conflicting emotions that filled those long moments he had told himself that he would not give loose to passion he would only speak the right thing
He stood as if petrified by an unseen force but the force was his own strong will
Well Adam said Arthur youve been looking at the fine old beeches eh
Theyre not to be come near by the hatchet though this is a sacred grove
I overtook pretty little Hetty Sorrel as I was coming to my denthe Hermitage there
She ought not to come home this way so late
So I took care of her to the gate and asked for a kiss for my pains
But I must get back now for this road is confoundedly damp
Goodnight Adam
I shall see you tomorrowto say goodbye you know
Arthur was too much preoccupied with the part he was playing himself to be thoroughly aware of the expression in Adams face
He did not look directly at Adam but glanced carelessly round at the trees and then lifted up one foot to look at the sole of his boot
He cared to say no morehe had thrown quite dust enough into honest Adams eyesand as he spoke the last words he walked on
Stop a bit sir said Adam in a hard peremptory voice without turning round
Ive got a word to say to you
Arthur paused in surprise
Susceptible persons are more affected by a change of tone than by unexpected words and Arthur had the susceptibility of a nature at once affectionate and vain
He was still more surprised when he saw that Adam had not moved but stood with his back to him as if summoning him to return
What did he mean
He was going to make a serious business of this affair
Arthur felt his temper rising
A patronising disposition always has its meaner side and in the confusion of his irritation and alarm there entered the feeling that a man to whom he had shown so much favour as to Adam was not in a position to criticize his conduct
And yet he was dominated as one who feels himself in the wrong always is by the man whose good opinion he cares for
In spite of pride and temper there was as much deprecation as anger in his voice when he said What do you mean Adam
I mean siranswered Adam in the same harsh voice still without turning roundI mean sir that you dont deceive me by your light words
This is not the first time youve met Hetty Sorrel in this grove and this is not the first time youve kissed her
Arthur felt a startled uncertainty how far Adam was speaking from knowledge and how far from mere inference
And this uncertainty which prevented him from contriving a prudent answer heightened his irritation
He said in a high sharp tone Well sir what then
Why then instead of acting like th upright honourable man weve all believed you to be youve been acting the part of a selfish lightminded scoundrel
You know as well as I do what its to lead to when a gentleman like you kisses and makes love to a young woman like Hetty and gives her presents as shes frightened for other folks to see
And I say it again youre acting the part of a selfish lightminded scoundrel though it cuts me to th heart to say so and Id rather ha lost my right hand
Let me tell you Adam said Arthur bridling his growing anger and trying to recur to his careless tone youre not only devilishly impertinent but youre talking nonsense
Every pretty girl is not such a fool as you to suppose that when a gentleman admires her beauty and pays her a little attention he must mean something particular
Every man likes to flirt with a pretty girl and every pretty girl likes to be flirted with
The wider the distance between them the less harm there is for then shes not likely to deceive herself
I dont know what you mean by flirting said Adam but if you mean behaving to a woman as if you loved her and yet not loving her all the while I say thats not th action of an honest man and what isnt honest does come t harm
Im not a fool and youre not a fool and you know better than what youre saying
You know it couldnt be made public as youve behaved to Hetty as y have done without her losing her character and bringing shame and trouble on her and her relations
What if you meant nothing by your kissing and your presents
Other folks wont believe as youve meant nothing and dont tell me about her not deceiving herself
I tell you as youve filled her mind so with the thought of you as itll mayhap poison her life and shell never love another man as ud make her a good husband
Arthur had felt a sudden relief while Adam was speaking he perceived that Adam had no positive knowledge of the past and that there was no irrevocable damage done by this evenings unfortunate rencontre
Adam could still be deceived
The candid Arthur had brought himself into a position in which successful lying was his only hope
The hope allayed his anger a little
Well Adam he said in a tone of friendly concession youre perhaps right
Perhaps Ive gone a little too far in taking notice of the pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and then
Youre such a grave steady fellow you dont understand the temptation to such trifling
Im sure I wouldnt bring any trouble or annoyance on her and the good Poysers on any account if I could help it
But I think you look a little too seriously at it
You know Im going away immediately so I shant make any more mistakes of the kind
But let us say goodnightArthur here turned round to walk onand talk no more about the matter
The whole thing will soon be forgotten
No by God
Adam burst out with rage that could be controlled no longer throwing down the basket of tools and striding forward till he was right in front of Arthur
All his jealousy and sense of personal injury which he had been hitherto trying to keep under had leaped up and mastered him
What man of us in the first moments of a sharp agony could ever feel that the fellow man who has been the medium of inflicting it did not mean to hurt us
In our instinctive rebellion against pain we are children again and demand an active will to wreak our vengeance on
Adam at this moment could only feel that he had been robbed of Hetty robbed treacherously by the man in whom he had trustedand he stood close in front of Arthur with fierce eyes glaring at him with pale lips and clenched hands the hard tones in which he had hitherto been constraining himself to express no more than a just indignation giving way to a deep agitated voice that seemed to shake him as he spoke
No itll not be soon forgot as youve come in between her and me when she might ha loved meitll not soon be forgot as youve robbed me o my happiness while I thought you was my best friend and a nobleminded man as I was proud to work for
And youve been kissing her and meaning nothing have you
And I never kissed her i my lifebut Id ha worked hard for years for the right to kiss her
And you make light of it
You think little o doing what may damage other folks so as you get your bit o trifling as means nothing
I throw back your favours for youre not the man I took you for
Ill never count you my friend any more
Id rather youd act as my enemy and fight me where I standits all th amends you can make me
Poor Adam possessed by rage that could find no other vent began to throw off his coat and his cap too blind with passion to notice the change that had taken place in Arthur while he was speaking
Arthurs lips were now as pale as Adams his heart was beating violently
The discovery that Adam loved Hetty was a shock which made him for the moment see himself in the light of Adams indignation and regard Adams suffering as not merely a consequence but an element of his error
The words of hatred and contemptthe first he had ever heard in his lifeseemed like scorching missiles that were making ineffaceable scars on him
All screening selfexcuse which rarely falls quite away while others respect us forsook him for an instant and he stood face to face with the first great irrevocable evil he had ever committed
He was only twentyone and three months agonay much laterhe had thought proudly that no man should ever be able to reproach him justly
His first impulse if there had been time for it would perhaps have been to utter words of propitiation but Adam had no sooner thrown off his coat and cap than he became aware that Arthur was standing pale and motionless with his hands still thrust in his waistcoat pockets
What
he said wont you fight me like a man
You know I wont strike you while you stand so
Go away Adam said Arthur I dont want to fight you
No said Adam bitterly you dont want to fight meyou think Im a common man as you can injure without answering for it
I never meant to injure you said Arthur with returning anger
I didnt know you loved her
But youve made her love you said Adam
Youre a doublefaced manIll never believe a word you say again
Go away I tell you said Arthur angrily or we shall both repent
No said Adam with a convulsed voice I swear I wont go away without fighting you
Do you want provoking any more
I tell you youre a coward and a scoundrel and I despise you
The colour had all rushed back to Arthurs face in a moment his right hand was clenched and dealt a blow like lightning which sent Adam staggering backward
His blood was as thoroughly up as Adams now and the two men forgetting the emotions that had gone before fought with the instinctive fierceness of panthers in the deepening twilight darkened by the trees
The delicatehanded gentleman was a match for the workman in everything but strength and Arthurs skill enabled him to protract the struggle for some long moments
But between unarmed men the battle is to the strong where the strong is no blunderer and Arthur must sink under a wellplanted blow of Adams as a steel rod is broken by an iron bar
The blow soon came and Arthur fell his head lying concealed in a tuft of fern so that Adam could only discern his darkly clad body
He stood still in the dim light waiting for Arthur to rise
The blow had been given now towards which he had been straining all the force of nerve and muscleand what was the good of it
What had he done by fighting
Only satisfied his own passion only wreaked his own vengeance
He had not rescued Hetty nor changed the pastthere it was just as it had been and he sickened at the vanity of his own rage
But why did not Arthur rise
He was perfectly motionless and the time seemed long to Adam
Good God
had the blow been too much for him
Adam shuddered at the thought of his own strength as with the oncoming of this dread he knelt down by Arthurs side and lifted his head from among the fern
There was no sign of life the eyes and teeth were set
The horror that rushed over Adam completely mastered him and forced upon him its own belief
He could feel nothing but that death was in Arthurs face and that he was helpless before it
He made not a single movement but knelt like an image of despair gazing at an image of death
Chapter XXVIII A Dilemma IT was only a few minutes measured by the clockthough Adam always thought it had been a long whilebefore he perceived a gleam of consciousness in Arthurs face and a slight shiver through his frame
The intense joy that flooded his soul brought back some of the old affection with it
Do you feel any pain sir
he said tenderly loosening Arthurs cravat
Arthur turned his eyes on Adam with a vague stare which gave way to a slightly startled motion as if from the shock of returning memory
But he only shivered again and said nothing
Do you feel any hurt sir
Adam said again with a trembling in his voice
Arthur put his hand up to his waistcoat buttons and when Adam had unbuttoned it he took a longer breath
Lay my head down he said faintly and get me some water if you can
Adam laid the head down gently on the fern again and emptying the tools out of the flagbasket hurried through the trees to the edge of the Grove bordering on the Chase where a brook ran below the bank
When he returned with his basket leaking but still halffull Arthur looked at him with a more thoroughly reawakened consciousness
Can you drink a drop out o your hand sir
said Adam kneeling down again to lift up Arthurs head
No said Arthur dip my cravat in and souse it on my head
The water seemed to do him some good for he presently raised himself a little higher resting on Adams arm
Do you feel any hurt inside sir
Adam asked again Nono hurt said Arthur still faintly but rather done up
After a while he said I suppose I fainted away when you knocked me down
Yes sir thank God said Adam
I thought it was worse
What
You thought youd done for me eh
Come help me on my legs
I feel terribly shaky and dizzy Arthur said as he stood leaning on Adams arm that blow of yours must have come against me like a batteringram
I dont believe I can walk alone
Lean on me sir Ill get you along said Adam
Or will you sit down a bit longer on my coat here and Ill prop y up
Youll perhaps be better in a minute or two
No said Arthur
Ill go to the HermitageI think Ive got some brandy there
Theres a short road to it a little farther on near the gate
If youll just help me on
They walked slowly with frequent pauses but without speaking again
In both of them the concentration in the present which had attended the first moments of Arthurs revival had now given way to a vivid recollection of the previous scene
It was nearly dark in the narrow path among the trees but within the circle of firtrees round the Hermitage there was room for the growing moonlight to enter in at the windows
Their steps were noiseless on the thick carpet of firneedles and the outward stillness seemed to heighten their inward consciousness as Arthur took the key out of his pocket and placed it in Adams hand for him to open the door
Adam had not known before that Arthur had furnished the old Hermitage and made it a retreat for himself and it was a surprise to him when he opened the door to see a snug room with all the signs of frequent habitation
Arthur loosed Adams arm and threw himself on the ottoman
Youll see my huntingbottle somewhere he said
A leather case with a bottle and glass in
Adam was not long in finding the case
Theres very little brandy in it sir he said turning it downwards over the glass as he held it before the window hardly this little glassful
Well give me that said Arthur with the peevishness of physical depression
When he had taken some sips Adam said Hadnt I better run to th house sir and get some more brandy
I can be there and back pretty soon
Itll be a stiff walk home for you if you dont have something to revive you
Yesgo
But dont say Im ill
Ask for my man Pym and tell him to get it from Mills and not to say Im at the Hermitage
Get some water too
Adam was relieved to have an active taskboth of them were relieved to be apart from each other for a short time
But Adams swift pace could not still the eager pain of thinkingof living again with concentrated suffering through the last wretched hour and looking out from it over all the new sad future
Arthur lay still for some minutes after Adam was gone but presently he rose feebly from the ottoman and peered about slowly in the broken moonlight seeking something
It was a short bit of wax candle that stood amongst a confusion of writing and drawing materials
There was more searching for the means of lighting the candle and when that was done he went cautiously round the room as if wishing to assure himself of the presence or absence of something
At last he had found a slight thing which he put first in his pocket and then on a second thought took out again and thrust deep down into a wastepaper basket
It was a womans little pink silk neckerchief
He set the candle on the table and threw himself down on the ottoman again exhausted with the effort
When Adam came back with his supplies his entrance awoke Arthur from a doze
Thats right Arthur said Im tremendously in want of some brandyvigour
Im glad to see youve got a light sir said Adam
Ive been thinking Id better have asked for a lanthorn
No no the candle will last long enoughI shall soon be up to walking home now
I cant go before Ive seen you safe home sir said Adam hesitatingly
No it will be better for you to staysit down
Adam sat down and they remained opposite to each other in uneasy silence while Arthur slowly drank brandyandwater with visibly renovating effect
He began to lie in a more voluntary position and looked as if he were less overpowered by bodily sensations
Adam was keenly alive to these indications and as his anxiety about Arthurs condition began to be allayed he felt more of that impatience which every one knows who has had his just indignation suspended by the physical state of the culprit
Yet there was one thing on his mind to be done before he could recur to remonstrance it was to confess what had been unjust in his own words
Perhaps he longed all the more to make this confession that his indignation might be free again and as he saw the signs of returning ease in Arthur the words again and again came to his lips and went back checked by the thought that it would be better to leave everything till tomorrow
As long as they were silent they did not look at each other and a foreboding came across Adam that if they began to speak as though they remembered the pastif they looked at each other with full recognitionthey must take fire again
So they sat in silence till the bit of wax candle flickered low in the socket the silence all the while becoming more irksome to Adam
Arthur had just poured out some more brandyandwater and he threw one arm behind his head and drew up one leg in an attitude of recovered ease which was an irresistible temptation to Adam to speak what was on his mind
You begin to feel more yourself again sir he said as the candle went out and they were halfhidden from each other in the faint moonlight
Yes I dont feel good for muchvery lazy and not inclined to move but Ill go home when Ive taken this dose
There was a slight pause before Adam said My temper got the better of me and I said things as wasnt true
Id no right to speak as if youd known you was doing me an injury youd no grounds for knowing it Ive always kept what I felt for her as secret as I could
He paused again before he went on
And perhaps I judged you too harshIm apt to be harshand you may have acted out o thoughtlessness more than I should ha believed was possible for a man with a heart and a conscience
Were not all put together alike and we may misjudge one another
God knows its all the joy I could have now to think the best of you
Arthur wanted to go home without saying any morehe was too painfully embarrassed in mind as well as too weak in body to wish for any further explanation tonight
And yet it was a relief to him that Adam reopened the subject in a way the least difficult for him to answer
Arthur was in the wretched position of an open generous man who has committed an error which makes deception seem a necessity
The native impulse to give truth in return for truth to meet trust with frank confession must be suppressed and duty was becoming a question of tactics
His deed was reacting upon himwas already governing him tyrannously and forcing him into a course that jarred with his habitual feelings
The only aim that seemed admissible to him now was to deceive Adam to the utmost to make Adam think better of him than he deserved
And when he heard the words of honest retractationwhen he heard the sad appeal with which Adam endedhe was obliged to rejoice in the remains of ignorant confidence it implied
He did not answer immediately for he had to be judicious and not truthful
Say no more about our anger Adam he said at last very languidly for the labour of speech was unwelcome to him I forgive your momentary injusticeit was quite natural with the exaggerated notions you had in your mind
We shall be none the worse friends in future I hope because weve fought
You had the best of it and that was as it should be for I believe Ive been most in the wrong of the two
Come let us shake hands
Arthur held out his hand but Adam sat still
I dont like to say No to that sir he said but I cant shake hands till its clear what we mean byt
I was wrong when I spoke as if youd done me an injury knowingly but I wasnt wrong in what I said before about your behaviour t Hetty and I cant shake hands with you as if I held you my friend the same as ever till youve cleared that up better
Arthur swallowed his pride and resentment as he drew back his hand
He was silent for some moments and then said as indifferently as he could I dont know what you mean by clearing up Adam
Ive told you already that you think too seriously of a little flirtation
But if you are right in supposing there is any danger in itIm going away on Saturday and there will be an end of it
As for the pain it has given you Im heartily sorry for it
I can say no more
Adam said nothing but rose from his chair and stood with his face towards one of the windows as if looking at the blackness of the moonlit firtrees but he was in reality conscious of nothing but the conflict within him
It was of no use nowhis resolution not to speak till tomorrow
He must speak there and then
But it was several minutes before he turned round and stepped nearer to Arthur standing and looking down on him as he lay
Itll be better for me to speak plain he said with evident effort though its hard work
You see sir this isnt a trifle to me whatever it may be to you
Im none o them men as can go making love first to one woman and then t another and dont think it much odds which of em I take
What I feel for Hettys a different sort o love such as I believe nobody can know much about but them as feel it and God as has given it to em
Shes more nor everything else to me all but my conscience and my good name
And if its true what youve been saying all alongand if its only been trifling and flirting as you call it as ll be put an end to by your going awaywhy then Id wait and hope her heart ud turn to me after all
Im loath to think youd speak false to me and Ill believe your word however things may look
You would be wronging Hetty more than me not to believe it said Arthur almost violently starting up from the ottoman and moving away
But he threw himself into a chair again directly saying more feebly You seem to forget that in suspecting me you are casting imputations upon her
Nay sir Adam said in a calmer voice as if he were half relievedfor he was too straightforward to make a distinction between a direct falsehood and an indirect oneNay sir things dont lie level between Hetty and you
Youre acting with your eyes open whatever you may do but how do you know whats been in her mind
Shes all but a childas any man with a conscience in him ought to feel bound to take care on
And whatever you may think I know youve disturbed her mind
I know shes been fixing her heart on you for theres a many things clear to me now as I didnt understand before
But you seem to make light o what she may feelyou dont think o that
Good God Adam let me alone
Arthur burst out impetuously I feel it enough without your worrying me
He was aware of his indiscretion as soon as the words had escaped him
Well then if you feel it Adam rejoined eagerly if you feel as you may ha put false notions into her mind and made her believe as you loved her when all the while you meant nothing Ive this demand to make of youIm not speaking for myself but for her
I ask you t undeceive her before you go away
Yarent going away for ever and if you leave her behind with a notion in her head o your feeling about her the same as she feels about you shell be hankering after you and the mischief may get worse
It may be a smart to her now but itll save her pain i th end
I ask you to write a letteryou may trust to my seeing as she gets it
Tell her the truth and take blame to yourself for behaving as youd no right to do to a young woman as isnt your equal
I speak plain sir but I cant speak any other way
Theres nobody can take care o Hetty in this thing but me
I can do what I think needful in the matter said Arthur more and more irritated by mingled distress and perplexity without giving promises to you
I shall take what measures I think proper
No said Adam in an abrupt decided tone that wont do
I must know what ground Im treading on
I must be safe as youve put an end to what ought never to ha been begun
I dont forget whats owing to you as a gentleman but in this thing were man and man and I cant give up
There was no answer for some moments
Then Arthur said Ill see you tomorrow
I can bear no more now Im ill He rose as he spoke and reached his cap as if intending to go
You wont see her again
Adam exclaimed with a flash of recurring anger and suspicion moving towards the door and placing his back against it
Either tell me she can never be my wife tell me youve been lyingor else promise me what Ive said
Adam uttering this alternative stood like a terrible fate before Arthur who had moved forward a step or two and now stopped faint shaken sick in mind and body
It seemed long to both of themthat inward struggle of Arthursbefore he said feebly I promise let me go
Adam moved away from the door and opened it but when Arthur reached the step he stopped again and leaned against the door post
Youre not well enough to walk alone sir said Adam
Take my arm again
Arthur made no answer and presently walked on Adam following
But after a few steps he stood still again and said coldly I believe I must trouble you
Its getting late now and there may be an alarm set up about me at home
Adam gave his arm and they walked on without uttering a word till they came where the basket and the tools lay
I must pick up the tools sir Adam said
Theyre my brothers
I doubt theyll be rusted
If youll please to wait a minute
Arthur stood still without speaking and no other word passed between them till they were at the side entrance where he hoped to get in without being seen by any one
He said then Thank you I neednt trouble you any further
What time will it be convenent for me to see you tomorrow sir
said Adam
You may send me word that youre here at five oclock said Arthur not before
Goodnight sir said Adam
But he heard no reply Arthur had turned into the house
Chapter XXIX The Next Morning ARTHUR did not pass a sleepless night he slept long and well
For sleep comes to the perplexedif the perplexed are only weary enough
But at seven he rang his bell and astonished Pym by declaring he was going to get up and must have breakfast brought to him at eight
And see that my mare is saddled at halfpast eight and tell my grandfather when hes down that Im better this morning and am gone for a ride
He had been awake an hour and could rest in bed no longer
In bed our yesterdays are too oppressive if a man can only get up though it be but to whistle or to smoke he has a present which offers some resistance to the pastsensations which assert themselves against tyrannous memories
And if there were such a thing as taking averages of feeling it would certainly be found that in the hunting and shooting seasons regret selfreproach and mortified pride weigh lighter on country gentlemen than in late spring and summer
Arthur felt that he should be more of a man on horseback
Even the presence of Pym waiting on him with the usual deference was a reassurance to him after the scenes of yesterday
For with Arthurs sensitiveness to opinion the loss of Adams respect was a shock to his selfcontentment which suffused his imagination with the sense that he had sunk in all eyesas a sudden shock of fear from some real peril makes a nervous woman afraid even to step because all her perceptions are suffused with a sense of danger
Arthurs as you know was a loving nature
Deeds of kindness were as easy to him as a bad habit they were the common issue of his weaknesses and good qualities of his egoism and his sympathy
He didnt like to witness pain and he liked to have grateful eyes beaming on him as the giver of pleasure
When he was a lad of seven he one day kicked down an old gardeners pitcher of broth from no motive but a kicking impulse not reflecting that it was the old mans dinner but on learning that sad fact he took his favourite pencilcase and a silverhafted knife out of his pocket and offered them as compensation
He had been the same Arthur ever since trying to make all offences forgotten in benefits
If there were any bitterness in his nature it could only show itself against the man who refused to be conciliated by him
And perhaps the time was come for some of that bitterness to rise
At the first moment Arthur had felt pure distress and selfreproach at discovering that Adams happiness was involved in his relation to Hetty
If there had been a possibility of making Adam tenfold amendsif deeds of gift or any other deeds could have restored Adams contentment and regard for him as a benefactor Arthur would not only have executed them without hesitation but would have felt bound all the more closely to Adam and would never have been weary of making retribution
But Adam could receive no amends his suffering could not be cancelled his respect and affection could not be recovered by any prompt deeds of atonement
He stood like an immovable obstacle against which no pressure could avail an embodiment of what Arthur most shrank from believing inthe irrevocableness of his own wrongdoing
The words of scorn the refusal to shake hands the mastery asserted over him in their last conversation in the Hermitageabove all the sense of having been knocked down to which a man does not very well reconcile himself even under the most heroic circumstancespressed on him with a galling pain which was stronger than compunction
Arthur would so gladly have persuaded himself that he had done no harm
And if no one had told him the contrary he could have persuaded himself so much better
Nemesis can seldom forge a sword for herself out of our consciencesout of the suffering we feel in the suffering we may have caused there is rarely metal enough there to make an effective weapon
Our moral sense learns the manners of good society and smiles when others smile but when some rude person gives rough names to our actions she is apt to take part against us
And so it was with Arthur Adams judgment of him Adams grating words disturbed his selfsoothing arguments
Not that Arthur had been at ease before Adams discovery
Struggles and resolves had transformed themselves into compunction and anxiety
He was distressed for Hettys sake and distressed for his own that he must leave her behind
He had always both in making and breaking resolutions looked beyond his passion and seen that it must speedily end in separation but his nature was too ardent and tender for him not to suffer at this parting and on Hettys account he was filled with uneasiness
He had found out the dream in which she was livingthat she was to be a lady in silks and satinsand when he had first talked to her about his going away she had asked him tremblingly to let her go with him and be married
It was his painful knowledge of this which had given the most exasperating sting to Adams reproaches
He had said no word with the purpose of deceiving herher vision was all spun by her own childish fancybut he was obliged to confess to himself that it was spun half out of his own actions
And to increase the mischief on this last evening he had not dared to hint the truth to Hetty he had been obliged to soothe her with tender hopeful words lest he should throw her into violent distress
He felt the situation acutely felt the sorrow of the dear thing in the present and thought with a darker anxiety of the tenacity which her feelings might have in the future
That was the one sharp point which pressed against him every other he could evade by hopeful selfpersuasion
The whole thing had been secret the Poysers had not the shadow of a suspicion
No one except Adam knew anything of what had passedno one else was likely to know for Arthur had impressed on Hetty that it would be fatal to betray by word or look that there had been the least intimacy between them and Adam who knew half their secret would rather help them to keep it than betray it
It was an unfortunate business altogether but there was no use in making it worse than it was by imaginary exaggerations and forebodings of evil that might never come
The temporary sadness for Hetty was the worst consequence he resolutely turned away his eyes from any bad consequence that was not demonstrably inevitable
Butbut Hetty might have had the trouble in some other way if not in this
And perhaps hereafter he might be able to do a great deal for her and make up to her for all the tears she would shed about him
She would owe the advantage of his care for her in future years to the sorrow she had incurred now
So good comes out of evil
Such is the beautiful arrangement of things
Are you inclined to ask whether this can be the same Arthur who two months ago had that freshness of feeling that delicate honour which shrinks from wounding even a sentiment and does not contemplate any more positive offence as possible for itwho thought that his own selfrespect was a higher tribunal than any external opinion
The same I assure you only under different conditions
Our deeds determine us as much as we determine our deeds and until we know what has been or will be the peculiar combination of outward with inward facts which constitutes a mans critical actions it will be better not to think ourselves wise about his character
There is a terrible coercion in our deeds which may first turn the honest man into a deceiver and then reconcile him to the change for this reasonthat the second wrong presents itself to him in the guise of the only practicable right
The action which before commission has been seen with that blended common sense and fresh untarnished feeling which is the healthy eye of the soul is looked at afterwards with the lens of apologetic ingenuity through which all things that men call beautiful and ugly are seen to be made up of textures very much alike
Europe adjusts itself to a fait accompli and so does an individual characteruntil the placid adjustment is disturbed by a convulsive retribution
No man can escape this vitiating effect of an offence against his own sentiment of right and the effect was the stronger in Arthur because of that very need of selfrespect which while his conscience was still at ease was one of his best safeguards
Selfaccusation was too painful to himhe could not face it
He must persuade himself that he had not been very much to blame he began even to pity himself for the necessity he was under of deceiving Adamit was a course so opposed to the honesty of his own nature
But then it was the only right thing to do
Well whatever had been amiss in him he was miserable enough in consequence miserable about Hetty miserable about this letter that he had promised to write and that seemed at one moment to be a gross barbarity at another perhaps the greatest kindness he could do to her
And across all this reflection would dart every now and then a sudden impulse of passionate defiance towards all consequences
He would carry Hetty away and all other considerations might go to
In this state of mind the four walls of his room made an intolerable prison to him they seemed to hem in and press down upon him all the crowd of contradictory thoughts and conflicting feelings some of which would fly away in the open air
He had only an hour or two to make up his mind in and he must get clear and calm
Once on Megs back in the fresh air of that fine morning he should be more master of the situation
The pretty creature arched her bay neck in the sunshine and pawed the gravel and trembled with pleasure when her master stroked her nose and patted her and talked to her even in a more caressing tone than usual
He loved her the better because she knew nothing of his secrets
But Meg was quite as well acquainted with her masters mental state as many others of her sex with the mental condition of the nice young gentlemen towards whom their hearts are in a state of fluttering expectation
Arthur cantered for five miles beyond the Chase till he was at the foot of a hill where there were no hedges or trees to hem in the road
Then he threw the bridle on Megs neck and prepared to make up his mind
Hetty knew that their meeting yesterday must be the last before Arthur went awaythere was no possibility of their contriving another without exciting suspicionand she was like a frightened child unable to think of anything only able to cry at the mention of parting and then put her face up to have the tears kissed away
He could do nothing but comfort her and lull her into dreaming on
A letter would be a dreadfully abrupt way of awakening her
Yet there was truth in what Adam saidthat it would save her from a lengthened delusion which might be worse than a sharp immediate pain
And it was the only way of satisfying Adam who must be satisfied for more reasons than one
If he could have seen her again
But that was impossible there was such a thorny hedge of hindrances between them and an imprudence would be fatal
And yet if he COULD see her again what good would it do
Only cause him to suffer more from the sight of her distress and the remembrance of it
Away from him she was surrounded by all the motives to selfcontrol
A sudden dread here fell like a shadow across his imaginationthe dread lest she should do something violent in her grief and close upon that dread came another which deepened the shadow
But he shook them off with the force of youth and hope
What was the ground for painting the future in that dark way
It was just as likely to be the reverse
Arthur told himself he did not deserve that things should turn out badly
He had never meant beforehand to do anything his conscience disapproved he had been led on by circumstances
There was a sort of implicit confidence in him that he was really such a good fellow at bottom Providence would not treat him harshly
At all events he couldnt help what would come now all he could do was to take what seemed the best course at the present moment
And he persuaded himself that that course was to make the way open between Adam and Hetty
Her heart might really turn to Adam as he said after a while and in that case there would have been no great harm done since it was still Adams ardent wish to make her his wife
To be sure Adam was deceiveddeceived in a way that Arthur would have resented as a deep wrong if it had been practised on himself
That was a reflection that marred the consoling prospect
Arthurs cheeks even burned in mingled shame and irritation at the thought
But what could a man do in such a dilemma
He was bound in honour to say no word that could injure Hetty his first duty was to guard her
He would never have told or acted a lie on his own account
Good God
What a miserable fool he was to have brought himself into such a dilemma and yet if ever a man had excuses he had
Pity that consequences are determined not by excuses but by actions
Well the letter must be written it was the only means that promised a solution of the difficulty
The tears came into Arthurs eyes as he thought of Hetty reading it but it would be almost as hard for him to write it he was not doing anything easy to himself and this last thought helped him to arrive at a conclusion
He could never deliberately have taken a step which inflicted pain on another and left himself at ease
Even a movement of jealousy at the thought of giving up Hetty to Adam went to convince him that he was making a sacrifice
When once he had come to this conclusion he turned Meg round and set off home again in a canter
The letter should be written the first thing and the rest of the day would be filled up with other business he should have no time to look behind him
Happily Irwine and Gawaine were coming to dinner and by twelve oclock the next day he should have left the Chase miles behind him
There was some security in this constant occupation against an uncontrollable impulse seizing him to rush to Hetty and thrust into her hand some mad proposition that would undo everything
Faster and faster went the sensitive Meg at every slight sign from her rider till the canter had passed into a swift gallop
I thought they said th young mester war took ill last night said sour old John the groom at dinnertime in the servants hall
Hes been ridin fit to split the mare i two this forenoon
Thats happen one o the symptims John said the facetious coachman
Then I wish he war let blood for t thats all said John grimly
Adam had been early at the Chase to know how Arthur was and had been relieved from all anxiety about the effects of his blow by learning that he was gone out for a ride
At five oclock he was punctually there again and sent up word of his arrival
In a few minutes Pym came down with a letter in his hand and gave it to Adam saying that the captain was too busy to see him and had written everything he had to say
The letter was directed to Adam but he went out of doors again before opening it
It contained a sealed enclosure directed to Hetty
On the inside of the cover Adam read In the enclosed letter I have written everything you wish
I leave it to you to decide whether you will be doing best to deliver it to Hetty or to return it to me
Ask yourself once more whether you are not taking a measure which may pain her more than mere silence
There is no need for our seeing each other again now
We shall meet with better feelings some months hence
AD Perhaps hes i th right on t not to see me thought Adam
Its no use meeting to say more hard words and its no use meeting to shake hands and say were friends again
Were not friends an its better not to pretend it
I know forgiveness is a mans duty but to my thinking that can only mean as youre to give up all thoughts o taking revenge it can never mean as youre t have your old feelings back again for thats not possible
Hes not the same man to me and I cant feel the same towards him
God help me
I dont know whether I feel the same towards anybody I seem as if Id been measuring my work from a false line and had got it all to measure over again
But the question about delivering the letter to Hetty soon absorbed Adams thoughts
Arthur had procured some relief to himself by throwing the decision on Adam with a warning and Adam who was not given to hesitation hesitated here
He determined to feel his wayto ascertain as well as he could what was Hettys state of mind before he decided on delivering the letter
Chapter XXX The Delivery of the Letter THE next Sunday Adam joined the Poysers on their way out of church hoping for an invitation to go home with them
He had the letter in his pocket and was anxious to have an opportunity of talking to Hetty alone
He could not see her face at church for she had changed her seat and when he came up to her to shake hands her manner was doubtful and constrained
He expected this for it was the first time she had met him since she had been aware that he had seen her with Arthur in the Grove
Come youll go on with us Adam Mr Poyser said when they reached the turning and as soon as they were in the fields Adam ventured to offer his arm to Hetty
The children soon gave them an opportunity of lingering behind a little and then Adam said Will you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you this evening if it keeps fine Hetty
Ive something particlar to talk to you about
Hetty said Very well
She was really as anxious as Adam was that she should have some private talk with him
She wondered what he thought of her and Arthur
He must have seen them kissing she knew but she had no conception of the scene that had taken place between Arthur and Adam
Her first feeling had been that Adam would be very angry with her and perhaps would tell her aunt and uncle but it never entered her mind that he would dare to say anything to Captain Donnithorne
It was a relief to her that he behaved so kindly to her today and wanted to speak to her alone for she had trembled when she found he was going home with them lest he should mean to tell
But now he wanted to talk to her by herself she should learn what he thought and what he meant to do
She felt a certain confidence that she could persuade him not to do anything she did not want him to do she could perhaps even make him believe that she didnt care for Arthur and as long as Adam thought there was any hope of her having him he would do just what she liked she knew
Besides she MUST go on seeming to encourage Adam lest her uncle and aunt should be angry and suspect her of having some secret lover
Hettys little brain was busy with this combination as she hung on Adams arm and said yes or no to some slight observations of his about the many hawthornberries there would be for the birds this next winter and the lowhanging clouds that would hardly hold up till morning
And when they rejoined her aunt and uncle she could pursue her thoughts without interruption for Mr Poyser held that though a young man might like to have the woman he was courting on his arm he would nevertheless be glad of a little reasonable talk about business the while and for his own part he was curious to heal the most recent news about the Chase Farm
So through the rest of the walk he claimed Adams conversation for himself and Hetty laid her small plots and imagined her little scenes of cunning blandishment as she walked along by the hedgerows on honest Adams arm quite as well as if she had been an elegantly clad coquette alone in her boudoir
For if a country beauty in clumsy shoes be only shallowhearted enough it is astonishing how closely her mental processes may resemble those of a lady in society and crinoline who applies her refined intellect to the problem of committing indiscretions without compromising herself
Perhaps the resemblance was not much the less because Hetty felt very unhappy all the while
The parting with Arthur was a double pain to hermingling with the tumult of passion and vanity there was a dim undefined fear that the future might shape itself in some way quite unlike her dream
She clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had uttered in their last meeting I shall come again at Christmas and then we will see what can be done
She clung to the belief that he was so fond of her he would never be happy without her and she still hugged her secret that a great gentleman loved herwith gratified pride as a superiority over all the girls she knew
But the uncertainty of the future the possibilities to which she could give no shape began to press upon her like the invisible weight of air she was alone on her little island of dreams and all around her was the dark unknown water where Arthur was gone
She could gather no elation of spirits now by looking forward but only by looking backward to build confidence on past words and caresses
But occasionally since Thursday evening her dim anxieties had been almost lost behind the more definite fear that Adam might betray what he knew to her uncle and aunt and his sudden proposition to talk with her alone had set her thoughts to work in a new way
She was eager not to lose this evenings opportunity and after tea when the boys were going into the garden and Totty begged to go with them Hetty said with an alacrity that surprised Mrs Poyser Ill go with her Aunt
It did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he would go too and soon he and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the filberttrees while the boys were busy elsewhere gathering the large unripe nuts to play at cobnut with and Totty was watching them with a puppylike air of contemplation
It was but a short timehardly two monthssince Adam had had his mind filled with delicious hopes as he stood by Hettys side un this garden
The remembrance of that scene had often been with him since Thursday evening the sunlight through the appletree boughs the red bunches Hettys sweet blush
It came importunately now on this sad evening with the lowhanging clouds but he tried to suppress it lest some emotion should impel him to say more than was needful for Hettys sake
After what I saw on Thursday night Hetty he began you wont think me making too free in what Im going to say
If you was being courted by any man as ud make you his wife and Id known you was fond of him and meant to have him I should have no right to speak a word to you about it but when I see youre being made love to by a gentleman as can never marry you and doesna think o marrying you I feel bound t interfere for you
I cant speak about it to them as are i the place o your parents for that might bring worse trouble thans needful
Adams words relieved one of Hettys fears but they also carried a meaning which sickened her with a strengthened foreboding
She was pale and trembling and yet she would have angrily contradicted Adam if she had dared to betray her feelings
But she was silent
Youre so young you know Hetty he went on almost tenderly and y havent seen much o what goes on in the world
Its right for me to do what I can to save you from getting into trouble for want o your knowing where youre being led to
If anybody besides me knew what I know about your meeting a gentleman and having fine presents from him theyd speak light on you and youd lose your character
And besides that youll have to suffer in your feelings wi giving your love to a man as can never marry you so as he might take care of you all your life
Adam paused and looked at Hetty who was plucking the leaves from the filberttrees and tearing them up in her hand
Her little plans and preconcerted speeches had all forsaken her like an ill learnt lesson under the terrible agitation produced by Adams words
There was a cruel force in their calm certainty which threatened to grapple and crush her flimsy hopes and fancies
She wanted to resist themshe wanted to throw them off with angry contradictionbut the determination to conceal what she felt still governed her
It was nothing more than a blind prompting now for she was unable to calculate the effect of her words
Youve no right to say as I love him she said faintly but impetuously plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up
She was very beautiful in her paleness and agitation with her dark childish eyes dilated and her breath shorter than usual
Adams heart yearned over her as he looked at her
Ah if he could but comfort her and soothe her and save her from this pain if he had but some sort of strength that would enable him to rescue her poor troubled mind as he would have rescued her body in the face of all danger
I doubt it must be so Hetty he said tenderly for I canna believe youd let any man kiss you by yourselves and give you a gold box with his hair and go awalking i the Grove to meet him if you didna love him
Im not blaming you for I know it ud begin by little and little till at last youd not be able to throw it off
Its him I blame for stealing your love i that way when he knew he could never make you the right amends
Hes been trifling with you and making a plaything of you and caring nothing about you as a man ought to care
Yes he does care for me I know better nor you Hetty burst out
Everything was forgotten but the pain and anger she felt at Adams words
Nay Hetty said Adam if hed cared for you rightly hed never ha behaved so
He told me himself he meant nothing by his kissing and presents and he wanted to make me believe as you thought light of em too
But I know better nor that
I cant help thinking as youve been trusting to his loving you well enough to marry you for all hes a gentleman
And thats why I must speak to you about it Hetty for fear you should be deceiving yourself
Its never entered his head the thought o marrying you
How do you know
How durst you say so
said Hetty pausing in her walk and trembling
The terrible decision of Adams tone shook her with fear
She had no presence of mind left for the reflection that Arthur would have his reasons for not telling the truth to Adam
Her words and look were enough to determine Adam he must give her the letter
Perhaps you cant believe me Hetty because you think too well of himbecause you think he loves you better than he does
But Ive got a letter i my pocket as he wrote himself for me to give you
Ive not read the letter but he says hes told you the truth in it
But before I give you the letter consider Hetty and dont let it take too much hold on you
It wouldna ha been good for you if hed wanted to do such a mad thing as marry you it ud ha led to no happiness i th end
Hetty said nothing she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a letter which Adam had not read
There would be something quite different in it from what he thought
Adam took out the letter but he held it in his hand still while he said in a tone of tender entreaty Dont you bear me ill will Hetty because Im the means o bringing you this pain
God knows Id ha borne a good deal worse for the sake o sparing it you
And thinktheres nobody but me knows about this and Ill take care of you as if I was your brother
Youre the same as ever to me for I dont believe youve done any wrong knowingly
Hetty had laid her hand on the letter but Adam did not loose it till he had done speaking
She took no notice of what he said she had not listened but when he loosed the letter she put it into her pocket without opening it and then began to walk more quickly as if she wanted to go in
Youre in the right not to read it just yet said Adam
Read it when youre by yourself
But stay out a little bit longer and let us call the children you look so white and ill your aunt may take notice of it
Hetty heard the warning
It recalled to her the necessity of rallying her native powers of concealment which had half given way under the shock of Adams words
And she had the letter in her pocket she was sure there was comfort in that letter in spite of Adam
She ran to find Totty and soon reappeared with recovered colour leading Totty who was making a sour face because she had been obliged to throw away an unripe apple that she had set her small teeth in
Hegh Totty said Adam come and ride on my shoulderever so highyoull touch the tops o the trees
What little child ever refused to be comforted by that glorious sense of being seized strongly and swung upward
I dont believe Ganymede cried when the eagle carried him away and perhaps deposited him on Joves shoulder at the end
Totty smiled down complacently from her secure height and pleasant was the sight to the mothers eyes as she stood at the house door and saw Adam coming with his small burden
Bless your sweet face my pet she said the mothers strong love filling her keen eyes with mildness as Totty leaned forward and put out her arms
She had no eyes for Hetty at that moment and only said without looking at her You go and draw some ale Hetty the gells are both at the cheese
After the ale had been drawn and her uncles pipe lighted there was Totty to be taken to bed and brought down again in her night gown because she would cry instead of going to sleep
Then there was supper to be got ready and Hetty must be continually in the way to give help
Adam stayed till he knew Mrs Poyser expected him to go engaging her and her husband in talk as constantly as he could for the sake of leaving Hetty more at ease
He lingered because he wanted to see her safely through that evening and he was delighted to find how much selfcommand she showed
He knew she had not had time to read the letter but he did not know she was buoyed up by a secret hope that the letter would contradict everything he had said
It was hard work for him to leave herhard to think that he should not know for days how she was bearing her trouble
But he must go at last and all he could do was to press her hand gently as he said Goodbye and hope she would take that as a sign that if his love could ever be a refuge for her it was there the same as ever
How busy his thoughts were as he walked home in devising pitying excuses for her folly in referring all her weakness to the sweet lovingness of her nature in blaming Arthur with less and less inclination to admit that his conduct might be extenuated too
His exasperation at Hettys sufferingand also at the sense that she was possibly thrust for ever out of his own reachdeafened him to any plea for the miscalled friend who had wrought this misery
Adam was a clearsighted fairminded mana fine fellow indeed morally as well as physically
But if Aristides the Just was ever in love and jealous he was at that moment not perfectly magnanimous
And I cannot pretend that Adam in these painful days felt nothing but righteous indignation and loving pity
He was bitterly jealous and in proportion as his love made him indulgent in his judgment of Hetty the bitterness found a vent in his feeling towards Arthur
Her head was allays likely to be turned he thought when a gentleman with his fine manners and fine clothes and his white hands and that way o talking gentlefolks have came about her making up to her in a bold way as a man couldnt do that was only her equal and its much if shell ever like a common man now
He could not help drawing his own hands out of his pocket and looking at themat the hard palms and the broken fingernails
Im a roughish fellow altogether I dont know now I come to think ont what there is much for a woman to like about me and yet I might ha got another wife easy enough if I hadnt set my heart on her
But its little matter what other women think about me if she cant love me
She might ha loved me perhaps as likely as any other mantheres nobody hereabouts as Im afraid of if he hadnt come between us but now I shall belike be hateful to her because Im so different to him
And yet theres no tellingshe may turn round the other way when she finds hes made light of her all the while
She may come to feel the vally of a man as ud be thankful to be bound to her all his life
But I must put up with it whichever way it isIve only to be thankful its been no worse
I am not th only man thats got to do without much happiness i this life
Theres many a good bit o work done with a bad heart
Its Gods will and thats enough for us we shouldnt know better how things ought to be than He does I reckon if we was to spend our lives i puzzling
But it ud ha gone near to spoil my work for me if Id seen her brought to sorrow and shame and through the man as Ive always been proud to think on
Since Ive been spared that Ive no right to grumble
When a mans got his limbs whole he can bear a smart cut or two
As Adam was getting over a stile at this point in his reflections he perceived a man walking along the field before him
He knew it was Seth returning from an evening preaching and made haste to overtake him
I thought theedst be at home before me he said as Seth turned round to wait for him for Im later than usual tonight
Well Im later too for I got into talk after meeting with John Barnes who has lately professed himself in a state of perfection and Id a question to ask him about his experience
Its one o them subjects that lead you further than y expect they dont lie along the straight road
They walked along together in silence two or three minutes
Adam was not inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious experience but he was inclined to interchange a word or two of brotherly affection and confidence with Seth
That was a rare impulse in him much as the brothers loved each other
They hardly ever spoke of personal matters or uttered more than an allusion to their family troubles
Adam was by nature reserved in all matters of feeling and Seth felt a certain timidity towards his more practical brother
Seth lad Adam said putting his arm on his brothers shoulder hast heard anything from Dinah Morris since she went away
Yes said Seth
She told me I might write her word after a while how we went on and how mother bore up under her trouble
So I wrote to her a fortnight ago and told her about thee having a new employment and how Mother was more contented and last Wednesday when I called at the post at Treddleson I found a letter from her
I think theedst perhaps like to read it but I didna say anything about it because theest seemed so full of other things
Its quite easy t readshe writes wonderful for a woman
Seth had drawn the letter from his pocket and held it out to Adam who said as he took it Aye lad Ive got a tough load to carry just nowthee mustna take it ill if Im a bit silenter and crustier nor usual
Trouble doesna make me care the less for thee
I know we shall stick together to the last
I take nought ill o thee Adam
I know well enough what it means if theet a bit short wi me now and then
Theres Mother opening the door to look out for us said Adam as they mounted the slope
Shes been sitting i the dark as usual
Well Gyp well art glad to see me
Lisbeth went in again quickly and lighted a candle for she had heard the welcome rustling of footsteps on the grass before Gyps joyful bark
Eh my lads
Th hours war neer so long sin I war born as theyn been this blessed Sunday night
What can ye both ha been doin till this time
Thee shouldstna sit i the dark Mother said Adam that makes the time seem longer
Eh what am I to do wi burnin candle of a Sunday when theres ony me an its sin to do a bit o knittin
The daylights long enough for me to stare i the booke as I canna read
It ud be a fine way o shortenin the time to make it waste the good candle
But which on yous for hain supper
Ye mun ayther be clemmed or full I should think seein what time o night it is
Im hungry Mother said Seth seating himself at the little table which had been spread ever since it was light
Ive had my supper said Adam
Here Gyp he added taking some cold potato from the table and rubbing the rough grey head that looked up towards him
Thee needstna be giin th dog said Lisbeth In fed him well aready
Im not like to forget him I reckon when hes all o thee I can get sight on
Come then Gyp said Adam well go to bed
Goodnight Mother Im very tired
What ails him dost know
Lisbeth said to Seth when Adam was gone upstairs
Hes like as if he was struck for death this day or twohes so cast down
I found him i the shop this forenoon arter thee wast gone asittin an doin nothinnot so much as a booke afore him
Hes a deal o work upon him just now Mother said Seth and I think hes a bit troubled in his mind
Dont you take notice of it because it hurts him when you do
Be as kind to him as you can Mother and dont say anything to vex him
Eh what dost talk o my vexin him
An what am I like to be but kind
Ill ma him a kettlecake for breakfast i the mornin
Adam meanwhile was reading Dinahs letter by the light of his dip candle
DEAR BROTHER SETHYour letter lay three days beyond my knowing of it at the post for I had not money enough by me to pay the carriage this being a time of great need and sickness here with the rains that have fallen as if the windows of heaven were opened again and to lay by money from day to day in such a time when there are so many in present need of all things would be a want of trust like the laying up of the manna
I speak of this because I would not have you think me slow to answer or that I had small joy in your rejoicing at the worldly good that has befallen your brother Adam
The honour and love you bear him is nothing but meet for God has given him great gifts and he uses them as the patriarch Joseph did who when he was exalted to a place of power and trust yet yearned with tenderness towards his parent and his younger brother
My heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to be near her in the day of trouble
Speak to her of me and tell her I often bear her in my thoughts at evening time when I am sitting in the dim light as I did with her and we held one anothers hands and I spoke the words of comfort that were given to me
Ah that is a blessed time isnt it Seth when the outward light is fading and the body is a little wearied with its work and its labour
Then the inward light shines the brighter and we have a deeper sense of resting on the Divine strength
I sit on my chair in the dark room and close my eyes and it is as if I was out of the body and could feel no want for evermore
For then the very hardship and the sorrow and the blindness and the sin I have beheld and been ready to weep overyea all the anguish of the children of men which sometimes wraps me round like sudden darknessI can bear with a willing pain as if I was sharing the Redeemers cross
For I feel it I feel itinfinite love is suffering tooyea in the fulness of knowledge it suffers it yearns it mourns and that is a blind selfseeking which wants to be freed from the sorrow wherewith the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
Surely it is not true blessedness to be free from sorrow while there is sorrow and sin in the world sorrow is then a part of love and love does not seek to throw it off
It is not the spirit only that tells me thisI see it in the whole work and word of the Gospel
Is there not pleading in heaven
Is not the Man of Sorrows there in that crucified body wherewith he ascended
And is He not one with the Infinite Love itselfas our love is one with our sorrow
These thoughts have been much borne in on me of late and I have seen with new clearness the meaning of those words If any man love me let him take up my cross
I have heard this enlarged on as if it meant the troubles and persecutions we bring on ourselves by confessing Jesus
But surely that is a narrow thought
The true cross of the Redeemer was the sin and sorrow of this world that was what lay heavy on his heartand that is the cross we shall share with him that is the cup we must drink of with him if we would have any part in that Divine Love which is one with his sorrow
In my outward lot which you ask about I have all things and abound
I have had constant work in the mill though some of the other hands have been turned off for a time and my body is greatly strengthened so that I feel little weariness after long walking and speaking
What you say about staying in your own country with your mother and brother shows me that you have a true guidance your lot is appointed there by a clear showing and to seek a greater blessing elsewhere would be like laying a false offering on the altar and expecting the fire from heaven to kindle it
My work and my joy are here among the hills and I sometimes think I cling too much to my life among the people here and should be rebellious if I was called away
I was thankful for your tidings about the dear friends at the Hall Farm for though I sent them a letter by my aunts desire after I came back from my sojourn among them I have had no word from them
My aunt has not the pen of a ready writer and the work of the house is sufficient for the day for she is weak in body
My heart cleaves to her and her children as the nearest of all to me in the fleshyea and to all in that house
I am carried away to them continually in my sleep and often in the midst of work and even of speech the thought of them is borne in on me as if they were in need and trouble which yet is dark to me
There may be some leading here but I wait to be taught
You say they are all well
We shall see each other again in the body I trust though it may be not for a long while for the brethren and sisters at Leeds are desirous to have me for a short space among them when I have a door opened me again to leave Snowfield
Farewell dear brotherand yet not farewell
For those children of God whom it has been granted to see each other face to face and to hold communion together and to feel the same spirit working in both can never more be sundered though the hills may lie between
For their souls are enlarged for evermore by that union and they bear one another about in their thoughts continually as it were a new strengthYour faithful Sister and fellowworker in Christ DINAH MORRIS
I have not skill to write the words so small as you do and my pen moves slow
And so I am straitened and say but little of what is in my mind
Greet your mother for me with a kiss
She asked me to kiss her twice when we parted
Adam had refolded the letter and was sitting meditatively with his head resting on his arm at the head of the bed when Seth came upstairs
Hast read the letter
said Seth
Yes said Adam
I dont know what I should ha thought of her and her letter if Id never seen her I daresay I should ha thought a preaching woman hateful
But shes one as makes everything seem right she says and does and I seemed to see her and hear her speaking when I read the letter
Its wonderful how I remember her looks and her voice
Shed make thee rare and happy Seth shes just the woman for thee
Its no use thinking o that said Seth despondingly
She spoke so firm and shes not the woman to say one thing and mean another
Nay but her feelings may grow different
A woman may get to love by degreesthe best fire dosna flare up the soonest
Id have thee go and see her by and by Id make it convenient for thee to be away three or four days and it ud be no walk for theeonly between twenty and thirty mile
I should like to see her again whether or no if she wouldna be displeased with me for going said Seth
Shell be none displeased said Adam emphatically getting up and throwing off his coat
It might be a great happiness to us all if shed have thee for mother took to her so wonderful and seemed so contented to be with her
Aye said Seth rather timidly and Dinahs fond o Hetty too she thinks a deal about her
Adam made no reply to that and no other word but goodnight passed between them
Chapter XXXI In Hettys BedChamber IT was no longer light enough to go to bed without a candle even in Mrs Poysers early household and Hetty carried one with her as she went up at last to her bedroom soon after Adam was gone and bolted the door behind her
Now she would read her letter
It mustit must have comfort in it
How was Adam to know the truth
It was always likely he should say what he did say
She set down the candle and took out the letter
It had a faint scent of roses which made her feel as if Arthur were close to her
She put it to her lips and a rush of remembered sensations for a moment or two swept away all fear
But her heart began to flutter strangely and her hands to tremble as she broke the seal
She read slowly it was not easy for her to read a gentlemans handwriting though Arthur had taken pains to write plainly
DEAREST HETTYI have spoken truly when I have said that I loved you and I shall never forget our love
I shall be your true friend as long as life lasts and I hope to prove this to you in many ways
If I say anything to pain you in this letter do not believe it is for want of love and tenderness towards you for there is nothing I would not do for you if I knew it to be really for your happiness
I cannot bear to think of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss them away and if I followed only my own inclinations I should be with her at this moment instead of writing
It is very hard for me to part from herharder still for me to write words which may seem unkind though they spring from the truest kindness
Dear dear Hetty sweet as our love has been to me sweet as it would be to me for you to love me always I feel that it would have been better for us both if we had never had that happiness and that it is my duty to ask you to love me and care for me as little as you can
The fault has all been mine for though I have been unable to resist the longing to be near you I have felt all the while that your affection for me might cause you grief
I ought to have resisted my feelings
I should have done so if I had been a better fellow than I am but now since the past cannot be altered I am bound to save you from any evil that I have power to prevent
And I feel it would be a great evil for you if your affections continued so fixed on me that you could think of no other man who might be able to make you happier by his love than I ever can and if you continued to look towards something in the future which cannot possibly happen
For dear Hetty if I were to do what you one day spoke of and make you my wife I should do what you yourself would come to feel was for your misery instead of your welfare
I know you can never be happy except by marrying a man in your own station and if I were to marry you now I should only be adding to any wrong I have done besides offending against my duty in the other relations of life
You know nothing dear Hetty of the world in which I must always live and you would soon begin to dislike me because there would be so little in which we should be alike
And since I cannot marry you we must partwe must try not to feel like lovers any more
I am miserable while I say this but nothing else can be
Be angry with me my sweet one I deserve it but do not believe that I shall not always care for you always be grateful to youalways remember my Hetty and if any trouble should come that we do not now foresee trust in me to do everything that lies in my power
I have told you where you are to direct a letter to if you want to write but I put it down below lest you should have forgotten
Do not write unless there is something I can really do for you for dear Hetty we must try to think of each other as little as we can
Forgive me and try to forget everything about me except that I shall be as long as I live your affectionate friend ARTHUR DONNITHORNE
Slowly Hetty had read this letter and when she looked up from it there was the reflection of a blanched face in the old dim glass a white marble face with rounded childish forms but with something sadder than a childs pain in it
Hetty did not see the faceshe saw nothingshe only felt that she was cold and sick and trembling
The letter shook and rustled in her hand
She laid it down
It was a horrible sensationthis cold and trembling
It swept away the very ideas that produced it and Hetty got up to reach a warm cloak from her clothespress wrapped it round her and sat as if she were thinking of nothing but getting warm
Presently she took up the letter with a firmer hand and began to read it through again
The tears came this timegreat rushing tears that blinded her and blotched the paper
She felt nothing but that Arthur was cruelcruel to write so cruel not to marry her
Reasons why he could not marry her had no existence for her mind how could she believe in any misery that could come to her from the fulfilment of all she had been longing for and dreaming of
She had not the ideas that could make up the notion of that misery
As she threw down the letter again she caught sight of her face in the glass it was reddened now and wet with tears it was almost like a companion that she might complain tothat would pity her
She leaned forward on her elbows and looked into those dark overflooding eyes and at the quivering mouth and saw how the tears came thicker and thicker and how the mouth became convulsed with sobs
The shattering of all her little dreamworld the crushing blow on her newborn passion afflicted her pleasurecraving nature with an overpowering pain that annihilated all impulse to resistance and suspended her anger
She sat sobbing till the candle went out and then wearied aching stupefied with crying threw herself on the bed without undressing and went to sleep
There was a feeble dawn in the room when Hetty awoke a little after four oclock with a sense of dull misery the cause of which broke upon her gradually as she began to discern the objects round her in the dim light
And then came the frightening thought that she had to conceal her misery as well as to bear it in this dreary daylight that was coming
She could lie no longer
She got up and went towards the table there lay the letter
She opened her treasuredrawer there lay the earrings and the locketthe signs of all her short happinessthe signs of the lifelong dreariness that was to follow it
Looking at the little trinkets which she had once eyed and fingered so fondly as the earnest of her future paradise of finery she lived back in the moments when they had been given to her with such tender caresses such strangely pretty words such glowing looks which filled her with a bewildering delicious surprisethey were so much sweeter than she had thought anything could be
And the Arthur who had spoken to her and looked at her in this way who was present with her nowwhose arm she felt round her his cheek against hers his very breath upon herwas the cruel cruel Arthur who had written that letter that letter which she snatched and crushed and then opened again that she might read it once more
The halfbenumbed mental condition which was the effect of the last nights violent crying made it necessary to her to look again and see if her wretched thoughts were actually trueif the letter was really so cruel
She had to hold it close to the window else she could not have read it by the faint light
Yes
It was worseit was more cruel
She crushed it up again in anger
She hated the writer of that letterhated him for the very reason that she hung upon him with all her loveall the girlish passion and vanity that made up her love
She had no tears this morning
She had wept them all away last night and now she felt that dryeyed morning misery which is worse than the first shock because it has the future in it as well as the present
Every morning to come as far as her imagination could stretch she would have to get up and feel that the day would have no joy for her
For there is no despair so absolute as that which comes with the first moments of our first great sorrow when we have not yet known what it is to have suffered and be healed to have despaired and to have recovered hope
As Hetty began languidly to take off the clothes she had worn all the night that she might wash herself and brush her hair she had a sickening sense that her life would go on in this way
She should always be doing things she had no pleasure in getting up to the old tasks of work seeing people she cared nothing about going to church and to Treddleston and to tea with Mrs Best and carrying no happy thought with her
For her short poisonous delights had spoiled for ever all the little joys that had once made the sweetness of her lifethe new frock ready for Treddleston Fair the party at Mr Brittons at Broxton wake the beaux that she would say No to for a long while and the prospect of the wedding that was to come at last when she would have a silk gown and a great many clothes all at once
These things were all flat and dreary to her now everything would be a weariness and she would carry about for ever a hopeless thirst and longing
She paused in the midst of her languid undressing and leaned against the dark old clothespress
Her neck and arms were bare her hair hung down in delicate ringsand they were just as beautiful as they were that night two months ago when she walked up and down this bedchamber glowing with vanity and hope
She was not thinking of her neck and arms now even her own beauty was indifferent to her
Her eyes wandered sadly over the dull old chamber and then looked out vacantly towards the growing dawn
Did a remembrance of Dinah come across her mind
Of her foreboding words which had made her angry
Of Dinahs affectionate entreaty to think of her as a friend in trouble
No the impression had been too slight to recur
Any affection or comfort Dinah could have given her would have been as indifferent to Hetty this morning as everything else was except her bruised passion
She was only thinking she could never stay here and go on with the old lifeshe could better bear something quite new than sinking back into the old everyday round
She would like to run away that very morning and never see any of the old faces again
But Hettys was not a nature to face difficultiesto dare to loose her hold on the familiar and rush blindly on some unknown condition
Hers was a luxurious and vain naturenot a passionate oneand if she were ever to take any violent measure she must be urged to it by the desperation of terror
There was not much room for her thoughts to travel in the narrow circle of her imagination and she soon fixed on the one thing she would do to get away from her old life she would ask her uncle to let her go to be a ladys maid
Miss Lydias maid would help her to get a situation if she krew Hetty had her uncles leave
When she had thought of this she fastened up her hair and began to wash it seemed more possible to her to go downstairs and try to behave as usual
She would ask her uncle this very day
On Hettys blooming health it would take a great deal of such mental suffering as hers to leave any deep impress and when she was dressed as neatly as usual in her workingdress with her hair tucked up under her little cap an indifferent observer would have been more struck with the young roundness of her cheek and neck and the darkness of her eyes and eyelashes than with any signs of sadness about her
But when she took up the crushed letter and put it in her drawer that she might lock it out of sight hard smarting tears having no relief in them as the great drops had that fell last night forced their way into her eyes
She wiped them away quickly she must not cry in the daytime
Nobody should find out how miserable she was nobody should know she was disappointed about anything and the thought that the eyes of her aunt and uncle would be upon her gave her the selfcommand which often accompanies a great dread
For Hetty looked out from her secret misery towards the possibility of their ever knowing what had happened as the sick and weary prisoner might think of the possible pillory
They would think her conduct shameful and shame was torture
That was poor little Hettys conscience
So she locked up her drawer and went away to her early work
In the evening when Mr Poyser was smoking his pipe and his goodnature was therefore at its superlative moment Hetty seized the opportunity of her aunts absence to say Uncle I wish youd let me go for a ladys maid
Mr Poyser took the pipe from his mouth and looked at Hetty in mild surprise for some moments
She was sewing and went on with her work industriously
Why whats put that into your head my wench
he said at last after he had given one conservative puff
I should like itI should like it better than farmwork
Nay nay you fancy so because you donna know it my wench
It wouldnt be half so good for your health nor for your luck i life
Id like you to stay wi us till youve got a good husband youre my own niece and I wouldnt have you go to service though it was a gentlemans house as long as Ive got a home for you
Mr Poyser paused and puffed away at his pipe
I like the needlework said Hetty and I should get good wages
Has your aunt been a bit sharp wi you
said Mr Poyser not noticing Hettys further argument
You mustna mind that my wenchshe does it for your good
She wishes you well an there isnt many aunts as are no kin to you ud ha done by you as she has
No it isnt my aunt said Hetty but I should like the work better
It was all very well for you to learn the work a bitan I gev my consent to that fast enough sin Mrs Pomfret was willing to teach you
For if anything was t happen its well to know how to turn your hand to different sorts o things
But I niver meant you to go to service my wench my familys ate their own bread and cheese as fur back as anybody knows hanna they Father
You wouldna like your grandchild to take wage
Naay said old Martin with an elongation of the word meant to make it bitter as well as negative while he leaned forward and looked down on the floor
But the wench takes arter her mother
Id hard work t hould HER in an she married i spite o mea feller wi ony two head o stock when there should ha been ten ons farmshe might well die o th inflammation afore she war thirty
It was seldom the old man made so long a speech but his sons question had fallen like a bit of dry fuel on the embers of a long unextinguished resentment which had always made the grandfather more indifferent to Hetty than to his sons children
Her mothers fortune had been spent by that goodfornought Sorrel and Hetty had Sorrels blood in her veins
Poor thing poor thing
said Martin the younger who was sorry to have provoked this retrospective harshness
Shed but bad luck
But Hettys got as good a chance o getting a solid sober husband as any gell i this country
After throwing out this pregnant hint Mr Poyser recurred to his pipe and his silence looking at Hetty to see if she did not give some sign of having renounced her illadvised wish
But instead of that Hetty in spite of herself began to cry half out of ill temper at the denial half out of the days repressed sadness
Hegh hegh
said Mr Poyser meaning to check her playfully dont lets have any crying
Cryings for them as ha got no home not for them as want to get rid o one
What dost think
he continued to his wife who now came back into the houseplace knitting with fierce rapidity as if that movement were a necessary function like the twittering of a crabs antennae
Think
Why I think we shall have the fowl stole before we are much older wi that gell forgetting to lock the pens up o nights
Whats the matter now Hetty
What are you crying at
Why shes been wanting to go for a ladys maid said Mr Poyser
I tell her we can do better for her nor that
I thought shed got some maggot in her head shes gone about wi her mouth buttoned up so all day
Its all wi going so among them servants at the Chase as we war fools for letting her
She thinks it ud be a finer life than being wi them as are akin to her and ha brought her up sin she war no bigger nor Marty
She thinks theres nothing belongs to being a ladys maid but wearing finer clothes nor she was born to Ill be bound
Its what rag she can get to stick on her as shes thinking on from morning till night as I often ask her if she wouldnt like to be the mawkin i the field for then shed be made o rags inside and out
Ill never gi my consent to her going for a ladys maid while shes got good friends to take care on her till shes married to somebody better nor one o them valets as is neither a common man nor a gentleman an must live on the fat o the land ans like enough to stick his hands under his coattails and expect his wife to work for him
Aye aye said Mr Poyser we must have a better husband for her nor that and theres better at hand
Come my wench give over crying and get to bed
Ill do better for you nor letting you go for a ladys maid
Lets hear no more ont
When Hetty was gone upstairs he said I canna make it out as she should want to go away for I thought shed got a mind t Adam Bede
Shes looked like it o late
Eh theres no knowing what shes got a liking to for things take no more hold on her than if she was a dried pea
I believe that gell Mollyas is aggravatin enough for the matter o thatbut I believe shed care more about leaving us and the children for all shes been here but a year come Michaelmas nor Hetty would
But shes got this notion o being a ladys maid wi going among them servantswe might ha known what it ud lead to when we let her go to learn the fine work
But Ill put a stop to it pretty quick
Theedst be sorry to part wi her if it wasnt for her good said Mr Poyser
Shes useful to thee i the work
Sorry
Yes Im fonder on her nor she deservesa little hard hearted hussy wanting to leave us i that way
I cant ha had her about me these seven year I reckon and done for her and taught her everything wiout caring about her
An here Im having linen spun an thinking all the while itll make sheeting and tableclothing for her when shes married an shell live i the parish wi us and never go out of our sightslike a fool as I am for thinking aught about her as is no better nor a cherry wi a hard stone inside it
Nay nay thee mustna make much of a trifle said Mr Poyser soothingly
Shes fond on us Ill be bound but shes young an gets things in her head as she cant rightly give account on
Them young fillies ull run away often wiou knowing why
Her uncles answers however had had another effect on Hetty besides that of disappointing her and making her cry
She knew quite well whom he had in his mind in his allusions to marriage and to a sober solid husband and when she was in her bedroom again the possibility of her marrying Adam presented itself to her in a new light
In a mind where no strong sympathies are at work where there is no supreme sense of right to which the agitated nature can cling and steady itself to quiet endurance one of the first results of sorrow is a desperate vague clutching after any deed that will change the actual condition
Poor Hettys vision of consequences at no time more than a narrow fantastic calculation of her own probable pleasures and pains was now quite shut out by reckless irritation under present suffering and she was ready for one of those convulsive motiveless actions by which wretched men and women leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong misery
Why should she not marry Adam
She did not care what she did so that it made some change in her life
She felt confident that he would still want to marry her and any further thought about Adams happiness in the matter had never yet visited her
Strange
perhaps you will say this rush of impulse towards a course that might have seemed the most repugnant to her present state of mind and in only the second night of her sadness
Yes the actions of a little trivial soul like Hettys struggling amidst the serious sad destinies of a human being are strange
So are the motions of a little vessel without ballast tossed about on a stormy sea
How pretty it looked with its particoloured sail in the sunlight moored in the quiet bay
Let that man bear the loss who loosed it from its moorings
But that will not save the vesselthe pretty thing that might have been a lasting joy
Chapter XXXII Mrs Poyser Has Her Say Out THE next Saturday evening there was much excited discussion at the Donnithorne Arms concerning an incident which had occurred that very dayno less than a second appearance of the smart man in topboots said by some to be a mere farmer in treaty for the Chase Farm by others to be the future steward but by Mr Casson himself the personal witness to the strangers visit pronounced contemptuously to be nothing better than a bailiff such as Satchell had been before him
No one had thought of denying Mr Cassons testimony to the fact that he had seen the stranger nevertheless he proffered various corroborating circumstances
I see him myself he said I see him coming along by the Crab tree Meadow on a baldfaced hoss
Id just been t hev a pintit was half after ten i the forenoon when I hev my pint as reglar as the clockand I says to Knowles as druv up with his waggon Youll get a bit o barley today Knowles I says if you look about you and then I went round by the rickyard and towart the Treddleson road and just as I come up by the big ashtree I see the man i topboots coming along on a baldfaced hossI wish I may never stir if I didnt
And I stood still till he come up and I says Good morning sir I says for I wanted to hear the turn of his tongue as I might know whether he was a thiscountry man so I says Good morning sir it ll old hup for the barley this morning I think
Therell be a bit got hin if weve good luck
And he says Eh ye may be raight theres noo tallin he says and I knowed by thathere Mr Casson gave a winkas he didnt come from a hundred mile off
I daresay hed think me a hodd talker as you Loamshire folks allays does hany one as talks the right language
The right language
said Bartle Massey contemptuously
Youre about as near the right language as a pigs squeaking is like a tune played on a keybugle
Well I dont know answered Mr Casson with an angry smile
I should think a man as has lived among the gentry from a by is likely to know whats the right language pretty nigh as well as a schoolmaster
Aye aye man said Bartle with a tone of sarcastic consolation you talk the right language for you
When Mike Holdsworths goat says baaa its all rightit ud be unnatural for it to make any other noise
The rest of the party being Loamsnire men Mr Casson had the laugh strongly against him and wisely fell back on the previous question which far from being exhausted in a single evening was renewed in the churchyard before service the next day with the fresh interest conferred on all news when there is a fresh person to hear it and that fresh hearer was Martin Poyser who as his wife said never went boozin with that set at Cassons a sittin soakin in drink and looking as wise as a lot o codfish wi red faces
It was probably owing to the conversation she had had with her husband on their way from church concerning this problematic stranger that Mrs Poysers thoughts immediately reverted to him when a day or two afterwards as she was standing at the house door with her knitting in that eager leisure which came to her when the afternoon cleaning was done she saw the old squire enter the yard on his black pony followed by John the groom
She always cited it afterwards as a case of prevision which really had something more in it than her own remarkable penetration that the moment she set eyes on the squire she said to herself I shouldna wonder if hes come about that man as is agoing to take the Chase Farm wanting Poyser to do something for him without pay
But Poysers a fool if he does
Something unwonted must clearly be in the wind for the old squires visits to his tenantry were rare and though Mrs Poyser had during the last twelvemonth recited many imaginary speeches meaning even more than met the ear which she was quite determined to make to him the next time he appeared within the gates of the Hall Farm the speeches had always remained imaginary
Goodday Mrs Poyser said the old squire peering at her with his shortsighted eyesa mode of looking at her which as Mrs Poyser observed allays aggravated me it was as if you was a insect and he was going to dab his fingernail on you
However she said Your servant sir and curtsied with an air of perfect deference as she advanced towards him she was not the woman to misbehave towards her betters and fly in the face of the catechism without severe provocation
Is your husband at home Mrs
Poyser
Yes sir hes only i the rickyard
Ill send for him in a minute if youll please to get down and step in
Thank you I will do so
I want to consult him about a little matter but you are quite as much concerned in it if not more
I must have your opinion too
Hetty run and tell your uncle to come in said Mrs Poyser as they entered the house and the old gentleman bowed low in answer to Hettys curtsy while Totty conscious of a pinafore stained with gooseberry jam stood hiding her face against the clock and peeping round furtively
What a fine old kitchen this is
said Mr Donnithorne looking round admiringly
He always spoke in the same deliberate well chiselled polite way whether his words were sugary or venomous
And you keep it so exquisitely clean Mrs Poyser
I like these premises do you know beyond any on the estate
Well sir since youre fond of em I should be glad if youd let a bit o repairs be done to em for the boardings i that state as were like to be eaten up wi rats and mice and the cellar you may stan up to your knees i water int if you like to go down but perhaps youd rather believe my words
Wont you please to sit down sir
Not yet I must see your dairy
I have not seen it for years and I hear on all hands about your fine cheese and butter said the squire looking politely unconscious that there could be any question on which he and Mrs Poyser might happen to disagree
I think I see the door open there
You must not be surprised if I cast a covetous eye on your cream and butter
I dont expect that Mrs Satchells cream and butter will bear comparison with yours
I cant say sir Im sure
Its seldom I see other folkss butter though theres some on it as ones no need to seethe smells enough
Ah now this I like said Mr Donnithorne looking round at the damp temple of cleanliness but keeping near the door
Im sure I should like my breakfast better if I knew the butter and cream came from this dairy
Thank you that really is a pleasant sight
Unfortunately my slight tendency to rheumatism makes me afraid of damp Ill sit down in your comfortable kitchen
Ah Poyser how do you do
In the midst of business I see as usual
Ive been looking at your wifes beautiful dairythe best manager in the parish is she not
Mr Poyser had just entered in shirtsleeves and open waistcoat with a face a shade redder than usual from the exertion of pitching
As he stood red rotund and radiant before the small wiry cool old gentleman he looked like a prize apple by the side of a withered crab
Will you please to take this chair sir
he said lifting his fathers armchair forward a little youll find it easy
No thank you I never sit in easychairs said the old gentleman seating himself on a small chair near the door
Do you know Mrs Poysersit down pray both of youIve been far from contented for some time with Mrs Satchells dairy management
I think she has not a good method as you have
Indeed sir I cant speak to that said Mrs Poyser in a hard voice rolling and unrolling her knitting and looking icily out of the window as she continued to stand opposite the squire
Poyser might sit down if he liked she thought she wasnt going to sit down as if shed give in to any such smoothtongued palaver
Mr Poyser who looked and felt the reverse of icy did sit down in his threecornered chair
And now Poyser as Satchell is laid up I am intending to let the Chase Farm to a respectable tenant
Im tired of having a farm on my own handsnothing is made the best of in such cases as you know
A satisfactory bailiff is hard to find and I think you and I Poyser and your excellent wife here can enter into a little arrangement in consequence which will be to our mutual advantage
Oh said Mr Poyser with a goodnatured blankness of imagination as to the nature of the arrangement
If Im called upon to speak sir said Mrs Poyser after glancing at her husband with pity at his softness you know better than me but I dont see what the Chase Farm is t us weve cumber enough wi our own farm
Not but what Im glad to hear o anybody respectable coming into the parish theres some as ha been brought in as hasnt been looked on i that character
Youre likely to find Mr Thurle an excellent neighbour I assure yousuch a one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little plan Im going to mention especially as I hope you will find it as much to your own advantage as his
Indeed sir if its anything t our advantage itll be the first offer o the sort Ive heared on
Its them as take advantage that get advantage i this world I think
Folks have to wait long enough afore its brought to em
The fact is Poyser said the squire ignoring Mrs Poysers theory of worldly prosperity there is too much dairy land and too little plough land on the Chase Farm to suit Thurles purposeindeed he will only take the farm on condition of some change in it his wife it appears is not a clever dairywoman like yours
Now the plan Im thinking of is to effect a little exchange
If you were to have the Hollow Pastures you might increase your dairy which must be so profitable under your wifes management and I should request you Mrs Poyser to supply my house with milk cream and butter at the market prices
On the other hand Poyser you might let Thurle have the Lower and Upper Ridges which really with our wet seasons would be a good riddance for you
There is much less risk in dairy land than corn land
Mr Poyser was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees his head on one side and his mouth screwed upapparently absorbed in making the tips of his fingers meet so as to represent with perfect accuracy the ribs of a ship
He was much too acute a man not to see through the whole business and to foresee perfectly what would be his wifes view of the subject but he disliked giving unpleasant answers
Unless it was on a point of farming practice he would rather give up than have a quarrel any day and after all it mattered more to his wife than to him
So after a few moments silence he looked up at her and said mildly What dost say
Mrs Poyser had had her eyes fixed on her husband with cold severity during his silence but now she turned away her head with a toss looked icily at the opposite roof of the cowshed and spearing her knitting together with the loose pin held it firmly between her clasped hands
Say
Why I say you may do as you like about giving up any o your cornland afore your lease is up which it wont be for a year come next Michaelmas but Ill not consent to take more dairy work into my hands either for love or money and theres nayther love nor money here as I can see ony other folkss love o theirselves and the money as is to go into other folkss pockets
I know theres them as is born t own the land and them as is born to sweat onthere Mrs Poyser paused to gasp a little and I know its christened folkss duty to submit to their betters as fur as flesh and blood ull bear it but Ill not make a martyr o myself and wear myself to skin and bone and worret myself as if I was a churn wi butter acoming int for no landlord in England not if he was King George himself
No no my dear Mrs Poyser certainly not said the squire still confident in his own powers of persuasion you must not overwork yourself but dont you think your work will rather be lessened than increased in this way
There is so much milk required at the Abbey that you will have little increase of cheese and butter making from the addition to your dairy and I believe selling the milk is the most profitable way of disposing of dairy produce is it not
Aye thats true said Mr Poyser unable to repress an opinion on a question of farming profits and forgetting that it was not in this case a purely abstract question
I daresay said Mrs Poyser bitterly turning her head halfway towards her husband and looking at the vacant armchairI daresay its true for men as sit i th chimneycorner and make believe as everythings cut wi ins an outs to fit int everything else
If you could make a pudding wi thinking o the batter it ud be easy getting dinner
How do I know whether the milk ull be wanted constant
Whats to make me sure as the house wont be put o board wage afore were many months older and then I may have to lie awake o nights wi twenty gallons o milk on my mindand Dingall ull take no more butter let alone paying for it and we must fat pigs till were obliged to beg the butcher on our knees to buy em and lose half of em wi the measles
And theres the fetching and carrying as ud be welly half a days work for a man an hossthats to be took out o the profits I reckon
But theres folks ud hold a sieve under the pump and expect to carry away the water
That difficultyabout the fetching and carryingyou will not have Mrs Poyser said the squire who thought that this entrance into particulars indicated a distant inclination to compromise on Mrs Poysers part
Bethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony
Oh sir begging your pardon Ive never been used t having gentlefolkss servants coming about my back places amaking love to both the gells at once and keeping em with their hands on their hips listening to all manner o gossip when they should be down on their knees ascouring
If were to go to ruin it shanna be wi having our back kitchen turned into a public
Well Poyser said the squire shifting his tactics and looking as if he thought Mrs Poyser had suddenly withdrawn from the proceedings and left the room you can turn the Hollows into feedingland
I can easily make another arrangement about supplying my house
And I shall not forget your readiness to accommodate your landlord as well as a neighbour
I know you will be glad to have your lease renewed for three years when the present one expires otherwise I daresay Thurle who is a man of some capital would be glad to take both the farms as they could be worked so well together
But I dont want to part with an old tenant like you
To be thrust out of the discussion in this way would have been enough to complete Mrs Poysers exasperation even without the final threat
Her husband really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the old place where he had been bred and bornfor he believed the old squire had small spite enough for anything was beginning a mild remonstrance explanatory of the inconvenience he should find in having to buy and sell more stock with Well sir I think as its rether hard when Mrs Poyser burst in with the desperate determination to have her say out this once though it were to rain notices to quit and the only shelter were the workhouse
Then sir if I may speakas for all Im a woman and theres folks as thinks a womans fool enough to stan by an look on while the men sign her soul away Ive a right to speak for I make one quarter o the rent and save another quarterI say if Mr Thurles so ready to take farms under you its a pity but what he should take this and see if he likes to live in a house wi all the plagues o Egypt intwi the cellar full o water and frogs and toads hoppin up the steps by dozensand the floors rotten and the rats and mice gnawing every bit o cheese and runnin over our heads as we lie i bed till we expect em to eat us up aliveas its a mercy they hanna eat the children long ago
I should like to see if theres another tenant besides Poyser as ud put up wi never having a bit o repairs done till a place tumbles downand not then ony wi begging and praying and having to pay halfand being strung up wi the rent as its much if he gets enough out o the land to pay for all hes put his own money into the ground beforehand
See if youll get a stranger to lead such a life here as that a maggot must be born i the rotten cheese to like it I reckon
You may run away from my words sir continued Mrs Poyser following the old squire beyond the doorfor after the first moments of stunned surprise he had got up and waving his hand towards her with a smile had walked out towards his pony
But it was impossible for him to get away immediately for John was walking the pony up and down the yard and was some distance from the causeway when his master beckoned
You may run away from my words sir and you may go spinnin underhand ways o doing us a mischief for youve got Old Harry to your friend though nobody else is but I tell you for once as were not dumb creatures to be abused and made money on by them as ha got the lash i their hands for want o knowing how t undo the tackle
An if Im th only one as speaks my mind theres plenty o the same way o thinking i this parish and the next to t for your names no better than a brimstone match in everybodys noseif it isna twothree old folks as you think o saving your soul by giving em a bit o flannel and a drop o porridge
An you may be right i thinking itll take but little to save your soul for itll be the smallest savin y iver made wi all your scrapin
There are occasions on which two servantgirls and a waggoner may be a formidable audience and as the squire rode away on his black pony even the gift of shortsightedness did not prevent him from being aware that Molly and Nancy and Tim were grinning not far from him
Perhaps he suspected that sour old John was grinning behind himwhich was also the fact
Meanwhile the bulldog the blackandtan terrier Alicks sheepdog and the gander hissing at a safe distance from the ponys heels carried out the idea of Mrs Poysers solo in an irnpressive quartet
Mrs Poyser however had no sooner seen the pony move off than she turned round gave the two hilarious damsels a look which drove them into the back kitchen and unspearing her knitting began to knit again with her usual rapidity as she reentered the house
Theest done it now said Mr Poyser a little alarmed and uneasy but not without some triumphant amusement at his wifes outbreak
Yes I know Ive done it said Mrs Poyser but Ive had my say out and I shall be th easier fort all my life
Theres no pleasure i living if youre to be corked up for ever and only dribble your mind out by the sly like a leaky barrel
I shant repent saying what I think if I live to be as old as th old squire and theres little likelihoodfor it seems as if them as arent wanted here are th only folks as arent wanted i th other world
But thee wutna like moving from th old place this Michaelmas twelvemonth said Mr Poyser and going into a strange parish where thee knowst nobody
Itll be hard upon us both and upo Father too
Eh its no use worreting theres plenty o things may happen between this and Michaelmas twelvemonth
The captain may be master afore them for what we know said Mrs Poyser inclined to take an unusually hopeful view of an embarrassment which had been brought about by her own merit and not by other peoples fault
IM none for worreting said Mr Poyser rising from his three cornered chair and walking slowly towards the door but I should be loath to leave th old place and the parish where I was bred and born and Father afore me
We should leave our roots behind us I doubt and niver thrive again
Chapter XXXIII More Links THE barley was all carried at last and the harvest suppers went by without waiting for the dismal black crop of beans
The apples and nuts were gathered and stored the scent of whey departed from the farmhouses and the scent of brewing came in its stead
The woods behind the Chase and all the hedgerow trees took on a solemn splendour under the dark lowhanging skies
Michaelmas was come with its fragrant basketfuls of purple damsons and its paler purple daisies and its lads and lasses leaving or seeking service and winding along between the yellow hedges with their bundles under their arms
But though Michaelmas was come Mr Thurle that desirable tenant did not come to the Chase Farm and the old squire afler all had been obliged to put in a new bailiff
It was known throughout the two parishes that the squires plan had been frustrated because the Poysers had refused to be put upon and Mrs Poysers outbreak was discussed in all the farmhouses with a zest which was only heightened by frequent repetition
The news that Bony was come back from Egypt was comparatively insipid and the repulse of the French in Italy was nothing to Mrs Poysers repulse of the old squire
Mr Irwine had heard a version of it in every parishioners house with the one exception of the Chase
But since he had always with marvellous skill avoided any quarrel with Mr Donnithorne he could not allow himself the pleasure of laughing at the old gentlemans discomfiture with any one besides his mother who declared that if she were rich she should like to allow Mrs Poyser a pension for life and wanted to invite her to the parsonage that she might hear an account of the scene from Mrs Poysers own lips
No no Mother said Mr Irwine it was a little bit of irregular justice on Mrs Poysers part but a magistrate like me must not countenance irregular justice
There must be no report spread that I have taken notice of the quarrel else I shall lose the little good influence I have over the old man
Well I like that woman even better than her creamcheeses said Mrs Irwine
She has the spirit of three men with that pale face of hers
And she says such sharp things too
Sharp
Yes her tongue is like a newset razor
Shes quite original in her talk too one of those untaught wits that help to stock a country with proverbs
I told you that capital thing I heard her say about Craigthat he was like a cock who thought the sun had risen to hear him crow
Now thats an AEsops fable in a sentence
But it will be a bad business if the old gentleman turns them out of the farm next Michaelmas eh
said Mrs Irwine
Oh that must not be and Poyser is such a good tenant that Donnithorne is likely to think twice and digest his spleen rather than turn them out
But if he should give them notice at Lady Day Arthur and I must move heaven and earth to mollify him
Such old parishioners as they are must not go
Ah theres no knowing what may happen before Lady day said Mrs Irwine
It struck me on Arthurs birthday that the old man was a little shaken hes eightythree you know
Its really an unconscionable age
Its only women who have a right to live as long as that
When theyve got oldbachelor sons who would be forlorn without them said Mr Irwine laughing and kissing his mothers hand
Mrs Poyser too met her husbands occasional forebodings of a notice to quit with Theres no knowing what may happen before Lady dayone of those undeniable general propositions which are usually intended to convey a particular meaning very far from undeniable
But it is really too hard upon human nature that it should be held a criminal offence to imagine the death even of the king when he is turned eightythree
It is not to be believed that any but the dullest Britons can be good subjects under that hard condition
Apart from this foreboding things went on much as usual in the Poyser household
Mrs Poyser thought she noticed a surprising improvement in Hetty
To be sure the girl got closer tempered and sometimes she seemed as if thered be no drawing a word from her with cartropes but she thought much less about her dress and went after the work quite eagerly without any telling
And it was wonderful how she never wanted to go out nowindeed could hardly be persuaded to go and she bore her aunts putting a stop to her weekly lesson in finework at the Chase without the least grumbling or pouting
It must be after all that she had set her heart on Adam at last and her sudden freak of wanting to be a ladys maid must have been caused by some little pique or misunderstanding between them which had passed by
For whenever Adam came to the Hall Farm Hetty seemed to be in better spirits and to talk more than at other times though she was almost sullen when Mr Craig or any other admirer happened to pay a visit there
Adam himself watched her at first with trembling anxiety which gave way to surprise and delicious hope
Five days after delivering Arthurs letter he had ventured to go to the Hall Farm againnot without dread lest the sight of him might be painful to her
She was not in the houseplace when he entered and he sat talking to Mr and Mrs Poyser for a few minutes with a heavy fear on his heart that they might presently tell him Hetty was ill
But by and by there came a light step that he knew and when Mrs Poyser said Come Hetty where have you been
Adam was obliged to turn round though he was afraid to see the changed look there must be in her face
He almost started when he saw her smiling as if she were pleased to see himlooking the same as ever at a first glance only that she had her cap on which he had never seen her in before when he came of an evening
Still when he looked at her again and again as she moved about or sat at her work there was a change the cheeks were as pink as ever and she smiled as much as she had ever done of late but there was something different in her eyes in the expression of her face in all her movements Adam thoughtsomething harder older less childlike
Poor thing
he said to himself thats allays likely
Its because shes had her first heartache
But shes got a spirit to bear up under it
Thank God for that
As the weeks went by and he saw her always looking pleased to see himturning up her lovely face towards him as if she meant him to understand that she was glad for him to comeand going about her work in the same equable way making no sign of sorrow he began to believe that her feeling towards Arthur must have been much slighter than he had imagined in his first indignation and alarm and that she had been able to think of her girlish fancy that Arthur was in love with her and would marry her as a folly of which she was timely cured
And it perhaps was as he had sometimes in his more cheerful moments hoped it would beher heart was really turning with all the more warmth towards the man she knew to have a serious love for her
Possibly you think that Adam was not at all sagacious in his interpretations and that it was altogether extremely unbecoming in a sensible man to behave as he didfalling in love with a girl who really had nothing more than her beauty to recommend her attributing imaginary virtues to her and even condescending to cleave to her after she had fallen in love with another man waiting for her kind looks as a patient trembling dog waits for his masters eye to be turned upon him
But in so complex a thing as human nature we must consider it is hard to find rules without exceptions
Of course I know that as a rule sensible men fall in love with the most sensible women of their acquaintance see through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty never imagine themselves loved when they are not loved cease loving on all proper occasions and marry the woman most fitted for them in every respectindeed so as to compel the approbation of all the maiden ladies in their neighbourhood
But even to this rule an exception will occur now and then in the lapse of centuries and my friend Adam was one
For my own part however I respect him none the lessnay I think the deep love he had for that sweet rounded blossomlike darkeyed Hetty of whose inward self he was really very ignorant came out of the very strength of his nature and not out of any inconsistent weakness
Is it any weakness pray to be wrought on by exquisite music
To feel its wondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings of your soul the delicate fibres of life where no memory can penetrate and binding together your whole being past and present in one unspeakable vibration melting you in one moment with all the tenderness all the love that has been scattered through the toilsome years concentrating in one emotion of heroic courage or resignation all the hardlearnt lessons of self renouncing sympathy blending your present joy with past sorrow and your present sorrow with all your past joy
If not then neither is it a weakness to be so wrought upon by the exquisite curves of a womans cheek and neck and arms by the liquid depths of her beseeching eyes or the sweet childish pout of her lips
For the beauty of a lovely woman is like music what can one say more
Beauty has an expression beyond and far above the one womans soul that it clothes as the words of genius have a wider meaning than the thought that prompted them
It is more than a womans love that moves us in a womans eyesit seems to be a faroff mighty love that has come near to us and made speech for itself there the rounded neck the dimpled arm move us by something more than their prettinessby their close kinship with all we have known of tenderness and peace
The noblest nature sees the most of this impersonal expression in beauty it is needless to say that there are gentlemen with whiskers dyed and undyed who see none of it whatever and for this reason the noblest nature is often the most blinded to the character of the one womans soul that the beauty clothes
Whence I fear the tragedy of human life is likely to continue for a long time to come in spite of mental philosophers who are ready with the best receipts for avoiding all mistakes of the kind
Our good Adam had no fine words into which he could put his feeling for Hetty he could not disguise mystery in this way with the appearance of knowledge he called his love frankly a mystery as you have heard him
He only knew that the sight and memory of her moved him deeply touching the spring of all love and tenderness all faith and courage within him
How could he imagine narrowness selfishness hardness in her
He created the mind he believed in out of his own which was large unselfish tender
The hopes he felt about Hetty softened a little his feeling towards Arthur
Surely his attentions to Hetty must have been of a slight kind they were altogether wrong and such as no man in Arthurs position ought to have allowed himself but they must have had an air of playfulness about them which had probably blinded him to their danger and had prevented them from laying any strong hold on Hettys heart
As the new promise of happiness rose for Adam his indignation and jealousy began to die out
Hetty was not made unhappy he almost believed that she liked him best and the thought sometimes crossed his mind that the friendship which had once seemed dead for ever might revive in the days to come and he would not have to say goodbye to the grand old woods but would like them better because they were Arthurs
For this new promise of happiness following so quickly on the shock of pain had an intoxicating effect on the sober Adam who had all his life been used to much hardship and moderate hope
Was he really going to have an easy lot after all
It seemed so for at the beginning of November Jonathan Burge finding it impossible to replace Adam had at last made up his mind to offer him a share in the business without further condition than that he should continue to give his energies to it and renounce all thought of having a separate business of his own
Soninlaw or no soninlaw Adam had made himself too necessary to be parted with and his headwork was so much more important to Burge than his skill in handicraft that his having the management of the woods made little difference in the value of his services and as to the bargains about the squires timber it would be easy to call in a third person
Adam saw here an opening into a broadening path of prosperous work such as he had thought of with ambitious longing ever since he was a lad he might come to build a bridge or a town hall or a factory for he had always said to himself that Jonathan Burges building buisness was like an acorn which might be the mother of a great tree
So he gave his hand to Burge on that bargain and went home with his mind full of happy visions in which my refined reader will perhaps be shocked when I say it the image of Hetty hovered and smiled over plans for seasoning timber at a trifling expense calculations as to the cheapening of bricks per thousand by watercarriage and a favourite scheme for the strengthening of roofs and walls with a peculiar form of iron girder
What then
Adams enthusiasm lay in these things and our love is inwrought in our enthusiasm as electricity is inwrought in the air exalting its power by a subtle presence
Adam would be able to take a separate house now and provide for his mother in the old one his prospects would justify his marrying very soon and if Dinah consented to have Seth their mother would perhaps be more contented to live apart from Adam
But he told himself that he would not be hastyhe would not try Hettys feeling for him until it had had time to grow strong and firm
However tomorrow after church he would go to the Hall Farm and tell them the news
Mr Poyser he knew would like it better than a fivepound note and he should see if Hettys eyes brightened at it
The months would be short with all he had to fill his mind and this foolish eagerness which had come over him of late must not hurry him into any premature words
Yet when he got home and told his mother the good news and ate his supper while she sat by almost crying for joy and wanting him to eat twice as much as usual because of this goodluck he could not help preparing her gently for the coming change by talking of the old house being too small for them all to go on living in it always
Chapter XXXIV The Betrothal IT was a dry Sunday and really a pleasant day for the 2d of November
There was no sunshine but the clouds were high and the wind was so still that the yellow leaves which fluttered down from the hedgerow elms must have fallen from pure decay
Nevertheless Mrs Poyser did not go to church for she had taken a cold too serious to be neglected only two winters ago she had been laid up for weeks with a cold and since his wife did not go to church Mr Poyser considered that on the whole it would be as well for him to stay away too and keep her company
He could perhaps have given no precise form to the reasons that determined this conclusion but it is well known to all experienced minds that our firmest convictions are often dependent on subtle impressions for which words are quite too coarse a medium
However it was no one from the Poyser family went to church that afternoon except Hetty and the boys yet Adam was bold enough to join them after church and say that he would walk home with them though all the way through the village he appeared to be chiefly occupied with Marty and Tommy telling them about the squirrels in Binton Coppice and promising to take them there some day
But when they came to the fields he said to the boys Now then which is the stoutest walker
Him as gets to th homegate first shall be the first to go with me to Binton Coppice on the donkey
But Tommy must have the start up to the next stile because hes the smallest
Adam had never behaved so much like a determined lover before
As soon as the boys had both set off he looked down at Hetty and said Wont you hang on my arm Hetty
in a pleading tone as if he had already asked her and she had refused
Hetty looked up at him smilingly and put her round arm through his in a moment
It was nothing to her putting her arm through Adams but she knew he cared a great deal about having her arm through his and she wished him to care
Her heart beat no faster and she looked at the halfbare hedgerows and the ploughed field with the same sense of oppressive dulness as before
But Adam scarcely felt that he was walking
He thought Hetty must know that he was pressing her arm a littlea very little
Words rushed to his lips that he dared not utterthat he had made up his mind not to utter yet and so he was silent for the length of that field
The calm patience with which he had once waited for Hettys love content only with her presence and the thought of the future had forsaken him since that terrible shock nearly three months ago
The agitations of jealousy had given a new restlessness to his passionhad made fear and uncertainty too hard almost to bear
But though he might not speak to Hetty of his love he would tell her about his new prospects and see if she would be pleased
So when he was enough master of himself to talk he said Im going to tell your uncle some news thatll surprise him Hetty and I think hell be glad to hear it too
Whats that
Hetty said indifferently
Why Mr Burge has offered me a share in his business and Im going to take it
There was a change in Hettys face certainly not produced by any agreeable impression from this news
In fact she felt a momentary annoyance and alarm for she had so often heard it hinted by her uncle that Adam might have Mary Burge and a share in the business any day if he liked that she associated the two objects now and the thought immediately occurred that perhaps Adam had given her up because of what had happened lately and had turned towards Mary Burge
With that thought and before she had time to remember any reasons why it could not be true came a new sense of forsakenness and disappointment
The one thingthe one person her mind had rested on in its dull weariness had slipped away from her and peevish misery filled her eyes with tears
She was looking on the ground but Adam saw her face saw the tears and before he had finished saying Hetty dear Hetty what are you crying for
his eager rapid thought had flown through all the causes conceivable to him and had at last alighted on half the true one
Hetty thought he was going to marry Mary Burgeshe didnt like him to marryperhaps she didnt like him to marry any one but herself
All caution was swept awayall reason for it was gone and Adam could feel nothing but trembling joy
He leaned towards her and took her hand as he said I could afford to be married now HettyI could make a wife comfortable but I shall never want to be married if you wont have me
Hetty looked up at him and smiled through her tears as she had done to Arthur that first evening in the wood when she had thought he was not coming and yet he came
It was a feebler relief a feebler triumph she felt now but the great dark eyes and the sweet lips were as beautiful as ever perhaps more beautiful for there was a more luxuriant womanliness about Hetty of late
Adam could hardly believe in the happiness of that moment
His right hand held her left and he pressed her arm close against his heart as he leaned down towards her
Do you really love me Hetty
Will you be my own wife to love and take care of as long as I live
Hetty did not speak but Adams face was very close to hers and she put up her round cheek against his like a kitten
She wanted to be caressedshe wanted to feel as if Arthur were with her again
Adam cared for no words after that and they hardly spoke through the rest of the walk
He only said I may tell your uncle and aunt maynt I Hetty
and she said Yes
The red firelight on the hearth at the Hall Farm shone on joyful faces that evening when Hetty was gone upstairs and Adam took the opportunity of telling Mr and Mrs Poyser and the grandfather that he saw his way to maintaining a wife now and that Hetty had consented to have him
I hope you have no objections against me for her husband said Adam Im a poor man as yet but she shall want nothing as I can work for
Objections
said Mr Poyser while the grandfather leaned forward and brought out his long Nay nay
What objections can we ha to you lad
Never mind your being poorish as yet theres money in your headpiece as theres money i the sown field but it must ha time
Youn got enough to begin on and we can do a deal towrt the bit o furniture youll want
Theest got feathers and linen to spareplenty eh
This question was of course addressed to Mrs Poyser who was wrapped up in a warm shawl and was too hoarse to speak with her usual facility
At first she only nodded emphatically but she was presently unable to resist the temptation to be more explicit
It ud be a poor tale if I hadna feathers and linen she said hoarsely when I never sell a fowl but whats plucked and the wheels agoing every day o the week
Come my wench said Mr Poyser when Hetty came down come and kiss us and let us wish you luck
Hetty went very quietly and kissed the big goodnatured man
There
he said patting her on the back go and kiss your aunt and your grandfather
Im as wishful t have you settled well as if you was my own daughter and sos your aunt Ill be bound for shes done by you this seven ear Hetty as if youd been her own
Come come now he went on becoming jocose as soon as Hetty had kissed her aunt and the old man Adam wants a kiss too Ill warrant and hes a right to one now
Hetty turned away smiling towards her empty chair
Come Adam then take one persisted Mr Poyser else y arena half a man
Adam got up blushing like a small maidengreat strong fellow as he wasand putting his arm round Hetty stooped down and gently kissed her lips
It was a pretty scene in the red firelight for there were no candleswhy should there be when the fire was so bright and was reflected from all the pewter and the polished oak
No one wanted to work on a Sunday evening
Even Hetty felt something like contentment in the midst of all this love
Adams attachment to her Adams caress stirred no passion in her were no longer enough to satisfy her vanity but they were the best her life offered her nowthey promised her some change
There was a great deal of discussion before Adam went away about the possibility of his finding a house that would do for him to settle in
No house was empty except the one next to Will Maskerys in the village and that was too small for Adam now
Mr Poyser insisted that the best plan would be for Seth and his mother to move and leave Adam in the old home which might be enlarged after a while for there was plenty of space in the woodyard and garden but Adam objected to turning his mother out
Well well said Mr Poyser at last we needna fix everything tonight
We must take time to consider
You canna think o getting married afore Easter
Im not for long courtships but there must be a bit o time to make things comfortable
Aye to be sure said Mrs Poyser in a hoarse whisper Christian folks cant be married like cuckoos I reckon
Im a bit daunted though said Mr Poyser when I think as we may have notice to quit and belike be forced to take a farm twenty mile off
Eh said the old man staring at the floor and lifting his hands up and down while his arms rested on the elbows of his chair its a poor tale if I mun leave th ould spot an be buried in a strange parish
An youll happen ha double rates to pay he added looking up at his son
Well thee mustna fret beforehand father said Martin the younger
Happen the captain ull come home and make our peace wi th old squire
I build upo that for I know the captain ll see folks righted if he can
Chapter XXXV The Hidden Dread IT was a busy time for Adamthe time between the beginning of November and the beginning of February and he could see little of Hetty except on Sundays
But a happy time nevertheless for it was taking him nearer and nearer to March when they were to be married and all the little preparations for their new housekeeping marked the progress towards the longedfor day
Two new rooms had been run up to the old house for his mother and Seth were to live with them after all
Lisbeth had cried so piteously at the thought of leaving Adam that he had gone to Hetty and asked her if for the love of him she would put up with his mothers ways and consent to live with her
To his great delight Hetty said Yes Id as soon she lived with us as not
Hettys mind was oppressed at that moment with a worse difficulty than poor Lisbeths ways she could not care about them
So Adam was consoled for the disappointment he had felt when Seth had come back from his visit to Snowfield and said it was no useDinahs heart wasna turned towards marrying
For when he told his mother that Hetty was willing they should all live together and there was no more need of them to think of parting she said in a more contented tone than he had heard her speak in since it had been settled that he was to be married Eh my lad Ill be as still as th ould tabby an neer want to do aught but th offal work as she wonna like t do
An then we needna part the platters an things as ha stood on the shelf together sin afore thee wast born
There was only one cloud that now and then came across Adams sunshine Hetty seemed unhappy sometimes
But to all his anxious tender questions she replied with an assurance that she was quite contented and wished nothing different and the next time he saw her she was more lively than usual
It might be that she was a little overdone with work and anxiety now for soon after Christmas Mrs Poyser had taken another cold which had brought on inflammation and this illness had confined her to her room all through January
Hetty had to manage everything downstairs and halfsupply Mollys place too while that good damsel waited on her mistress and she seemed to throw herself so entirely into her new functions working with a grave steadiness which was new in her that Mr Poyser often told Adam she was wanting to show him what a good housekeeper he would have but he doubted the lass was oerdoing itshe must have a bit o rest when her aunt could come downstairs
This desirable event of Mrs Poysers coming downstairs happened in the early part of February when some mild weather thawed the last patch of snow on the Binton Hills
On one of these days soon after her aunt came down Hetty went to Treddleston to buy some of the wedding things which were wanting and which Mrs Poyser had scolded her for neglecting observing that she supposed it was because they were not for th outside else shed ha bought em fast enough
It was about ten oclock when Hetty set off and the slight hoar frost that had whitened the hedges in the early morning had disappeared as the sun mounted the cloudless sky
Bright February days have a stronger charm of hope about them than any other days in the year
One likes to pause in the mild rays of the sun and look over the gates at the patient ploughhorses turning at the end of the furrow and think that the beautiful year is all before one
The birds seem to feel just the same their notes are as clear as the clear air
There are no leaves on the trees and hedgerows but how green all the grassy fields are
And the dark purplish brown of the ploughed earth and of the bare branches is beautiful too
What a glad world this looks like as one drives or rides along the valleys and over the hills
I have often thought so when in foreign countries where the fields and woods have looked to me like our English Loamshirethe rich land tilled with just as much care the woods rolling down the gentle slopes to the green meadowsI have come on sormething by the roadside which has reminded me that I am not in Loamshire an image of a great agonythe agony of the Cross
It has stood perhaps by the clustering appleblossoms or in the broad sunshine by the cornfield or at a turning by the wood where a clear brook was gurgling below and surely if there came a traveller to this world who knew nothing of the story of mans life upon it this image of agony would seem to him strangely out of place in the midst of this joyous nature
He would not know that hidden behind the appleblossoms or among the golden corn or under the shrouding boughs of the wood there might be a human heart beating heavily with anguishperhaps a young blooming girl not knowing where to turn for refuge from swiftadvancing shame understanding no more of this life of ours than a foolish lost lamb wandering farther and farther in the nightfall on the lonely heath yet tasting the bitterest of lifes bitterness
Such things are sometimes hidden among the sunny fields and behind the blossoming orchards and the sound of the gurgling brook if you came close to one spot behind a small bush would be mingled for your ear with a despairing human sob
No wonder mans religion has much sorrow in it no wonder he needs a suffering God
Hetty in her red cloak and warm bonnet with her basket in her hand is turning towards a gate by the side of the Treddleston road but not that she may have a more lingering enjoyment of the sunshine and think with hope of the long unfolding year
She hardly knows that the sun is shining and for weeks now when she has hoped at all it has been for something at which she herself trembles and shudders
She only wants to be out of the highroad that she may walk slowly and not care how her face looks as she dwells on wretched thoughts and through this gate she can get into a fieldpath behind the wide thick hedgerows
Her great dark eyes wander blankly over the fields like the eyes of one who is desolate homeless unloved not the promised bride of a brave tender man
But there are no tears in them her tears were all wept away in the weary night before she went to sleep
At the next stile the pathway branches off there are two roads before herone along by the hedgerow which will by and by lead her into the road again the other across the fields which will take her much farther out of the way into the Scantlands low shrouded pastures where she will see nobody
She chooses this and begins to walk a little faster as if she had suddenly thought of an object towards which it was worth while to hasten
Soon she is in the Scantlands where the grassy land slopes gradually downwards and she leaves the level ground to follow the slope
Farther on there is a clump of trees on the low ground and she is making her way towards it
No it is not a clump of trees but a dark shrouded pool so full with the wintry rains that the under boughs of the elderbushes lie low beneath the water
She sits down on the grassy bank against the stooping stem of the great oak that hangs over the dark pool
She has thought of this pool often in the nights of the month that has just gone by and now at last she is come to see it
She clasps her hands round her knees and leans forward and looks earnestly at it as if trying to guess what sort of bed it would make for her young round limbs
No she has not courage to jump into that cold watery bed and if she had they might find herthey might find out why she had drowned herself
There is but one thing left to her she must go away go where they cant find her
After the first oncoming of her great dread some weeks after her betrothal to Adam she had waited and waited in the blind vague hope that something would happen to set her free from her terror but she could wait no longer
All the force of her nature had been concentrated on the one effort of concealment and she had shrunk with irresistible dread from every course that could tend towards a betrayal of her miserable secret
Whenever the thought of writing to Arthur had occurred to her she had rejected it
He could do nothing for her that would shelter her from discovery and scorn among the relatives and neighbours who once more made all her world now her airy dream had vanished
Her imagination no longer saw happiness with Arthur for he could do nothing that would satisfy or soothe her pride
No something else would happensomething must happento set her free from this dread
In young childish ignorant souls there is constantly this blind trust in some unshapen chance it is as hard to a boy or girl to believe that a great wretchedness will actually befall them as to believe that they will die
But now necessity was pressing hard upon hernow the time of her marriage was close at handshe could no longer rest in this blind trust
She must run away she must hide herself where no familiar eyes could detect her and then the terror of wandering out into the world of which she knew nothing made the possibility of going to Arthur a thought which brought some comfort with it
She felt so helpless now so unable to fashion the future for herself that the prospect of throwing herself on him had a relief in it which was stronger than her pride
As she sat by the pool and shuddered at the dark cold water the hope that he would receive her tenderlythat he would care for her and think for herwas like a sense of lulling warmth that made her for the moment indifferent to everything else and she began now to think of nothing but the scheme by which she should get away
She had had a letter from Dinah lately full of kind words about the coming marriage which she had heard of from Seth and when Hetty had read this letter aloud to her uncle he had said I wish Dinah ud come again now for shed be a comfort to your aunt when youre gone
What do you think my wench o going to see her as soon as you can be spared and persuading her to come back wi you
You might happen persuade her wi telling her as her aunt wants her for all she writes o not being able to come
Hetty had not liked the thought of going to Snowfield and felt no longing to see Dinah so she only said Its so far off Uncle
But now she thought this proposed visit would serve as a pretext for going away
She would tell her aunt when she got home again that she should like the change of going to Snowfield for a week or ten days
And then when she got to Stoniton where nobody knew her she would ask for the coach that would take her on the way to Windsor
Arthur was at Windsor and she would go to him
As soon as Hetty had determined on this scheme she rose from the grassy bank of the pool took up her basket and went on her way to Treddleston for she must buy the wedding things she had come out for though she would never want them
She must be careful not to raise any suspicion that she was going to run away
Mrs Poyser was quite agreeably surprised that Hetty wished to go and see Dinah and try to bring her back to stay over the wedding
The sooner she went the better since the weather was pleasant now and Adam when he came in the evening said if Hetty could set off tomorrow he would make time to go with her to Treddleston and see her safe into the Stoniton coach
I wish I could go with you and take care of you Hetty he said the next morning leaning in at the coach door but you wont stay much beyond a weekthe time ull seem long
He was looking at her fondly and his strong hand beld hers in its grasp
Hetty felt a sense of protection in his presenceshe was used to it now if she could have had the past undone and known no other love than her quiet liking for Adam
The tears rose as she gave him the last look
God bless her for loving me said Adam as he went on his way to work again with Gyp at his heels
But Hettys tears were not for Adamnot for the anguish that would come upon him when he found she was gone from him for ever
They were for the misery of her own lot which took her away from this brave tender man who offered up his whole life to her and threw her a poor helpless suppliant on the man who would think it a misfortune that she was obliged to cling to him
At three oclock that day when Hetty was on the coach that was to take her they said to Leicesterpart of the long long way to Windsorshe felt dimly that she might be travelling all this weary journey towards the beginning of new misery
Yet Arthur was at Windsor he would surely not be angry with her
If he did not mind about her as he used to do he had promised to be good to her
Book Five Chapter XXXVI The Journey of Hope A LONG lonely journey with sadness in the heart away from the familiar to the strange that is a hard and dreary thing even to the rich the strong the instructed a hard thing even when we are called by duty not urged by dread
What was it then to Hetty
With her poor narrow thoughts no longer melting into vague hopes but pressed upon by the chill of definite fear repeating again and again the same small round of memoriesshaping again and again the same childish doubtful images of what was to comeseeing nothing in this wide world but the little history of her own pleasures and pains with so little money in her pocket and the way so long and difficult
Unless she could afford always to go in the coachesand she felt sure she could not for the journey to Stoniton was more expensive than she had expectedit was plain that she must trust to carriers carts or slow waggons and what a time it would be before she could get to the end of her journey
The burly old coachman from Oakbourne seeing such a pretty young woman among the outside passengers had invited her to come and sit beside him and feeling that it became him as a man and a coachman to open the dialogue with a joke he applied himself as soon as they were off the stones to the elaboration of one suitable in all respects
After many cuts with his whip and glances at Hetty out of the corner of his eye he lifted his lips above the edge of his wrapper and said Hes pretty nigh six foot Ill be bound isna he now
Who
said Hetty rather startled
Why the sweetheart as youve left behind or else him as youre goin arterwhich is it
Hetty felt her face flushing and then turning pale
She thought this coachman must know something about her
He must know Adam and might tell him where she was gone for it is difficult to country people to believe that those who make a figure in their own parish are not known everywhere else and it was equally difficult to Hetty to understand that chance words could happen to apply closely to her circumstances
She was too frightened to speak
Hegh hegh
said the coachman seeing that his joke was not so gratifying as he had expected you munna take it too serous if hes behaved ill get another
Such a pretty lass as you can get a sweetheart any day
Hettys fear was allayed by and by when she found that the coachman made no further allusion to her personal concerns but it still had the effect of preventing her from asking him what were the places on the road to Windsor
She told him she was only going a little way out of Stoniton and when she got down at the inn where the coach stopped she hastened away with her basket to another part of the town
When she had formed her plan of going to Windsor she had not foreseen any difficulties except that of getting away and after she had overcome this by proposing the visit to Dinah her thoughts flew to the meeting with Arthur and the question how he would behave to hernot resting on any probable incidents of the journey
She was too entirely ignorant of traveling to imagine any of its details and with all her store of moneyher three guineasin her pocket she thought herself amply provided
It was not until she found how much it cost her to get to Stoniton that she began to be alarmed about the journey and then for the first time she felt her ignorance as to the places that must be passed on her way
Oppressed with this new alarm she walked along the grim Stoniton streets and at last turned into a shabby little inn where she hoped to get a cheap lodging for the night
Here she asked the landlord if he could tell her what places she must go to to get to Windsor
Well I cant rightly say
Windsor must be pretty nigh London for its where the king lives was the answer
Anyhow youd best go t Ashby nextthats southard
But theres as many places from here to London as theres houses in Stoniton by what I can make out
Ive never been no traveller myself
But how comes a lone young woman like you to be thinking o taking such a journey as that
Im going to my brotherhes a soldier at Windsor said Hetty frightened at the landlords questioning look
I cant afford to go by the coach do you think theres a cart goes toward Ashby in the morning
Yes there may be carts if anybody knowed where they started from but you might run over the town before you found out
Youd best set off and walk and trust to summat overtaking you
Every word sank like lead on Hettys spirits she saw the journey stretch bit by bit before her now
Even to get to Ashby seemed a hard thing it might take the day for what she knew and that was nothing to the rest of the journey
But it must be doneshe must get to Arthur
Oh how she yearned to be again with somebody who would care for her
She who had never got up in the morning without the certainty of seeing familiar faces people on whom she had an acknowledged claim whose farthest journey had been to Rosseter on the pillion with her uncle whose thoughts had always been taking holiday in dreams of pleasure because all the business of her life was managed for herthis kittenlike Hetty who till a few months ago had never felt any other grief than that of envying Mary Burge a new ribbon or being girded at by her aunt for neglecting Totty must now make her toilsome way in loneliness her peaceful home left behind for ever and nothing but a tremulous hope of distant refuge before her
Now for the first time as she lay down tonight in the strange hard bed she felt that her home had been a happy one that her uncle had been very good to her that her quiet lot at Hayslope among the things and people she knew with her little pride in her one best gown and bonnet and nothing to hide from any one was what she would like to wake up to as a reality and find that all the feverish life she had known besides was a short nightmare
She thought of all she had left behind with yearning regret for her own sake
Her own misery filled her heartthere was no room in it for other peoples sorrow
And yet before the cruel letter Arthur had been so tender and loving
The memory of that had still a charm for her though it was no more than a soothing draught that just made pain bearable
For Hetty could conceive no other existence for herself in future than a hidden one and a hidden life even with love would have had no delights for her still less a life mingled with shame
She knew no romances and had only a feeble share in the feelings which are the source of romance so that wellread ladies may find it difflcult to understand her state of mind
She was too igrorant of everything beyond the simple notions and habits in which she had been brought up to have any more definite idea of her probable future than that Arthur would take care of her somehow and shelter her from anger and scorn
He would not marry her and make her a lady and apart from that she could think of nothing he could give towards which she looked with longing and ambition
The next morning she rose early and taking only some milk and bread for her breakfast set out to walk on the road towards Ashby under a leadencoloured sky with a narrowing streak of yellow like a departing hope on the edge of the horizon
Now in her faintness of heart at the length and difficulty of her journey she was most of all afraid of spending her money and becoming so destitute that she would have to ask peoples charity for Hettv had the pride not only of a proud nature but of a proud classthe class that pays the most poorrates and most shudders at the idea of profiting by a poorrate
It had not yet occurred to her that she might get money for her locket and earrings which she carried with her and she applied all her small arithmetic and knowledge of prices to calculating how many meals and how many rides were contained in her two guineas and the odd shillings which had a melancholy look as if they were the pale ashes of the other brightflaming coin
For the first few miles out of Stoniton she walked on bravely always fixing on some tree or gate or projecting bush at the most distant visible point in the road as a goal and feeling a faint joy when she had reached it
But when she came to the fourth milestone the first she had happened to notice among the long grass by the roadside and read that she was still only four miles beyond Stoniton her courage sank
She had come only this little way and yet felt tired and almost hungry again in the keen morning air for though Hetty was accustomed to much movement and exertion indoors she was not used to long walks which produced quite a different sort of fatigue from that of household activity
As she was looking at the milestone she felt some drops falling on her faceit was beginning to rain
Here was a new trouble which had not entered into her sad thoughts before and quite weighed down by this sudden addition to her burden she sat down on the step of a stile and began to sob hysterically
The beginning of hardship is like the first taste of bitter foodit seems for a moment unbearable yet if there is nothing else to satisfy our hunger we take another bite and find it possible to go on
When Hetty recovered from her burst of weeping she rallied her fainting courage it was raining and she must try to get on to a village where she might find rest and shelter
Presently as she walked on wearily she heard the rumbling of heavy wheels behind her a covered waggon was coming creeping slowly along with a slouching driver cracking his whip beside the horses
She waited for it thinking that if the waggoner were not a very sourlooking man she would ask him to take her up
As the waggon approached her the driver had fallen behind but there was something in the front of the big vehicle which encouraged her
At any previous moment in her life she would not have noticed it but now the new susceptibility that suffering had awakened in her caused this object to impress her strongly
It was only a small whiteand livercoloured spaniel which sat on the front ledge of the waggon with large timid eyes and an incessant trembling in the body such as you may have seen in some of these small creatures
Hetty cared little for animals as you know but at this moment she felt as if the helpless timid creature had some fellowship with her and without being quite aware of the reason she was less doubtful about speaking to the driver who now came forwarda large ruddy man with a sack over his shoulders by way of scarf or mantle
Could you take me up in your waggon if youre going towards Ashby
said Hetty
Ill pay you for it
Aw said the big fellow with that slowly dawning smile which belongs to heavy faces I can take y up fawst enough wiout bein paid fort if you dooant mind lyin a bit closish atop o the woolpacks
Where do you coom from
And what do you want at Ashby
I come from Stoniton
Im going a long wayto Windsor
What
Arter some service or what
Going to my brotherhes a soldier there
Well Im going no furder nor Leicesterand fur enough toobut Ill take you if you dooant mind being a bit long on the road
Th hosses wooant feel YOUR weight no more nor they feel the little doog there as I puck up on the road a fortnit agoo
He war lost I blieve ans been all of a tremble iver sin
Come gi us your basket an come behind and let me put y in
To lie on the woolpacks with a cranny left between the curtains of the awning to let in the air was luxury to Hetty now and she halfslept away the hours till the driver came to ask her if she wanted to get down and have some victual he himself was going to eat his dinner at this public
Late at night they reached Leicester and so this second day of Hettys journey was past
She had spent no money except what she had paid for her food but she felt that this slow journeying would be intolerable for her another day and in the morning she found her way to a coach office to ask about the road to Windsor and see if it would cost her too much to go part of the distance by coach again
Yes
The distance was too greatthe coaches were too dearshe must give them up but the elderly clerk at the office touched by her pretty anxious face wrote down for her the names of the chief places she must pass through
This was the only comfort she got in Leicester for the men stared at her as she went along the street and for the first time in her life Hetty wished no one would look at her
She set out walking again but this day she was fortunate for she was soon overtaken by a carriers cart which carried her to Hinckley and by the help of a return chaise with a drunken postilionwho frightened her by driving like Jehu the son of Nimshi and shouting hilarious remarks at her twisting himself backwards on his saddleshe was before night in the heart of woody Warwickshire but still almost a hundred miles from Windsor they told her
Oh what a large world it was and what hard work for her to find her way in it
She went by mistake to StratfordonAvon finding Stratford set down in her list of places and then she was told she had come a long way out of the right road
It was not till the fifth day that she got to Stony Stratford
That seems but a slight journey as you look at the map or remember your own pleasant travels to and from the meadowy banks of the Avon
But how wearily long it was to Hetty
It seemed to her as if this country of flat fields and hedgerows and dotted houses and villages and markettownsall so much alike to her indifferent eyesmust have no end and she must go on wandering among them for ever waiting tired at tollgates for some cart to come and then finding the cart went only a little waya very little wayto the millers a mile off perhaps and she hated going into the public houses where she must go to get food and ask questions because there were always men lounging there who stared at her and joked her rudely
Her body was very weary too with these days of new fatigue and anxiety they had made her look more pale and worn than all the time of hidden dread she had gone through at home
When at last she reached Stony Stratford her impatience and weariness had become too strong for her economical caution she determined to take the coach for the rest of the way though it should cost her all her remaining money
She would need nothing at Windsor but to find Arthur
When she had paid the fare for the last coach she had only a shilling and as she got down at the sign of the Green Man in Windsor at twelve oclock in the middle of the seventh day hungry and faint the coachman came up and begged her to remember him
She put her hand in her pocket and took out the shilling but the tears came with the sense of exhaustion and the thought that she was giving away her last means of getting food which she really required before she could go in search of Arthur
As she held out the shilling she lifted up her dark tearfilled eyes to the coachmans face and said Can you give me back sixpence
No no he said gruffly never mindput the shilling up again
The landlord of the Green Man had stood near enough to witness this scene and he was a man whose abundant feeding served to keep his good nature as well as his person in high condition
And that lovely tearful face of Hettys would have found out the sensitive fibre in most men
Come young woman come in he said and have adrop o something youre pretty well knocked up I can see that
He took her into the bar and said to his wife Here missis take this young woman into the parlour shes a little overcomefor Hettys tears were falling fast
They were merely hysterical tears she thought she had no reason for weeping now and was vexed that she was too weak and tired to help it
She was at Windsor at last not far from Arthur
She looked with eager hungry eyes at the bread and meat and beer that the landlady brought her and for some minutes she forgot everything else in the delicious sensations of satisfying hunger and recovering from exhaustion
The landlady sat opposite to her as she ate and looked at her earnestly
No wonder Hetty had thrown off her bonnet and her curls had fallen down
Her face was all the more touching in its youth and beauty because of its weary look and the good womans eyes presently wandered to her figure which in her hurried dressing on her journey she had taken no pains to conceal moreover the strangers eye detects what the familiar unsuspecting eye leaves unnoticed
Why youre not very fit for travelling she said glancing while she spoke at Hettys ringless hand
Have you come far
Yes said Hetty roused by this question to exert more self command and feeling the better for the food she had taken
Ive come a good long way and its very tiring
But Im better now
Could you tell me which way to go to this place
Here Hetty took from her pocket a bit of paper it was the end of Arthurs letter on which he had written his address
While she was speaking the landlord had come in and had begun to look at her as earnestly as his wife had done
He took up the piece of paper which Hetty handed across the table and read the address
Why what do you want at this house
he said
It is in the nature of innkeepers and all men who have no pressing business of their own to ask as many questions as possible before giving any information
I want to see a gentleman as is there said Hetty
But theres no gentleman there returned the landlord
Its shut upbeen shut up this fortnight
What gentleman is it you want
Perhaps I can let you know where to find him
Its Captain Donnithorne said Hetty tremulously her heart beginning to beat painfully at this disappointment of her hope that she should find Arthur at once
Captain Donnithorne
Stop a bit said the landlard slowly
Was he in the Loamshire Militia
A tall young officer with a fairish skin and reddish whiskersand had a servant by the name o Pym
Oh yes said Hetty you know himwhere is he
A fine sight o miles away from here
The Loamshire Militias gone to Ireland its been gone this fortnight
Look there
Shes fainting said the landlady hastening to support Hetty who had lost her miserable consciousness and looked like a beautiful corpse
They carried her to the sofa and loosened her dress
Heres a bad business I suspect said the landlord as he brought in some water
Ah its plain enough what sort of business it is said the wife
Shes not a common flaunting dratchell I can see that
She looks like a respectable country girl and she comes from a good way off to judge by her tongue
She talks something like that ostler we had that come from the north
He was as honest a fellow as we ever had about the housetheyre all honest folks in the north
I never saw a prettier young woman in my life said the husband
Shes like a pictur in a shopwinder
It goes to ones eart to look at her
It ud have been a good deal better for her if shed been uglier and had more conduct said the landlady who on any charitable construction must have been supposed to have more conduct than beauty
But shes coming to again
Fetch a drop more water
Chapter XXXVII The Journey in Despair HETTY was too ill through the rest of that day for any questions to be addressed to hertoo ill even to think with any distinctness of the evils that were to come
She only felt that all her hope was crushed and that instead of having found a refuge she had only reached the borders of a new wilderness where no goal lay before her
The sensations of bodily sickness in a comfortable bed and with the tendance of the goodnatured landlady made a sort of respite for her such a respite as there is in the faint weariness which obliges a man to throw himself on the sand instead of toiling onward under the scorching sun
But when sleep and rest had brought back the strength necessary for the keenness of mental sufferingwhen she lay the next morning looking at the growing light which was like a cruel task master returning to urge from her a fresh round of hated hopeless labourshe began to think what course she must take to remember that all her money was gone to look at the prospect of further wandering among strangers with the new clearness shed on it by the experience of her journey to Windsor
But which way could she turn
It was impossible for her to enter into any service even if she could obtain it
There was nothing but immediate beggary before her
She thought of a young woman who had been found against the church wall at Hayslope one Sunday nearly dead with cold and hungera tiny infant in her arms
The woman was rescued and taken to the parish
The parish
You can perhaps hardly understand the effect of that word on a mind like Hettys brought up among people who were somewhat hard in their feelings even towards poverty who lived among the fields and had little pity for want and rags as a cruel inevitable fate such as they sometimes seem in cities but held them a mark of idleness and viceand it was idleness and vice that brought burdens on the parish
To Hetty the parish was next to the prison in obloquy and to ask anything of strangersto beglay in the same faroff hideous region of intolerable shame that Hetty had all her life thought it impossible she could ever come near
But now the remembrance of that wretched woman whom she had seen herself on her way from church being carried into Joshua Ranns came back upon her with the new terrible sense that there was very little now to divide HER from the same lot
And the dread of bodily hardship mingled with the dread of shame for Hetty had the luxurious nature of a round softcoated pet animal
How she yearned to be back in her safe home again cherished and cared for as she had always been
Her aunts scolding about trifles would have been music to her ears now she longed for it she used to hear it in a time when she had only trifles to hide
Could she be the same Hetty that used to make up the butter in the dairy with the Guelder roses peeping in at the windowshe a runaway whom her friends would not open their doors to again lying in this strange bed with the knowledge that she had no money to pay for what she received and must offer those strangers some of the clothes in her basket
It was then she thought of her locket and earrings and seeing her pocket lie near she reached it and spread the contents on the bed before her
There were the locket and earrings in the little velvetlined boxes and with them there was a beautiful silver thimble which Adam had bought her the words Remember me making the ornament of the border a steel purse with her one shilling in itand a small redleather case fastening with a strap
Those beautiful little earrings with their delicate pearls and garnet that she had tried in her ears with such longing in the bright sunshine on the 30th of July
She had no longing to put them in her ears now her head with its dark rings of hair lay back languidly on the pillow and the sadness that rested about her brow and eyes was something too hard for regretful memory
Yet she put her hands up to her ears it was because there were some thin gold rings in them which were also worth a little money
Yes she could surely get some money for her ornaments those Arthur had given her must have cost a great deal of money
The landlord and landlady had been good to her perhaps they would help her to get the money for these things
But this money would not keep her long
What should she do when it was gone
Where should she go
The horrible thought of want and beggary drove her once to think she would go back to her uncle and aunt and ask them to forgive her and have pity on her
But she shrank from that idea again as she might have shrunk from scorching metal
She could never endure that shame before her uncle and aunt before Mary Burge and the servants at the Chase and the people at Broxton and everybody who knew her
They should never know what had happened to her
What could she do
She would go away from Windsortravel again as she had done the last week and get among the flat green fields with the high hedges round them where nobody could see her or know her and there perhaps when there was nothing else she could do she should get courage to drown herself in some pond like that in the Scantlands
Yes she would get away from Windsor as soon as possible she didnt like these people at the inn to know about her to know that she had come to look for Captain Donnithorne
She must think of some reason to tell them why she had asked for him
With this thought she began to put the things back into her pocket meaning to get up and dress before the landlady came to her
She had her hand on the redleather case when it occurred to her that there might be something in this case which she had forgottensomething worth selling for without knowing what she should do with her life she craved the means of living as long as possible and when we desire eagerly to find something we are apt to search for it in hopeless places
No there was nothing but common needles and pins and dried tulippetals between the paper leaves where she had written down her little moneyaccounts
But on one of these leaves there was a name which often as she had seen it before now flashed on Hettys mind like a newly discovered message
The name wasDinah Morris Snowfield
There was a text above it written as well as the name by Dinahs own hand with a little pencil one evening that they were sitting together and Hetty happened to have the red case lying open before her
Hetty did not read the text now she was only arrested by the name
Now for the first time she remembered without indifference the affectionate kindness Dinah had shown her and those words of Dinah in the bedchamberthat Hetty must think of her as a friend in trouble
Suppose she were to go to Dinah and ask her to help her
Dinah did not think about things as other people did
She was a mystery to Hetty but Hetty knew she was always kind
She couldnt imagine Dinahs face turning away from her in dark reproof or scorn Dinahs voice willingly speaking ill of her or rejoicing in her misery as a punishment
Dinah did not seem to belong to that world of Hettys whose glance she dreaded like scorching fire
But even to her Hetty shrank from beseeching and confession
She could not prevail on herself to say I will go to Dinah she only thought of that as a possible alternative if she had not courage for death
The good landlady was amazed when she saw Hetty come downstairs soon after herself neatly dressed and looking resolutely self possessed
Hetty told her she was quite well this morning
She had only been very tired and overcome with her journey for she had come a long way to ask about her brother who had run away and they thought he was gone for a soldier and Captain Donnithorne might know for he had been very kind to her brother once
It was a lame story and the landlady looked doubtfully at Hetty as she told it but there was a resolute air of self reliance about her this morning so different from the helpless prostration of yesterday that the landlady hardly knew how to make a remark that might seem like prying into other peoples affairs
She only invited her to sit down to breakfast with them and in the course of it Hetty brought out her earrings and locket and asked the landlord if he could help her to get money for them
Her journey she said had cost her much more than she expected and now she had no money to get back to her friends which she wanted to do at once
It was not the first time the landlady had seen the ornaments for she had examined the contents of Hettys pocket yesterday and she and her husband had discussed the fact of a country girl having these beautiful things with a stronger conviction than ever that Hetty had been miserably deluded by the fine young officer
Well said the landlord when Hetty had spread the precious trifles before him we might take em to the jewellers shop for theres one not far off but Lord bless you they wouldnt give you a quarter o what the things are worth
And you wouldnt like to part with em
he added looking at her inquiringly
Oh I dont mind said Hetty hastily so as I can get money to go back
And they might think the things were stolen as you wanted to sell em he went on for it isnt usual for a young woman like you to have fine jewllery like that
The blood rushed to Hettys face with anger
I belong to respectable folks she said Im not a thief
No that you arent Ill be bound said the landlady and youd no call to say that looking indignantly at her husband
The things were gev to her thats plain enough to be seen
I didnt mean as I thought so said the husband apologetically but I said it was what the jeweller might think and so he wouldnt be offering much money for em
Well said the wife suppose you were to advance some money on the things yourself and then if she liked to redeem em when she got home she could
But if we heard nothing from her after two months we might do as we liked with em
I will not say that in this accommodating proposition the landlady had no regard whatever to the possible reward of her good nature in the ultimate possession of the locket and earrings indeed the effect they would have in that case on the mind of the grocers wife had presented itself with remarkable vividness to her rapid imagination
The landlord took up the ornaments and pushed out his lips in a meditative manner
He wished Hetty well doubtless but pray how many of your wellwishers would decline to make a little gain out of you
Your landlady is sincerely affected at parting with you respects you highly and will really rejoice if any one else is generous to you but at the same time she hands you a bill by which she gains as high a percentage as possible
How much money do you want to get home with young woman
said the wellwisher at length
Three guineas answered Hetty fixing on the sum she set out with for want of any other standard and afraid of asking too much
Well Ive ho objections to advance you three guineas said the landlord and if you like to send it me back and get the jewellery again you can you know
The Green Man isnt going to run away
Oh yes Ill be very glad if youll give me that said Hetty relieved at the thought that she would not have to go to the jewellers and be stared at and questioned
But if you want the things again youll write before long said the landlady because when two months are up we shall make up our minds as you dont want em
Yes said Hetty indifferently
The husband and wife were equally content with this arrangement
The husband thought if the ornaments were not redeemed he could make a good thing of it by taking them to London and selling them
The wife thought she would coax the good man into letting her keep them
And they were accommodating Hetty poor thinga pretty respectablelooking young woman apparently in a sad case
They declined to take anything for her food and bed she was quite welcome
And at eleven oclock Hetty said Goodbye to them with the same quiet resolute air she had worn all the morning mounting the coach that was to take her twenty miles back along the way she had come
There is a strength of selfpossession which is the sign that the last hope has departed
Despair no more leans on others than perfect contentment and in despair pride ceases to be counteracted by the sense of dependence
Hetty felt that no one could deliver her from the evils that would make life hateful to her and no one she said to herself should ever know her misery and humiliation
No she would not confess even to Dinah
She would wander out of sight and drown herself where her body would never be found and no one should know what had become of her
When she got off this coach she began to walk again and take cheap rides in carts and get cheap meals going on and on without distinct purpose yet strangely by some fascination taking the way she had come though she was determined not to go back to her own country
Perhaps it was because she had fixed her mind on the grassy Warwickshire fields with the bushy treestudded hedgerows that made a hidingplace even in this leafless season
She went more slowly than she came often getting over the stiles and sitting for hours under the hedgerows looking before her with blank beautiful eyes fancying herself at the edge of a hidden pool low down like that in the Scantlands wondering if it were very painful to be drowned and if there would be anything worse after death than what she dreaded in life
Religious doctrines had taken no hold on Hettys mind
She was one of those numerous people who have had godfathers and godmothers learned their catechism been confirmed and gone to church every Sunday and yet for any practical result of strength in life or trust in death have never appropriated a single Christian idea or Christian feeling
You would misunderstand her thoughts during these wretched days if you imagined that they were influenced either by religious fears or religious hopes
She chose to go to StratfordonAvon again where she had gone before by mistake for she remembered some grassy fields on her former way towards itfields among which she thought she might find just the sort of pool she had in her mind
Yet she took care of her money still she carried her basket death seemed still a long way off and life was so strong in her
She craved food and restshe hastened towards them at the very moment she was picturing to herself the bank from which she would leap towards death
It was already five days since she had left Windsor for she had wandered about always avoiding speech or questioning looks and recovering her air of proud selfdependence whenever she was under observation choosing her decent lodging at night and dressing herself neatly in the morning and setting off on her way steadily or remaining under shelter if it rained as if she had a happy life to cherish
And yet even in her most selfconscious moments the face was sadly different from that which had smiled at itself in the old specked glass or smiled at others when they glanced at it admiringly
A hard and even fierce look had come in the eyes though their lashes were as long as ever and they had all their dark brightness
And the cheek was never dimpled with smiles now
It was the same rounded pouting childish prettiness but with all love and belief in love departed from itthe sadder for its beauty like that wondrous Medusaface with the passionate passionless lips
At last she was among the fields she had been dreaming of on a long narrow pathway leading towards a wood
If there should be a pool in that wood
It would be better hidden than one in the fields
No it was not a wood only a wild brake where there had once been gravelpits leaving mounds and hollows studded with brushwood and small trees
She roamed up and down thinking there was perhaps a pool in every hollow before she came to it till her limbs were weary and she sat down to rest
The afternoon was far advanced and the leaden sky was darkening as if the sun were setting behind it
After a little while Hetty started up again feeling that darkness would soon come on and she must put off finding the pool till tomorrow and make her way to some shelter for the night
She had quite lost her way in the fields and might as well go in one direction as another for aught she knew
She walked through field after field and no village no house was in sight but there at the corner of this pasture there was a break in the hedges the land seemed to dip down a little and two trees leaned towards each other across the opening
Hettys heart gave a great heat as she thought there must be a pool there
She walked towards it heavily over the tufted grass with pale lips and a sense of trembling
It was as if the thing were come in spite of herself instead of being the object of her search
There it was black under the darkening sky no motion no sound near
She set down her basket and then sank down herself on the grass trembling
The pool had its wintry depth now by the time it got shallow as she remembered the pools did at Hayslope in the summer no one could find out that it was her body
But then there was her basketshe must hide that too
She must throw it into the watermake it heavy with stones first and then throw it in
She got up to look about for stones and soon brought five or six which she laid down beside her basket and then sat down again
There was no need to hurrythere was all the night to drown herself in
She sat leaning her elbow on the basket
She was weary hungry
There were some buns in her basketthree which she had supplied herself with at the place where she ate her dinner
She took them out now and ate them eagerly and then sat still again looking at the pool
The soothed sensation that came over her from the satisfaction of her hunger and this fixed dreamy attitude brought on drowsiness and presently her head sank down on her knees
She was fast asleep
When she awoke it was deep night and she felt chill
She was frightened at this darknessfrightened at the long night before her
If she could but throw herself into the water
No not yet
She began to walk about that she might get warm again as if she would have more resolution then
Oh how long the time was in that darkness
The bright hearth and the warmth and the voices of home the secure uprising and lying down the familiar fields the familiar people the Sundays and holidays with their simple joys of dress and feastingall the sweets of her young life rushed before her now and she seemed to be stretching her arms towards them across a great gulf
She set her teeth when she thought of Arthur
She cursed him without knowing what her cursing would do
She wished he too might know desolation and cold and a life of shame that he dared not end by death
The horror of this cold and darkness and solitudeout of all human reachbecame greater every long minute
It was almost as if she were dead already and knew that she was dead and longed to get back to life again
But no she was alive still she had not taken the dreadful leap
She felt a strange contradictory wretchedness and exultation wretchedness that she did not dare to face death exultation that she was still in lifethat she might yet know light and warmth again
She walked backwards and forwards to warm herself beginning to discern something of the objects around her as her eyes became accustomed to the night the darker line of the hedge the rapid motion of some living creatureperhaps a fieldmouserushing across the grass
She no longer felt as if the darkness hedged her in
She thought she could walk back across the field and get over the stile and then in the very next field she thought she remembered there was a hovel of furze near a sheepfold
If she could get into that hovel she would be warmer
She could pass the night there for that was what Alick did at Hayslope in lambingtime
The thought of this hovel brought the energy of a new hope
She took up her basket and walked across the field but it was some time before she got in the right direction for the stile
The exercise and the occupation of finding the stile were a stimulus to her however and lightened the horror of the darkness and solitude
There were sheep in the next field and she startled a group as she set down her basket and got over the stile and the sound of their movement comforted her for it assured her that her impression was rightthis was the field where she had seen the hovel for it was the field where the sheep were
Right on along the path and she would get to it
She reached the opposite gate and felt her way along its rails and the rails of the sheepfold till her hand encountered the pricking of the gorsy wall
Delicious sensation
She had found the shelter
She groped her way touching the prickly gorse to the door and pushed it open
It was an illsmelling close place but warm and there was straw on the ground
Hetty sank down on the straw with a sense of escape
Tears cameshe had never shed tears before since she left Windsortears and sobs of hysterical joy that she had still hold of life that she was still on the familiar earth with the sheep near her
The very consciousness of her own limbs was a delight to her she turned up her sleeves and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life
Soon warmth and weariness lulled her in the midst of her sobs and she fell continually into dozing fancying herself at the brink of the pool againfancying that she had jumped into the water and then awaking with a start and wondering where she was
But at last deep dreamless sleep came her head guarded by her bonnet found a pillow against the gorsy wall and the poor soul driven to and fro between two equal terrors found the one relief that was possible to itthe relief of unconsciousness
Alas
That relief seems to end the moment it has begun
It seemed to Hetty as if those dozen dreams had only passed into another dreamthat she was in the hovel and her aunt was standing over her with a candle in her hand
She trembled under her aunts glance and opened her eyes
There was no candle but there was light in the hovelthe light of early morning through the open door
And there was a face looking down on her but it was an unknown face belonging to an elderly man in a smockfrock
Why what do you do here young woman
the man said roughly
Hetty trembled still worse under this real fear and shame than she had done in her momentary dream under her aunts glance
She felt that she was like a beggar alreadyfound sleeping in that place
But in spite of her trembling she was so eager to account to the man for her presence here that she found words at once
I lost my way she said
Im travellingnorthard and I got away from the road into the fields and was overtaken by the dark
Will you tell me the way to the nearest village
She got up as she was speaking and put her hands to her bonnet to adjust it and then laid hold of her basket
The man looked at her with a slow bovine gaze without giving her any answer for some seconds
Then he turned away and walked towards the door of the hovel but it was not till he got there that he stood still and turning his shoulder halfround towards her said Aw I can show you the way to Norton if you like
But what do you do gettin out o the highroad
he added with a tone of gruff reproof
Yull be gettin into mischief if you dooant mind
Yes said Hetty I wont do it again
Ill keep in the road if youll be so good as show me how to get to it
Why dooant you keep where theres a fingerpoasses an folks to ax the way on
the man said still more gruffly
Anybody ud think you was a wild woman an look at yer
Hetty was frightened at this gruff old man and still more at this last suggestion that she looked like a wild woman
As she followed him out of the hovel she thought she would give him a sixpence for telling her the way and then he would not suppose she was wild
As he stopped to point out the road to her she put her hand in her pocket to get the sixpence ready and when he was turning away without saying goodmorning she held it out to him and said Thank you will you please to take something for your trouble
He looked slowly at the sixpence and then said I want none o your money
Youd better take care ont else youll get it stool from yer if you go trapesin about the fields like a mad woman a thatway
The man left her without further speech and Hetty held on her way
Another day had risen and she must wander on
It was no use to think of drowning herselfshe could not do it at least while she had money left to buy food and strength to journey on
But the incident on her waking this morning heightened her dread of that time when her money would be all gone she would have to sell her basket and clothes then and she would really look like a beggar or a wild woman as the man had said
The passionate joy in life she had felt in the night after escaping from the brink of the black cold death in the pool was gone now
Life now by the morning light with the impression of that mans hard wondering look at her was as full of dread as deathit was worse it was a dread to which she felt chained from which she shrank and shrank as she did from the black pool and yet could find no refuge from it
She took out her money from her purse and looked at it
She had still twoandtwenty shillings it would serve her for many days more or it would help her to get on faster to Stonyshire within reach of Dinah
The thought of Dinah urged itself more strongly now since the experience of the night had driven her shuddering imagination away from the pool
If it had been only going to Dinahif nobody besides Dinah would ever knowHetty could have made up her mind to go to her
The soft voice the pitying eyes would have drawn her
But afterwards the other people must know and she could no more rush on that shame than she could rush on death
She must wander on and on and wait for a lower depth of despair to give her courage
Perhaps death would come to her for she was getting less and less able to bear the days weariness
And yet such is the strange action of our souls drawing us by a lurking desire towards the very ends we dreadHetty when she set out again from Norton asked the straightest road northwards towards Stonyshire and kept it all that day
Poor wandering Hetty with the rounded childish face and the hard unloving despairing soul looking out of itwith the narrow heart and narrow thoughts no room in them for any sorrows but her own and tasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness
My heart bleeds for her as I see her toiling along on her weary feet or seated in a cart with her eyes fixed vacantly on the road before her never thinking or caring whither it tends till hunger comes and makes her desire that a village may be near
What will be the end the end of her objectless wandering apart from all love caring for human beings only through her pride clinging to life only as the hunted wounded brute clings to it
God preserve you and me from being the beginners of such miserty
Chapter XXXVIII The Quest THE first ten days after Hettys departure passed as quietly as any other days with the family at the Hall Farm and with Adam at his daily work
They had expected Hetty to stay away a week or ten days at least perhaps a little longer if Dinah came back with her because there might then be somethung to detain them at Snowfield
But when a fortnight had passed they began to feel a little surprise that Hetty did not return she must surely have found it pleasanter to be with Dinah than any one could have supposed
Adam for his part was getting very impatient to see her and he resolved that if she did not appear the next day Saturday he would set out on Sunday morning to fetch her
There was no coach on a Sunday but by setting out before it was light and perhaps getting a lift in a cart by the way he would arrive pretty early at Snowfield and bring back Hetty the next dayDinah too if she were coming
It was quite time Hetty came home and he would afford to lose his Monday for the sake of bringing her
His project was quite approved at the Farm when he went there on Saturday evening
Mrs Poyser desired him emphatically not to come back without Hetty for she had been quite too long away considering the things she had to get ready by the middle of March and a week was surely enough for any one to go out for their health
As for Dinah Mrs Poyser had small hope of their bringing her unless they could make her believe the folks at Hayslope were twice as miserable as the folks at Snowfield
Though said Mrs Poyser by way of conclusion you might tell her shes got but one aunt left and SHES wasted pretty nigh to a shadder and we shall prhaps all be gone twenty mile farther off her next Michaelmas and shall die o broken hearts among strange folks and leave the children fatherless and motherless
Nay nay said Mr Poyser who certainly had the air of a man perfectly heartwhole it isna so bad as that
Theet looking rarely now and getting flesh every day
But Id be glad for Dinah t come for shed help thee wi the little uns they took t her wonderful
So at daybreak on Sunday Adam set off
Seth went with him the first mile or two for the thought of Snowfield and the possibility that Dinah might come again made him restless and the walk with Adam in the cold morning air both in their best clothes helped to give him a sense of Sunday calm
It was the last morning in February with a low grey sky and a slight hoar frost on the green border of the road and on the black hedges
They heard the gurgling of the full brooklet hurrying down the hill and the faint twittering of the early birds
For they walked in silence though with a pleased sense of companionship
Goodbye lad said Adam laying his hand on Seths shoulder and looking at him affectionately as they were about to part
I wish thee wast going all the way wi me and as happy as I am
Im content Addy Im content said Seth cheerfully
Ill be an old bachelor belike and make a fuss wi thy children
They turned away from each other and Seth walked leisurely homeward mentally repeating one of his favourite hymnshe was very fond of hymns Dark and cheerless is the morn Unaccompanied by thee Joyless is the days return Till thy mercys beams I see Till thou inward light impart Glad my eyes and warm my heart
Visit then this soul of mine Pierce the gloom of sin and grief Fill me Radiancy Divine Scatter all my unbelief
More and more thyself display Shining to the perfect day
Adam walked much faster and any one coming along the Oakbourne road at sunrise that morning must have had a pleasant sight in this tall broadchested man striding along with a carriage as upright and firm as any soldiers glancing with keen glad eyes at the darkblue hills as they began to show themselves on his way
Seldom in Adams life had his face been so free from any cloud of anxiety as it was this morning and this freedom from care as is usual with constructive practical minds like his made him all the more observant of the objects round him and all the more ready to gather suggestions from them towards his own favourite plans and ingenious contrivances
His happy lovethe knowledge that his steps were carrying him nearer and nearer to Hetty who was so soon to be hiswas to his thoughts what the sweet morning air was to his sensations it gave him a consciousness of wellbeing that made activity delightful
Every now and then there was a rush of more intense feeling towards her which chased away other images than Hetty and along with that would come a wondering thankfulness that all this happiness was given to himthat this life of ours had such sweetness in it
For Adam had a devout mind though he was perhaps rather impatient of devout words and his tenderness lay very close to his reverence so that the one could hardly be stirred without the other
But after feeling had welled up and poured itself out in this way busy thought would come back with the greater vigour and this morning it was intent on schemes by which the roads might be improved that were so imperfect all through the country and on picturing all the benefits that might come from the exertions of a single country gentleman if he would set himself to getting the roads made good in his own district
It seemed a very short walk the ten miles to Oakbourne that pretty town within sight of the blue hills where he breakfasted
After this the country grew barer and barer no more rolling woods no more widebranching trees near frequent homesteads no more bushy hedgerows but greystone walls intersecting the meagre pastures and dismal widescattered greystone houses on broken lands where mines had been and were no longer
A hungry land said Adam to himself
Id rather go southard where they say its as flat as a table than come to live here though if Dinah likes to live in a country where she can be the most comfort to folks shes i the right to live o this side for she must look as if shed come straight from heaven like th angels in the desert to strengthen them as ha got nothing t eat
And when at last he came in sight of Snowfield he thought it looked like a town that was fellow to the country though the stream through the valley where the great mill stood gave a pleasant greenness to the lower fields
The town lay grim stony and unsheltered up the side of a steep hill and Adam did not go forward to it at present for Seth had told him where to find Dinah
It was at a thatched cottage outside the town a little way from the millan old cottage standing sideways towards the road with a little bit of potatoground before it
Here Dinah lodged with an elderly couple and if she and Hetty happened to be out Adam could learn where they were gone or when they would be at home again
Dinah might be out on some preaching errand and perhaps she would have left Hetty at home
Adam could not help hoping this and as he recognized the cottage by the roadside before him there shone out in his face that involuntary smile which belongs to the expectation of a near joy
He hurried his step along the narrow causeway and rapped at the door
It was opened by a very clean old woman with a slow palsied shake of the head
Is Dinah Morris at home
said Adam
Ehno said the old woman looking up at this tall stranger with a wonder that made her slower of speech than usual
Will you please to come in
she added retiring from the door as if recollecting herself
Why yere brother to the young man as come afore arena ye
Yes said Adam entering
That was Seth Bede
Im his brother Adam
He told me to give his respects to you and your good master
Aye the same t him
He was a gracious young man
An ye feature him ony yere darker
Sit ye down i th armchair
My man isna come home from meeting
Adam sat down patiently not liking to hurry the shaking old woman with questions but looking eagerly towards the narrow twisting stairs in one corner for he thought it was possible Hetty might have heard his voice and would come down them
So youre come to see Dinah Morris
said the old woman standing opposite to him
An you didn know she was away from home then
No said Adam but I thought it likely she might be away seeing as its Sunday
But the other young womanis she at home or gone along with Dinah
The old woman looked at Adam with a bewildered air
Gone along wi her
she said
Eh Dinahs gone to Leeds a big town ye may ha heared on where theres a many o the Lords people
Shes been gone sin Friday was a fortnight they sent her the money for her journey
You may see her room here she went on opening a door and not noticing the effect of her words on Adam
He rose and followed her and darted an eager glance into the little room with its narrow bed the portrait of Wesley on the wall and the few books lying on the large Bible
He had had an irrational hope that Hetty might be there
He could not speak in the first moment after seeing that the room was empty an undefined fear had seized himsomething had happened to Hetty on the journey
Still the old woman was so slow of speech and apprehension that Hetty might be at Snowfield after all
Its a pity ye didna know she said
Have ye come from your own country o purpose to see her
But HettyHetty Sorrel said Adam abruptly Where is she
I know nobody by that name said the old woman wonderingly
Is it anybody yeve heared on at Snowfield
Did there come no young woman herevery young and prettyFriday was a fortnight to see Dinah Morris
Nay In seen no young woman
Think are you quite sure
A girl eighteen years old with dark eyes and dark curly hair and a red cloak on and a basket on her arm
You couldnt forget her if you saw her
Nay Friday was a fortnightit was the day as Dinah went away there come nobody
Theres neer been nobody asking for her till you come for the folks about know as shes gone
Eh dear eh dear is there summat the matter
The old woman had seen the ghastly look of fear in Adams face
But he was not stunned or confounded he was thinking eagerly where he could inquire about Hetty
Yes a young woman started from our country to see Dinah Friday was a fortnight
I came to fetch her back
Im afraid something has happened to her
I cant stop
Goodbye
He hastened out of the cottage and the old woman followed him to the gate watching him sadly with her shaking head as he almost ran towards the town
He was going to inquire at the place where the Oakbourne coach stopped
No
No young woman like Hetty had been seen there
Had any accident happened to the coach a fortnight ago
No
And there was no coach to take him back to Oakbourne that day
Well he would walk he couldnt stay here in wretched inaction
But the innkeeper seeing that Adam was in great anxiety and entering into this new incident with the eagerness of a man who passes a great deal of time with his hands in his pockets looking into an obstinately monotonous street offered to take him back to Oakbourne in his own taxed cart this very evening
It was not five oclock there was plenty of time for Adam to take a meal and yet to get to Oakbourne before ten oclock
The innkeeper declared that he really wanted to go to Oakbourne and might as well go tonight he should have all Monday before him then
Adam after making an ineffectual attempt to eat put the food in his pocket and drinking a draught of ale declared himself ready to set off
As they approached the cottage it occurred to him that he would do well to learn from the old woman where Dinah was to be found in Leeds if there was trouble at the Hall Farmhe only halfadmitted the foreboding that there would bethe Poysers might like to send for Dinah
But Dinah had not left any address and the old woman whose memory for names was infirm could not recall the name of the blessed woman who was Dinahs chief friend in the Society at Leeds
During that long long journey in the taxed cart there was time for all the conjectures of importunate fear and struggling hope
In the very first shock of discovering that Hetty had not been to Snowfield the thought of Arthur had darted through Adam like a sharp pang but he tried for some time to ward off its return by busying himself with modes of accounting for the alarming fact quite apart from that intolerable thought
Some accident had happened
Hetty had by some strange chance got into a wrong vehicle from Oakbourne she had been taken ill and did not want to frighten them by letting them know
But this frail fence of vague improbabilities was soon hurled down by a rush of distinct agonizing fears
Hetty had been deceiving herself in thinking that she could love and marry him she had been loving Arthur all the while and now in her desperation at the nearness of their marriage she had run away
And she was gone to him
The old indignation and jealousy rose again and prompted the suspicion that Arthur had been dealing falselyhad written to Hettyhad tempted her to come to himbeing unwilling after all that she should belong to another man besides himself
Perhaps the whole thing had been contrived by him and he had given her directions how to follow him to Irelandfor Adam knew that Arthur had been gone thither three weeks ago having recently learnt it at the Chase
Every sad look of Hettys since she had been engaged to Adam returned upon him now with all the exaggeration of painful retrospect
He had been foolishly sanguine and confident
The poor thing hadnt perhaps known her own mind for a long while had thought that she could forget Arthur had been momentarily drawn towards the man who offered her a protecting faithful love
He couldnt bear to blame her she never meant to cause him this dreadful pain
The blame lay with that man who had selfishly played with her hearthad perhaps even deliberately lured her away
At Oakbourne the ostler at the Royal Oak remembered such a young woman as Adam described getting out of the Treddleston coach more than a fortnight agowasnt likely to forget such a pretty lass as that in a hurrywas sure she had not gone on by the Buxton coach that went through Snowfield but had lost sight of her while he went away with the horses and had never set eyes on her again
Adam then went straight to the house from which the Stonition coach started Stoniton was the most obvious place for Hetty to go to first whatever might be her destination for she would hardly venture on any but the chief coachroads
She had been noticed here too and was remembered to have sat on the box by the coachman but the coachman could not be seen for another man had been driving on that road in his stead the last three or four days
He could probably be seen at Stoniton through inquiry at the inn where the coach put up
So the anxious heartstricken Adam must of necessity wait and try to rest till morningnay till eleven oclock when the coach started
At Stoniton another delay occurred for the old coachman who had driven Hetty would not be in the town again till night
When he did come he remembered Hetty well and remembered his own joke addressed to her quoting it many times to Adam and observing with equal frequency that he thought there was something more than common because Hetty had not laughed when he joked her
But he declared as the people had done at the inn that he had lost sight of Hetty directly she got down
Part of the next morning was consumed in inquiries at every house in the town from which a coach startedall in vain for you know Hetty did not start from Stonition by coach but on foot in the grey morningand then in walking out to the first tollgates on the different lines of road in the forlorn hope of finding some recollection of her there
No she was not to be traced any farther and the next hard task for Adam was to go home and carry the wretched tidings to the Hall Farm
As to what he should do beyond that he had come to two distinct resolutions amidst the tumult of thought and feeling which was going on within him while he went to and fro
He would not mention what he knew of Arthur Donnithornes behaviour to Hetty till there was a clear necessity for it it was still possible Hetty might come back and the disclosure might be an injury or an offence to her
And as soon as he had been home and done what was necessary there to prepare for his further absence he would start off to Ireland if he found no trace of Hetty on the road he would go straight to Arthur Donnithorne and make himself certain how far he was acquainted with her movements
Several times the thought occurred to him that he would consult Mr Irwine but that would be useless unless he told him all and so betrayed the secret about Arthur
It seems strange that Adam in the incessant occupation of his mind about Hetty should never have alighted on the probability that she had gone to Windsor ignorant that Arthur was no longer there
Perhaps the reason was that he could not conceive Hettys throwing herself on Arthur uncalled he imagined no cause that could have driven her to such a step after that letter written in August
There were but two alternatives in his mind either Arthur had written to her again and enticed her away or she had simply fled from her approaching marriage with himself because she found after all she could not love him well enough and yet was afraid of her friends anger if she retracted
With this last determination on his mind of going straight to Arthur the thought that he had spent two days in inquiries which had proved to be almost useless was torturing to Adam and yet since he would not tell the Poysers his conviction as to where Hetty was gone or his intention to follow her thither he must be able to say to them that he had traced her as far as possible
It was after twelve oclock on Tuesday night when Adam reached Treddleston and unwilling to disturb his mother and Seth and also to encounter their questions at that hour he threw himself without undressing on a bed at the Waggon Overthrown and slept hard from pure weariness
Not more than four hours however for before five oclock he set out on his way home in the faint morning twilight
He always kept a key of the workshop door in his pocket so that he could let himself in and he wished to enter without awaking his mother for he was anxious to avoid telling her the new trouble himself by seeing Seth first and asking him to tell her when it should be necessary
He walked gently along the yard and turned the key gently in the door but as he expected Gyp who lay in the workshop gave a sharp bark
It subsided when he saw Adam holding up his finger at him to impose silence and in his dumb tailless joy he must content himself with rubbing his body against his masters legs
Adam was too heartsick to take notice of Gyps fondling
He threw himself on the bench and stared dully at the wood and the signs of work around him wondering if he should ever come to feel pleasure in them again while Gyp dimly aware that there was something wrong with his master laid his rough grey head on Adams knee and wrinkled his brows to look up at him
Hitherto since Sunday afternoon Adam had been constantly among strange people and in strange places having no associations with the details of his daily life and now that by the light of this new morning he was come back to his home and surrounded by the familiar objects that seemed for ever robbed of their charm the realitythe hard inevitable reality of his troubles pressed upon him with a new weight
Right before him was an unfinished chest of drawers which he had been making in spare moments for Hettys use when his home should be hers
Seth had not heard Adams entrance but he had been roused by Gyps bark and Adam heard him moving about in the room above dressing himself
Seths first thoughts were about his brother he would come home today surely for the business would be wanting him sadly by tomorrow but it was pleasant to think he had had a longer holiday than he had expected
And would Dinah come too
Seth felt that that was the greatest happiness he could look forward to for himself though he had no hope left that she would ever love him well enough to marry him but he had often said to himself it was better to be Dinahs friend and brother than any other womans husband
If he could but be always near her instead of living so far off
He came downstairs and opened the inner door leading from the kitchen into the workshop intending to let out Gyp but he stood still in the doorway smitten with a sudden shock at the sight of Adam seated listlessly on the bench pale unwashed with sunken blank eyes almost like a drunkard in the morning
But Seth felt in an instant what the marks meantnot drunkenness but some great calamity
Adam looked up at him without speaking and Seth moved forward towards the bench himself trembling so that speech did not come readily
God have mercy on us Addy he said in a low voice sitting down on the bench beside Adam what is it
Adam was unable to speak
The strong man accustomed to suppress the signs of sorrow had felt his heart swell like a childs at this first approach of sympathy
He fell on Seths neck and sobbed
Seth was prepared for the worst now for even in his recollections of their boyhood Adam had never sobbed before
Is it death Adam
Is she dead
he asked in a low tone when Adam raised his head and was recovering himself
No lad but shes gonegone away from us
Shes never been to Snowfield
Dinahs been gone to Leeds ever since last Friday was a fortnight the very day Hetty set out
I cant find out where she went after she got to Stoniton
Seth was silent from utter astonishment he knew nothing that could suggest to him a reason for Hettys going away
Hast any notion what shes done it for
he said at last
She cant ha loved me
She didnt like our marriage when it came nighthat must be it said Adam
He had determined to mention no further reason
I hear Mother stirring said Seth
Must we tell her
No not yet said Adam rising from the bench and pushing the hair from his face as if he wanted to rouse himself
I cant have her told yet and I must set out on another journey directly after Ive been to the village and th Hall Farm
I cant tell thee where Im going and thee must say to her Im gone on business as nobody is to know anything about
Ill go and wash myself now
Adam moved towards the door of the workshop but after a step or two he turned round and meeting Seths eyes with a calm sad glance he said I must take all the money out o the tin box lad but if anything happens to me all the rest ll be thine to take care o Mother with
Seth was pale and trembling he felt there was some terrible secret under all this
Brother he said faintlyhe never called Adam Brother except in solemn momentsI dont believe youll do anything as you cant ask Gods blessing on
Nay lad said Adam dont be afraid
Im for doing nought but whats a mans duty
The thought that if he betrayed his trouble to his mother she would only distress him by words half of blundering affection half of irrepressible triumph that Hetty proved as unfit to be his wife as she had always foreseen brought back some of his habitual firmness and selfcommand
He had felt ill on his journey home he told her when she came downhad stayed all night at Tredddleston for that reason and a bad headache that still hung about him this morning accounted for his paleness and heavy eyes
He determined to go to the village in the first place attend to his business for an hour and give notice to Burge of his being obliged to go on a journey which he must beg him not to mention to any one for he wished to avoid going to the Hall Farm near breakfasttime when the children and servants would be in the houseplace and there must be exclamations in their hearing about his having returned without Hetty
He waited until the clock struck nine before he left the workyard at the village and set off through the fields towards the Farm
It was an immense relief to him as he came near the Home Close to see Mr Poyser advancing towards him for this would spare him the pain of going to the house
Mr Poyser was walking briskly this March morning with a sense of spring business on his mind he was going to cast the masters eye on the shoeing of a new carthorse carrying his spud as a useful companion by the way
His surprise was great when he caught sight of Adam but he was not a man given to presentiments of evil
Why Adam lad ist you
Have ye been all this time away and not brought the lasses back after all
Where are they
No Ive not brought em said Adam turning round to indicate that he wished to walk back with Mr Poyser
Why said Martin looking with sharper attention at Adam ye look bad
Is there anything happened
Yes said Adam heavily
A sad things happened
I didna find Hetty at Snowfield
Mr Poysers goodnatured face showed signs of troubled astonishment
Not find her
Whats happened to her
he said his thoughts flying at once to bodily accident
That I cant tell whether anythings happened to her
She never went to Snowfieldshe took the coach to Stoniton but I cant learn nothing of her after she got down from the Stoniton coach
Why you donna mean shes run away
said Martin standing still so puzzled and bewildered that the fact did not yet make itself felt as a trouble by him
She must ha done said Adam
She didnt like our marriage when it came to the pointthat must be it
Shed mistook her feelings
Martin was silent for a minute or two looking on the ground and rooting up the grass with his spud without knowing what he was doing
His usual slowness was always trebled when the subject of speech was painful
At last he looked up right in Adams face saying Then she didna deserve t ha ye my lad
An I feel i fault myself for she was my niece and I was allays hot for her marring ye
Theres no amends I can make ye ladthe mores the pity its a sad cutup for ye I doubt
Adam could say nothing and Mr Poyser after pursuing his walk for a little while went on Ill be bound shes gone after trying to get a ladys maids place for shed got that in her head half a year ago and wanted me to gi my consent
But Id thought better on herhe added shaking his head slowly and sadlyId thought better on her nor to look for this after shed gien y her word an everything been got ready
Adam had the strongest motives for encouraging this supposition in Mr Poyser and he even tried to believe that it might possibly be true
He had no warrant for the certainty that she was gone to Arthur
It was better it should be so he said as quietly as he could if she felt she couldnt like me for a husband
Better run away before than repent after
I hope you wont look harshly on her if she comes back as she may do if she finds it hard to get on away from home
I canna look on her as Ive done before said Martin decisively
Shes acted bad by you and by all of us
But Ill not turn my back on her shes but a young un and its the first harm Ive knowed on her
Itll be a hard job for me to tell her aunt
Why didna Dinah come back wi ye
Shed ha helped to pacify her aunt a bit
Dinah wasnt at Snowfield
Shes been gone to Leeds this fortnight and I couldnt learn from th old woman any direction where she is at Leeds else I should ha brought it you
Shed a deal better be staying wi her own kin said Mr Poyser indignantly than going preaching among strange folks athatn
I must leave you now Mr Poyser said Adam for Ive a deal to see to
Aye youd best be after your business and I must tell the missis when I go home
Its a hard job
But said Adam I beg particular youll keep whats happened quiet for a week or two
Ive not told my mother yet and theres no knowing how things may turn out
Aye aye least said soonest mended
Wen no need to say why the match is broke off an we may hear of her after a bit
Shake hands wi me lad I wish I could make thee amends
There was something in Martin Poysers throat at that moment which caused him to bring out those scanty words in rather a broken fashion
Yet Adam knew what they meant all the better and the two honest men grasped each others hard hands in mutual understanding
There was nothing now to hinder Adam from setting off
He had told Seth to go to the Chase and leave a message for the squire saying that Adam Bede had been obliged to start off suddenly on a journeyand to say as much and no more to any one else who made inquiries about him
If the Poysers learned that he was gone away again Adam knew they would infer that he was gone in search of Hetty
He had intended to go right on his way from the Hall Farm but now the impulse which had frequently visited him beforeto go to Mr Irwine and make a confidant of himrecurred with the new force which belongs to a last opportunity
He was about to start on a long journeya difficult oneby seaand no soul would know where he was gone
If anything happened to him
Or if he absolutely needed help in any matter concerning Hetty
Mr Irwine was to be trusted and the feeling which made Adam shrink from telling anything which was her secret must give way before the need there was that she should have some one else besides himself who would be prepared to defend her in the worst extremity
Towards Arthur even though he might have incurred no new guilt Adam felt that he was not bound to keep silence when Hettys interest called on him to speak
I must do it said Adam when these thoughts which had spread themselves through hours of his sad journeying now rushed upon him in an instant like a wave that had been slowly gathering its the right thing
I cant stand alone in this way any longer
Chapter XXXIX The Tidings ADAM turned his face towards Broxton and walked with his swiftest stride looking at his watch with the fear that Mr Irwine might be gone outhunting perhaps
The fear and haste together produced a state of strong excitement before he reached the rectory gate and outside it he saw the deep marks of a recent hoof on the gravel
But the hoofs were turned towards the gate not away from it and though there was a horse against the stable door it was not Mr Irwines it had evidently had a journey this morning and must belong to some one who had come on business
Mr Irwine was at home then but Adam could hardly find breath and calmness to tell Carroll that he wanted to speak to the rector
The double suffering of certain and uncertain sorrow had begun to shake the strong man
The butler looked at him wonderingly as he threw himself on a bench in the passage and stared absently at the clock on the opposite wall
The master had somebody with him he said but he heard the study door openthe stranger seemed to be coming out and as Adam was in a hurry he would let the master know at once
Adam sat looking at the clock the minutehand was hurrying along the last five minutes to ten with a loud hard indifferent tick and Adam watched the movement and listened to the sound as if he had had some reason for doing so
In our times of bitter suffering there are almost always these pauses when our consciousness is benumbed to everything but some trivial perception or sensation
It is as if semiidiocy came to give us rest from the memory and the dread which refuse to leave us in our sleep
Carroll coming back recalled Adam to the sense of his burden
He was to go into the study immediately
I cant think what that strange persons come about the butler added from mere incontinence of remark as he preceded Adam to the door hes gone i the diningroom
And master looks unaccountableas if he was frightened
Adam took no notice of the words he could not care about other peoples business
But when he entered the study and looked in Mr Irwines face he felt in an instant that there was a new expression in it strangely different from the warm friendliness it had always worn for him before
A letter lay open on the table and Mr Irwines hand was on it but the changed glance he cast on Adam could not be owing entirely to preoccupation with some disagreeable business for he was looking eagerly towards the door as if Adams entrance were a matter of poignant anxiety to him
You want to speak to me Adam he said in that low constrainedly quiet tone which a man uses when he is determined to suppress agitation
Sit down here
He pointed to a chair just opposite to him at no more than a yards distance from his own and Adam sat down with a sense that this cold manner of Mr Irwines gave an additional unexpected difficulty to his disclosure
But when Adam had made up his mind to a measure he was not the man to renounce it for any but imperative reasons
I come to you sir he said as the gentleman I look up to most of anybody
Ive something very painful to tell yousomething as itll pain you to hear as well as me to tell
But if I speak o the wrong other people have done youll see I didnt speak till Id good reason
Mr Irwine nodded slowly and Adam went on rather tremulously You was t ha married me and Hetty Sorrel you know sir o the fifteenth o this month
I thought she loved me and I was th happiest man i the parish
But a dreadful blows come upon me
Mr Irwine started up from his chair as if involuntarily but then determined to control himself walked to the window and looked out
Shes gone away sir and we dont know where
She said she was going to Snowfield o Friday was a fortnight and I went last Sunday to fetch her back but shed never been there and she took the coach to Stoniton and beyond that I cant trace her
But now Im going a long journey to look for her and I cant trust t anybody but you where Im going
Mr Irwine came back from the window and sat down
Have you no idea of the reason why she went away
he said
Its plain enough she didnt want to marry me sir said Adam
She didnt like it when it came so near
But that isnt all I doubt
Theres something else I must tell you sir
Theres somebody else concerned besides me
A gleam of somethingit was almost like relief or joycame across the eager anxiety of Mr Irwines face at that moment
Adam was looking on the ground and paused a little the next words were hard to speak
But when he went on he lifted up his head and looked straight at Mr Irwine
He would do the thing he had resolved to do without flinching
You know whos the man Ive reckoned my greatest friend he said and used to be proud to think as I should pass my life i working for him and had felt so ever since we were lads Mr Irwine as if all selfcontrol had forsaken him grasped Adams arm which lay on the table and clutching it tightly like a man in pain said with pale lips and a low hurried voice No Adam nodont say it for Gods sake
Adam surprised at the violence of Mr Irwines feeling repented of the words that had passed his lips and sat in distressed silence
The grasp on his arm gradually relaxed and Mr Irwine threw himself back in his chair saying Go onI must know it
That man played with Hettys feelings and behaved to her as hed no right to do to a girl in her station o lifemade her presents and used to go and meet her out awalking
I found it out only two days before he went awayfound him akissing her as they were parting in the Grove
Thered been nothing said between me and Hetty then though Id loved her for a long while and she knew it
But I reproached him with his wrong actions and words and blows passed between us and he said solemnly to me after that as it had been all nonsense and no more than a bit o flirting
But I made him write a letter to tell Hetty hed meant nothing for I saw clear enough sir by several things as I hadnt understood at the time as hed got hold of her heart and I thought shed belike go on thinking of him and never come to love another man as wanted to marry her
And I gave her the letter and she seemed to bear it all after a while better than Id expectedand she behaved kinder and kinder to meI daresay she didnt know her own feelings then poor thing and they came back upon her when it was too lateI dont want to blame herI cant think as she meant to deceive me
But I was encouraged to think she loved me andyou know the rest sir
But its on my mind as hes been false to me and ticed her away and shes gone to himand Im going now to see for I can never go to work again till I know whats become of her
During Adams narrative Mr Irwine had had time to recover his selfmastery in spite of the painful thoughts that crowded upon him
It was a bitter remembrance to him nowthat morning when Arthur breakfasted with him and seemed as if he were on the verge of a confession
It was plain enough now what he had wanted to confess
And if their words had taken another turnif he himself had been less fastidious about intruding on another mans secretsit was cruel to think how thin a film had shut out rescue from all this guilt and misery
He saw the whole history now by that terrible illumination which the present sheds back upon the past
But every other feeling as it rushed upon his was thrown into abeyance by pity deep respectful pity for the man who sat before himalready so bruised going forth with sad blind resignedness to an unreal sorrow while a real one was close upon him too far beyond the range of common trial for him ever to have feared it
His own agitation was quelled by a certain awe that comes over us in the presence of a great anguish for the anguish he must inflict on Adam was already present to him
Again he put his hand on the arm that lay on the table but very gently this time as he said solemnly Adam my dear friend you have had some hard trials in your life
You can bear sorrow manfully as well as act manfully
God requires both tasks at our hands
And there is a heavier sorrow coming upon you than any you have yet known
But you are not guiltyyou have not the worst of all sorrows
God help him who has
The two pale faces looked at each other in Adams there was trembling suspense in Mr Irwines hesitating shrinking pity
But he went on
I have had news of Hetty this morning
She is not gone to him
She is in Stonyshireat Stoniton
Adam started up from his chair as if he thought he could have leaped to her that moment
But Mr Irwine laid hold of his arm again and said persuasively Wait Adam wait
So he sat down
She is in a very unhappy positionone which will make it worse for you to find her my poor friend than to have lost her for ever
Adams lips moved tremulously but no sound came
They moved again and he whispered Tell me
She has been arrestedshe is in prison
It was as if an insulting blow had brought back the spirit of resistance into Adam
The blood rushed to his face and he said loudly and sharply For what
For a great crimethe murder of her child
It CANT BE
Adam almost shouted starting up from his cnair and making a stride towards the door but he turned round again setting his back against the bookcase and looking fiercely at Mr Irwine
It isnt possible
She never had a child
She cant be guilty
WHO says it
God grant she may be innocent Adam
We can still hope she is
But who says she is guilty
said Adam violently
Tell me everything
Here is a letter from the magistrate before whom she was taken and the constable who arrested her is in the diningroom
She will not confess her name or where she comes from but I fear I fear there can be no doubt it is Hetty
The description of her person corresponds only that she is said to look very pale and ill She had a small redleather pocketbook in her pocket with two names written in itone at the beginning Hetty Sorrel Hayslope and the other near the end Dinah Morris Snowfield
She will not say which is her own nameshe denies everything and will answer no questions and application has been made to me as a magistrate that I may take measures for identifying her for it was thought probable that the name which stands first is her own name
But what proof have they got against her if it IS Hetty
said Adam still violently with an effort that seemed to shake his whole frame
Ill not believe it
It couldnt ha been and none of us know it
Terrible proof that she was under the temptation to commit the crime but we have room to hope that she did not really commit it
Try and read that letter Adam
Adam took the letter between his shaking hands and tried to fix his eyes steadily on it
Mr Irwine meanwhile went out to give some orders
When he came back Adams eyes were still on the first pagehe couldnt readhe could not put the words together and make out what they meant
He threw it down at last and clenched his fist
Its HIS doing he said if theres been any crime its at his door not at hers
HE taught her to deceiveHE deceived me first
Let em put HIM on his triallet him stand in court beside her and Ill tell em how he got hold of her heart and ticed her t evil and then lied to me
Is HE to go free while they lay all the punishment on herso weak and young
The image called up by these last words gave a new direction to poor Adams maddened feelings
He was silent looking at the corner of the room as if he saw something there
Then he burst out again in a tone of appealing anguish I cant bear itO God its too hard to lay upon meits too hard to think shes wicked
Mr Irwine had sat down again in silence
He was too wise to utter soothing words at present and indeed the sight of Adam before him with that look of sudden age which sometimes comes over a young face in moments of terrible emotionthe hard bloodless look of the skin the deep lines about the quivering mouth the furrows in the browthe sight of this strong firm man shattered by the invisible stroke of sorrow moved him so deeply that speech was not easy
Adam stood motionless with his eyes vacantly fixed in this way for a minute or two in that short space he was living through all his love again
She cant ha done it he said still without moving his eyes as if he were only talking to himself it was fear made her hide itI forgive her for deceiving meI forgive thee Hettythee wast deceived tooits gone hard wi thee my poor Hettybut theyll never make me believe it
He was silent again for a few moments and then he said with fierce abruptness Ill go to himIll bring him backIll make him go and look at her in her miseryhe shall look at her till he cant forget itit shall follow him night and dayas long as he lives it shall follow himhe shant escape wi lies this time Ill fetch him Ill drag him myself
In the act of going towards the door Adam paused automatically and looked about for his hat quite unconscious where he was or who was present with him
Mr Irwine had followed him and now took him by the arm saying in a quiet but decided tone No Adam no Im sure you will wish to stay and see what good can be done for her instead of going on a useless errand of vengeance
The punishment will surely fall without your aid
Besides he is no longer in Ireland
He must be on his way homeor would be long before you arrived for his grandfather I know wrote for him to come at least ten days ago
I want you now to go with me to Stoniton
I have ordered a horse for you to ride with us as soon as you can compose yourself
While Mr Irwine was speaking Adam recovered his consciousness of the actual scene
He rubbed his hair off his forehead and listened
Remember Mr Irwine went on there are others to think of and act for besides yourself Adam there are Hettys friends the good Poysers on whom this stroke will fall more heavily than I can bear to think
I expect it from your strength of mind Adam from your sense of duty to God and manthat you will try to act as long as action can be of any use
In reality Mr Irwine proposed this journey to Stoniton for Adams own sake
Movement with some object before him was the best means of counteracting the violence of suffering in these first hours
You will go with me to Stoniton Adam
he said again after a moments pause
We have to see if it is really Hetty who is there you know
Yes sir said Adam Ill do what you think right
But the folks at th Hall Farm
I wish them not to know till I return to tell them myself
I shall have ascertained things then which I am uncertain about now and I shall return as soon as possible
Come now the horses are ready
Chapter XL The Bitter Waters Spread MR IRWINE returned from Stoniton in a postchaise that night and the first words Carroll said to him as he entered the house were that Squire Donnithorne was deadfound dead in his bed at ten oclock that morningand that Mrs Irwine desired him to say she should be awake when Mr Irwine came home and she begged him not to go to bed without seeing her
Well Dauphin Mrs Irwine said as her son entered her room youre come at last
So the old gentlemans fidgetiness and low spirits which made him send for Arthur in that sudden way really meant something
I suppose Carroll has told you that Donnithorne was found dead in his bed this morning
You will believe my prognostications another time though I daresay I shant live to prognosticate anything but my own death
What have they done about Arthur
said Mr Irwine
Sent a messenger to await him at Liverpool
Yes Ralph was gone before the news was brought to us
Dear Arthur I shall live now to see him master at the Chase and making good times on the estate like a generoushearted fellow as he is
Hell be as happy as a king now
Mr Irwine could not help giving a slight groan he was worn with anxiety and exertion and his mothers light words were almost intolerable
What are you so dismal about Dauphin
Is there any bad news
Or are you thinking of the danger for Arthur in crossing that frightful Irish Channel at this time of year
No Mother Im not thinking of that but Im not prepared to rejoice just now
Youve been worried by this law business that youve been to Stoniton about
What in the world is it that you cant tell me
You will know by and by mother
It would not be right for me to tell you at present
Goodnight youll sleep now you have no longer anything to listen for
Mr Irwine gave up his intention of sending a letter to meet Arthur since it would not now hasten his return the news of his grandfathers death would bring him as soon as he could possibly come
He could go to bed now and get some needful rest before the time came for the mornings heavy duty of carrying his sickening news to the Hall Farm and to Adams home
Adam himself was not come back from Stoniton for though he shrank from seeing Hetty he could not bear to go to a distance from her again
Its no use sir he said to the rector its no use for me to go back
I cant go to work again while shes here and I couldnt bear the sight o the things and folks round home
Ill take a bit of a room here where I can see the prison walls and perhaps I shall get in time to bear seeing her
Adam had not been shaken in his belief that Hetty was innocent of the crime she was charged with for Mr Irwine feeling that the belief in her guilt would be a crushing addition to Adams load had kept from him the facts which left no hope in his own mind
There was not any reason for thrusting the whole burden on Adam at once and Mr Irwine at parting only said If the evidence should tell too strongly against her Adam we may still hope for a pardon
Her youth and other circumstances will be a plea for her
Ah and its right people should know how she was tempted into the wrong way said Adam with bitter earnestness
Its right they should know it was a fine gentleman made love to her and turned her head wi notions
Youll remember sir youve promised to tell my mother and Seth and the people at the farm who it was as led her wrong else theyll think harder of her than she deserves
Youll be doing her a hurt by sparing him and I hold him the guiltiest before God let her ha done what she may
If you spare him Ill expose him
I think your demand is just Adam said Mr Irwine but when you are calmer you will judge Arthur more mercifully
I say nothing now only that his punishment is in other hands than ours
Mr Irwine felt it hard upon him that he should have to tell of Arthurs sad part in the story of sin and sorrowhe who cared for Arthur with fatherly affection who had cared for him with fatherly pride
But he saw clearly that the secret must be known before long even apart from Adams determination since it was scarcely to be supposed that Hetty would persist to the end in her obstinate silence
He made up his mind to withhold nothing from the Poysers but to tell them the worst at once for there was no time to rob the tidings of their suddenness
Hettys trial must come on at the Lent assizes and they were to be held at Stoniton the next week
It was scarcely to be hoped that Martin Poyser could escape the pain of being called as a witness and it was better he should know everything as long beforehand as possible
Before ten oclock on Thursday morning the home at the Hall Farm was a house of mourning for a misfortune felt to be worse than death
The sense of family dishonour was too keen even in the kindhearted Martin Poyser the younger to leave room for any compassion towards Hetty
He and his father were simpleminded farmers proud of their untarnished character proud that they came of a family which had held up its head and paid its way as far back as its name was in the parish register and Hetty had brought disgrace on them alldisgrace that could never be wiped out
That was the allconquering feeling in the mind both of father and sonthe scorching sense of disgrace which neutralised all other sensibilityand Mr Irwine was struck with surprise to observe that Mrs Poyser was less severe than her husband
We are often startled by the severity of mild people on exceptional occasions the reason is that mild people are most liable to be under the yoke of traditional impressions
Im willing to pay any money as is wanted towards trying to bring her off said Martin the younger when Mr Irwine was gone while the old grandfather was crying in the opposite chair but Ill not go nigh her nor ever see her again by my own will
Shes made our bread bitter to us for all our lives to come an we shall neer hold up our heads i this parish nor i any other
The parson talks o folks pitying us its poor amends pity ull make us
Pity
said the grandfather sharply
I neer wanted folkss pity i MY life aforean I mun begin to be looked down on now an me turned seventytwo last St Thomass an all th underbearers and pallbearers as In picked for my funeral are i this parish and the next to tIts o no use nowI mun be taen to the grave by strangers
Dont fret so father said Mrs Poyser who had spoken very little being almost overawed by her husbands unusual hardness and decision
Youll have your children wi you an theres the lads and the little un ull grow up in a new parish as well as i th old un
Ah theres no staying i this country for us now said Mr Poyser and the hard tears trickled slowly down his round cheeks
We thought it ud be bad luck if the old squire gave us notice this Lady day but I must gi notice myself now an see if there can anybody be got to come an take to the crops as In put i the ground for I wonna stay upo that mans land a day longer nor Im forced tot
An me as thought him such a good upright young man as I should be glad when he come to be our landlord
Ill neer lift my hat to him again nor sit i the same church wi hima man as has brought shame on respectable folksan pretended to be such a friend t everybodyPoor Adam therea fine friend hes been t Adam making speeches an talking so fine an all the while poisoning the lads life as its much if he can stay i this country any more nor we can
An you t ha to go into court and own youre akin t her said the old man
Why theyll cast it up to the little un as isnt four ear old some daytheyll cast it up t her as shed a cousin tried at the sizes for murder
Itll be their own wickedness then said Mrs Poyser with a sob in her voice
But theres One above ull take care o the innicent child else its but little truth they tell us at church
Itll be harder nor ever to die an leave the little uns an nobody to be a mother to em
Wed better ha sent for Dinah if wed known where she is said Mr Poyser but Adam said shed left no direction where shed be at Leeds
Why shed be wi that woman as was a friend t her Aunt Judith said Mrs Poyser comforted a little by this suggestion of her husbands
Ive often heard Dinah talk of her but I cant remember what name she called her by
But theres Seth Bede hes like enough to know for shes a preaching woman as the Methodists think a deal on
Ill send to Seth said Mr Poyser
Ill send Alick to tell him to come or else to send up word o the womans name an thee canst write a letter ready to send off to Treddleson as soon as we can make out a direction
Its poor work writing letters when you want folks to come to you i trouble said Mrs Poyser
Happen itll be ever so long on the road an never reach her at last
Before Alick arrived with the message Lisbeths thoughts too had already flown to Dinah and she had said to Seth Eh theres no comfort for us i this world any more wiout thee couldst get Dinah Morris to come to us as she did when my old man died
Id like her to come in an take me by th hand again an talk to me
Shed tell me the rights ont belikeshed happen know some good i all this trouble an heartbreak comin upo that poor lad as neer done a bit o wrong ins life but war better nor anybody elses son pick the country round
Eh my ladAdam my poor lad
Thee wouldstna like me to leave thee to go and fetch Dinah
said Seth as his mother sobbed and rocked herself to and fro
Fetch her
said Lisbeth looking up and pausing from her grief like a crying child who hears some promise of consolation
Why what place ist shes at do they say
Its a good way off motherLeeds a big town
But I could be back in three days if thee couldst spare me
Nay nay I canna spare thee
Thee must go an see thy brother an bring me word what hes adoin
Mester Irwine said hed come an tell me but I canna make out so well what it means when he tells me
Thee must go thysen sin Adam wonna let me go to him
Write a letter to Dinah canstna
Theet fond enough o writin when nobody wants thee
Im not sure where shed be i that big town said Seth
If Id gone myself I could ha found out by asking the members o the Society
But perhaps if I put Sarah Williamson Methodist preacher Leeds o th outside it might get to her for most like shed be wi Sarah Williamson
Alick came now with the message and Seth finding that Mrs Poyser was writing to Dinah gave up the intention of writing himself but he went to the Hall Farm to tell them all he could suggest about the address of the letter and warn them that there might be some delay in the delivery from his not knowing an exact direction
On leaving Lisbeth Mr Irwine had gone to Jonathan Burge who had also a claim to be acquainted with what was likely to keep Adam away from business for some time and before six oclock that evening there were few people in Broxton and Hayslope who had not heard the sad news
Mr Irwine had not mentioned Arthurs name to Burge and yet the story of his conduct towards Hetty with all the dark shadows cast upon it by its terrible consequences was presently as well known as that his grandfather was dead and that he was come into the estate
For Martin Poyser felt no motive to keep silence towards the one or two neighbours who ventured to come and shake him sorrowfully by the hand on the first day of his trouble and Carroll who kept his ears open to all that passed at the rectory had framed an inferential version of the story and found early opportunities of communicating it
One of those neighbours who came to Martin Poyser and shook him by the hand without speaking for some minutes was Bartle Massey
He had shut up his school and was on his way to the rectory where he arrived about halfpast seven in the evening and sending his duty to Mr Irwine begged pardon for troubling him at that hour but had something particular on his mind
He was shown into the study where Mr Irwine soon joined him
Well Bartle
said Mr Irwine putting out his hand
That was not his usual way of saluting the schoolmaster but trouble makes us treat all who feel with us very much alike
Sit down
You know what Im come about as well as I do sir I daresay said Bartle
You wish to know the truth about the sad news that has reached youabout Hetty Sorrel
Nay sir what I wish to know is about Adam Bede
I understand you left him at Stoniton and I beg the favour of you to tell me whats the state of the poor lads mind and what he means to do
For as for that bit o pinkandwhite theyve taken the trouble to put in jail I dont value her a rotten nutnot a rotten nut only for the harm or good that may come out of her to an honest mana lad Ive set such store bytrusted to that hed make my bit o knowledge go a good way in the worldWhy sir hes the only scholar Ive had in this stupid country that ever had the will or the headpiece for mathematics
If he hadnt had so much hard work to do poor fellow he might have gone into the higher branches and then this might never have happenedmight never have happened
Bartle was heated by the exertion of walking fast in an agitated frame of mind and was not able to check himself on this first occasion of venting his feelings
But he paused now to rub his moist forehead and probably his moist eyes also
Youll excuse me sir he said when this pause had given him time to reflect for running on in this way about my own feelings like that foolish dog of mine howling in a storm when theres nobody wants to listen to me
I came to hear you speak not to talk myselfif youll take the trouble to tell me what the poor lads doing
Dont put yourself under any restraint Bartle said Mr Irwine
The fact is Im very much in the same condition as you just now Ive a great deal thats painful on my mind and I find it hard work to be quite silent about my own feelings and only attend to others
I share your concern for Adam though he is not the only one whose sufferings I care for in this affair
He intends to remain at Stoniton till after the trial it will come on probably a week tomorrow
He has taken a room there and I encouraged him to do so because I think it better he should be away from his own home at present and poor fellow he still believes Hetty is innocenthe wants to summon up courage to see her if he can he is unwilling to leave the spot where she is
Do you think the creaturs guilty then
said Bartle
Do you think theyll hang her
Im afraid it will go hard with her
The evidence is very strong
And one bad symptom is that she denies everythingdenies that she has had a child in the face of the most positive evidence
I saw her myself and she was obstinately silent to me she shrank up like a frightened animal when she saw me
I was never so shocked in my life as at the change in her
But I trust that in the worst case we may obtain a pardon for the sake of the innocent who are involved
Stuff and nonsense
said Bartle forgetting in his irritation to whom he was speaking
I beg your pardon sir I mean its stuff and nonsense for the innocent to care about her being hanged
For my own part I think the sooner such women are put out o the world the better and the men that help em to do mischief had better go along with em for that matter
What good will you do by keeping such vermin alive eating the victual that ud feed rational beings
But if Adams fool enough to care about it I dont want him to suffer more thans needfulIs he very much cut up poor fellow
Bartle added taking out his spectacles and putting them on as if they would assist his imagination
Yes Im afraid the grief cuts very deep said Mr Irwine
He looks terribly shattered and a certain violence came over him now and then yesterday which made me wish I could have remained near him
But I shall go to Stoniton again tomorrow and I have confidence enough in the strength of Adams principle to trust that he will be able to endure the worst without being driven to anything rash
Mr Irwine who was involuntarily uttering his own thoughts rather than addressing Bartle Massey in the last sentence had in his mind the possibility that the spirit of vengeance towards Arthur which was the form Adams anguish was continually taking might make him seek an encounter that was likely to end more fatally than the one in the Grove
This possibility heightened the anxiety with which he looked forward to Arthurs arrival
But Bartle thought Mr Irwine was referring to suicide and his face wore a new alarm
Ill tell you what I have in my head sir he said and I hope youll approve of it
Im going to shut up my schoolif the scholars come they must go back again thats alland I shall go to Stoniton and look after Adam till this business is over
Ill pretend Im come to look on at the assizes he cant object to that
What do you think about it sir
Well said Mr Irwine rather hesitatingly there would be some real advantages in thatand I honour you for your friendship towards him Bartle
Butyou must be careful what you say to him you know
Im afraid you have too little fellowfeeling in what you consider his weakness about Hetty
Trust to me sirtrust to me
I know what you mean
Ive been a fool myself in my time but thats between you and me
I shant thrust myself on him only keep my eye on him and see that he gets some good food and put in a word here and there
Then said Mr Irwine reassured a little as to Bartles discretion I think youll be doing a good deed and it will be well for you to let Adams mother and brother know that youre going
Yes sir yes said Bartle rising and taking off his spectacles Ill do that Ill do that though the mothers a whimpering thingI dont like to come within earshot of her however shes a straightbacked clean woman none of your slatterns
I wish you goodbye sir and thank you for the time youve spared me
Youre everybodys friend in this business everybodys friend
Its a heavy weight youve got on your shoulders
Goodbye Bartle till we meet at Stoniton as I daresay we shall
Bartle hurried away from the rectory evading Carrolls conversational advances and saying in an exasperated tone to Vixen whose short legs pattered beside him on the gravel Now I shall be obliged to take you with me you goodfornothing woman
Youd go fretting yourself to death if I left youyou know you would and perhaps get snapped up by some tramp
And youll be running into bad company I expect putting your nose in every hole and corner where youve no business
But if you do anything disgraceful Ill disown youmind that madam mind that
Chapter XLI The Eve of the Trial AN upper room in a dull Stoniton street with two beds in itone laid on the floor
It is ten oclock on Thursday night and the dark wall opposite the window shuts out the moonlight that might have struggled with the light of the one dip candle by which Bartle Massey is pretending to read while he is really looking over his spectacles at Adam Bede seated near the dark window
You would hardly have known it was Adam without being told
His face has got thinner this last week he has the sunken eyes the neglected beard of a man just risen from a sickbed
His heavy black hair hangs over his forehead and there is no active impulse in him which inclines him to push it off that he may be more awake to what is around him
He has one arm over the back of the chair and he seems to be looking down at his clasped hands
He is roused by a knock at the door
There he is said Bartle Massey rising hastily and unfastening the door
It was Mr Irwine
Adam rose from his chair with instinctive respect as Mr Irwine approached him and took his hand
Im late Adam he said sitting down on the chair which Bartle placed for him but I was later in setting off from Broxton than I intended to be and I have been incessantly occupied since I arrived
I have done everything now howevereverything that can be done tonight at least
Let us all sit down
Adam took his chair again mechanically and Bartle for whom there was no chair remaining sat on the bed in the background
Have you seen her sir
said Adam tremulously
Yes Adam I and the chaplain have both been with her this evening
Did you ask her sirdid you say anything about me
Yes said Mr Irwine with some hesitation I spoke of you
I said you wished to see her before the trial if she consented
As Mr Irwine paused Adam looked at him with eager questioning eyes
You know she shrinks from seeing any one Adam
It is not only yousome fatal influence seems to have shut up her heart against her fellowcreatures
She has scarcely said anything more than No either to me or the chaplain
Three or four days ago before you were mentioned to her when I asked her if there was any one of her family whom she would like to seeto whom she could open her mindshe said with a violent shudder Tell them not to come near meI wont see any of them
Adams head was hanging down again and he did not speak
There was silence for a few minutes and then Mr Irwine said I dont like to advise you against your own feelings Adam if they now urge you strongly to go and see her tomorrow morning even without her consent
It is just possible notwithstanding appearances to the contrary that the interview might affect her favourably
But I grieve to say I have scarcely any hope of that
She didnt seem agitated when I mentioned your name she only said No in the same cold obstinate way as usual
And if the meeting had no good effect on her it would be pure useless suffering to yousevere suffering I fear
She is very much changed Adam started up from his chair and seized his hat which lay on the table
But he stood still then and looked at Mr Irwine as if he had a question to ask which it was yet difficult to utter
Bartle Massey rose quietly turned the key in the door and put it in his pocket
Is he come back
said Adam at last
No he is not said Mr Irwine quietly
Lay down your hat Adam unless you like to walk out with me for a little fresh air
I fear you have not been out again today
You neednt deceive me sir said Adam looking hard at Mr Irwine and speaking in a tone of angry suspicion
You neednt be afraid of me
I only want justice
I want him to feel what she feels
Its his workshe was a child as it ud ha gone t anybodys heart to look atI dont care what shes doneit was him brought her to it
And he shall know ithe shall feel itif theres a just God he shall feel what it is t ha brought a child like her to sin and misery
Im not deceiving you Adam said Mr Irwine
Arthur Donnithorne is not come backwas not come back when I left
I have left a letter for him he will know all as soon as he arrives
But you dont mind about it said Adam indignantly
You think it doesnt matter as she lies there in shame and misery and he knows nothing about ithe suffers nothing
Adam he WILL knowhe WILL suffer long and bitterly
He has a heart and a conscience I cant be entirely deceived in his character
I am convincedI am sure he didnt fall under temptation without a struggle
He may be weak but he is not callous not coldly selfish
I am persuaded that this will be a shock of which he will feel the effects all his life
Why do you crave vengeance in this way
No amount of torture that you could inflict on him could benefit her
NoO God no Adam groaned out sinking on his chair again but then thats the deepest curse of allthats what makes the blackness of itIT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE
My poor Hettyshe can never be my sweet Hetty againthe prettiest thing God had made smiling up at meI thought she loved meand was good Adams voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone as if he were only talking to himself but now he said abruptly looking at Mr Irwine But she isnt as guilty as they say
You dont think she is sir
She cant ha done it
That perhaps can never be known with certainty Adam Mr Irwine answered gently
In these cases we sometimes form our judgment on what seems to us strong evidence and yet for want of knowing some small fact our judgment is wrong
But suppose the worst you have no right to say that the guilt of her crime lies with him and that he ought to bear the punishment
It is not for us men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution
We find it impossible to avoid mistakes even in determining who has committed a single criminal act and the problem how far a man is to be held responsible for the unforeseen consequences of his own deed is one that might well make us tremble to look into it
The evil consequences that may lie folded in a single act of selfish indulgence is a thought so awful that it ought surely to awaken some feeling less presumptuous than a rash desire to punish
You have a mind that can understand this fully Adam when you are calm
Dont suppose I cant enter into the anguish that drives you into this state of revengeful hatred
But think of this if you were to obey your passionfor it IS passion and you deceive yourself in calling it justiceit might be with you precisely as it has been with Arthur nay worse your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime
Nonot worse said Adam bitterly I dont believe its worse Id sooner do itId sooner do a wickedness as I could suffer for by myself than ha brought HER to do wickedness and then stand by and see em punish her while they let me alone and all for a bit o pleasure as if hed had a mans heart in him hed ha cut his hand off sooner than hed ha taken it
What if he didnt foresee whats happened
He foresaw enough hed no right to expect anything but harm and shame to her
And then he wanted to smooth it off wi lies
Notheres plenty o things folks are hanged for not half so hateful as that
Let a man do what he will if he knows hes to bear the punishment himself he isnt half so bad as a mean selfish coward as makes things easy t himself and knows all the while the punishment ll fall on somebody else
There again you partly deceive yourself Adam
There is no sort of wrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone you cant isolate yourself and say that the evil which is in you shall not spread
Mens lives are as thoroughly blended with each other as the air they breathe evil spreads as necessarily as disease
I know I feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of Arthurs has caused to others but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it
An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under you could not bear the punishment alone you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you
You would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were and add worse evils to them
You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of vengeance but the feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such actions and as long as you indulge it as long as you do not see that to fix your mind on Arthurs punishment is revenge and not justice you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong
Remember what you told me about your feelings after you had given that blow to Arthur in the Grove
Adam was silent the last words had called up a vivid image of the past and Mr Irwine left him to his thoughts while he spoke to Bartle Massey about old Mr Donnithornes funeral and other matters of an indifferent kind
But at length Adam turned round and said in a more subdued tone Ive not asked about em at th Hall Farm sir
Is Mr Poyser coming
He is come he is in Stoniton tonight
But I could not advise him to see you Adam
His own mind is in a very perturbed state and it is best he should not see you till you are calmer
Is Dinah Morris come to em sir
Seth said theyd sent for her
No
Mr Poyser tells me she was not come when he left
Theyre afraid the letter has not reached her
It seems they had no exact address
Adam sat ruminating a little while and then said I wonder if Dinah ud ha gone to see her
But perhaps the Poysers would ha been sorely against it since they wont come nigh her themselves
But I think she would for the Methodists are great folks for going into the prisons and Seth said he thought she would
Shed a very tender way with her Dinah had I wonder if she could ha done any good
You never saw her sir did you
Yes I did
I had a conversation with hershe pleased me a good deal
And now you mention it I wish she would come for it is possible that a gentle mild woman like her might move Hetty to open her heart
The jail chaplain is rather harsh in his manner
But its o no use if she doesnt come said Adam sadly
If Id thought of it earlier I would have taken some measures for finding her out said Mr Irwine but its too late now I fearWell Adam I must go now
Try to get some rest tonight
God bless you
Ill see you early tomorrow morning
Chapter XLII The Morning of the Trial AT one oclock the next day Adam was alone in his dull upper room his watch lay before him on the table as if he were counting the long minutes
He had no knowledge of what was likely to be said by the witnesses on the trial for he had shrunk from all the particulars connected with Hettys arrest and accusation
This brave active man who would have hastened towards any danger or toil to rescue Hetty from an apprehended wrong or misfortune felt himself powerless to contemplate irremediable evil and suffering
The susceptibility which would have been an impelling force where there was any possibility of action became helpless anguish when he was obliged to be passive or else sought an active outlet in the thought of inflicting justice on Arthur
Energetic natures strong for all strenuous deeds will often rush away from a hopeless sufferer as if they were hardhearted
It is the overmastering sense of pain that drives them
They shrink by an ungovernable instinct as they would shrink from laceration
Adam had brought himself to think of seeing Hetty if she would consent to see him because he thought the meeting might possibly be a good to hermight help to melt away this terrible hardness they told him of
If she saw he bore her no ill will for what she had done to him she might open her heart to him
But this resolution had been an immense efforthe trembled at the thought of seeing her changed face as a timid woman trembles at the thought of the surgeons knife and he chose now to bear the long hours of suspense rather than encounter what seemed to him the more intolerable agony of witnessing her trial
Deep unspeakable suffering may well be called a baptism a regeneration the initiation into a new state
The yearning memories the bitter regret the agonized sympathy the struggling appeals to the Invisible Rightall the intense emotions which had filled the days and nights of the past week and were compressing themselves again like an eager crowd into the hours of this single morning made Adam look back on all the previous years as if they had been a dim sleepy existence and he had only now awaked to full consciousness
It seemed to him as if he had always before thought it a light thing that men should suffer as if all that he had himself endured and called sorrow before was only a moments stroke that had never left a bruise
Doubtless a great anguish may do the work of years and we may come out from that baptism of fire with a soul full of new awe and new pity
O God Adam groaned as he leaned on the table and looked blankly at the face of the watch and men have suffered like this beforeand poor helpless young things have suffered like herSuch a little while ago looking so happy and so prettykissing em all her grandfather and all of em and they wishing her luckO my poor poor Hettydost think on it now
Adam started and looked round towards the door
Vixen had begun to whimper and there was a sound of a stick and a lame walk on the stairs
It was Bartle Massey come back
Could it be all over
Bartle entered quietly and going up to Adam grasped his hand and said Im just come to look at you my boy for the folks are gone out of court for a bit
Adams heart beat so violently he was unable to speakhe could only return the pressure of his friends handand Bartle drawing up the other chair came and sat in front of him taking off his hat and his spectacles
Thats a thing never happened to me before he observed to go out o the door with my spectacles on
I clean forgot to take em off
The old man made this trivial remark thinking it better not to respond at all to Adams agitation he would gather in an indirect way that there was nothing decisive to communicate at present
And now he said rising again I must see to your having a bit of the loaf and some of that wine Mr Irwine sent this morning
Hell be angry with me if you dont have it
Come now he went on bringing forward the bottle and the loaf and pouring some wine into a cup I must have a bit and a sup myself
Drink a drop with me my laddrink with me
Adam pushed the cup gently away and said entreatingly Tell me about it Mr Masseytell me all about it
Was she there
Have they begun
Yes my boy yesits taken all the time since I first went but theyre slow theyre slow and theres the counsel theyve got for her puts a spoke in the wheel whenever he can and makes a deal to do with crossexamining the witnesses and quarrelling with the other lawyers
Thats all he can do for the money they give him and its a big sumits a big sum
But hes a cute fellow with an eye that ud pick the needles out of the hay in no time
If a man had got no feelings it ud be as good as a demonstration to listen to what goes on in court but a tender heart makes one stupid
Id have given up figures for ever only to have had some good news to bring to you my poor lad
But does it seem to be going against her
said Adam
Tell me what theyve said
I must know it nowI must know what they have to bring against her
Why the chief evidence yet has been the doctors all but Martin Poyserpoor Martin
Everybody in court felt for himit was like one sob the sound they made when he came down again
The worst was when they told him to look at the prisoner at the bar
It was hard work poor fellowit was hard work
Adam my boy the blow falls heavily on him as well as you you must help poor Martin you must show courage
Drink some wine now and show me you mean to bear it like a man
Bartle had made the right sort of appeal
Adam with an air of quiet obedience took up the cup and drank a little
Tell me how SHE looked he said presently
Frightened very frightened when they first brought her in it was the first sight of the crowd and the judge poor creatur
And theres a lot o foolish women in fine clothes with gewgaws all up their arms and feathers on their heads sitting near the judge theyve dressed themselves out in that way one ud think to be scarecrows and warnings against any man ever meddling with a woman again
They put up their glasses and stared and whispered
But after that she stood like a white image staring down at her hands and seeming neither to hear nor see anything
And shes as white as a sheet
She didnt speak when they asked her if shed plead guilty or not guilty and they pleaded not guilty for her
But when she heard her uncles name there seemed to go a shiver right through her and when they told him to look at her she hung her head down and cowered and hid her face in her hands
Hed much ado to speak poor man his voice trembled so
And the counsellorswho look as hard as nails mostlyI saw spared him as much as they could
Mr Irwine put himself near him and went with him out o court
Ah its a great thing in a mans life to be able to stand by a neighbour and uphold him in such trouble as that
God bless him and you too Mr Massey said Adam in a low voice laying his hand on Bartles arm
Aye aye hes good metal he gives the right ring when you try him our parson does
A man o sensesays no more thans needful
Hes not one of those that think they can comfort you with chattering as if folks who stand by and look on knew a deal better what the trouble was than those who have to bear it
Ive had to do with such folks in my timein the south when I was in trouble myself
Mr Irwine is to be a witness himself by and by on her side you know to speak to her character and bringing up
But the other evidencedoes it go hard against her
said Adam
What do you think Mr Massey
Tell me the truth
Yes my lad yes
The truth is the best thing to tell
It must come at last
The doctors evidence is heavy on heris heavy
But shes gone on denying shes had a child from first to last
These poor silly womenthingstheyve not the sense to know its no use denying whats proved
Itll make against her with the jury I doubt her being so obstinate they may be less for recommending her to mercy if the verdicts against her
But Mr Irwine ull leave no stone unturned with the judgeyou may rely upon that Adam
Is there nobody to stand by her and seem to care for her in the court
said Adam
Theres the chaplain o the jail sits near her but hes a sharp ferretyfaced mananother sort o flesh and blood to Mr Irwine
They say the jail chaplains are mostly the fagend o the clergy
Theres one man as ought to be there said Adam bitterly
Presently he drew himself up and looked fixedly out of the window apparently turning over some new idea in his mind
Mr Massey he said at last pushing the hair off his forehead Ill go back with you
Ill go into court
Its cowardly of me to keep away
Ill stand by herIll own herfor all shes been deceitful
They oughtnt to cast her offher own flesh and blood
We hand folks over to Gods mercy and show none ourselves
I used to be hard sometimes Ill never be hard again
Ill go Mr MasseyIll go with you
There was a decision in Adams manner which would have prevented Bartle from opposing him even if he had wished to do so
He only said Take a bit then and another sup Adam for the love of me
See I must stop and eat a morsel
Now you take some
Nerved by an active resolution Adam took a morsel of bread and drank some wine
He was haggard and unshaven as he had been yesterday but he stood upright again and looked more like the Adam Bede of former days
Chapter XLIII The Verdict THE place fitted up that day as a court of justice was a grand old hall now destroyed by fire
The midday light that fell on the close pavement of human heads was shed through a line of high pointed windows variegated with the mellow tints of old painted glass
Grim dusty armour hung in high relief in front of the dark oaken gallery at the farther end and under the broad arch of the great mullioned window opposite was spread a curtain of old tapestry covered with dim melancholy figures like a dozing indistinct dream of the past
It was a place that through the rest of the year was haunted with the shadowy memories of old kings and queens unhappy discrowned imprisoned but today all those shadows had fled and not a soul in the vast hall felt the presence of any but a living sorrow which was quivering in warm hearts
But that sorrow seemed to have made it itself feebly felt hitherto now when Adam Bedes tall figure was suddenly seen being ushered to the side of the prisoners dock
In the broad sunlight of the great hall among the sleek shaven faces of other men the marks of suffering in his face were startling even to Mr Irwine who had last seen him in the dim light of his small room and the neighbours from Hayslope who were present and who told Hetty Sorrels story by their firesides in their old age never forgot to say how it moved them when Adam Bede poor fellow taller by the head than most of the people round him came into court and took his place by her side
But Hetty did not see him
She was standing in the same position Bartle Massey had described her hands crossed over each other and her eyes fixed on them
Adam had not dared to look at her in the first moments but at last when the attention of the court was withdrawn by the proceedings he turned his face towards her with a resolution not to shrink
Why did they say she was so changed
In the corpse we love it is the likeness we seeit is the likeness which makes itself felt the more keenly because something else was and is not
There they werethe sweet face and neck with the dark tendrils of hair the long dark lashes the rounded cheek and the pouting lipspale and thin yes but like Hetty and only Hetty
Others thought she looked as if some demon had cast a blighting glance upon her withered up the womans soul in her and left only a hard despairing obstinacy
But the mothers yearning that completest type of the life in another life which is the essence of real human love feels the presence of the cherished child even in the debased degraded man and to Adam this pale hardlooking culprit was the Hetty who had smiled at him in the garden under the appletree boughsshe was that Hettys corpse which he had trembled to look at the first time and then was unwilling to turn away his eyes from
But presently he heard something that compelled him to listen and made the sense of sight less absorbing
A woman was in the witnessbox a middleaged woman who spoke in a firm distinct voice
She said My name is Sarah Stone
I am a widow and keep a small shop licensed to sell tobacco snuff and tea in Church Lane Stoniton
The prisoner at the bar is the same young woman who came looking ill and tired with a basket on her arm and asked for a lodging at my house on Saturday evening the 27th of February
She had taken the house for a public because there was a figure against the door
And when I said I didnt take in lodgers the prisoner began to cry and said she was too tired to go anywhere else and she only wanted a bed for one night
And her prettiness and her condition and something respectable about her clothes and looks and the trouble she seemed to be in made me as I couldnt find in my heart to send her away at once
I asked her to sit down and gave her some tea and asked her where she was going and where her friends were
She said she was going home to her friends they were farming folks a good way off and shed had a long journey that had cost her more money than she expected so as shed hardly any money left in her pocket and was afraid of going where it would cost her much
She had been obliged to sell most of the things out of her basket but shed thankfully give a shilling for a bed
I saw no reason why I shouldnt take the young woman in for the night
I had only one room but there were two beds in it and I told her she might stay with me
I thought shed been led wrong and got into trouble but if she was going to her friends it would be a good work to keep her out of further harm
The witness then stated that in the night a child was born and she identified the babyclothes then shown to her as those in which she had herself dressed the child
Those are the clothes
I made them myself and had kept them by me ever since my last child was born
I took a deal of trouble both for the child and the mother
I couldnt help taking to the little thing and being anxious about it
I didnt send for a doctor for there seemed no need
I told the mother in the day time she must tell me the name of her friends and where they lived and let me write to them
She said by and by she would write herself but not today
She would have no nay but she would get up and be dressed in spite of everything I could say
She said she felt quite strong enough and it was wonderful what spirit she showed
But I wasnt quite easy what I should do about her and towards evening I made up my mind Id go after Meeting was over and speak to our minister about it
I left the house about halfpast eight oclock
I didnt go out at the shop door but at the back door which opens into a narrow alley
Ive only got the groundfloor of the house and the kitchen and bedroom both look into the alley
I left the prisoner sitting up by the fire in the kitchen with the baby on her lap
She hadnt cried or seemed low at all as she did the night before
I thought she had a strange look with her eyes and she got a bit flushed towards evening
I was afraid of the fever and I thought Id call and ask an acquaintance of mine an experienced woman to come back with me when I went out
It was a very dark night
I didnt fasten the door behind me there was no lock it was a latch with a bolt inside and when there was nobody in the house I always went out at the shop door
But I thought there was no danger in leaving it unfastened that little while
I was longer than I meant to be for I had to wait for the woman that came back with me
It was an hour and a half before we got back and when we went in the candle was standing burning just as I left it but the prisoner and the baby were both gone
Shed taken her cloak and bonnet but shed left the basket and the things in itI was dreadful frightened and angry with her for going
I didnt go to give information because Id no thought she meant to do any harm and I knew she had money in her pocket to buy her food and lodging
I didnt like to set the constable after her for shed a right to go from me if she liked
The effect of this evidence on Adam was electrical it gave him new force
Hetty could not be guilty of the crimeher heart must have clung to her babyelse why should she have taken it with her
She might have left it behind
The little creature had died naturally and then she had hidden it
Babies were so liable to deathand there might be the strongest suspicions without any proof of guilt
His mind was so occupied with imaginary arguments against such suspicions that he could not listen to the cross examination by Hettys counsel who tried without result to elicit evidence that the prisoner had shown some movements of maternal affection towards the child
The whole time this witness was being examined Hetty had stood as motionless as before no word seemed to arrest her ear
But the sound of the next witnesss voice touched a chord that was still sensitive she gave a start and a frightened look towards him but immediately turned away her head and looked down at her hands as before
This witness was a man a rough peasant
He said My name is John Olding
I am a labourer and live at Tedds Hole two miles out of Stoniton
A week last Monday towards one oclock in the afternoon I was going towards Hetton Coppice and about a quarter of a mile from the coppice I saw the prisoner in a red cloak sitting under a bit of a haystack not far off the stile
She got up when she saw me and seemed as if shed be walking on the other way
It was a regular road through the fields and nothing very uncommon to see a young woman there but I took notice of her because she looked white and scared
I should have thought she was a beggarwoman only for her good clothes
I thought she looked a bit crazy but it was no business of mine
I stood and looked back after her but she went right on while she was in sight
I had to go to the other side of the coppice to look after some stakes
Theres a road right through it and bits of openings here and there where the trees have been cut down and some of em not carried away
I didnt go straight along the road but turned off towards the middle and took a shorter way towards the spot I wanted to get to
I hadnt got far out of the road into one of the open places before I heard a strange cry
I thought it didnt come from any animal I knew but I wasnt for stopping to look about just then
But it went on and seemed so strange to me in that place I couldnt help stopping to look
I began to think I might make some money of it if it was a new thing
But I had hard work to tell which way it came from and for a good while I kept looking up at the boughs
And then I thought it came from the ground and there was a lot of timberchoppings lying about and loose pieces of turf and a trunk or two
And I looked about among them but could find nothing and at last the cry stopped
So I was for giving it up and I went on about my business
But when I came back the same way pretty nigh an hour after I couldnt help laying down my stakes to have another look
And just as I was stooping and laying down the stakes I saw something odd and round and whitish lying on the ground under a nutbush by the side of me
And I stooped down on hands and knees to pick it up
And I saw it was a little babys hand
At these words a thrill ran through the court
Hetty was visibly trembling now for the first time she seemed to be listening to what a witness said
There was a lot of timberchoppings put together just where the ground went hollow like under the bush and the hand came out from among them
But there was a hole left in one place and I could see down it and see the childs head and I made haste and did away the turf and the choppings and took out the child
It had got comfortable clothes on but its body was cold and I thought it must be dead
I made haste back with it out of the wood and took it home to my wife
She said it was dead and Id better take it to the parish and tell the constable
And I said Ill lay my life its that young womans child as I met going to the coppice
But she seemed to be gone clean out of sight
And I took the child on to Hetton parish and told the constable and we went on to Justice Hardy
And then we went looking after the young woman till dark at night and we went and gave information at Stoniton as they might stop her
And the next morning another constable came to me to go with him to the spot where I found the child
And when we got there there was the prisoner a sitting against the bush where I found the child and she cried out when she saw us but she never offered to move
Shed got a big piece of bread on her lap
Adam had given a faint groan of despair while this witness was speaking
He had hidden his face on his arm which rested on the boarding in front of him
It was the supreme moment of his suffering Hetty was guilty and he was silently calling to God for help
He heard no more of the evidence and was unconscious when the case for the prosecution had closedunconscious that Mr Irwine was in the witnessbox telling of Hettys unblemished character in her own parish and of the virtuous habits in which she had been brought up
This testimony could have no influence on the verdict but it was given as part of that plea for mercy which her own counsel would have made if he had been allowed to speak for hera favour not granted to criminals in those stern times
At last Adam lifted up his head for there was a general movement round him
The judge had addressed the jury and they were retiring
The decisive moment was not far off Adam felt a shuddering horror that would not let him look at Hetty but she had long relapsed into her blank hard indifference
All eyes were strained to look at her but she stood like a statue of dull despair
There was a mingled rustling whispering and low buzzing throughout the court during this interval
The desire to listen was suspended and every one had some feeling or opinion to express in undertones
Adam sat looking blankly before him but he did not see the objects that were right in front of his eyes the counsel and attorneys talking with an air of cool business and Mr Irwine in low earnest conversation with the judgedid not see Mr Irwine sit down again in agitation and shake his head mournfully when somebody whispered to him
The inward action was too intense for Adam to take in outward objects until some strong sensation roused him
It was not very long hardly more than a quarter of an hour before the knock which told that the jury had come to their decision fell as a signal for silence on every ear
It is sublimethat sudden pause of a great multitude which tells that one soul moves in them all
Deeper and deeper the silence seemed to become like the deepening night while the jurymens names were called over and the prisoner was made to hold up her hand and the jury were asked for their verdict
Guilty
It was the verdict every one expected but there was a sigh of disappointment from some hearts that it was followed by no recommendation to mercy
Still the sympathy of the court was not with the prisoner
The unnaturalness of her crime stood out the more harshly by the side of her hard immovability and obstinate silence
Even the verdict to distant eyes had not appeared to move her but those who were near saw her trembling
The stillness was less intense until the judge put on his black cap and the chaplain in his canonicals was observed behind him
Then it deepened again before the crier had had time to command silence
If any sound were heard it must have been the sound of beating hearts
The judge spoke Hester Sorrel The blood rushed to Hettys face and then fled back again as she looked up at the judge and kept her wideopen eyes fixed on him as if fascinated by fear
Adam had not yet turned towards her there was a deep horror like a great gulf between them
But at the words and then to be hanged by the neck till you be dead a piercing shriek rang through the hall
It was Hettys shriek
Adam started to his feet and stretched out his arms towards her
But the arms could not reach her she had fallen down in a faintingfit and was carried out of court
Chapter XLIV Arthurs Return When Arthur Donnithorne landed at Liverpool and read the letter from his Aunt Lydia briefly announcing his grandfathers death his first feeling was Poor Grandfather
I wish I could have got to him to be with him when he died
He might have felt or wished something at the last that I shall never know now
It was a lonely death
It is impossible to say that his grief was deeper than that
Pity and softened memory took place of the old antagonism and in his busy thoughts about the future as the chaise carried him rapidly along towards the home where he was now to be master there was a continually recurring effort to remember anything by which he could show a regard for his grandfathers wishes without counteracting his own cherished aims for the good of the tenants and the estate
But it is not in human natureonly in human pretencefor a young man like Arthur with a fine constitution and fine spirits thinking well of himself believing that others think well of him and having a very ardent intention to give them more and more reason for that good opinionit is not possible for such a young man just coming into a splendid estate through the death of a very old man whom he was not fond of to feel anything very different from exultant joy
Now his real life was beginning now he would have room and opportunity for action and he would use them
He would show the Loamshire people what a fine country gentleman was he would not exchange that career for any other under the sun
He felt himself riding over the hills in the breezy autumn days looking after favourite plans of drainage and enclosure then admired on sombre mornings as the best rider on the best horse in the hunt spoken well of on marketdays as a firstrate landlord by and by making speeches at election dinners and showing a wonderful knowledge of agriculture the patron of new ploughs and drills the severe upbraider of negligent landowners and withal a jolly fellow that everybody must likehappy faces greeting him everywhere on his own estate and the neighbouring families on the best terms with him
The Irwines should dine with him every week and have their own carriage to come in for in some very delicate way that Arthur would devise the layimpropriator of the Hayslope tithes would insist on paying a couple of hundreds more to the vicar and his aunt should be as comfortable as possible and go on living at the Chase if she liked in spite of her oldmaidish waysat least until he was married and that event lay in the indistinct background for Arthur had not yet seen the woman who would play the ladywife to the firstrate country gentleman
These were Arthurs chief thoughts so far as a mans thoughts through hours of travelling can be compressed into a few sentences which are only like the list of names telling you what are the scenes in a long long panorama full of colour of detail and of life
The happy faces Arthur saw greeting him were not pale abstractions but real ruddy faces long familiar to him Martin Poyser was therethe whole Poyser family
WhatHetty
Yes for Arthur was at ease about Hettynot quite at ease about the past for a certain burning of the ears would come whenever he thought of the scenes with Adam last August but at ease about her present lot
Mr Irwine who had been a regular correspondent telling him all the news about the old places and people had sent him word nearly three months ago that Adam Bede was not to marry Mary Burge as he had thought but pretty Hetty Sorrel
Martin Poyser and Adam himself had both told Mr Irwine all about it that Adam had been deeply in love with Hetty these two years and that now it was agreed they were to be married in March
That stalwart rogue Adam was more susceptible than the rector had thought it was really quite an idyllic love affair and if it had not been too long to tell in a letter he would have liked to describe to Arthur the blushing looks and the simple strong words with which the fine honest fellow told his secret
He knew Arthur would like to hear that Adam had this sort of happiness in prospect
Yes indeed
Arthur felt there was not air enough in the room to satisfy his renovated life when he had read that passage in the letter
He threw up the windows he rushed out of doors into the December air and greeted every one who spoke to him with an eager gaiety as if there had been news of a fresh Nelson victory
For the first time that day since he had come to Windsor he was in true boyish spirits
The load that had been pressing upon him was gone the haunting fear had vanished
He thought he could conquer his bitterness towards Adam nowcould offer him his hand and ask to be his friend again in spite of that painful memory which would still make his ears burn
He had been knocked down and he had been forced to tell a lie such things make a scar do what we will
But if Adam were the same again as in the old days Arthur wished to be the same too and to have Adam mixed up with his business and his future as he had always desired before the accursed meeting in August
Nay he would do a great deal more for Adam than he should otherwise have done when he came into the estate Hettys husband had a special claim on himHetty herself should feel that any pain she had suffered through Arthur in the past was compensated to her a hundredfold
For really she could not have felt much since she had so soon made up her mind to marry Adam
You perceive clearly what sort of picture Adam and Hetty made in the panorama of Arthurs thoughts on his journey homeward
It was March now they were soon to be married perhaps they were already married
And now it was actually in his power to do a great deal for them
Sweetsweet little Hetty
The little puss hadnt cared for him half as much as he cared for her for he was a great fool about her stillwas almost afraid of seeing herindeed had not cared much to look at any other woman since he parted from her
That little figure coming towards him in the Grove those darkfringed childish eyes the lovely lips put up to kiss him that picture had got no fainter with the lapse of months
And she would look just the same
It was impossible to think how he could meet her he should certainly tremble
Strange how long this sort of influence lasts for he was certainly not in love with Hetty now
He had been earnestly desiring for months that she should marry Adam and there was nothing that contributed more to his happiness in these moments than the thought of their marriage
It was the exaggerating effect of imagination that made his heart still beat a little more quickly at the thought of her
When he saw the little thing again as she really was as Adams wife at work quite prosaically in her new home he should perhaps wonder at the possibility of his past feelings
Thank heaven it had turned out so well
He should have plenty of affairs and interests to fill his life now and not be in danger of playing the fool again
Pleasant the crack of the postboys whip
Pleasant the sense of being hurried along in swift ease through English scenes so like those round his own home only not quite so charming
Here was a markettownvery much like Treddlestonwhere the arms of the neighbouring lord of the manor were borne on the sign of the principal inn then mere fields and hedges their vicinity to a markettown carrying an agreeable suggestion of high rent till the land began to assume a trimmer look the woods were more frequent and at length a white or red mansion looked down from a moderate eminence or allowed him to be aware of its parapet and chimneys among the denselooking masses of oaks and elmsmasses reddened now with early buds
And close at hand came the village the small church with its redtiled roof looking humble even among the faded halftimbered houses the old green gravestones with nettles round them nothing fresh and bright but the children opening round eyes at the swift postchaise nothing noisy and busy but the gaping curs of mysterious pedigree
What a much prettier village Hayslope was
And it should not be neglected like this place vigorous repairs should go on everywhere among farmbuildings and cottages and travellers in postchaises coming along the Rosseter road should do nothing but admire as they went
And Adam Bede should superintend all the repairs for he had a share in Burges business now and if he liked Arthur would put some money into the concern and buy the old man out in another year or two
That was an ugly fault in Arthurs life that affair last summer but the future should make amends
Many men would have retained a feeling of vindictiveness towards Adam but he would nothe would resolutely overcome all littleness of that kind for he had certainly been very much in the wrong and though Adam had been harsh and violent and had thrust on him a painful dilemma the poor fellow was in love and had real provocation
No Arthur had not an evil feeling in his mind towards any human being he was happy and would make every one else happy that came within his reach
And here was dear old Hayslope at last sleeping on the hill like a quiet old place as it was in the late afternoon sunlight and opposite to it the great shoulders of the Binton Hills below them the purplish blackness of the hanging woods and at last the pale front of the Abbey looking out from among the oaks of the Chase as if anxious for the heirs return
Poor Grandfather
And he lies dead there
He was a young fellow once coming into the estate and making his plans
So the world goes round
Aunt Lydia must feel very desolate poor thing but she shall be indulged as much as she indulges her fat Fido
The wheels of Arthurs chaise had been anxiously listened for at the Chase for today was Friday and the funeral had already been deferred two days
Before it drew up on the gravel of the courtyard all the servants in the house were assembled to receive him with a grave decent welcome befitting a house of death
A month ago perhaps it would have been difficult for them to have maintained a suitable sadness in their faces when Mr Arthur was come to take possession but the hearts of the headservants were heavy that day for another cause than the death of the old squire and more than one of them was longing to be twenty miles away as Mr Craig was knowing what was to become of Hetty Sorrelpretty Hetty Sorrelwhom they used to see every week
They had the partisanship of household servants who like their places and were not inclined to go the full length of the severe indignation felt against him by the farming tenants but rather to make excuses for him nevertheless the upper servants who had been on terms of neighbourly intercourse with the Poysers for many years could not help feeling that the longedfor event of the young squires coming into the estate had been robbed of all its pleasantness
To Arthur it was nothing surprising that the servants looked grave and sad he himself was very much touched on seeing them all again and feeling that he was in a new relation to them
It was that sort of pathetic emotion which has more pleasure than pain in itwhich is perhaps one of the most delicious of all states to a goodnatured man conscious of the power to satisfy his good nature
His heart swelled agreeably as he said Well Mills how is my aunt
But now Mr Bygate the lawyer who had been in the house ever since the death came forward to give deferential greetings and answer all questions and Arthur walked with him towards the library where his Aunt Lydia was expecting him
Aunt Lydia was the only person in the house who knew nothing about Hetty
Her sorrow as a maiden daughter was unmixed with any other thoughts than those of anxiety about funeral arrangements and her own future lot and after the manner of women she mourned for the father who had made her life important all the more because she had a secret sense that there was little mourning for him in other hearts
But Arthur kissed her tearful face more tenderly than he had ever done in his life before
Dear Aunt he said affectionately as he held her hand YOUR loss is the greatest of all but you must tell me how to try and make it up to you all the rest of your life
It was so sudden and so dreadful Arthur poor Miss Lydia began pouring out her little plaints and Arthur sat down to listen with impatient patience
When a pause came he said Now Aunt Ill leave you for a quarter of an hour just to go to my own room and then I shall come and give full attention to everything
My room is all ready for me I suppose Mills
he said to the butler who seemed to be lingering uneasily about the entrance hall
Yes sir and there are letters for you they are all laid on the writingtable in your dressingroom
On entering the small anteroom which was called a dressingroom but which Arthur really used only to lounge and write in he just cast his eyes on the writingtable and saw that there were several letters and packets lying there but he was in the uncomfortable dusty condition of a man who has had a long hurried journey and he must really refresh himself by attending to his toilette a little before he read his letters
Pym was there making everything ready for him and soon with a delightful freshness about him as if he were prepared to begin a new day he went back into his dressingroom to open his letters
The level rays of the low afternoon sun entered directly at the window and as Arthur seated himself in his velvet chair with their pleasant warmth upon him he was conscious of that quiet wellbeing which perhaps you and I have felt on a sunny afternoon when in our brightest youth and health life has opened a new vista for us and long tomorrows of activity have stretched before us like a lovely plain which there was no need for hurrying to look at because it was all our own
The top letter was placed with its address upwards it was in Mr Irwines handwriting Arthur saw at once and below the address was written To be delivered as soon as he arrives
Nothing could have been less surprising to him than a letter from Mr Irwine at that moment of course there was something he wished Arthur to know earlier than it was possible for them to see each other
At such a time as that it was quite natural that Irwine should have something pressing to say
Arthur broke the seal with an agreeable anticipation of soon seeing the writer
I send this letter to meet you on your arrival Arthur because I may then be at Stoniton whither I am called by the most painful duty it has ever been given me to perform and it is right that you should know what I have to tell you without delay
I will not attempt to add by one word of reproach to the retribution that is now falling on you any other words that I could write at this moment must be weak and unmeaning by the side of those in which I must tell you the simple fact
Hetty Sorrel is in prison and will be tried on Friday for the crime of childmurder
Arthur read no more
He started up from his chair and stood for a single minute with a sense of violent convulsion in his whole frame as if the life were going out of him with horrible throbs but the next minute he had rushed out of the room still clutching the letterhe was hurrying along the corridor and down the stairs into the hall
Mills was still there but Arthur did not see him as he passed like a hunted man across the hall and out along the gravel
The butler hurried out after him as fast as his elderly limbs could run he guessed he knew where the young squire was going
When Mills got to the stables a horse was being saddled and Arthur was forcing himself to read the remaining words of the letter
He thrust it into his pocket as the horse was led up to him and at that moment caught sight of Mills anxious face in front of him
Tell them Im gonegone to Stoniton he said in a muffled tone of agitationsprang into the saddle and set off at a gallop
Chapter XLV In the Prison NEAR sunset that evening an elderly gentleman was standing with his back against the smaller entrancedoor of Stoniton jail saying a few last words to the departing chaplain
The chaplain walked away but the elderly gentleman stood still looking down on the pavement and stroking his chin with a ruminating air when he was roused by a sweet clear womans voice saying Can I get into the prison if you please
He turned his head and looked fixedly at the speaker for a few moments without answering
I have seen you before he said at last
Do you remember preaching on the village green at Hayslope in Loamshire
Yes sir surely
Are you the gentleman that stayed to listen on horseback
Yes
Why do you want to go into the prison
I want to go to Hetty Sorrel the young woman who has been condemned to deathand to stay with her if I may be permitted
Have you power in the prison sir
Yes I am a magistrate and can get admittance for you
But did you know this criminal Hetty Sorrel
Yes we are kin
My own aunt married her uncle Martin Poyser
But I was away at Leeds and didnt know of this great trouble in time to get here before today
I entreat you sir for the love of our heavenly Father to let me go to her and stay with her
How did you know she was condemned to death if you are only just come from Leeds
I have seen my uncle since the trial sir
He is gone back to his home now and the poor sinner is forsaken of all
I beseech you to get leave for me to be with her
What
Have you courage to stay all night in the prison
She is very sullen and will scarcely make answer when she is spoken to
Oh sir it may please God to open her heart still
Dont let us delay
Come then said the elderly gentleman ringing and gaining admission I know you have a key to unlock hearts
Dinah mechanically took off her bonnet and shawl as soon as they were within the prison court from the habit she had of throwing them off when she preached or prayed or visited the sick and when they entered the jailers room she laid them down on a chair unthinkingly
There was no agitation visible in her but a deep concentrated calmness as if even when she was speaking her soul was in prayer reposing on an unseen support
After speaking to the jailer the magistrate turned to her and said The turnkey will take you to the prisoners cell and leave you there for the night if you desire it but you cant have a light during the nightit is contrary to rules
My name is Colonel Townley if I can help you in anything ask the jailer for my address and come to me
I take some interest in this Hetty Sorrel for the sake of that fine fellow Adam Bede
I happened to see him at Hayslope the same evening I heard you preach and recognized him in court today ill as he looked
Ah sir can you tell me anything about him
Can you tell me where he lodges
For my poor uncle was too much weighed down with trouble to remember
Close by here
I inquired all about him of Mr Irwine
He lodges over a tinmans shop in the street on the right hand as you entered the prison
There is an old schoolmaster with him
Now goodbye I wish you success
Farewell sir
I am grateful to you
As Dinah crossed the prison court with the turnkey the solemn evening light seemed to make the walls higher than they were by day and the sweet pale face in the cap was more than ever like a white flower on this background of gloom
The turnkey looked askance at her all the while but never spoke
He somehow felt that the sound of his own rude voice would be grating just then
He struck a light as they entered the dark corridor leading to the condemned cell and then said in his most civil tone Itll be pretty nigh dark in the cell aready but I can stop with my light a bit if you like
Nay friend thank you said Dinah
I wish to go in alone
As you like said the jailer turning the harsh key in the lock and opening the door wide enough to admit Dinah
A jet of light from his lantern fell on the opposite corner of the cell where Hetty was sitting on her straw pallet with her face buried in her knees
It seemed as if she were asleep and yet the grating of the lock would have been likely to waken her
The door closed again and the only light in the cell was that of the evening sky through the small high gratingenough to discern human faces by
Dinah stood still for a minute hesitating to speak because Hetty might be asleep and looking at the motionless heap with a yearning heart
Then she said softly Hetty
There was a slight movement perceptible in Hettys framea start such as might have been produced by a feeble electrical shockbut she did not look up
Dinah spoke again in a tone made stronger by irrepressible emotion Hettyits Dinah
Again there was a slight startled movement through Hettys frame and without uncovering her face she raised her head a little as if listening
HettyDinah is come to you
After a moments pause Hetty lifted her head slowly and timidly from her knees and raised her eyes
The two pale faces were looking at each other one with a wild hard despair in it the other full of sad yearning love
Dinah unconsciously opened her arms and stretched them out
Dont you know me Hetty
Dont you remember Dinah
Did you think I wouldnt come to you in trouble
Hetty kept her eyes fixed on Dinahs faceat first like an animal that gazes and gazes and keeps aloof
Im come to be with you Hettynot to leave youto stay with youto be your sister to the last
Slowly while Dinah was speaking Hetty rose took a step forward and was clasped in Dinahs arms
They stood so a long while for neither of them felt the impulse to move apart again
Hetty without any distinct thought of it hung on this something that was come to clasp her now while she was sinking helpless in a dark gulf and Dinah felt a deep joy in the first sign that her love was welcomed by the wretched lost one
The light got fainter as they stood and when at last they sat down on the straw pallet together their faces had become indistinct
Not a word was spoken
Dinah waited hoping for a spontaneous word from Hetty but she sat in the same dull despair only clutching the hand that held hers and leaning her cheek against Dinahs
It was the human contact she clung to but she was not the less sinking into the dark gulf
Dinah began to doubt whether Hetty was conscious who it was that sat beside her
She thought suffering and fear might have driven the poor sinner out of her mind
But it was borne in upon her as she afterwards said that she must not hurry Gods work we are overhasty to speakas if God did not manifest himself by our silent feeling and make his love felt through ours
She did not know how long they sat in that way but it got darker and darker till there was only a pale patch of light on the opposite wall all the rest was darkness
But she felt the Divine presence more and morenay as if she herself were a part of it and it was the Divine pity that was beating in her heart and was willing the rescue of this helpless one
At last she was prompted to speak and find out how far Hetty was conscious of the present
Hetty she said gently do you know who it is that sits by your side
Yes Hetty answered slowly its Dinah
And do you remember the time when we were at the Hall Farm together and that night when I told you to be sure and think of me as a friend in trouble
Yes said Hetty
Then after a pause she added But you can do nothing for me
You cant make em do anything
Theyll hang me o Mondayits Friday now
As Hetty said the last words she clung closer to Dinah shuddering
No Hetty I cant save you from that death
But isnt the suffering less hard when you have somebody with you that feels for youthat you can speak to and say whats in your heartYes Hetty you lean on me you are glad to have me with you
You wont leave me Dinah
Youll keep close to me
No Hetty I wont leave you
Ill stay with you to the lastBut Hetty there is some one else in this cell besides me some one close to you
Hetty said in a frightened whisper Who
Some one who has been with you through all your hours of sin and troublewho has known every thought you have hadhas seen where you went where you lay down and rose up again and all the deeds you have tried to hide in darkness
And on Monday when I cant follow youwhen my arms cant reach youwhen death has parted usHe who is with us now and knows all will be with you then
It makes no differencewhether we live or die we are in the presence of God
Oh Dinah wont nobody do anything for me
Will they hang me for certainI wouldnt mind if theyd let me live
My poor Hetty death is very dreadful to you
I know its dreadful
But if you had a friend to take care of you after deathin that other worldsome one whose love is greater than minewho can do everythingIf God our Father was your friend and was willing to save you from sin and suffering so as you should neither know wicked feelings nor pain again
If you could believe he loved you and would help you as you believe I love you and will help you it wouldnt be so hard to die on Monday would it
But I cant know anything about it Hetty said with sullen sadness
Because Hetty you are shutting up your soul against him by trying to hide the truth
Gods love and mercy can overcome all thingsour ignorance and weakness and all the burden of our past wickednessall things but our wilful sin sin that we cling to and will not give up
You believe in my love and pity for you Hetty but if you had not let me come near you if you wouldnt have looked at me or spoken to me youd have shut me out from helping you
I couldnt have made you feel my love I couldnt have told you what I felt for you
Dont shut Gods love out in that way by clinging to sinHe cant bless you while you have one falsehood in your soul his pardoning mercy cant reach you until you open your heart to him and say I have done this great wickedness O God save me make me pure from sin
While you cling to one sin and will not part with it it must drag you down to misery after death as it has dragged you to misery here in this world my poor poor Hetty
It is sin that brings dread and darkness and despair there is light and blessedness for us as soon as we cast it off
God enters our souls then and teaches us and brings us strength and peace
Cast it off now Hettynow confess the wickedness you have donethe sin you have been guilty of against your Heavenly Father
Let us kneel down together for we are in the presence of God
Hetty obeyed Dinahs movement and sank on her knees
They still held each others hands and there was long silence
Then Dinah said Hetty we are before God
He is waiting for you to tell the truth
Still there was silence
At last Hetty spoke in a tone of beseeching Dinahhelp meI cant feel anything like youmy heart is hard
Dinah held the clinging hand and all her soul went forth in her voice Jesus thou present Saviour
Thou hast known the depths of all sorrow thou hast entered that black darkness where God is not and hast uttered the cry of the forsaken
Come Lord and gather of the fruits of thy travail and thy pleading
Stretch forth thy hand thou who art mighty to save to the uttermost and rescue this lost one
She is clothed round with thick darkness
The fetters of her sin are upon her and she cannot stir to come to thee
She can only feel her heart is hard and she is helpless
She cries to me thy weak creatureSaviour
It is a blind cry to thee
Hear it
Pierce the darkness
Look upon her with thy face of love and sorrow that thou didst turn on him who denied thee and melt her hard heart
See Lord I bring her as they of old brought the sick and helpless and thou didst heal them
I bear her on my arms and carry her before thee
Fear and trembling have taken hold on her but she trembles only at the pain and death of the body
Breathe upon her thy lifegiving Spirit and put a new fear within her the fear of her sin
Make her dread to keep the accursed thing within her soul
Make her feel the presence of the living God who beholds all the past to whom the darkness is as noonday who is waiting now at the eleventh hour for her to turn to him and confess her sin and cry for mercynow before the night of death comes and the moment of pardon is for ever fled like yesterday that returneth not
Saviour
It is yet timetime to snatch this poor soul from everlasting darkness
I believeI believe in thy infinite love
What is my love or my pleading
It is quenched in thine
I can only clasp her in my weak arms and urge her with my weak pity
Thouthou wilt breathe on the dead soul and it shall arise from the unanswering sleep of death
Yea Lord I see thee coming through the darkness coming like the morning with healing on thy wings
The marks of thy agony are upon theeI see I see thou art able and willing to save thou wilt not let her perish for ever
Come mighty Saviour
Let the dead hear thy voice
Let the eyes of the blind be opened
Let her see that God encompasses her
Let her tremble at nothing but at the sin that cuts her off from him
Melt the hard heart
Unseal the closed lips make her cry with her whole soul Father I have sinned
Dinah Hetty sobbed out throwing her arms round Dinahs neck I will speakI will tellI wont hide it any more
But the tears and sobs were too violent
Dinah raised her gently from her knees and seated her on the pallet again sitting down by her side
It was a long time before the convulsed throat was quiet and even then they sat some time in stillness and darkness holding each others hands
At last Hetty whispered I did do it DinahI buried it in the woodthe little babyand it criedI heard it cryever such a way offall nightand I went back because it cried
She paused and then spoke hurriedly in a louder pleading tone
But I thought perhaps it wouldnt diethere might somebody find it
I didnt kill itI didnt kill it myself
I put it down there and covered it up and when I came back it was goneIt was because I was so very miserable DinahI didnt know where to goand I tried to kill myself before and I couldnt
Oh I tried so to drown myself in the pool and I couldnt
I went to WindsorI ran awaydid you know
I went to find him as he might take care of me and he was gone and then I didnt know what to do
I darednt go back home againI couldnt bear it
I couldnt have bore to look at anybody for theyd have scorned me
I thought o you sometimes and thought Id come to you for I didnt think youd be cross with me and cry shame on me
I thought I could tell you
But then the other folks ud come to know it at last and I couldnt bear that
It was partly thinking o you made me come toward Stoniton and besides I was so frightened at going wandering about till I was a beggarwoman and had nothing and sometimes it seemed as if I must go back to the farm sooner than that
Oh it was so dreadful DinahI was so miserableI wished Id never been born into this world
I should never like to go into the green fields againI hated em so in my misery
Hetty paused again as if the sense of the past were too strong upon her for words
And then I got to Stoniton and I began to feel frightened that night because I was so near home
And then the little baby was born when I didnt expect it and the thought came into my mind that I might get rid of it and go home again
The thought came all of a sudden as I was lying in the bed and it got stronger and strongerI longed so to go back againI couldnt bear being so lonely and coming to beg for want
And it gave me strength and resolution to get up and dress myself
I felt I must do itI didnt know howI thought Id find a pool if I could like that other in the corner of the field in the dark
And when the woman went out I felt as if I was strong enough to do anythingI thought I should get rid of all my misery and go back home and never let em know why I ran away I put on my bonnet and shawl and went out into the dark street with the baby under my cloak and I walked fast till I got into a street a good way off and there was a public and I got some warm stuff to drink and some bread
And I walked on and on and I hardly felt the ground I trod on and it got lighter for there came the moon oh Dinah it frightened me when it first looked at me out o the cloudsit never looked so before and I turned out of the road into the fields for I was afraid o meeting anybody with the moon shining on me
And I came to a haystack where I thought I could lie down and keep myself warm all night
There was a place cut into it where I could make me a bed and I lay comfortable and the baby was warm against me and I must have gone to sleep for a good while for when I woke it was morning but not very light and the baby was crying
And I saw a wood a little way offI thought thered perhaps be a ditch or a pond thereand it was so early I thought I could hide the child there and get a long way off before folks was up
And then I thought Id go homeId get rides in carts and go home and tell em Id been to try and see for a place and couldnt get one
I longed so for it Dinah I longed so to be safe at home
I dont know how I felt about the baby
I seemed to hate itit was like a heavy weight hanging round my neck and yet its crying went through me and I darednt look at its little hands and face
But I went on to the wood and I walked about but there was no water Hetty shuddered
She was silent for some moments and when she began again it was in a whisper
I came to a place where there was lots of chips and turf and I sat down on the trunk of a tree to think what I should do
And all of a sudden I saw a hole under the nuttree like a little grave
And it darted into me like lightningId lay the baby there and cover it with the grass and the chips
I couldnt kill it any other way
And Id done it in a minute and oh it cried so DinahI couldnt cover it quite upI thought perhaps somebody ud come and take care of it and then it wouldnt die
And I made haste out of the wood but I could hear it crying all the while and when I got out into the fields it was as if I was held fastI couldnt go away for all I wanted so to go
And I sat against the haystack to watch if anybody ud come
I was very hungry and Id only a bit of bread left but I couldnt go away
And after ever such a whilehours and hoursthe man camehim in a smockfrock and he looked at me so I was frightened and I made haste and went on
I thought he was going to the wood and would perhaps find the baby
And I went right on till I came to a village a long way off from the wood and I was very sick and faint and hungry
I got something to eat there and bought a loaf
But I was frightened to stay
I heard the baby crying and thought the other folks heard it tooand I went on
But I was so tired and it was getting towards dark
And at last by the roadside there was a barnever such a way off any houselike the barn in Abbots Close and I thought I could go in there and hide myself among the hay and straw and nobody ud be likely to come
I went in and it was half full o trusses of straw and there was some hay too
And I made myself a bed ever so far behind where nobody could find me and I was so tired and weak I went to sleepBut oh the babys crying kept waking me and I thought that man as looked at me so was come and laying hold of me
But I must have slept a long while at last though I didnt know for when I got up and went out of the barn I didnt know whether it was night or morning
But it was morning for it kept getting lighter and I turned back the way Id come
I couldnt help it Dinah it was the babys crying made me goand yet I was frightened to death
I thought that man in the smockfrock ud see me and know I put the baby there
But I went on for all that
Id left off thinking about going homeit had gone out o my mind
I saw nothing but that place in the wood where Id buried the babyI see it now
Oh Dinah
shall I allays see it
Hetty clung round Dinah and shuddered again
The silence seemed long before she went on
I met nobody for it was very early and I got into the woodI knew the way to the placethe place against the nuttree and I could hear it crying at every stepI thought it was aliveI dont know whether I was frightened or gladI dont know what I felt
I only know I was in the wood and heard the cry
I dont know what I felt till I saw the baby was gone
And when Id put it there I thought I should like somebody to find it and save it from dying but when I saw it was gone I was struck like a stone with fear
I never thought o stirring I felt so weak
I knew I couldnt run away and everybody as saw me ud know about the baby
My heart went like a stone
I couldnt wish or try for anything it seemed like as if I should stay there for ever and nothing ud ever change
But they came and took me away
Hetty was silent but she shuddered again as if there was still something behind and Dinah waited for her heart was so full that tears must come before words
At last Hetty burst out with a sob Dinah do you think God will take away that crying and the place in the wood now Ive told everything
Let us pray poor sinner
Let us fall on our knees again and pray to the God of all mercy
Chapter XLVI The Hours of Suspense ON Sunday morning when the church bells in Stoniton were ringing for morning service Bartle Massey reentered Adams room after a short absence and said Adam heres a visitor wants to see you
Adam was seated with is back towards the door but he started up and turned round instantly with a flushed face and an eager look
His face was even thinner and more worn than we have seen it before but he was washed and shaven this Sunday morning
Is it any news
he said
Keep yourself quiet my lad said Bartle keep quiet
Its not what youre thinking of
Its the young Methodist woman come from the prison
Shes at the bottom o the stairs and wants to know if you think well to see her for she has something to say to you about that poor castaway but she wouldnt come in without your leave she said
She thought youd perhaps like to go out and speak to her
These preaching women are not so backard commonly Bartle muttered to himself
Ask her to come in said Adam
He was standing with his face towards the door and as Dinah entered lifting up her mild grey eyes towards him she saw at once the great change that had come since the day when she had looked up at the tall man in the cottage
There was a trembling in her clear voice as she put her hand into his and said Be comforted Adam Bede the Lord has not forsaken her
Bless you for coming to her Adam said
Mr Massey brought me word yesterday as you was come
They could neither of them say any more just yet but stood before each other in silence and Bartle Massey too who had put on his spectacles seemed transfixed examining Dinahs face
But he recovered himself first and said Sit down young woman sit down placing the chair for her and retiring to his old seat on the bed
Thank you friend I wont sit down said Dinah for I must hasten back
She entreated me not to stay long away
What I came for Adam Bede was to pray you to go and see the poor sinner and bid her farewell
She desires to ask your forgiveness and it is meet you should see her today rather than in the early morning when the time will be short
Adam stood trembling and at last sank down on his chair again
It wont be he said itll be put offtherell perhaps come a pardon
Mr Irwine said there was hope
He said I neednt quite give it up
Thats a blessed thought to me said Dinah her eyes filling with tears
Its a fearful thing hurrying her soul away so fast
But let what will be she added presently
You will surely come and let her speak the words that are in her heart
Although her poor soul is very dark and discerns little beyond the things of the flesh she is no longer hard
She is contrite she has confessed all to me
The pride of her heart has given way and she leans on me for help and desires to be taught
This fills me with trust for I cannot but think that the brethren sometimes err in measuring the Divine love by the sinners knowledge
She is going to write a letter to the friends at the Hall Farm for me to give them when she is gone and when I told her you were here she said I should like to say goodbye to Adam and ask him to forgive me
You will come Adam
Perhaps you will even now come back with me
I cant Adam said
I cant say goodbye while theres any hope
Im listening and listeningI cant think o nothing but that
It cant be as shell die that shameful deathI cant bring my mind to it
He got up from his chair again and looked away out of the window while Dinah stood with compassionate patience
In a minute or two he turned round and said I will come Dinahtomorrow morningif it must be
I may have more strength to bear it if I know it must be
Tell her I forgive her tell her I will come at the very last
I will not urge you against the voice of your own heart said Dinah
I must hasten back to her for it is wonderful how she clings now and was not willing to let me out of her sight
She used never to make any return to my affection before but now tribulation has opened her heart
Farewell Adam
Our heavenly Father comfort you and strengthen you to bear all things
Dinah put out her hand and Adam pressed it in silence
Bartle Massey was getting up to lift the stiff latch of the door for her but before he could reach it she had said gently Farewell friend and was gone with her light step down the stairs
Well said Bartle taking off his spectacles and putting them into his pocket if there must be women to make trouble in the world its but fair there should be women to be comforters under it and shes oneshes one
Its a pity shes a Methodist but theres no getting a woman without some foolishness or other
Adam never went to bed that night
The excitement of suspense heightening with every hour that brought him nearer the fatal moment was too great and in spite of his entreaties in spite of his promises that he would be perfectly quiet the schoolmaster watched too
What does it matter to me lad
Bartle said a nights sleep more or less
I shall sleep long enough by and by underground
Let me keep thee company in trouble while I can
It was a long and dreary night in that small chamber
Adam would sometimes get up and tread backwards and forwards along the short space from wall to wall then he would sit down and hide his face and no sound would be heard but the ticking of the watch on the table or the falling of a cinder from the fire which the schoolmaster carefully tended
Sometimes he would burst out into vehement speech If I could ha done anything to save herif my bearing anything would ha done any goodbut t have to sit still and know it and do nothingits hard for a man to bearand to think o what might ha been now if it hadnt been for HIMO God its the very day we should ha been married
Aye my lad said Bartle tenderly its heavyits heavy
But you must remember this when you thought of marrying her youd a notion shed got another sort of a nature inside her
You didnt think she could have got hardened in that little while to do what shes done
I knowI know that said Adam
I thought she was loving and tenderhearted and wouldnt tell a lie or act deceitful
How could I think any other way
And if hed never come near her and Id married her and been loving to her and took care of her she might never ha done anything bad
What would it ha signified my having a bit o trouble with her
It ud ha been nothing to this
Theres no knowing my ladtheres no knowing what might have come
The smarts bad for you to bear now you must have time you must have time
But Ive that opinion of you that youll rise above it all and be a man again and there may good come out of this that we dont see
Good come out of it
said Adam passionately
That doesnt alter th evil HER ruin cant be undone
I hate that talk o people as if there was a way o making amends for everything
Theyd more need be brought to see as the wrong they do can never be altered
When a mans spoiled his fellowcreaturs life hes no right to comfort himself with thinking good may come out of it
Somebody elses good doesnt alter her shame and misery
Well lad well said Bartle in a gentle tone strangely in contrast with his usual peremptoriness and impatience of contradiction its likely enough I talk foolishness
Im an old fellow and its a good many years since I was in trouble myself
Its easy finding reasons why other folks should be patient
Mr Massey said Adam penitently Im very hot and hasty
I owe you something different but you mustnt take it ill of me
Not I ladnot I
So the night wore on in agitation till the chill dawn and the growing light brought the tremulous quiet that comes on the brink of despair
There would soon be no more suspense
Let us go to the prison now Mr Massey said Adam when he saw the hand of his watch at six
If theres any news come we shall hear about it
The people were astir already moving rapidly in one direction through the streets
Adam tried not to think where they were going as they hurried past him in that short space between his lodging and the prison gates
He was thankful when the gates shut him in from seeing those eager people
No there was no news comeno pardonno reprieve
Adam lingered in the court half an hour before he could bring himself to send word to Dinah that he was come
But a voice caught his ear he could not shut out the words
The cart is to set off at halfpast seven
It must be saidthe last goodbye there was no help
In ten minutes from that time Adam was at the door of the cell
Dinah had sent him word that she could not come to him she could not leave Hetty one moment but Hetty was prepared for the meeting
He could not see her when he entered for agitation deadened his senses and the dim cell was almost dark to him
He stood a moment after the door closed behind him trembling and stupefied
But he began to see through the dimnessto see the dark eyes lifted up to him once more but with no smile in them
O God how sad they looked
The last time they had met his was when he parted from her with his heart full of joyous hopeful love and they looked out with a tearful smile from a pink dimpled childish face
The face was marble now the sweet lips were pallid and halfopen and quivering the dimples were all goneall but one that never went and the eyesO the worst of all was the likeness they had to Hettys
They were Hettys eyes looking at him with that mournful gaze as if she had come back to him from the dead to tell him of her misery
She was clinging close to Dinah her cheek was against Dinahs
It seemed as if her last faint strength and hope lay in that contact and the pitying love that shone out from Dinahs face looked like a visible pledge of the Invisible Mercy
When the sad eyes metwhen Hetty and Adam looked at each other she felt the change in him too and it seemed to strike her with fresh fear
It was the first time she had seen any being whose face seemed to reflect the change in herself Adam was a new image of the dreadful past and the dreadful present
She trembled more as she looked at him
Speak to him Hetty Dinah said tell him what is in your heart
Hetty obeyed her like a little child
AdamIm very sorryI behaved very wrong to youwill you forgive mebefore I die
Adam answered with a halfsob Yes I forgive thee Hetty
I forgave thee long ago
It had seemed to Adam as if his brain would burst with the anguish of meeting Hettys eyes in the first moments but the sound of her voice uttering these penitent words touched a chord which had been less strained
There was a sense of relief from what was becoming unbearable and the rare tears camethey had never come before since he had hung on Seths neck in the beginning of his sorrow
Hetty made an involuntary movement towards him some of the love that she had once lived in the midst of was come near her again
She kept hold of Dinahs hand but she went up to Adam and said timidly Will you kiss me again Adam for all Ive been so wicked
Adam took the blanched wasted hand she put out to him and they gave each other the solemn unspeakable kiss of a lifelong parting
And tell him Hetty said in rather a stronger voice tell himfor theres nobody else to tell himas I went after him and couldnt find himand I hated him and cursed him oncebut Dinah says I should forgive himand I tryfor else God wont forgive me
There was a noise at the door of the cell nowthe key was being turned in the lock and when the door opened Adam saw indistinctly that there were several faces there
He was too agitated to see moreeven to see that Mr Irwines face was one of them
He felt that the last preparations were beginning and he could stay no longer
Room was silently made for him to depart and he went to his chamber in loneliness leaving Bartle Massey to watch and see the end
Chapter XLVII The Last Moment IT was a sight that some people remembered better even than their own sorrowsthe sight in that grey clear morning when the fatal cart with the two young women in it was descried by the waiting watching multitude cleaving its way towards the hideous symbol of a deliberately inflicted sudden death
All Stoniton had heard of Dinah Morris the young Methodist woman who had brought the obstinate criminal to confess and there was as much eagerness to see her as to see the wretched Hetty
But Dinah was hardly conscious of the multitude
When Hetty had caught sight of the vast crowd in the distance she had clutched Dinah convulsively
Close your eyes Hetty Dinah said and let us pray without ceasing to God
And in a low voice as the cart went slowly along through the midst of the gazing crowd she poured forth her soul with the wrestling intensity of a last pleading for the trembling creature that clung to her and clutched her as the only visible sign of love and pity
Dinah did not know that the crowd was silent gazing at her with a sort of aweshe did not even know how near they were to the fatal spot when the cart stopped and she shrank appalled at a loud shout hideous to her ear like a vast yell of demons
Hettys shriek mingled with the sound and they clasped each other in mutual horror
But it was not a shout of execrationnot a yell of exultant cruelty
It was a shout of sudden excitement at the appearance of a horseman cleaving the crowd at full gallop
The horse is hot and distressed but answers to the desperate spurring the rider looks as if his eyes were glazed by madness and he saw nothing but what was unseen by others
See he has something in his handhe is holding it up as if it were a signal
The Sheriff knows him it is Arthur Donnithorne carrying in his hand a hardwon release from death
Chapter XLVIII A nother Meeting in the Wood THE next day at evening two men were walking from opposite points towards the same scene drawn thither by a common memory
The scene was the Grove by Donnithorne Chase you know who the men were
The old squires funeral had taken place that morning the will had been read and now in the first breathingspace Arthur Donnithorne had come out for a lonely walk that he might look fixedly at the new future before him and confirm himself in a sad resolution
He thought he could do that best in the Grove
Adam too had come from Stontion on Monday evening and today he had not left home except to go to the family at the Hall Farm and tell them everything that Mr Irwine had left untold
He had agreed with the Poysers that he would follow them to their new neighbourhood wherever that might be for he meant to give up the management of the woods and as soon as it was practicable he would wind up his business with Jonathan Burge and settle with his mother and Seth in a home within reach of the friends to whom he felt bound by a mutual sorrow
Seth and me are sure to find work he said
A man thats got our trade at his fingerends is at home everywhere and we must make a new start
My mother wont stand in the way for shes told me since I came home shed made up her mind to being buried in another parish if I wished it and if Id be more comfortable elsewhere
Its wonderful how quiet shes been ever since I came back
It seems as if the very greatness o the trouble had quieted and calmed her
We shall all be better in a new country though theres some I shall be loath to leave behind
But I wont part from you and yours if I can help it Mr Poyser
Troubles made us kin
Aye lad said Martin
Well go out o hearing o that mans name
But I doubt we shall neer go far enough for folks not to find out as weve got them belonging to us as are transported oer the seas and were like to be hanged
We shall have that flyin up in our faces and our childrens after us
That was a long visit to the Hall Farm and drew too strongly on Adams energies for him to think of seeing others or reentering on his old occupations till the morrow
But tomorrow he said to himself Ill go to work again
I shall learn to like it again some time maybe and its right whether I like it or not
This evening was the last he would allow to be absorbed by sorrow suspense was gone now and he must bear the unalterable
He was resolved not to see Arthur Donnithorne again if it were possible to avoid him
He had no message to deliver from Hetty now for Hetty had seen Arthur
And Adam distrusted himselfhe had learned to dread the violence of his own feeling
That word of Mr Irwinesthat he must remember what he had felt after giving the last blow to Arthur in the Grovehad remained with him
These thoughts about Arthur like all thoughts that are charged with strong feeling were continually recurring and they always called up the image of the Groveof that spot under the overarching boughs where he had caught sight of the two bending figures and had been possessed by sudden rage
Ill go and see it again tonight for the last time he said itll do me good itll make me feel over again what I felt when Id knocked him down
I felt what poor empty work it was as soon as Id done it before I began to think he might be dead
In this way it happened that Arthur and Adam were walking towards the same spot at the same time
Adam had on his workingdress again now for he had thrown off the other with a sense of relief as soon as he came home and if he had had the basket of tools over his shoulder he might have been taken with his pale wasted face for the spectre of the Adam Bede who entered the Grove on that August evening eight months ago
But he had no basket of tools and he was not walking with the old erectness looking keenly round him his hands were thrust in his side pockets and his eyes rested chiefly on the ground
He had not long entered the Grove and now he paused before a beech
He knew that tree well it was the boundary mark of his youththe sign to him of the time when some of his earliest strongest feelings had left him
He felt sure they would never return
And yet at this moment there was a stirring of affection at the remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he had believed in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago
It was affection for the dead THAT Arthur existed no longer
He was disturbed by the sound of approaching footsteps but the beech stood at a turning in the road and he could not see who was coming until the tall slim figure in deep mourning suddenly stood before him at only two yards distance
They both started and looked at each other in silence
Often in the last fortnight Adam had imagined himself as close to Arthur as this assailing him with words that should be as harrowing as the voice of remorse forcing upon him a just share in the misery he had caused and often too he had told himself that such a meeting had better not be
But in imagining the meeting he had always seen Arthur as he had met him on that evening in the Grove florid careless light of speech and the figure before him touched him with the signs of suffering
Adam knew what suffering washe could not lay a cruel finger on a bruised man
He felt no impulse that he needed to resist
Silence was more just than reproach
Arthur was the first to speak
Adam he said quietly it may be a good thing that we have met here for I wished to see you
I should have asked to see you to morrow
He paused but Adam said nothing
I know it is painful to you to meet me Arthur went on but it is not likely to happen again for years to come
No sir said Adam coldly that was what I meant to write to you tomorrow as it would be better all dealings should be at an end between us and somebody else put in my place
Arthur felt the answer keenly and it was not without an effort that he spoke again
It was partly on that subject I wished to speak to you
I dont want to lessen your indignation against me or ask you to do anything for my sake
I only wish to ask you if you will help me to lessen the evil consequences of the past which is unchangeable
I dont mean consequences to myself but to others
It is but little I can do I know
I know the worst consequences will remain but something may be done and you can help me
Will you listen to me patiently
Yes sir said Adam after some hesitation Ill hear what it is
If I can help to mend anything I will
Anger ull mend nothing I know
Weve had enough o that
I was going to the Hermitage said Arthur
Will you go there with me and sit down
We can talk better there
The Hermitage had never been entered since they left it together for Arthur had locked up the key in his desk
And now when he opened the door there was the candle burnt out in the socket there was the chair in the same place where Adam remembered sitting there was the wastepaper basket full of scraps and deep down in it Arthur felt in an instant there was the little pink silk handkerchief
It would have been painful to enter this place if their previous thoughts had been less painful
They sat down opposite each other in the old places and Arthur said Im going away Adam Im going into the army
Poor Arthur felt that Adam ought to be affected by this announcementought to have a movement of sympathy towards him
But Adams lips remained firmly closed and the expression of his face unchanged
What I want to say to you Arthur continued is this one of my reasons for going away is that no one else may leave Hayslopemay leave their home on my account
I would do anything there is no sacrifice I would not make to prevent any further injury to others through mythrough what has happened
Arthurs words had precisely the opposite effect to that he had anticipated
Adam thought he perceived in them that notion of compensation for irretrievable wrong that selfsoothing attempt to make evil bear the same fruits as good which most of all roused his indignation
He was as strongly impelled to look painful facts right in the face as Arthur was to turn away his eyes from them
Moreover he had the wakeful suspicious pride of a poor man in the presence of a rich man
He felt his old severity returning as he said The times past for that sir
A man should make sacrifices to keep clear of doing a wrong sacrifices wont undo it when its done
When peoples feelings have got a deadly wound they cant be cured with favours
Favours
said Arthur passionately no how can you suppose I meant that
But the PoysersMr Irwine tells me the Poysers mean to leave the place where they have lived so many yearsfor generations
Dont you see as Mr Irwine does that if they could be persuaded to overcome the feeling that drives them away it would be much better for them in the end to remain on the old spot among the friends and neighbours who know them
Thats true said Adam coldly
But then sir folkss feelings are not so easily overcome
Itll be hard for Martin Poyser to go to a strange place among strange faces when hes been bred up on the Hall Farm and his father before him but then it ud be harder for a man with his feelings to stay
I dont see how the things to be made any other than hard
Theres a sort o damage sir that cant be made up for
Arthur was silent some moments
In spite of other feelings dominant in him this evening his pride winced under Adams mode of treating him
Wasnt he himself suffering
Was not he too obliged to renounce his most cherished hopes
It was now as it had been eight months agoAdam was forcing Arthur to feel more intensely the irrevocableness of his own wrongdoing
He was presenting the sort of resistance that was the most irritating to Arthurs eager ardent nature
But his anger was subdued by the same influence that had subdued Adams when they first confronted each otherby the marks of suffering in a long familiar face
The momentary struggle ended in the feeling that he could bear a great deal from Adam to whom he had been the occasion of bearing so much but there was a touch of pleading boyish vexation in his tone as he said But people may make injuries worse by unreasonable conductby giving way to anger and satisfying that for the moment instead of thinking what will be the effect in the future
If I were going to stay here and act as landlord he added presently with still more eagernessif I were careless about what Ive donewhat Ive been the cause of you would have some excuse Adam for going away and encouraging others to go
You would have some excuse then for trying to make the evil worse
But when I tell you Im going away for yearswhen you know what that means for me how it cuts off every plan of happiness Ive ever formedit is impossible for a sensible man like you to believe that there is any real ground for the Poysers refusing to remain
I know their feeling about disgraceMr Irwine has told me all but he is of opinion that they might be persuaded out of this idea that they are disgraced in the eyes of their neighbours and that they cant remain on my estate if you would join him in his effortsif you would stay yourself and go on managing the old woods
Arthur paused a moment and then added pleadingly You know thats a good work to do for the sake of other people besides the owner
And you dont know but that they may have a better owner soon whom you will like to work for
If I die my cousin Tradgett will have the estate and take my name
He is a good fellow
Adam could not help being moved it was impossible for him not to feel that this was the voice of the honest warmhearted Arthur whom he had loved and been proud of in old days but nearer memories would not be thrust away
He was silent yet Arthur saw an answer in his face that induced him to go on with growing earnestness
And then if you would talk to the Poysersif you would talk the matter over with Mr Irwinehe means to see you tomorrowand then if you would join your arguments to his to prevail on them not to goI know of course that they would not accept any favour from meI mean nothing of that kindbut Im sure they would suffer less in the end
Irwine thinks so too
And Mr Irwine is to have the chief authority on the estatehe has consented to undertake that
They will really be under no man but one whom they respect and like
It would be the same with you Adam and it could be nothing but a desire to give me worse pain that could incline you to go
Arthur was silent again for a little while and then said with some agitation in his voice I wouldnt act so towards you I know
If you were in my place and I in yours I should try to help you to do the best
Adam made a hasty movement on his chair and looked on the ground
Arthur went on Perhaps youve never done anything youve had bitterly to repent of in your life Adam if you had you would be more generous
You would know then that its worse for me than for you
Arthur rose from his seat with the last words and went to one of the windows looking out and turning his back on Adam as he continued passionately Havent I loved her too
Didnt I see her yesterday
Shant I carry the thought of her about with me as much as you will
And dont you think you would suffer more if youd been in fault
There was silence for several minutes for the struggle in Adams mind was not easily decided
Facile natures whose emotions have little permanence can hardly understand how much inward resistance he overcame before he rose from his seat and turned towards Arthur
Arthur heard the movement and turning round met the sad but softened look with which Adam said Its true what you say sir
Im hardits in my nature
I was too hard with my father for doing wrong
Ive been a bit hard t everybody but her
I felt as if nobody pitied her enoughher suffering cut into me so and when I thought the folks at the farm were too hard with her I said Id never be hard to anybody myself again
But feeling overmuch about her has perhaps made me unfair to you
Ive known what it is in my life to repent and feel its too late
I felt Id been too harsh to my father when he was gone from meI feel it now when I think of him
Ive no right to be hard towards them as have done wrong and repent
Adam spoke these words with the firm distinctness of a man who is resolved to leave nothing unsaid that he is bound to say but he went on with more hesitation
I wouldnt shake hands with you once sir when you asked mebut if youre willing to do it now for all I refused then Arthurs white hand was in Adams large grasp in an instant and with that action there was a strong rush on both sides of the old boyish affection
Adam Arthur said impelled to full confession now it would never have happened if Id known you loved her
That would have helped to save me from it
And I did struggle
I never meant to injure her
I deceived you afterwardsand that led on to worse but I thought it was forced upon me I thought it was the best thing I could do
And in that letter I told her to let me know if she were in any trouble dont think I would not have done everything I could
But I was all wrong from the very first and horrible wrong has come of it
God knows Id give my life if I could undo it
They sat down again opposite each other and Adam said tremulously How did she seem when you left her sir
Dont ask me Adam Arthur said I feel sometimes as if I should go mad with thinking of her looks and what she said to me and then that I couldnt get a full pardonthat I couldnt save her from that wretched fate of being transportedthat I can do nothing for her all those years and she may die under it and never know comfort any more
Ah sir said Adam for the first time feeling his own pain merged in sympathy for Arthur you and mell often be thinking o the same thing when were a long way off one another
Ill pray God to help you as I pray him to help me
But theres that sweet womanthat Dinah Morris Arthur said pursuing his own thoughts and not knowing what had been the sense of Adams words she says she shall stay with her to the very last momenttill she goes and the poor thing clings to her as if she found some comfort in her
I could worship that woman I dont know what I should do if she were not there
Adam you will see her when she comes back
I could say nothing to her yesterdaynothing of what I felt towards her
Tell her Arthur went on hurriedly as if he wanted to hide the emotion with which he spoke while he took off his chain and watch tell her I asked you to give her this in remembrance of meof the man to whom she is the one source of comfort when he thinks ofI know she doesnt care about such thingsor anything else I can give her for its own sake
But she will use the watchI shall like to think of her using it
Ill give it to her sir Adam said and tell her your words
She told me she should come back to the people at the Hall Farm
And you will persuade the Poysers to stay Adam
said Arthur reminded of the subject which both of them had forgotten in the first interchange of revived friendship
You will stay yourself and help Mr Irwine to carry out the repairs and improvements on the estate
Theres one thing sir that perhaps you dont take account of said Adam with hesitating gentleness and that was what made me hang back longer
You see its the same with both me and the Poysers if we stay its for our own worldly interest and it looks as if wed put up with anything for the sake o that
I know thats what theyll feel and I cant help feeling a little of it myself
When folks have got an honourable independent spirit they dont like to do anything that might make em seem baseminded
But no one who knows you will think that Adam
That is not a reason strong enough against a course that is really more generous more unselfish than the other
And it will be knownit shall be made known that both you and the Poysers stayed at my entreaty
Adam dont try to make things worse for me Im punished enough without that
No sir no Adam said looking at Arthur with mournful affection
God forbid I should make things worse for you
I used to wish I could do it in my passionbut that was when I thought you didnt feel enough
Ill stay sir Ill do the best I can
Its all Ive got to think of nowto do my work well and make the world a bit better place for them as can enjoy it
Then well part now Adam
You will see Mr Irwine tomorrow and consult with him about everything
Are you going soon sir
said Adam
As soon as possibleafter Ive made the necessary arrangements
Goodbye Adam
I shall think of you going about the old place
Goodbye sir
God bless you
The hands were clasped once more and Adam left the Hermitage feeling that sorrow was more bearable now hatred was gone
As soon as the door was closed behind him Arthur went to the wastepaper basket and took out the little pink silk handkerchief
Book Six Chapter XLIX At the Hall Farm THE first autumnal afternoon sunshine of 1801more than eighteen months after that parting of Adam and Arthur in the Hermitagewas on the yard at the Hall Farm and the bulldog was in one of his most excited moments for it was that hour of the day when the cows were being driven into the yard for their afternoon milking
No wonder the patient beasts ran confusedly into the wrong places for the alarming din of the bulldog was mingled with more distant sounds which the timid feminine creatures with pardonable superstition imagined also to have some relation to their own movementswith the tremendous crack of the waggoners whip the roar of his voice and the booming thunder of the waggon as it left the rickyard empty of its golden load
The milking of the cows was a sight Mrs Poyser loved and at this hour on mild days she was usually standing at the house door with her knitting in her hands in quiet contemplation only heightened to a keener interest when the vicious yellow cow who had once kicked over a pailful of precious milk was about to undergo the preventive punishment of having her hinderlegs strapped
Today however Mrs Poyser gave but a divided attention to the arrival of the cows for she was in eager discussion with Dinah who was stitching Mr Poysers shirtcollars and had borne patiently to have her thread broken three times by Totty pulling at her arm with a sudden insistence that she should look at Baby that is at a large wooden doll with no legs and a long skirt whose bald head Totty seated in her small chair at Dinahs side was caressing and pressing to her fat cheek with much fervour
Totty is larger by more than two years growth than when you first saw her and she has on a black frock under her pinafore
Mrs Poyser too has on a black gown which seems to heighten the family likeness between her and Dinah
In other respects there is little outward change now discernible in our old friends or in the pleasant houseplace bright with polished oak and pewter
I never saw the like to you Dinah Mrs Poyser was saying when youve once took anything into your head theres no more moving you than the rooted tree
You may say what you like but I dont believe thats religion for whats the Sermon on the Mount about as youre so fond o reading to the boys but doing what other folks ud have you do
But if it was anything unreasonable they wanted you to do like taking your cloak off and giving it to em or letting em slap you i the face I daresay youd be ready enough
Its only when one ud have you do whats plain common sense and good for yourself as youre obstinate th other way
Nay dear Aunt said Dinah smiling slightly as she went on with her work Im sure your wish ud be a reason for me to do anything that I didnt feel it was wrong to do
Wrong
You drive me past bearing
What is there wrong I should like to know i staying along wi your own friends as are th happier for having you with em an are willing to provide for you even if your work didnt more nor pay em for the bit o sparrows victual y eat and the bit o rag you put on
An who is it I should like to know as youre bound t help and comfort i the world more nor your own flesh and bloodan me th only aunt youve got aboveground an am brought to the brink o the grave welly every winter as comes an theres the child as sits beside you ull break her little heart when you go an the grandfather not been dead a twelvemonth an your uncle ull miss you so as never wasalighting his pipe an waiting on him an now I can trust you wi the butter an have had all the trouble o teaching you and theres all the sewing to be done an I must have a strange gell out o Treddleson to do itan all because you must go back to that bare heap o stones as the very crows fly over an wont stop at
Dear Aunt Rachel said Dinah looking up in Mrs Poysers face its your kindness makes you say Im useful to you
You dont really want me now for Nancy and Molly are clever at their work and youre in good health now by the blessing of God and my uncle is of a cheerful countenance again and you have neighbours and friends not a fewsome of them come to sit with my uncle almost daily
Indeed you will not miss me and at Snowfield there are brethren and sisters in great need who have none of those comforts you have around you
I feel that I am called back to those amongst whom my lot was first cast
I feel drawn again towards the hills where I used to be blessed in carrying the word of life to the sinful and desolate
You feel
Yes said Mrs Poyser returning from a parenthetic glance at the cows thats allays the reason Im to sit down wi when youve a mind to do anything contrairy
What do you want to be preaching for more than youre preaching now
Dont you go off the Lord knows where every Sunday apreaching and praying
An havent you got Methodists enow at Treddleson to go and look at if churchfolkss faces are too handsome to please you
An isnt there them i this parish as youve got under hand and theyre like enough to make friends wi Old Harry again as soon as your backs turned
Theres that Bessy Cranageshell be flaunting i new finery three weeks after youre gone Ill be bound
Shell no more go on in her new ways without you than a dog ull stand on its hindlegs when theres nobody looking
But I suppose it doesna matter so much about folkss souls i this country else youd be for staying with your own aunt for shes none so good but what you might help her to be better
There was a certain something in Mrs Poysers voice just then which she did not wish to be noticed so she turned round hastily to look at the clock and said See there
Its teatime an if Martins i the rickyard hell like a cup
Here Totty my chicken let mother put your bonnet on and then you go out into the rickyard and see if Fathers there and tell him he mustnt go away again without coming t have a cup o tea and tell your brothers to come in too
Totty trotted off in her flapping bonnet while Mrs Poyser set out the bright oak table and reached down the teacups
You talk o them gells Nancy and Molly being clever i their work she began again its fine talking
Theyre all the same clever or stupidone cant trust em out o ones sight a minute
They want somebodys eye on em constant if theyre to be kept to their work
An suppose Im ill again this winter as I was the winter before last
Whos to look after em then if youre gone
An theres that blessed childsomethings sure t happen to her theyll let her tumble into the fire or get at the kettle wi the boiling lard int or some mischief as ull lame her for life an itll be all your fault Dinah
Aunt said Dinah I promise to come back to you in the winter if youre ill Dont think I will ever stay away from you if youre in real want of me
But indeed it is needful for my own soul that I should go away from this life of ease and luxury in which I have all things too richly to enjoyat least that I should go away for a short space
No one can know but myself what are my inward needs and the besetments I am most in danger from
Your wish for me to stay is not a call of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own desires it is a temptation that I must resist lest the love of the creature should become like a mist in my soul shutting out the heavenly light
It passes my cunning to know what you mean by ease and luxury said Mrs Poyser as she cut the bread and butter
Its true theres good victual enough about you as nobody shall ever say I dont provide enough and to spare but if theres ever a bit o odds an ends as nobody else ud eat youre sure to pick it outbut look there
Theres Adam Bede acarrying the little un in
I wonder how it is hes come so early
Mrs Poyser hastened to the door for the pleasure of looking at her darling in a new position with love in her eyes but reproof on her tongue
Oh for shame Totty
Little gells o five year old should be ashamed to be carried
Why Adam shell break your arm such a big gell as that set her downfor shame
Nay nay said Adam I can lift her with my handIve no need to take my arm to it
Totty looking as serenely unconscious of remark as a fat white puppy was set down at the doorplace and the mother enforced her reproof with a shower of kisses
Youre surprised to see me at this hour o the day said Adam
Yes but come in said Mrs Poyser making way for him theres no bad news I hope
No nothing bad Adam answered as he went up to Dinah and put out his hand to her
She had laid down her work and stood up instinctively as he approached her
A faint blush died away from her pale cheek as she put her hand in his and looked up at him timidly
Its an errand to you brought me Dinah said Adam apparently unconscious that he was holding her hand all the while mothers a bit ailing and shes set her heart on your coming to stay the night with her if youll be so kind
I told her Id call and ask you as I came from the village
She overworks herself and I cant persuade her to have a little girl t help her
I dont know whats to be done
Adam released Dinahs hand as he ceased speaking and was expecting an answer but before she had opened her lips Mrs Poyser said Look there now
I told you there was folks enow t help i this parish wiout going further off
Theres Mrs Bede getting as old and casalty as can be and she wont let anybody but you go anigh her hardly
The folks at Snowfield have learnt by this time to do better wiout you nor she can
Ill put my bonnet on and set off directly if you dont want anything done first Aunt said Dinah folding up her work
Yes I do want something done
I want you t have your tea child its all readyand youll have a cup Adam if y arena in too big a hurry
Yes Ill have a cup please and then Ill walk with Dinah
Im going straight home for Ive got a lot o timber valuations to write out
Why Adam lad are you here
said Mr Poyser entering warm and coatless with the two blackeyed boys behind him still looking as much like him as two small elephants are like a large one
How is it weve got sight o you so long before fodderingtime
I came on an errand for Mother said Adam
Shes got a touch of her old complaint and she wants Dinah to go and stay with her a bit
Well well spare her for your mother a little while said Mr Poyser
But we wonna spare her for anybody else ony her husband
Husband
said Marty who was at the most prosaic and literal period of the boyish mind
Why Dinah hasnt got a husband
Spare her
said Mrs Poyser placing a seedcake on the table and then seating herself to pour out the tea
But we must spare her it seems and not for a husband neither but for her own megrims
Tommy what are you doing to your little sisters doll
Making the child naughty when shed be good if youd let her
You shanna have a morsel o cake if you behave so
Tommy with true brotherly sympathy was amusing himself by turning Dollys skirt over her bald head and exhibiting her truncated body to the general scornan indignity which cut Totty to the heart
What do you think Dinahs been atelling me since dinnertime
Mrs Poyser continued looking at her husband
Eh
Im a poor un at guessing said Mr Poyser
Why she means to go back to Snowfield again and work i the mill and starve herself as she used to do like a creatur as has got no friends
Mr Poyser did not readily find words to express his unpleasant astonishment he only looked from his wife to Dinah who had now seated herself beside Totty as a bulwark against brotherly playfulness and was busying herself with the childrens tea
If he had been given to making general reflections it would have occurred to him that there was certainly a change come over Dinah for she never used to change colour but as it was he merely observed that her face was flushed at that moment
Mr Poyser thought she looked the prettier for it it was a flush no deeper than the petal of a monthly rose
Perhaps it came because her uncle was looking at her so fixedly but there is no knowing for just then Adam was saying with quiet surprise Why I hoped Dinah was settled among us for life
I thought shed given up the notion o going back to her old country
Thought
Yes said Mrs Poyser and so would anybody else ha thought as had got their right end upards
But I suppose you must be a Methodist to know what a Methodist ull do
Its ill guessing what the bats are flying after
Why what have we done to you
Dinah as you must go away from us
said Mr Poyser still pausing over his teacup
Its like breaking your word welly for your aunt never had no thought but youd make this your home
Nay Uncle said Dinah trying to be quite calm
When I first came I said it was only for a time as long as I could be of any comfort to my aunt
Well an who said youd ever left off being a comfort to me
said Mrs Poyser
If you didna mean to stay wi me youd better never ha come
Them as ha never had a cushion dont miss it
Nay nay said Mr Poyser who objected to exaggerated views
Thee mustna say so we should ha been ill off wiout her Lady day was a twelvemont
We mun be thankful for that whether she stays or no
But I canna think what she mun leave a good home for to go back int a country where the land most ont isna worth ten shillings an acre rent and profits
Why thats just the reason she wants to go as fur as she can give a reason said Mrs Poyser
She says this countrys too comfortable an theres too much t eat an folks arena miserable enough
And shes going next week
I canna turn her say what I will
Its allays the way wi them meekfaced people you mays well pelt a bag o feathers as talk to em
But I say it isna religion to be so obstinateis it now Adam
Adam saw that Dinah was more disturbed than he had ever seen her by any matter relating to herself and anxious to relieve her if possible he said looking at her affectionately Nay I cant find fault with anything Dinah does
I believe her thoughts are better than our guesses let em be what they may
I should ha been thankful for her to stay among us but if she thinks well to go I wouldnt cross her or make it hard to her by objecting
We owe her something different to that
As it often happens the words intended to relieve her were just too much for Dinahs susceptible feelings at this moment
The tears came into the grey eyes too fast to be hidden and she got up hurriedly meaning it to be understood that she was going to put on her bonnet
Mother whats Dinah crying for
said Totty
She isnt a naughty dell
Theest gone a bit too fur said Mr Poyser
Weve no right t interfere with her doing as she likes
An theedst be as angry as could be wi me if I said a word against anything she did
Because youd very like be finding fault wiout reason said Mrs Poyser
But theres reason i what I say else I shouldna say it
Its easy talking for them as cant love her so well as her own aunt does
An me got so used to her
I shall feel as uneasy as a new sheared sheep when shes gone from me
An to think of her leaving a parish where shes so looked on
Theres Mr Irwine makes as much of her as if she was a lady for all her being a Methodist an wi that maggot o preaching in her head God forgie me if Im i the wrong to call it so
Aye said Mr Poyser looking jocose but thee dostna tell Adam what he said to thee about it one day
The missis was saying Adam as the preaching was the only fault to be found wi Dinah and Mr Irwine says But you mustnt find fault with her for that Mrs Poyser you forget shes got no husband to preach to
Ill answer for it you give Poyser many a good sermon
The parson had thee there Mr Poyser added laughing unctuously
I told Bartle Massey on it an he laughed too
Yes its a small joke sets men laughing when they sit astaring at one another with a pipe i their mouths said Mrs Poyser
Give Bartle Massey his way and hed have all the sharpness to himself
If the chaffcutter had the making of us we should all be straw I reckon
Totty my chicken go upstairs to cousin Dinah and see what shes doing and give her a pretty kiss
This errand was devised for Totty as a means of checking certain threatening symptoms about the corners of the mouth for Tommy no longer expectant of cake was lifting up his eyelids with his forefingers and turning his eyeballs towards Totty in a way that she felt to be disagreeably personal
Youre rare and busy noweh Adam
said Mr Poyser
Burges getting so bad wi his asthmy its well if hell ever do much riding about again
Yes weve got a pretty bit o building on hand now said Adam what with the repairs on th estate and the new houses at Treddleson
Ill bet a penny that new house Burge is building on his own bit o land is for him and Mary to go to said Mr Poyser
Hell be for laying by business soon Ill warrant and be wanting you to take to it all and pay him so much by th ear
We shall see you living on th hill before another twelvemonts over
Well said Adam I should like t have the business in my own hands
It isnt as I mind much about getting any more money
Weve enough and to spare now with only our two selves and mother but I should like t have my own way about thingsI could try plans then as I cant do now
You get on pretty well wi the new steward I reckon
said Mr Poyser
Yes yes hes a sensible man enough understands farminghes carrying on the draining and all that capital
You must go some day towards the Stonyshire side and see what alterations theyre making
But hes got no notion about buildings
You can so seldom get hold of a man as can turn his brains to more nor one thing its just as if they wore blinkers like th horses and could see nothing o one side of em
Now theres Mr Irwine has got notions o building more nor most architects for as for th architects they set up to be fine fellows but the most of em dont know where to set a chimney so as it shant be quarrelling with a door
My notion is a practical builder thats got a bit o taste makes the best architect for common things and Ive ten times the pleasure i seeing after the work when Ive made the plan myself
Mr Poyser listened with an admiring interest to Adams discourse on building but perhaps it suggested to him that the building of his cornrick had been proceeding a little too long without the control of the masters eye for when Adam had done speaking he got up and said Well lad Ill bid you goodbye now for Im off to the rickyard again
Adam rose too for he saw Dinah entering with her bonnet on and a little basket in her hand preceded by Totty
Youre ready I see Dinah Adam said so well set off for the sooner Im at home the better
Mother said Totty with her treble pipe Dinah was saying her prayers and crying ever so
Hush hush said the mother little gells mustnt chatter
Whereupon the father shaking with silent laughter set Totty on the white deal table and desired her to kiss him
Mr and Mrs Poyser you perceive had no correct principles of education
Come back tomorrow if Mrs Bede doesnt want you Dinah said Mrs Poyser but you can stay you know if shes ill So when the goodbyes had been said Dinah and Adam left the Hall Farm together
Chapter L In the Cottage ADAM did not ask Dinah to take his arm when they got out into the lane
He had never yet done so often as they had walked together for he had observed that she never walked arminarm with Seth and he thought perhaps that kind of support was not agreeable to her
So they walked apart though side by side and the close poke of her little black bonnet hid her face from him
You cant be happy then to make the Hall Farm your home Dinah
Adam said with the quiet interest of a brother who has no anxiety for himself in the matter
Its a pity seeing theyre so fond of you
You know Adam my heart is as their heart so far as love for them and care for their welfare goes but they are in no present need
Their sorrows are healed and I feel that I am called back to my old work in which I found a blessing that I have missed of late in the midst of too abundant worldly good
I know it is a vain thought to flee from the work that God appoints us for the sake of finding a greater blessing to our own souls as if we could choose for ourselves where we shall find the fulness of the Divine Presence instead of seeking it where alone it is to be found in loving obedience
But now I believe I have a clear showing that my work lies elsewhereat least for a time
In the years to come if my aunts health should fail or she should otherwise need me I shall return
You know best Dinah said Adam
I dont believe youd go against the wishes of them that love you and are akin to you without a good and sufficient reason in your own conscience
Ive no right to say anything about my being sorry you know well enough what cause I have to put you above every other friend Ive got and if it had been ordered so that you could ha been my sister and lived with us all our lives I should ha counted it the greatest blessing as could happen to us now
But Seth tells me theres no hope o that your feelings are different and perhaps Im taking too much upon me to speak about it
Dinah made no answer and they walked on in silence for some yards till they came to the stone stile where as Adam had passed through first and turned round to give her his hand while she mounted the unusually high step she could not prevent him from seeing her face
It struck him with surprise for the grey eyes usually so mild and grave had the bright uneasy glance which accompanies suppressed agitation and the slight flush in her cheeks with which she had come downstairs was heightened to a deep rosecolour
She looked as if she were only sister to Dinah
Adam was silent with surprise and conjecture for some moments and then he said I hope Ive not hurt or displeased you by what Ive said Dinah
Perhaps I was making too free
Ive no wish different from what you see to be best and Im satisfied for you to live thirty mile off if you think it right
I shall think of you just as much as I do now for youre bound up with what I can no more help remembering than I can help my heart beating
Poor Adam
Thus do men blunder
Dinah made no answer but she presently said Have you heard any news from that poor young man since we last spoke of him
Dinah always called Arthur so she had never lost the image of him as she had seen him in the prison
Yes said Adam
Mr Irwine read me part of a letter from him yesterday
Its pretty certain they say that therell be a peace soon though nobody believes itll last long but he says he doesnt mean to come home
Hes no heart for it yet and its better for others that he should keep away
Mr Irwine thinks hes in the right not to come
Its a sorrowful letter
He asks about you and the Poysers as he always does
Theres one thing in the letter cut me a good deal You cant think what an old fellow I feel he says I make no schemes now
Im the best when Ive a good days march or fighting before me
Hes of a rash warmhearted nature like Esau for whom I have always felt great pity said Dinah
That meeting between the brothers where Esau is so loving and generous and Jacob so timid and distrustful notwithstanding his sense of the Divine favour has always touched me greatly
Truly I have been tempted sometimes to say that Jacob was of a mean spirit
But that is our trial we must learn to see the good in the midst of much that is unlovely
Ah said Adam I like to read about Moses best in th Old Testament
He carried a hard business well through and died when other folks were going to reap the fruits
A man must have courage to look at his life so and think whatll come of it after hes dead and gone
A good solid bit o work lasts if its only laying a floor down somebodys the better for it being done well besides the man as does it
They were both glad to talk of subjects that were not personal and in this way they went on till they passed the bridge across the Willow Brook when Adam turned round and said Ah heres Seth
I thought hed be home soon
Does he know of youre going Dinah
Yes I told him last Sabbath
Adam remembered now that Seth had come home much depressed on Sunday evening a circumstance which had been very unusual with him of late for the happiness he had in seeing Dinah every week seemed long to have outweighed the pain of knowing she would never marry him
This evening he had his habitual air of dreamy benignant contentment until he came quite close to Dinah and saw the traces of tears on her delicate eyelids and eyelashes
He gave one rapid glance at his brother but Adam was evidently quite outside the current of emotion that had shaken Dinah he wore his everyday look of unexpectant calm
Seth tried not to let Dinah see that he had noticed her face and only said Im thankful youre come Dinah for Mothers been hungering after the sight of you all day
She began to talk of you the first thing in the morning
When they entered the cottage Lisbeth was seated in her arm chair too tired with setting out the evening meal a task she always performed a long time beforehand to go and meet them at the door as usual when she heard the approaching footsteps
Coom child theet coom at last she said when Dinah went towards her
What dost mane by lavin me a week an neer coomin anigh me
Dear friend said Dinah taking her hand youre not well
If Id known it sooner Id have come
An hows thee t know if thee dostna coom
Th lads ony know what I tell em
As long as ye can stir hand and foot the men think yere hearty
But Im none so bad ony a bit of a cold sets me achin
An th lads tease me so t ha somebody wi me t do the workthey make me ache worse wi talkin
If theedst come and stay wi me theyd let me alone
The Poysers canna want thee so bad as I do
But take thy bonnet off an let me look at thee
Dinah was moving away but Lisbeth held her fast while she was taking off her bonnet and looked at her face as one looks into a newly gathered snowdrop to renew the old impressions of purity and gentleness
Whats the matter wi thee
said Lisbeth in astonishment theest been acryin
Its only a grief thatll pass away said Dinah who did not wish just now to call forth Lisbeths remonstrances by disclosing her intention to leave Hayslope
You shall know about it shortlywell talk of it tonight
I shall stay with you to night
Lisbeth was pacified by this prospect
And she had the whole evening to talk with Dinah alone for there was a new room in the cottage you remember built nearly two years ago in the expectation of a new inmate and here Adam always sat when he had writing to do or plans to make
Seth sat there too this evening for he knew his mother would like to have Dinah all to herself
There were two pretty pictures on the two sides of the wall in the cottage
On one side there was the broadshouldered large featured hardy old woman in her blue jacket and buff kerchief with her dimeyed anxious looks turned continually on the lily face and the slight form in the black dress that were either moving lightly about in helpful activity or seated close by the old womans armchair holding her withered hand with eyes lifted up towards her to speak a language which Lisbeth understood far better than the Bible or the hymnbook
She would scarcely listen to reading at all tonight
Nay nay shut the book she said
We mun talk
I want t know what thee was cryin about
Hast got troubles o thy own like other folks
On the other side of the wall there were the two brothers so like each other in the midst of their unlikeness Adam with knit brows shaggy hair and dark vigorous colour absorbed in his figuring Seth with large rugged features the close copy of his brothers but with thin wavy brown hair and blue dreamy eyes as often as not looking vaguely out of the window instead of at his book although it was a newly bought bookWesleys abridgment of Madame Guyons life which was full of wonder and interest for him
Seth had said to Adam Can I help thee with anything in here tonight
I dont want to make a noise in the shop
No lad Adam answered theres nothing but what I must do myself
Theest got thy new book to read
And often when Seth was quite unconscious Adam as he paused after drawing a line with his ruler looked at his brother with a kind smile dawning in his eyes
He knew th lad liked to sit full o thoughts he could give no account of theyd never come t anything but they made him happy and in the last year or so Adam had been getting more and more indulgent to Seth
It was part of that growing tenderness which came from the sorrow at work within him
For Adam though you see him quite master of himself working hard and delighting in his work after his inborn inalienable nature had not outlived his sorrowhad not felt it slip from him as a temporary burden and leave him the same man again
Do any of us
God forbid
It would be a poor result of all our anguish and our wrestling if we won nothing but our old selves at the end of it if we could return to the same blind loves the same self confident blame the same light thoughts of human suffering the same frivolous gossip over blighted human lives the same feeble sense of that Unknown towards which we have sent forth irrepressible cries in our loneliness
Let us rather be thankful that our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force only changing its form as forces do and passing from pain into sympathythe one poor word which includes all our best insight and our best love
Not that this transformation of pain into sympathy had completely taken place in Adam yet
There was still a great remnant of pain and this he felt would subsist as long as her pain was not a memory but an existing thing which he must think of as renewed with the light of every new morning
But we get accustomed to mental as well as bodily pain without for all that losing our sensibility to it
It becomes a habit of our lives and we cease to imagine a condition of perfect ease as possible for us
Desire is chastened into submission and we are contented with our day when we have been able to bear our grief in silence and act as if we were not suffering
For it is at such periods that the sense of our lives having visible and invisible relations beyond any of which either our present or prospective self is the centre grows like a muscle that we are obliged to lean on and exert
That was Adams state of mind in this second autumn of his sorrow
His work as you know had always been part of his religion and from very early days he saw clearly that good carpentry was Gods willwas that form of Gods will that most immediately concerned him
But now there was no margin of dreams for him beyond this daylight reality no holidaytime in the workingday world no moment in the distance when duty would take off her iron glove and breastplate and clasp him gently into rest
He conceived no picture of the future but one made up of hardworking days such as he lived through with growing contentment and intensity of interest every fresh week
Love he thought could never be anything to him but a living memorya limb lopped off but not gone from consciousness
He did not know that the power of loving was all the while gaining new force within him that the new sensibilities bought by a deep experience were so many new fibres by which it was possible nay necessary to him that his nature should intertwine with another
Yet he was aware that common affection and friendship were more precious to him than they used to bethat he clung more to his mother and Seth and had an unspeakable satisfaction in the sight or imagination of any small addition to their happiness
The Poysers toohardly three or four days passed but he felt the need of seeing them and interchanging words and looks of friendliness with them
He would have felt this probably even if Dinah had not been with them but he had only said the simplest truth in telling Dinah that he put her above all other friends in the world
Could anything be more natural
For in the darkest moments of memory the thought of her always came as the first ray of returning comfort
The early days of gloom at the Hall Farm had been gradually turned into soft moonlight by her presence and in the cottage too for she had come at every spare moment to soothe and cheer poor Lisbeth who had been stricken with a fear that subdued even her querulousness at the sight of her darling Adams griefworn face
He had become used to watching her light quiet movements her pretty loving ways to the children when he went to the Hall Farm to listen for her voice as for a recurrent music to think everything she said and did was just right and could not have been better
In spite of his wisdom he could not find fault with her for her overindulgence of the children who had managed to convert Dinah the preacher before whom a circle of rough men had often trembled a little into a convenient household slavethough Dinah herself was rather ashamed of this weakness and had some inward conflict as to her departure from the precepts of Solomon
Yes there was one thing that might have been better she might have loved Seth and consented to marry him
He felt a little vexed for his brothers sake and he could not help thinking regretfully how Dinah as Seths wife would have made their home as happy as it could be for them allhow she was the one being that would have soothed their mothers last days into peacefulness and rest
Its wonderful she doesnt love th lad Adam had said sometimes to himself for anybody ud think he was just cut out for her
But her hearts so taken up with other things
Shes one o those women that feel no drawing towards having a husband and children o their own
She thinks she should be filled up with her own life then and shes been used so to living in other folkss cares she cant bear the thought of her heart being shut up from em
I see how it is well enough
Shes cut out o different stuff from most women I saw that long ago
Shes never easy but when shes helping somebody and marriage ud interfere with her waysthats true
Ive no right to be contriving and thinking it ud be better if shed have Seth as if I was wiser than she is or than God either for He made her what she is and thats one o the greatest blessings Ive ever had from His hands and others besides me
This selfreproof had recurred strongly to Adams mind when he gathered from Dinahs face that he had wounded her by referring to his wish that she had accepted Seth and so he had endeavoured to put into the strongest words his confidence in her decision as righthis resignation even to her going away from them and ceasing to make part of their life otherwise than by living in their thoughts if that separation were chosen by herself
He felt sure she knew quite well enough how much he cared to see her continuallyto talk to her with the silent consciousness of a mutual great remembrance
It was not possible she should hear anything but selfrenouncing affection and respect in his assurance that he was contented for her to go away and yet there remained an uneasy feeling in his mind that he had not said quite the right thingthat somehow Dinah had not understood him
Dinah must have risen a little before the sun the next morning for she was downstairs about five oclock
So was Seth for through Lisbeths obstinate refusal to have any womanhelper in the house he had learned to make himself as Adam said very handy in the housework that he might save his mother from too great weariness on which ground I hope you will not think him unmanly any more than you can have thought the gallant Colonel Bath unmanly when he made the gruel for his invalid sister
Adam who had sat up late at his writing was still asleep and was not likely Seth said to be down till breakfasttime
Often as Dinah had visited Lisbeth during the last eighteen months she had never slept in the cottage since that night after Thiass death when you remember Lisbeth praised her deft movements and even gave a modified approval to her porridge
But in that long interval Dinah had made great advances in household cleverness and this morning since Seth was there to help she was bent on bringing everything to a pitch of cleanliness and order that would have satisfied her Aunt Poyser
The cottage was far from that standard at present for Lisbeths rheumatism had forced her to give up her old habits of dilettante scouring and polishing
When the kitchen was to her mind Dinah went into the new room where Adam had been writing the night before to see what sweeping and dusting were needed there
She opened the window and let in the fresh morning air and the smell of the sweetbrier and the bright lowslanting rays of the early sun which made a glory about her pale face and pale auburn hair as she held the long brush and swept singing to herself in a very low tonelike a sweet summer murmur that you have to listen for very closelyone of Charles Wesleys hymns Eternal Beam of Light Divine Fountain of unexhausted love In whom the Fathers glories shine Through earth beneath and heaven above Jesus
the weary wanderers rest Give me thy easy yoke to bear With steadfast patience arm my breast With spotless love and holy fear
Speak to my warring passions Peace
Say to my trembling heart Be still
Thy power my strength and fortress is For all things serve thy sovereign will
She laid by the brush and took up the duster and if you had ever lived in Mrs Poysers household you would know how the duster behaved in Dinahs handhow it went into every small corner and on every ledge in and out of sighthow it went again and again round every bar of the chairs and every leg and under and over everything that lay on the table till it came to Adams papers and rulers and the open desk near them
Dinah dusted up to the very edge of these and then hesitated looking at them with a longing but timid eye
It was painful to see how much dust there was among them
As she was looking in this way she heard Seths step just outside the open door towards which her back was turned and said raising her clear treble Seth is your brother wrathful when his papers are stirred
Yes very when they are not put back in the right places said a deep strong voice not Seths
It was as if Dinah had put her hands unawares on a vibrating chord
She was shaken with an intense thrill and for the instant felt nothing else then she knew her cheeks were glowing and dared not look round but stood still distressed because she could not say goodmorning in a friendly way
Adam finding that she did not look round so as to see the smile on his face was afraid she had thought him serious about his wrathfulness and went up to her so that she was obliged to look at him
What
You think Im a cross fellow at home Dinah
he said smilingly
Nay said Dinah looking up with timid eyes not so
But you might be put about by finding things meddled with and even the man Moses the meekest of men was wrathful sometimes
Come then said Adam looking at her affectionately Ill help you move the things and put em back again and then they cant get wrong
Youre getting to be your aunts own niece I see for particularness
They began their little task together but Dinah had not recovered herself sufficiently to think of any remark and Adam looked at her uneasily
Dinah he thought had seemed to disapprove him somehow lately she had not been so kind and open to him as she used to be
He wanted her to look at him and be as pleased as he was himself with doing this bit of playful work
But Dinah did not look at himit was easy for her to avoid looking at the tall manand when at last there was no more dusting to be done and no further excuse for him to linger near her he could bear it no longer and said in rather a pleading tone Dinah youre not displeased with me for anything are you
Ive not said or done anything to make you think ill of me
The question surprised her and relieved her by giving a new course to her feeling
She looked up at him now quite earnestly almost with the tears coming and said Oh no Adam
how could you think so
I couldnt bear you not to feel as much a friend to me as I do to you said Adam
And you dont know the value I set on the very thought of you Dinah
That was what I meant yesterday when I said Id be content for you to go if you thought right
I meant the thought of you was worth so much to me I should feel I ought to be thankful and not grumble if you see right to go away
You know I do mind parting with you Dinah
Yes dear friend said Dinah trembling but trying to speak calmly I know you have a brothers heart towards me and we shall often be with one another in spirit but at this season I am in heaviness through manifold temptations
You must not mark me
I feel called to leave my kindred for a while but it is a trial the flesh is weak
Adam saw that it pained her to be obliged to answer
I hurt you by talking about it Dinah he said
Ill say no more
Lets see if Seths ready with breakfast now
That is a simple scene reader
But it is almost certain that you too have been in loveperhaps even more than once though you may not choose to say so to all your feminine friends
If so you will no more think the slight words the timid looks the tremulous touches by which two human souls approach each other gradually like two little quivering rainstreams before they mingle into oneyou will no more think these things trivial than you will think the firstdetected signs of coming spring trivial though they be but a faint indescribable something in the air and in the song of the birds and the tiniest perceptible budding on the hedgerow branches
Those slight words and looks and touches are part of the souls language and the finest language I believe is chiefly made up of unimposing words such as light sound stars musicwords really not worth looking at or hearing in themselves any more than chips or sawdust
It is only that they happen to be the signs of something unspeakably great and beautiful
I am of opinion that love is a great and beautiful thing too and if you agree with me the smallest signs of it will not be chips and sawdust to you they will rather be like those little wordslight and music stirring the long winding fibres of your memory and enriching your present with your most precious past
Chapter LI Sunday Morning LISBETHS touch of rheumatism could not be made to appear serious enough to detain Dinah another night from the Hall Farm now she had made up her mind to leave her aunt so soon and at evening the friends must part
For a long while Dinah had said for she had told Lisbeth of her resolve
Then itll be for all my life an I shall neer see thee again said Lisbeth
Long while
In got no long while t live
An I shall be took bad an die an thee canst neer come anigh me an I shall die alonging for thee
That had been the keynote of her wailing talk all day for Adam was not in the house and so she put no restraint on her complaining
She had tried poor Dinah by returning again and again to the question why she must go away and refusing to accept reasons which seemed to her nothing but whim and contrairiness and still more by regretting that she couldna ha one o the lads and be her daughter
Thee couldstna put up wi Seth she said
He isna cliver enough for thee happen but hed ha been very good t theehes as handy as can be at doin things for me when Im bad an hes as fond o the Bible an chappellin as thee art thysen
But happen theedst like a husband better as isna just the cut o thysen the runnin brook isna athirst for th rain
Adam ud ha done for theeI know he wouldan he might come t like thee well enough if theedst stop
But hes as stubborn as th iron bartheres no bending him no way buts own
But hed be a fine husband for anybody be they who they will so lookedon an so cliver as he is
And hed be rare an lovin it does me good ony a look o the lads eye when he means kind towrt me
Dinah tried to escape from Lisbeths closest looks and questions by finding little tasks of housework that kept her moving about and as soon as Seth came home in the evening she put on her bonnet to go
It touched Dinah keenly to say the last goodbye and still more to look round on her way across the fields and see the old woman still standing at the door gazing after her till she must have been the faintest speck in the dim aged eyes
The God of love and peace be with them Dinah prayed as she looked back from the last stile
Make them glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted them and the years wherein they have seen evil
It is thy will that I should part from them let me have no will but thine
Lisbeth turned into the house at last and sat down in the workshop near Seth who was busying himself there with fitting some bits of turned wood he had brought from the village into a small workbox which he meant to give to Dinah before she went away
Theet see her again o Sunday afore she goes were her first words
If thee wast good for anything theedst make her come in again o Sunday night wi thee and see me once more
Nay Mother said Seth
Dinah ud be sure to come again if she saw right to come
I should have no need to persuade her
She only thinks it ud be troubling thee for nought just to come in to say goodbye over again
Shed neer go away I know if Adam ud be fond on her an marry her but everythings so contrairy said Lisbeth with a burst of vexation
Seth paused a moment and looked up with a slight blush at his mothers face
What
Has she said anything o that sort to thee Mother
he said in a lower tone
Said
Nay shell say nothin
Its ony the men as have to wait till folks say things afore they find em out
Well but what makes thee think so Mother
Whats put it into thy head
Its no matter whats put it into my head
My heads none so hollow as it must get in an nought to put it there
I know shes fond on him as I know th winds comin in at the door an thats anoof
An he might be willin to marry her if he knowd shes fond on him but hell neer think ont if somebody doesna put it intos head
His mothers suggestion about Dinahs feeling towards Adam was not quite a new thought to Seth but her last words alarmed him lest she should herself undertake to open Adams eyes
He was not sure about Dinahs feeling and he thought he was sure about Adams
Nay Mother nay he said earnestly thee mustna think o speaking o such things to Adam
Theest no right to say what Dinahs feelings are if she hasna told thee and it ud do nothing but mischief to say such things to Adam
He feels very grateful and affectionate toward Dinah but hes no thoughts towards her that ud incline him to make her his wife and I dont believe Dinah ud marry him either
I dont think shell marry at all
Eh said Lisbeth impatiently
Thee thinkst so cause she wouldna ha thee
Shell neer marry thee thee mightst as well like her t ha thy brother
Seth was hurt
Mother he said in a remonstrating tone dont think that of me
I should be as thankful t have her for a sister as thee wouldst t have her for a daughter
Ive no more thoughts about myself in that thing and I shall take it hard if ever thee sayst it again
Well well then thee shouldstna cross me wi sayin things arena as I say they are
But Mother said Seth theedst be doing Dinah a wrong by telling Adam what thee thinkst about her
It ud do nothing but mischief for it ud make Adam uneasy if he doesna feel the same to her
And Im pretty sure he feels nothing o the sort
Eh donna tell me what theet sure on thee knowst nought about it
Whats he allays goin to the Poysers for if he didna want t see her
He goes twice where he used t go once
Happen he knowsna as he wants t see her he knowsna as I put salt ins broth but hed miss it pretty quick if it warna there
Hell neer think o marrying if it isna put intos head an if theedst any love for thy mother theedst put him up tot an not let her go away out o my sight when I might ha her to make a bit o comfort for me afore I go to bed to my old man under the white thorn
Nay Mother said Seth thee mustna think me unkind but I should be going against my conscience if I took upon me to say what Dinahs feelings are
And besides that I think I should give offence to Adam by speaking to him at all about marrying and I counsel thee not to dot
Thee mayst be quite deceived about Dinah
Nay Im pretty sure by words she said to me last Sabbath as shes no mind to marry
Eh theet as contrairy as the rest on em
If it war summat I didna want it ud be done fast enough
Lisbeth rose from the bench at this and went out of the workshop leaving Seth in much anxiety lest she should disturb Adams mind about Dinah
He consoled himself after a time with reflecting that since Adams trouble Lisbeth had been very timid about speaking to him on matters of feeling and that she would hardly dare to approach this tenderest of all subjects
Even if she did he hoped Adam would not take much notice of what she said
Seth was right in believing that Lisbeth would be held in restraint by timidity and during the next three days the intervals in which she had an opportunity of speaking to Adam were too rare and short to cause her any strong temptation
But in her long solitary hours she brooded over her regretful thoughts about Dinah till they had grown very near that point of unmanageable strength when thoughts are apt to take wing out of their secret nest in a startling manner
And on Sunday morning when Seth went away to chapel at Treddleston the dangerous opportunity came
Sunday morning was the happiest time in all the week to Lisbeth for as there was no service at Hayslope church till the afternoon Adam was always at home doing nothing but reading an occupation in which she could venture to interrupt him
Moreover she had always a better dinner than usual to prepare for her sonsvery frequently for Adam and herself alone Seth being often away the entire dayand the smell of the roast meat before the clear fire in the clean kitchen the clock ticking in a peaceful Sunday manner her darling Adam seated near her in his best clothes doing nothing very important so that she could go and stroke her hand across his hair if she liked and see him look up at her and smile while Gyp rather jealous poked his muzzle up between themall these things made poor Lisbeths earthly paradise
The book Adam most often read on a Sunday morning was his large pictured Bible and this morning it lay open before him on the round white deal table in the kitchen for he sat there in spite of the fire because he knew his mother liked to have him with her and it was the only day in the week when he could indulge her in that way
You would have liked to see Adam reading his Bible
He never opened it on a weekday and so he came to it as a holiday book serving him for history biography and poetry
He held one hand thrust between his waistcoat buttons and the other ready to turn the pages and in the course of the morning you would have seen many changes in his face
Sometimes his lips moved in semi articulationit was when he came to a speech that he could fancy himself uttering such as Samuels dying speech to the people then his eyebrows would be raised and the corners of his mouth would quiver a little with sad sympathysomething perhaps old Isaacs meeting with his son touched him closely at other times over the New Testament a very solemn look would come upon his face and he would every now and then shake his head in serious assent or just lift up his hand and let it fall again
And on some mornings when he read in the Apocrypha of which he was very fond the son of Sirachs keenedged words would bring a delighted smile though he also enjoyed the freedom of occasionally differing from an Apocryphal writer
For Adam knew the Articles quite well as became a good churchman
Lisbeth in the pauses of attending to her dinner always sat opposite to him and watched him till she could rest no longer without going up to him and giving him a caress to call his attention to her
This morning he was reading the Gospel according to St Matthew and Lisbeth had been standing close by him for some minutes stroking his hair which was smoother than usual this morning and looking down at the large page with silent wonderment at the mystery of letters
She was encouraged to continue this caress because when she first went up to him he had thrown himself back in his chair to look at her affectionately and say Why Mother thee lookst rare and hearty this morning
Eh Gyp wants me t look at him
He cant abide to think I love thee the best
Lisbeth said nothing because she wanted to say so many things
And now there was a new leaf to be turned over and it was a picturethat of the angel seated on the great stone that has been rolled away from the sepulchre
This picture had one strong association in Lisbeths memory for she had been reminded of it when she first saw Dinah and Adam had no sooner turned the page and lifted the book sideways that they might look at the angel than she said Thats herthats Dinah
Adam smiled and looking more intently at the angels face said It is a bit like her but Dinahs prettier I think
Well then if thee thinkst her so pretty why arnt fond on her
Adam looked up in surprise
Why Mother dost think I dont set store by Dinah
Nay said Lisbeth frightened at her own courage yet feeling that she had broken the ice and the waters must flow whatever mischief they might do
Whats th use o settin store by things as are thirty mile off
If thee wast fond enough on her thee wouldstna let her go away
But Ive no right t hinder her if she thinks well said Adam looking at his book as if he wanted to go on reading
He foresaw a series of complaints tending to nothing
Lisbeth sat down again in the chair opposite to him as she said But she wouldna think well if thee wastna so contrairy
Lisbeth dared not venture beyond a vague phrase yet
Contrairy mother
Adam said looking up again in some anxiety
What have I done
What dost mean
Why theet never look at nothin nor think o nothin but thy figurin an thy work said Lisbeth halfcrying
An dost think thee canst go on so all thy life as if thee wast a man cut out o timber
An what wut do when thy mothers gone an nobody to take care on thee as thee gettst a bit o victual comfortable i the mornin
What hast got i thy mind Mother
said Adam vexed at this whimpering
I canna see what theet driving at
Is there anything I could do for thee as I dont do
Aye an that there is
Thee mightst do as I should ha somebody wi me to comfort me a bit an wait on me when Im bad an be good to me
Well Mother whose fault is it there isna some tidy body i th house t help thee
It isna by my wish as thee hast a stroke o work to do
We can afford itIve told thee often enough
It ud be a deal better for us
Eh whats the use o talking o tidy bodies when thee meanst one o th wenches out o th village or somebody from Treddleson as I neer set eyes on i my life
Id sooner make a shift an get into my own coffln afore I die nor ha them folks to put me in
Adam was silent and tried to go on reading
That was the utmost severity he could show towards his mother on a Sunday morning
But Lisbeth had gone too far now to check herself and after scarcely a minutes quietness she began again
Thee mightst know well enough who tis Id like t ha wi me
It isna many folks I send for t come an see me
I reckon
An theest had the fetchin on her times enow
Thee meanst Dinah Mother I know said Adam
But its no use setting thy mind on what cant be
If Dinah ud be willing to stay at Hayslope it isnt likely she can come away from her aunts house where they hold her like a daughter and where shes more bound than she is to us
If it had been so that she could ha married Seth that ud ha been a great blessing to us but we cant have things just as we like in this life
Thee must try and make up thy mind to do without her
Nay but I canna ma up my mind when shes just cut out for thee an nought shall ma me believe as God didna make her an send her there o purpose for thee
Whats it sinnify about her bein a Methody
It ud happen wear out on her wi marryin
Adam threw himself back in his chair and looked at his mother
He understood now what she had been aiming at from the beginning of the conversation
It was as unreasonable impracticable a wish as she had ever urged but he could not help being moved by so entirely new an idea
The chief point however was to chase away the notion from his mothers mind as quickly as possible
Mother he said gravely theet talking wild
Dont let me hear thee say such things again
Its no good talking o what can never be
Dinahs not for marrying shes fixed her heart on a different sort o life
Very like said Lisbeth impatiently very like shes none for marring when them as shed be willin t marry wonna ax her
I shouldna ha been for marring thy feyther if hed neer axed me an shes as fond o thee as eer I war o Thias poor fellow
The blood rushed to Adams face and for a few moments he was not quite conscious where he was
His mother and the kitchen had vanished for him and he saw nothing but Dinahs face turned up towards his
It seemed as if there were a resurrection of his dead joy
But he woke up very speedily from that dream the waking was chill and sad for it would have been very foolish in him to believe his mothers wordsshe could have no ground for them
He was prompted to express his disbelief very strongly perhaps that he might call forth the proofs if there were any to be offered
What dost say such things for Mother when theest got no foundation for em
Thee knowst nothing as gives thee a right to say that
Then I knowna nought as gies me a right to say as the years turned for all I feel it fust thing when I get up i th morning
She isna fond o Seth I reckon is she
She doesna want to marry HIM
But I can see as she doesna behave towrt thee as she daes towrt Seth
She makes no more o Seths coming anigh her nor if he war Gyp but shes all of a tremble when theet asittin down by her at breakfast an alooking at her
Thee thinkst thy mother knows nought but she war alive afore thee wast born
But thee canstna be sure as the trembling means love
said Adam anxiously
Eh what else should it mane
It isna hate I reckon
An what should she do but love thee
Theet made to be lovedfor wheres there a straighter cliverer man
An whats it sinnify her bein a Methody
Its ony the marigold i th parridge
Adam had thrust his hands in his pockets and was looking down at the book on the table without seeing any of the letters
He was trembling like a goldseeker who sees the strong promise of gold but sees in the same moment a sickening vision of disappointment
He could not trust his mothers insight she had seen what she wished to see
And yetand yet now the suggestion had been made to him he remembered so many things very slight things like the stirring of the water by an imperceptible breeze which seemed to him some confirmation of his mothers words
Lisbeth noticed that he was moved
She went on An theet find out as theet poorly aff when shes gone
Theet fonder on her nor thee knowst
Thy eyes follow her about welly as Gyps follow thee
Adam could sit still no longer
He rose took down his hat and went out into the fields
The sunshine was on them that early autumn sunshine which we should know was not summers even if there were not the touches of yellow on the lime and chestnut the Sunday sunshine too which has more than autumnal calmness for the working man the morning sunshine which still leaves the dewcrystals on the fine gossamer webs in the shadow of the bushy hedgerows
Adam needed the calm influence he was amazed at the way in which this new thought of Dinahs love had taken possession of him with an overmastering power that made all other feelings give way before the impetuous desire to know that the thought was true
Strange that till that moment the possibility of their ever being lovers had never crossed his mind and yet now all his longing suddenly went out towards that possibility
He had no more doubt or hesitation as to his own wishes than the bird that flies towards the opening through which the daylight gleams and the breath of heaven enters
The autumnal Sunday sunshine soothed him but not by preparing him with resignation to the disappointment if his motherif he himselfproved to be mistaken about Dinah
It soothed him by gentle encouragement of his hopes
Her love was so like that calm sunshine that they seemed to make one presence to him and he believed in them both alike
And Dinah was so bound up with the sad memories of his first passion that he was not forsaking them but rather giving them a new sacredness by loving her
Nay his love for her had grown out of that past it was the noon of that morning
But Seth
Would the lad be hurt
Hardly for he had seemed quite contented of late and there was no selfish jealousy in him he had never been jealous of his mothers fondness for Adam
But had he seen anything of what their mother talked about
Adam longed to know this for he thought he could trust Seths observation better than his mothers
He must talk to Seth before he went to see Dinah and with this intention in his mind he walked back to the cottage and said to his mother Did Seth say anything to thee about when he was coming home
Will he be back to dinner
Aye lad hell be back for a wonder
He isna gone to Treddleson
Hes gone somewhere else apreachin and aprayin
Hast any notion which way hes gone
said Adam
Nay but he aften goes to th Common
Thee knowst more os goings nor I do
Adam wanted to go and meet Seth but he must content himself with walking about the near fields and getting sight of him as soon as possible
That would not be for more than an hour to come for Seth would scarcely be at home much before their dinnertime which was twelve oclock
But Adam could not sit down to his reading again and he sauntered along by the brook and stood leaning against the stiles with eager intense eyes which looked as if they saw something very vividly but it was not the brook or the willows not the fields or the sky
Again and again his vision was interrupted by wonder at the strength of his own feeling at the strength and sweetness of this new lovealmost like the wonder a man feels at the added power he finds in himself for an art which he had laid aside for a space
How is it that the poets have said so many fine things about our first love so few about our later love
Are their first poems their best
Or are not those the best which come from their fuller thought their larger experience their deeperrooted affections
The boys flutelike voice has its own spring charm but the man should yield a richer deeper music
At last there was Seth visible at the farthest stile and Adam hastened to meet him
Seth was surprised and thought something unusual must have happened but when Adam came up his face said plainly enough that it was nothing alarming
Where hast been
said Adam when they were side by side
Ive been to the Common said Seth
Dinahs been speaking the Word to a little company of hearers at Brimstones as they call him
Theyre folks as never go to church hardlythem on the Commonbut theyll go and hear Dinah a bit
Shes been speaking with power this forenoon from the words I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
And there was a little thing happened as was pretty to see
The women mostly bring their children with em but today there was one stout curly headed fellow about three or four year old that I never saw there before
He was as naughty as could be at the beginning while I was praying and while we was singing but when we all sat down and Dinah began to speak th young un stood stock still all at once and began to look at her withs mouth open and presently he ran away froms mother and went to Dinah and pulled at her like a little dog for her to take notice of him
So Dinah lifted him up and held th lad on her lap while she went on speaking and he was as good as could be till he went to sleepand the mother cried to see him
Its a pity she shouldna be a mother herself said Adam so fond as the children are of her
Dost think shes quite fixed against marrying Seth
Dost think nothing ud turn her
There was something peculiar in his brothers tone which made Seth steal a glance at his face before he answered
It ud be wrong of me to say nothing ud turn her he answered
But if thee meanst it about myself Ive given up all thoughts as she can ever be my wife
She calls me her brother and thats enough
But dost think she might ever get fond enough of anybody else to be willing to marry em
said Adam rather shyly
Well said Seth after some hesitation its crossed my mind sometimes o late as she might but Dinah ud let no fondness for the creature draw her out o the path as she believed God had marked out for her
If she thought the leading was not from Him shes not one to be brought under the power of it
And shes allays seemed clear about thatas her work was to minister t others and make no home for herself i this world
But suppose said Adam earnestly suppose there was a man as ud let her do just the same and not interfere with hershe might do a good deal o what she does now just as well when she was married as when she was single
Other women of her sort have marriedthats to say not just like her but women as preached and attended on the sick and needy
Theres Mrs Fletcher as she talks of
A new light had broken in on Seth
He turned round and laying his hand on Adams shoulder said Why wouldst like her to marry THEE Brother
Adam looked doubtfully at Seths inquiring eyes and said Wouldst be hurt if she was to be fonder o me than o thee
Nay said Seth warmly how canst think it
Have I felt thy trouble so little that I shouldna feel thy joy
There was silence a few moments as they walked on and then Seth said Id no notion as theedst ever think of her for a wife
But is it o any use to think of her
said Adam
What dost say
Mothers made me as I hardly know where I am with what shes been saying to me this forenoon
She says shes sure Dinah feels for me more than common and ud be willing t have me
But Im afraid she speaks without book
I want to know if theest seen anything
Its a nice point to speak about said Seth and Im afraid o being wrong besides weve no right t intermeddle with peoples feelings when they wouldnt tell em themselves
Seth paused
But thee mightst ask her he said presently
She took no offence at me for asking and theest more right than I had only theet not in the Society
But Dinah doesnt hold wi them as are for keeping the Society so strict to themselves
She doesnt mind about making folks enter the Society so as theyre fit t enter the kingdom o God
Some o the brethren at Treddleson are displeased with her for that
Where will she be the rest o the day
said Adam
She said she shouldnt leave the farm again today said Seth because its her last Sabbath there and shes going t read out o the big Bible wi the children
Adam thoughtbut did not sayThen Ill go this afternoon for if I go to church my thoughts ull be with her all the while
They must sing th anthem without me today
Chapter LII Adam and Dinah IT was about three oclock when Adam entered the farmyard and roused Alick and the dogs from their Sunday dozing
Alick said everybody was gone to church but th young mississo he called Dinahbut this did not disappoint Adam although the everybody was so liberal as to include Nancy the dairymaid whose works of necessity were not unfrequently incompatible with churchgoing
There was perfect stillness about the house
The doors were all closed and the very stones and tubs seemed quieter than usual
Adam heard the water gently dripping from the pumpthat was the only soundand he knocked at the house door rather softly as was suitable in that stillness
The door opened and Dinah stood before him colouring deeply with the great surprise of seeing Adam at this hour when she knew it was his regular practice to be at church
Yesterday he would have said to her without any difficulty I came to see you Dinah I knew the rest were not at home
But today something prevented him from saying that and he put out his hand to her in silence
Neither of them spoke and yet both wished they could speak as Adam entered and they sat down
Dinah took the chair she had just left it was at the corner of the table near the window and there was a book lying on the table but it was not open
She had been sitting perfectly still looking at the small bit of clear fire in the bright grate
Adam sat down opposite her in Mr Poysers threecornered chair
Your mother is not ill again I hope Adam
Dinah said recovering herself
Seth said she was well this morning
No shes very hearty today said Adam happy in the signs of Dinahs feeling at the sight of him but shy
Theres nobody at home you see Dinah said but youll wait
Youve been hindered from going to church today doubtless
Yes Adam said and then paused before he added I was thinking about you that was the reason
This confession was very awkward and sudden Adam felt for he thought Dinah must understand all he meant
But the frankness of the words caused her immediately to interpret them into a renewal of his brotherly regrets that she was going away and she answered calmly Do not be careful and troubled for me Adam
I have all things and abound at Snowfield
And my mind is at rest for I am not seeking my own will in going
But if things were different Dinah said Adam hesitatingly
If you knew things that perhaps you dont know now Dinah looked at him inquiringly but instead of going on he reached a chair and brought it near the corner of the table where she was sitting
She wondered and was afraidand the next moment her thoughts flew to the past was it something about those distant unhappy ones that she didnt know
Adam looked at her
It was so sweet to look at her eyes which had now a selfforgetful questioning in themfor a moment he forgot that he wanted to say anything or that it was necessary to tell her what he meant
Dinah he said suddenly taking both her hands between his I love you with my whole heart and soul
I love you next to God who made me
Dinahs lips became pale like her cheeks and she trembled violently under the shock of painful joy
Her hands were cold as death between Adams
She could not draw them away because he held them fast
Dont tell me you cant love me Dinah
Dont tell me we must part and pass our lives away from one another
The tears were trembling in Dinahs eyes and they fell before she could answer
But she spoke in a quiet low voice
Yes dear Adam we must submit to another Will
We must part
Not if you love me Dinahnot if you love me Adam said passionately
Tell metell me if you can love me better than a brother
Dinah was too entirely reliant on the Supreme guidance to attempt to achieve any end by a deceptive concealment
She was recovering now from the first shock of emotion and she looked at Adam with simple sincere eyes as she said Yes Adam my heart is drawn strongly towards you and of my own will if I had no clear showing to the contrary I could find my happiness in being near you and ministering to you continually
I fear I should forget to rejoice and weep with others nay I fear I should forget the Divine presence and seek no love but yours
Adam did not speak immediately
They sat looking at each other in delicious silencefor the first sense of mutual love excludes other feelings it will have the soul all to itself
Then Dinah Adam said at last how can there be anything contrary to whats right in our belonging to one another and spending our lives together
Who put this great love into our hearts
Can anything be holier than that
For we can help one another in everything as is good
Id never think o putting myself between you and God and saying you oughtnt to do this and you oughtnt to do that
Youd follow your conscience as much as you do now
Yes Adam Dinah said I know marriage is a holy state for those who are truly called to it and have no other drawing but from my chilhood upwards I have been led towards another path all my peace and my joy have come from having no life of my own no wants no wishes for myself and living only in God and those of his creatures whose sorrows and joys he has given me to know
Those have been very blessed years to me and I feel that if I was to listen to any voice that would draw me aside from that path I should be turning my back on the light that has shone upon me and darkness and doubt would take hold of me
We could not bless each other Adam if there were doubts in my soul and if I yearned when it was too late after that better part which had once been given me and I had put away from me
But if a new feeling has come into your mind Dinah and if you love me so as to be willing to be nearer to me than to other people isnt that a sign that its right for you to change your life
Doesnt the love make it right when nothing else would
Adam my mind is full of questionings about that for now since you tell me of your strong love towards me what was clear to me has become dark again
I felt before that my heart was too strongly drawn towards you and that your heart was not as mine and the thought of you had taken hold of me so that my soul had lost its freedom and was becoming enslaved to an earthly affection which made me anxious and careful about what should befall myself
For in all other affection I had been content with any small return or with none but my heart was beginning to hunger after an equal love from you
And I had no doubt that I must wrestle against that as a great temptation and the command was clear that I must go away
But now dear dear Dinah now you know I love you better than you love meits all different now
You wont think o going
Youll stay and be my dear wife and I shall thank God for giving me my life as I never thanked him before
Adam its hard to me to turn a deaf earyou know its hard but a great fear is upon me
It seems to me as if you were stretching out your arms to me and beckoning me to come and take my ease and live for my own delight and Jesus the Man of Sorrows was standing looking towards me and pointing to the sinful and suffering and afflicted
I have seen that again and again when I have been sitting in stillness and darkness and a great terror has come upon me lest I should become hard and a lover of self and no more bear willingly the Redeemers cross
Dinah had closed her eyes and a faint shudder went through her
Adam she went on you wouldnt desire that we should seek a good through any unfaithfulness to the light that is in us you wouldnt believe that could be a good
We are of one mind in that
Yes Dinah said Adam sadly Ill never be the man t urge you against your conscience
But I cant give up the hope that you may come to see different
I dont believe your loving me could shut up your heartits only adding to what youve been before not taking away from it
For it seems to me its the same with love and happiness as with sorrowthe more we know of it the better we can feel what other peoples lives are or might be and so we shall only be more tender to em and wishful to help em
The more knowledge a man has the better hell dos work and feelings a sort o knowledge
Dinah was silent her eyes were fixed in contemplation of something visible only to herself
Adam went on presently with his pleading And you can do almost as much as you do now
I wont ask you to go to church with me of a Sunday
You shall go where you like among the people and teach em for though I like church best I dont put my soul above yours as if my words was better for you to follow than your own conscience
And you can help the sick just as much and youll have more means o making em a bit comfortable and youll be among all your own friends as love you and can help em and be a blessing to em till their dying day
Surely Dinah youd be as near to God as if you was living lonely and away from me
Dinah made no answer for some time
Adam was still holding her hands and looking at her with almost trembling anxiety when she turned her grave loving eyes on his and said in rather a sad voice Adam there is truth in what you say and theres many of the brethren and sisters who have greater strength than I have and find their hearts enlarged by the cares of husband and kindred
But I have not faith that it would be so with me for since my affections have been set above measure on you I have had less peace and joy in God
I have felt as it were a division in my heart
And think how it is with me Adam
That life I have led is like a land I have trodden in blessedness since my childhood and if I long for a moment to follow the voice which calls me to another land that I know not I cannot but fear that my soul might hereafter yearn for that early blessedness which I had forsaken and where doubt enters there is not perfect love
I must wait for clearer guidance
I must go from you and we must submit ourselves entirely to the Divine Will
We are sometimes required to lay our natural lawful affections on the altar
Adam dared not plead again for Dinahs was not the voice of caprice or insincerity
But it was very hard for him his eyes got dim as he looked at her
But you may come to feel satisfiedto feel that you may come to me again and we may never part Dinah
We must submit ourselves Adam
With time our duty will be made clear
It may be when I have entered on my former life I shall find all these new thoughts and wishes vanish and become as things that were not
Then I shall know that my calling is not towards marriage
But we must wait
Dinah said Adam mournfully you cant love me so well as I love you else youd have no doubts
But its natural you shouldnt for Im not so good as you
I cant doubt its right for me to love the best thing Gods ever given me to know
Nay Adam
It seems to me that my love for you is not weak for my heart waits on your words and looks almost as a little child waits on the help and tenderness of the strong on whom it depends
If the thought of you took slight hold of me I should not fear that it would be an idol in the temple
But you will strengthen meyou will not hinder me in seeking to obey to the uttermost
Let us go out into the sunshine Dinah and walk together
Ill speak no word to disturb you
They went out and walked towards the fields where they would meet the family coming from church
Adam said Take my arm Dinah and she took it
That was the only change in their manner to each other since they were last walking together
But no sadness in the prospect of her going awayin the uncertainty of the issue could rob the sweetness from Adams sense that Dinah loved him
He thought he would stay at the Hall Farm all that evening
He would be near her as long as he could
Heyday
Theres Adam along wi Dinah said Mr Poyser as he opened the far gate into the Home Close
I couldna think how he happened away from church
Why added good Martin after a moments pause what dost think has just jumped into my head
Summat as hadna far to jump for its just under our nose
You mean as Adams fond o Dinah
Aye
hast ever had any notion of it before
To be sure I have said Mrs Poyser who always declined if possible to be taken by surprise
Im not one o those as can see the cat i the dairy an wonder what shes come after
Thee never saidst a word to me about it
Well I arent like a birdclapper forced to make a rattle when the wind blows on me
I can keep my own counsel when theres no good i speaking
But Dinah ll ha none o him
Dost think she will
Nay said Mrs Poyser not sufficiently on her guard against a possible surprise shell never marry anybody if he isnt a Methodist and a cripple
It ud ha been a pretty thing though for em t marry said Martin turning his head on one side as if in pleased contemplation of his new idea
Theedst ha liked it too wouldstna
Ah
I should
I should ha been sure of her then as she wouldnt go away from me to Snowfield welly thirty mile off and me not got a creatur to look to only neighbours as are no kin to me an most of em women as Id be ashamed to show my face if my dairy things war like theirn
There may well be streaky butter i the market
An I should be glad to see the poor thing settled like a Christian woman with a house of her own over her head and wed stock her well wi linen and feathers for I love her next to my own children
An she makes one feel safer when shes i the house for shes like the driven snow anybody might sin for two as had her at their elbow
Dinah said Tommy running forward to meet her mother says youll never marry anybody but a Methodist cripple
What a silly you must be
a comment which Tommy followed up by seizing Dinah with both arms and dancing along by her side with incommodious fondness
Why Adam we missed you i the singing today said Mr Poyser
How was it
I wanted to see Dinahshes going away so soon said Adam
Ah lad
Can you persuade her to stop somehow
Find her a good husband somewhere i the parish
If youll do that well forgive you for missing church
But anyway she isna going before the harvest supper o Wednesday and you must come then
Theres Bartle Massey comin an happen Craig
Youll be sure an come now at seven
The missis wunna have it a bit later
Aye said Adam Ill come if I can
But I cant often say what Ill do beforehand for the work often holds me longer than I expect
Youll stay till the end o the week Dinah
Yes yes
said Mr Poyser
Well have no nay
Shes no call to be in a hurry observed Mrs Poyser
Scarceness o victual ull keep theres no need to be hasty wi the cooking
An scarceness is what theres the biggest stock of i that country
Dinah smiled but gave no promise to stay and they talked of other things through the rest of the walk lingering in the sunshine to look at the great flock of geese grazing at the new cornricks and at the surprising abundance of fruit on the old peartree Nancy and Molly having already hastened home side by side each holding carefully wrapped in her pockethandkerchief a prayerbook in which she could read little beyond the large letters and the Amens
Surely all other leisure is hurry compared with a sunny walk through the fields from afternoon churchas such walks used to be in those old leisurely times when the boat gliding sleepily along the canal was the newest locomotive wonder when Sunday books had most of them old brownleather covers and opened with remarkable precision always in one place
Leisure is gonegone where the spinningwheels are gone and the packhorses and the slow waggons and the pedlars who brought bargains to the door on sunny afternoons
Ingenious philosophers tell you perhaps that the great work of the steamengine is to create leisure for mankind
Do not believe them it only creates a vacuum for eager thought to rush in
Even idleness is eager noweager for amusement prone to excursiontrains art museums periodical literature and exciting novels prone even to scientific theorizing and cursory peeps through microscopes
Old Leisure was quite a different personage
He only read one newspaper innocent of leaders and was free from that periodicity of sensations which we call posttime
He was a contemplative rather stout gentleman of excellent digestion of quiet perceptions undiseased by hypothesis happy in his inability to know the causes of things preferring the things themselves
He lived chiefly in the country among pleasant seats and homesteads and was fond of sauntering by the fruittree wall and scenting the apricots when they were warmed by the morning sunshine or of sheltering himself under the orchard boughs at noon when the summer pears were falling
He knew nothing of weekday services and thought none the worse of the Sunday sermon if it allowed him to sleep from the text to the blessing liking the afternoon service best because the prayers were the shortest and not ashamed to say so for he had an easy jolly conscience broad backed like himself and able to carry a great deal of beer or portwine not being made squeamish by doubts and qualms and lofty aspirations
Life was not a task to him but a sinecure
He fingered the guineas in his pocket and ate his dinners and slept the sleep of the irresponsible for had he not kept up his character by going to church on the Sunday afternoons
Fine old Leisure
Do not be severe upon him and judge him by our modern standard
He never went to Exeter Hall or heard a popular preacher or read Tracts for the Times or Sartor Resartus
Chapter LIII The Harvest Supper As Adam was going homeward on Wednesday evening in the six oclock sunlight he saw in the distance the last load of barley winding its way towards the yardgate of the Hall Farm and heard the chant of Harvest Home
rising and sinking like a wave
Fainter and fainter and more musical through the growing distance the falling dying sound still reached him as he neared the Willow Brook
The low westering sun shone right on the shoulders of the old Binton Hills turning the unconscious sheep into bright spots of light shone on the windows of the cottage too and made them aflame with a glory beyond that of amber or amethyst
It was enough to make Adam feel that he was in a great temple and that the distant chant was a sacred song
Its wonderful he thought how that sound goes to ones heart almost like a funeral bell for all it tells one o the joyfullest time o the year and the time when men are mostly the thankfullest
I suppose its a bit hard to us to think anythings over and gone in our lives and theres a parting at the root of all our joys
Its like what I feel about Dinah
I should never ha come to know that her love ud be the greatest o blessings to me if what I counted a blessing hadnt been wrenched and torn away from me and left me with a greater need so as I could crave and hunger for a greater and a better comfort
He expected to see Dinah again this evening and get leave to accompany her as far as Oakbourne and then he would ask her to fix some time when he might go to Snowfield and learn whether the last best hope that had been born to him must be resigned like the rest
The work he had to do at home besides putting on his best clothes made it seven before he was on his way again to the Hall Farm and it was questionable whether with his longest and quickest strides he should be there in time even for the roast beef which came after the plum pudding for Mrs Poysers supper would be punctual
Great was the clatter of knives and pewter plates and tin cans when Adam entered the house but there was no hum of voices to this accompaniment the eating of excellent roast beef provided free of expense was too serious a business to those good farm labourers to be performed with a divided attention even if they had had anything to say to each otherwhich they had not
And Mr Poyser at the head of the table was too busy with his carving to listen to Bartle Masseys or Mr Craigs ready talk
Here Adam said Mrs Poyser who was standing and looking on to see that Molly and Nancy did their duty as waiters heres a place kept for you between Mr Massey and the boys
Its a poor tale you couldnt come to see the pudding when it was whole
Adam looked anxiously round for a fourth womans figure but Dinah was not there
He was almost afraid of asking about her besides his attention was claimed by greetings and there remained the hope that Dinah was in the house though perhaps disinclined to festivities on the eve of her departure
It was a goodly sightthat table with Martin Poysers round goodhumoured face and large person at the head of it helping his servants to the fragrant roast beef and pleased when the empty plates came again
Martin though usually blest with a good appetite really forgot to finish his own beef tonightit was so pleasant to him to look on in the intervals of carving and see how the others enjoyed their supper for were they not men who on all the days of the year except Christmas Day and Sundays ate their cold dinner in a makeshift manner under the hedgerows and drank their beer out of wooden bottleswith relish certainly but with their mouths towards the zenith after a fashion more endurable to ducks than to human bipeds
Martin Poyser had some faint conception of the flavour such men must find in hot roast beef and freshdrawn ale
He held his head on one side and screwed up his mouth as he nudged Bartle Massey and watched halfwitted Tom Tholer otherwise known as Tom Saft receiving his second plateful of beef
A grin of delight broke over Toms face as the plate was set down before him between his knife and fork which he held erect as if they had been sacred tapers
But the delight was too strong to continue smouldering in a grinit burst out the next instant in a longdrawn haw haw
followed by a sudden collapse into utter gravity as the knife and fork darted down on the prey
Martin Poysers large person shook with his silent unctuous laugh
He turned towards Mrs Poyser to see if she too had been observant of Tom and the eyes of husband and wife met in a glance of goodnatured amusement
Tom Saft was a great favourite on the farm where he played the part of the old jester and made up for his practical deficiencies by his success in repartee
His hits I imagine were those of the flail which falls quite at random but nevertheless smashes an insect now and then
They were much quoted at sheepshearing and haymaking times but I refrain from recording them here lest Toms wit should prove to be like that of many other bygone jesters eminent in their dayrather of a temporary nature not dealing with the deeper and more lasting relations of things
Tom excepted Martin Poyser had some pride in his servants and labourers thinking with satisfaction that they were the best worth their pay of any set on the estate
There was Kester Bale for example Beale probably if the truth were known but he was called Bale and was not conscious of any claim to a fifth letter the old man with the close leather cap and the network of wrinkles on his sunbrowned face
Was there any man in Loamshire who knew better the natur of all farming work
He was one of those invaluable labourers who can not only turn their hand to everything but excel in everything they turn their hand to
It is true Kesters knees were much bent outward by this time and he walked with a perpetual curtsy as if he were among the most reverent of men
And so he was but I am obliged to admit that the object of his reverence was his own skill towards which he performed some rather affecting acts of worship
He always thatched the ricksfor if anything were his forte more than another it was thatchingand when the last touch had been put to the last beehive rick Kester whose home lay at some distance from the farm would take a walk to the rickyard in his best clothes on a Sunday morning and stand in the lane at a due distance to contemplate his own thatching walking about to get each rick from the proper point of view
As he curtsied along with his eyes upturned to the straw knobs imitative of golden globes at the summits of the beehive ricks which indeed were gold of the best sort you might have imagined him to be engaged in some pagan act of adoration
Kester was an old bachelor and reputed to have stockings full of coin concerning which his master cracked a joke with him every paynight not a new unseasoned joke but a good old one that had been tried many times before and had worn well
Th young measters a merry mon Kester frequently remarked for having begun his career by frightening away the crows under the last Martin Poyser but one he could never cease to account the reigning Martin a young master
I am not ashamed of commemorating old Kester
You and I are indebted to the hard hands of such menhands that have long ago mingled with the soil they tilled so faithfully thriftily making the best they could of the earths fruits and receiving the smallest share as their own wages
Then at the end of the table opposite his master there was Alick the shepherd and headman with the ruddy face and broad shoulders not on the best terms with old Kester indeed their intercourse was confined to an occasional snarl for though they probably differed little concerning hedging and ditching and the treatment of ewes there was a profound difference of opinion between them as to their own respective merits
When Tityrus and Meliboeus happen to be on the same farm they are not sentimentally polite to each other
Alick indeed was not by any means a honeyed man
His speech had usually something of a snarl in it and his broadshouldered aspect something of the bulldog expressionDont you meddle with me and I wont meddle with you
But he was honest even to the splitting of an oatgrain rather than he would take beyond his acknowledged share and as closefisted with his masters property as if it had been his ownthrowing very small handfuls of damaged barley to the chickens because a large handful affected his imagination painfully with a sense of profusion
Goodtempered Tim the waggoner who loved his horses had his grudge against Alick in the matter of corn
They rarely spoke to each other and never looked at each other even over their dish of cold potatoes but then as this was their usual mode of behaviour towards all mankind it would be an unsafe conclusion that they had more than transient fits of unfriendliness
The bucolic character at Hayslope you perceive was not of that entirely genial merry broadgrinning sort apparently observed in most districts visited by artists
The mild radiance of a smile was a rare sight on a fieldlabourers face and there was seldom any gradation between bovine gravity and a laugh
Nor was every labourer so honest as our friend Alick
At this very table among Mr Poysers men there is that big Ben Tholoway a very powerful thresher but detected more than once in carrying away his masters corn in his pocketsan action which as Ben was not a philosopher could hardly be ascribed to absence of mind
However his master had forgiven him and continued to employ him for the Tholoways had lived on the Common time out of mind and had always worked for the Poysers
And on the whole I daresay society was not much the worse because Ben had not six months of it at the treadmill for his views of depredation were narrow and the House of Correction might have enlarged them
As it was Ben ate his roast beef tonight with a serene sense of having stolen nothing more than a few peas and beans as seed for his garden since the last harvest supper and felt warranted in thinking that Alicks suspicious eye for ever upon him was an injury to his innocence
But NOW the roast beef was finished and the cloth was drawn leaving a fair large deal table for the bright drinkingcans and the foaming brown jugs and the bright brass candlesticks pleasant to behold
NOW the great ceremony of the evening was to beginthe harvestsong in which every man must join
He might be in tune if he liked to be singular but he must not sit with closed lips
The movement was obliged to be in triple time the rest was ad libitum
As to the origin of this songwhether it came in its actual state from the brain of a single rhapsodist or was gradually perfected by a school or succession of rhapsodists I am ignorant
There is a stamp of unity of individual genius upon it which inclines me to the former hypothesis though I am not blind to the consideration that this unity may rather have arisen from that consensus of many minds which was a condition of primitive thought foreign to our modern consciousness
Some will perhaps think that they detect in the first quatrain an indication of a lost line which later rhapsodists failing in imaginative vigour have supplied by the feeble device of iteration
Others however may rather maintain that this very iteration is an original felicity to which none but the most prosaic minds can be insensible
The ceremony connected with the song was a drinking ceremony
That is perhaps a painful fact but then you know we cannot reform our forefathers
During the first and second quatrain sung decidedly forte no can was filled
Heres a health unto our master The founder of the feast Heres a health unto our master And to our mistress
And may his doings prosper Whateer he takes in hand For we are all his servants And are at his command
But now immediately before the third quatrain or chorus sung fortissimo with emphatic raps of the table which gave the effect of cymbals and drum together Alicks can was filled and he was bound to empty it before the chorus ceased
Then drink boys drink
And see ye do not spill For if ye do ye shall drink two For tis our masters will
When Alick had gone successfully through this test of steady handed manliness it was the turn of old Kester at his right handand so on till every man had drunk his initiatory pint under the stimulus of the chorus
Tom Saftthe roguetook care to spill a little by accident but Mrs Poyser too officiously Tom thought interfered to prevent the exaction of the penalty
To any listener outside the door it would have been the reverse of obvious why the Drink boys drink
should have such an immediate and oftenrepeated encore but once entered he would have seen that all faces were at present sober and most of them seriousit was the regular and respectable thing for those excellent farmlabourers to do as much as for elegant ladies and gentlemen to smirk and bow over their wineglasses
Bartle Massey whose ears were rather sensitive had gone out to see what sort of evening it was at an early stage in the ceremony and had not finished his contemplation until a silence of five minutes declared that Drink boys drink
was not likely to begin again for the next twelvemonth
Much to the regret of the boys and Totty on them the stillness fell rather flat after that glorious thumping of the table towards which Totty seated on her fathers knee contributed with her small might and small fist
When Bartle reentered however there appeared to be a general desire for solo music after the choral
Nancy declared that Tim the waggoner knew a song and was allays singing like a lark i the stable whereupon Mr Poyser said encouragingly Come Tim lad lets hear it
Tim looked sheepish tucked down his head and said he couldnt sing but this encouraging invitation of the masters was echoed all round the table
It was a conversational opportunity everybody could say Come Tim except Alick who never relaxed into the frivolity of unnecessary speech
At last Tims next neighbour Ben Tholoway began to give emphasis to his speech by nudges at which Tim growing rather savage said Let me alooan will ye
Else Ill ma ye sing a toon ye wonna like
A goodtempered waggoners patience has limits and Tim was not to be urged further
Well then David yere the lad to sing said Ben willing to show that he was not discomfited by this check
Sing My looves a roos wiout a thorn
The amatory David was a young man of an unconscious abstracted expression which was due probably to a squint of superior intensity rather than to any mental characteristic for he was not indifferent to Bens invitation but blushed and laughed and rubbed his sleeve over his mouth in a way that was regarded as a symptom of yielding
And for some time the company appeared to be much in earnest about the desire to hear Davids song
But in vain
The lyricism of the evening was in the cellar at present and was not to be drawn from that retreat just yet
Meanwhile the conversation at the head of the table had taken a political turn
Mr Craig was not above talking politics occasionally though he piqued himself rather on a wise insight than on specific information
He saw so far beyond the mere facts of a case that really it was superfluous to know them
Im no reader o the paper myself he observed tonight as he filled his pipe though I might read it fast enough if I liked for theres Miss Lyddy has em and s done with em i no time
But theres Mills now sits i the chimneycorner and reads the paper pretty nigh from morning to night and when hes got to th end ont hes more addleheaded than he was at the beginning
Hes full o this peace now as they talk on hes been reading and reading and thinks hes got to the bottom ont
Why Lor bless you Mills says I you see no more into this thing nor you can see into the middle of a potato
Ill tell you what it is you think itll be a fine thing for the country
And Im not again itmark my wordsIm not again it
But its my opinion as theres them at the head o this country as are worse enemies to us nor Bony and all the mounseers hes got at s back for as for the mounseers you may skewer halfadozen of em at once as if they war frogs
Aye aye said Martin Poyser listening with an air of much intelligence and edification they neer ate a bit o beef i their lives
Mostly sallet I reckon
And says I to Mills continued Mr Craig Will you try to make me believe as furriners like them can do us half th harm them ministers do with their bad government
If King George ud turn em all away and govern by himself hed see everything righted
He might take on Billy Pitt again if he liked but I dont see myself what we want wi anybody besides King and Parliament
Its that nest o ministers does the mischief I tell you
Ah its fine talking observed Mrs Poyser who was now seated near her husband with Totty on her lapits fine talking
Its hard work to tell which is Old Harry when everybodys got boots on
As for this peace said Mr Poyser turning his head on one side in a dubitative manner and giving a precautionary puff to his pipe between each sentence I dont know
Th wars a fine thing for the country an howll you keep up prices wiout it
An them French are a wicked sort o folks by what I can make out
What can you do better nor fight em
Yere partly right there Poyser said Mr Craig but Im not again the peaceto make a holiday for a bit
We can break it when we like an Im in no fear o Bony for all they talk so much o his cliverness
Thats what I says to Mills this morning
Lor bless you he sees no more through Bonywhy I put him up to more in three minutes than he gets froms paper all the year round
Says I Am I a gardener as knows his business or arnt I Mills
Answer me that
To be sure y are Craig says he hes not a bad fellow Mills isnt for a butler but weak i the head
Well says I you talk o Bonys cliverness would it be any use my being a firstrate gardener if Id got nought but a quagmire to work on
No says he
Well I says thats just what it is wi Bony
Ill not deny but he may be a bit cliverhes no Frenchman born as I understandbut whats he got ats back but mounseers
Mr Craig paused a moment with an emphatic stare after this triumphant specimen of Socratic argument and then added thumping the table rather fiercely Why its a sure thingand theres them ull bear witness totas i one regiment where there was one man amissing they put the regimentals on a big monkey and they fit him as the shell fits the walnut and you couldnt tell the monkey from the mounseers
Ah
Think o that now
said Mr Poyser impressed at once with the political bearings of the fact and with its striking interest as an anecdote in natural history
Come Craig said Adam thats a little too strong
You dont believe that
Its all nonsense about the French being such poor sticks
Mr Irwines seen em in their own country and he says theyve plenty o fine fellows among em
And as for knowledge and contrivances and manufactures theres a many things as were a fine sight behind em in
Its poor foolishness to run down your enemies
Why Nelson and the rest of em ud have no merit i beating em if they were such offal as folks pretend
Mr Poyser looked doubtfully at Mr Craig puzzled by this opposition of authorities
Mr Irwines testimony was not to be disputed but on the other hand Craig was a knowing fellow and his view was less startling
Martin had never heard tell of the French being good for much
Mr Craig had found no answer but such as was implied in taking a long draught of ale and then looking down fixedly at the proportions of his own leg which he turned a little outward for that purpose when Bartle Massey returned from the fireplace where he had been smoking his first pipe in quiet and broke the silence by saying as he thrust his forefinger into the canister Why Adam how happened you not to be at church on Sunday
Answer me that you rascal
The anthem went limping without you
Are you going to disgrace your schoolmaster in his old age
No Mr Massey said Adam
Mr and Mrs Poyser can tell you where I was
I was in no bad company
Shes gone Adamgone to Snowfield said Mr Poyser reminded of Dinah for the first time this evening
I thought youd ha persuaded her better
Nought ud hold her but she must go yesterday forenoon
The missis has hardly got over it
I thought shed ha no sperrit for th harvest supper
Mrs Poyser had thought of Dinah several times since Adam had come in but she had had no heart to mention the bad news
What
said Bartle with an air of disgust
Was there a woman concerned
Then I give you up Adam
But its a woman youn spoke well on Bartle said Mr Poyser
Come now you canna draw back you said once as women wouldna ha been a bad invention if theyd all been like Dinah
I meant her voice manI meant her voice that was all said Bartle
I can bear to hear her speak without wanting to put wool in my ears
As for other things I daresay shes like the rest o the womenthinks two and two ll come to make five if she cries and bothers enough about it
Aye aye
said Mrs Poyser one ud think an hear some folks talk as the men war cute enough to count the corns in a bag o wheat wi only smelling at it
They can see through a barndoor they can
Perhaps thats the reason THEY can see so little o this side ont
Martin Poyser shook with delighted laughter and winked at Adam as much as to say the schoolmaster was in for it now
Ah
said Bartle sneeringly the women are quick enoughtheyre quick enough
They know the rights of a story before they hear it and can tell a man what his thoughts are before he knows em himself
Like enough said Mrs Poyser for the men are mostly so slow their thoughts overrun em an they can only catch em by the tail
I can count a stockingtop while a mans gettings tongue ready an when he outs wi his speech at last theres little broth to be made ont
Its your dead chicks take the longest hatchin
Howiver Im not denyin the women are foolish God Almighty made em to match the men
Match
said Bartle
Aye as vinegar matches ones teeth
If a man says a word his wife ll match it with a contradiction if hes a mind for hot meat his wife ll match it with cold bacon if he laughs shell match him with whimpering
Shes such a match as the horsefly is to th horse shes got the right venom to sting him withthe right venom to sting him with
Yes said Mrs Poyser I know what the men likea poor soft as ud simper at em like the picture o the sun whether they did right or wrong an say thank you for a kick an pretend she didna know which end she stood uppermost till her husband told her
Thats what a man wants in a wife mostly he wants to make sure o one fool as ull tell him hes wise
But theres some men can do wiout thatthey think so much o themselves aready
An thats how it is theres old bachelors
Come Craig said Mr Poyser jocosely you mun get married pretty quick else youll be set down for an old bachelor an you see what the women ull think on you
Well said Mr Craig willing to conciliate Mrs Poyser and setting a high value on his own compliments I like a cleverish womana woman o sperrita managing woman
Youre out there Craig said Bartle dryly youre out there
You judge o your gardenstuff on a better plan than that
You pick the things for what they can excel infor what they can excel in
You dont value your peas for their roots or your carrots for their flowers
Now thats the way you should choose women
Their cleverness ll never come to muchnever come to muchbut they make excellent simpletons ripe and strong flavoured
What dost say to that
said Mr Poyser throwing himself back and looking merrily at his wife
Say
answered Mrs Poyser with dangerous fire kindling in her eye
Why I say as some folks tongues are like the clocks as run on strikin not to tell you the time o the day but because theres summat wrong i their own inside Mrs Poyser would probably have brought her rejoinder to a further climax if every ones attention had not at this moment been called to the other end of the table where the lyricism which had at first only manifested itself by Davids sotto voce performance of My loves a rose without a thorn had gradually assumed a rather deafening and complex character
Tim thinking slightly of Davids vocalization was impelled to supersede that feeble buzz by a spirited commencement of Three Merry Mowers but David was not to be put down so easily and showed himself capable of a copious crescendo which was rendering it doubtful whether the rose would not predominate over the mowers when old Kester with an entirely unmoved and immovable aspect suddenly set up a quavering trebleas if he had been an alarum and the time was come for him to go off
The company at Alicks end of the table took this form of vocal entertainment very much as a matter of course being free from musical prejudices but Bartle Massey laid down his pipe and put his fingers in his ears and Adam who had been longing to go ever since he had heard Dinah was not in the house rose and said he must bid goodnight
Ill go with you lad said Bartle Ill go with you before my ears are split
Ill go round by the Common and see you home if you like Mr Massey said Adam
Aye aye
said Bartle then we can have a bit o talk together
I never get hold of you now
Eh
Its a pity but youd sit it out said Martin Poyser
Theyll all go soon for th missis niver lets em stay past ten
But Adam was resolute so the goodnights were said and the two friends turned out on their starlight walk together
Theres that poor fool Vixen whimpering for me at home said Bartle
I can never bring her here with me for fear she should be struck with Mrs Poysers eye and the poor bitch might go limping for ever after
Ive never any need to drive Gyp back said Adam laughing
He always turns back of his own head when he finds out Im coming here
Aye aye said Bartle
A terrible womanmade of needles made of needles
But I stick to MartinI shall always stick to Martin
And he likes the needles God help him
Hes a cushion made on purpose for em
But shes a downright goodnaturd woman for all that said Adam and as true as the daylight
Shes a bit cross wi the dogs when they offer to come in th house but if they depended on her shed take care and have em well fed
If her tongues keen her hearts tender Ive seen that in times o trouble
Shes one o those women as are better than their word
Well well said Bartle I dont say th apple isnt sound at the core but it sets my teeth on edgeit sets my teeth on edge
Chapter LIV The Meeting on the Hill ADAM understood Dinahs haste to go away and drew hope rather than discouragement from it
She was fearful lest the strength of her feeling towards him should hinder her from waiting and listening faithfully for the ultimate guiding voice from within
I wish Id asked her to write to me though he thought
And yet even that might disturb her a bit perhaps
She wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while
And Ive no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my wishes
Shes told me what her mind is and shes not a woman to say one thing and mean another
Ill wait patiently
That was Adams wise resolution and it throve excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got from the remembrance of Dinahs confession that Sunday afternoon
There is a wonderful amount of sustenance in the first few words of love
But towards the middle of October the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion
The weeks were unusually long Dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind
Let a woman say what she will after she has once told a man that she loves him he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second
He treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties
But that sort of glow dies out memory gets sadly diluted with time and is not strong enough to revive us
Adam was no longer so confident as he had been
He began to fear that perhaps Dinahs old life would have too strong a grasp upon her for any new feeling to triumph
If she had not felt this she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him
As Adams confidence waned his patience waned with it and he thought he must write himself
He must ask Dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful
He sat up late one night to write her a letter but the next morning he burnt it afraid of its effect
It would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips for her presence reconciled him to her will
You perceive how it was Adam was hungering for the sight of Dinah and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn
But what harm could he do by going to Snowfield
Dinah could not be displeased with him for it
She had not forbidden him to go
She must surely expect that he would go before long
By the second Sunday in October this view of the case had become so clear to Adam that he was already on his way to Snowfield on horseback this time for his hours were precious now and he had borrowed Jonathan Burges good nag for the journey
What keen memories went along the road with him
He had often been to Oakbourne and back since that first journey to Snowfield but beyond Oakbourne the greystone walls the broken country the meagre trees seemed to be telling him afresh the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart
But no story is the same to us after a lapse of timeor rather we who read it are no longer the same interpretersand Adam this morning brought with him new thoughts through that grey country thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past
That is a base and selfish even a blasphemous spirit which rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that has blighted or crushed another because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves
Adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him he could never thank God for anothers misery
And if I were capable of that narrowsighted joy in Adams behalf I should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself
He would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said Evils evil and sorrows sorrow and you cant alter its natur by wrapping it up in other words
Other folks were not created for my sake that I should think all square when things turn out well for me
But it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life which a sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain
Surely it is not possible to feel otherwise any more than it would be possible for a man with cataract to regret the painful process by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day
The growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty bringing with it a sense of added strength
We can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner or a philosopher to his less complete formula
Something like this sense of enlarged being was in Adams mind this Sunday morning as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past
His feeling towards Dinah the hope of passing his life with her had been the distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from Snowfield eighteen months ago had been leading him
Tender and deep as his love for Hetty had beenso deep that the roots of it would never be torn awayhis love for Dinah was better and more precious to him for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow
Its like as if it was a new strength to me he said to himself to love her and know as she loves me
I shall look t her to help me to see things right
For shes better than I am theres less o self in her and pride
And its a feeling as gives you a sort o liberty as if you could walk more fearless when youve more trust in another than y have in yourself
Ive always been thinking I knew better than them as belonged to me and thats a poor sort o life when you cant look to them nearest to you t help you with a bit better thought than what youve got inside you aready
It was more than two oclock in the afternoon when Adam came in sight of the grey town on the hillside and looked searchingly towards the green valley below for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill
The scene looked less harsh in the soft October sunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all widestretching woodless regionsthat it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching skyhad a milder more soothing influence than usual on this almost cloudless day
Adams doubts and fears melted under this influence as the delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him
He seemed to see Dinahs gentle face assuring him with its looks alone of all he longed to know
He did not expect Dinah to be at home at this hour but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate that he might ask where she was gone today
He had set his mind on following her and bringing her home
She was gone to Slomans End a hamlet about three miles off over the hill the old woman told himhad set off directly after morning chapel to preach in a cottage there as her habit was
Anybody at the town would tell him the way to Slomans End
So Adam got on his horse again and rode to the town putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty landlord from whose friendly questions and reminiscences he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out towards Slomans End
With all his haste it was nearly four oclock before he could set off and he thought that as Dinah had gone so early she would perhaps already be near returning
The little grey desolatelooking hamlet unscreened by sheltering trees lay in sight long before he reached it and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn
Perhaps thats the last hymn before they come away Adam thought
Ill walk back a bit and turn again to meet her farther off the village
He walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again and seated himself on a loose stone against the low wall to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill
He chose this spot almost at the top of the hill because it was away from all eyesno house no cattle not even a nibbling sheep nearno presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky
She was much longer coming than he expected
He waited an hour at least watching for her and thinking of her while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer
At last he saw the little black figure coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill
Slowly Adam thought but Dinah was really walking at her usual pace with a light quiet step
Now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill but Adam would not move yet he would not meet her too soon he had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness
And now he began to fear lest he should startle her too much
Yet he thought shes not one to be overstartled shes always so calm and quiet as if she was prepared for anything
What was she thinking of as she wound up the hill
Perhaps she had found complete repose without him and had ceased to feel any need of his love
On the verge of a decision we all tremble hope pauses with fluttering wings
But now at last she was very near and Adam rose from the stone wall
It happened that just as he walked forward Dinah had paused and turned round to look back at the villagewho does not pause and look back in mounting a hill
Adam was glad for with the fine instinct of a lover he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him
He came within three paces of her and then said Dinah
She started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place
Dinah
Adam said again
He knew quite well what was in her mind
She was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice
But this second time she looked round
What a look of yearning love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong darkeyed man
She did not start again at the sight of him she said nothing but moved towards him so that his arm could clasp her round
And they walked on so in silence while the warm tears fell
Adam was content and said nothing
It was Dinah who spoke first
Adam she said it is the Divine Will
My soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life I live without you
And this moment now you are with me and I feel that our hearts are filled with the same love
I have a fulness of strength to bear and do our heavenly Fathers Will that I had lost before
Adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes
Then well never part any more Dinah till death parts us
And they kissed each other with a deep joy
What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they are joined for lifeto strengthen each other in all labour to rest on each other in all sorrow to minister to each other in all pain to be one with each other in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the last parting
Chapter LV Marriage Bells IN little more than a month after that meeting on the hillon a rimy morning in departing NovemberAdam and Dinah were married
It was an event much thought of in the village
All Mr Burges men had a holiday and all Mr Poysers and most of those who had a holiday appeared in their best clothes at the wedding
I think there was hardly an inhabitant of Hayslope specially mentioned in this history and still resident in the parish on this November morning who was not either in church to see Adam and Dinah married or near the church door to greet them as they came forth
Mrs Irwine and her daughters were waiting at the churchyard gates in their carriage for they had a carriage now to shake hands with the bride and bridegroom and wish them well and in the absence of Miss Lydia Donnithorne at Bath Mrs Best Mr Mills and Mr Craig had felt it incumbent on them to represent the family at the Chase on the occasion
The churchyard walk was quite lined with familiar faces many of them faces that had first looked at Dinah when she preached on the Green
And no wonder they showed this eager interest on her marriage morning for nothing like Dinah and the history which had brought her and Adam Bede together had been known at Hayslope within the memory of man
Bessy Cranage in her neatest cap and frock was crying though she did not exactly know why for as her cousin Wiry Ben who stood near her judiciously suggested Dinah was not going away and if Bessy was in low spirits the best thing for her to do was to follow Dinahs example and marry an honest fellow who was ready to have her
Next to Bessy just within the church door there were the Poyser children peeping round the corner of the pews to get a sight of the mysterious ceremony Tottys face wearing an unusual air of anxiety at the idea of seeing cousin Dinah come back looking rather old for in Tottys experience no married people were young
I envy them all the sight they had when the marriage was fairly ended and Adam led Dinah out of church
She was not in black this morning for her Aunt Poyser would by no means allow such a risk of incurring bad luck and had herself made a present of the wedding dress made all of grey though in the usual Quaker form for on this point Dinah could not give way
So the lily face looked out with sweet gravity from under a grey Quaker bonnet neither smiling nor blushing but with lips trembling a little under the weight of solemn feelings
Adam as he pressed her arm to his side walked with his old erectness and his head thrown rather backward as if to face all the world better
But it was not because he was particularly proud this morning as is the wont of bridegrooms for his happiness was of a kind that had little reference to mens opinion of it
There was a tinge of sadness in his deep joy Dinah knew it and did not feel aggrieved
There were three other couples following the bride and bridegroom first Martin Poyser looking as cheery as a bright fire on this rimy morning led quiet Mary Burge the bridesmaid then came Seth serenely happy with Mrs Poyser on his arm and last of all Bartle Massey with LisbethLisbeth in a new gown and bonnet too busy with her pride in her son and her delight in possessing the one daughter she had desired to devise a single pretext for complaint
Bartle Massey had consented to attend the wedding at Adams earnest request under protest against marriage in general and the marriage of a sensible man in particular
Nevertheless Mr Poyser had a joke against him after the wedding dinner to the effect that in the vestry he had given the bride one more kiss than was necessary
Behind this last couple came Mr Irwine glad at heart over this good mornings work of joining Adam and Dinah
For he had seen Adam in the worst moments of his sorrow and what better harvest from that painful seedtime could there be than this
The love that had brought hope and comfort in the hour of despair the love that had found its way to the dark prison cell and to poor Hettys darker soulthis strong gentle love was to be Adams companion and helper till death
There was much shaking of hands mingled with God bless yous and other good wishes to the four couples at the churchyard gate Mr Poyser answering for the rest with unwonted vivacity of tongue for he had all the appropriate weddingday jokes at his command
And the women he observed could never do anything but put finger in eye at a wedding
Even Mrs Poyser could not trust herself to speak as the neighbours shook hands with her and Lisbeth began to cry in the face of the very first person who told her she was getting young again
Mr Joshua Rann having a slight touch of rheumatism did not join in the ringing of the bells this morning and looking on with some contempt at these informal greetings which required no official cooperation from the clerk began to hum in his musical bass Oh what a joyful thing it is by way of preluding a little to the effect he intended to produce in the wedding psalm next Sunday
Thats a bit of good news to cheer Arthur said Mr Irwine to his mother as they drove off
I shall write to him the first thing when we get home
Epilogue IT is near the end of June in 1807
The workshops have been shut up half an hour or more in Adam Bedes timberyard which used to be Jonathan Burges and the mellow evening light is falling on the pleasant house with the buff walls and the soft grey thatch very much as it did when we saw Adam bringing in the keys on that June evening nine years ago
There is a figure we know well just come out of the house and shading her eyes with her hands as she looks for something in the distance for the rays that fall on her white borderless cap and her pale auburn hair are very dazzling
But now she turns away from the sunlight and looks towards the door
We can see the sweet pale face quite well now it is scarcely at all alteredonly a little fuller to correspond to her more matronly figure which still seems light and active enough in the plain black dress
I see him Seth Dinah said as she looked into the house
Let us go and meet him
Come Lisbeth come with Mother
The last call was answered immediately by a small fair creature with pale auburn hair and grey eyes little more than four years old who ran out silently and put her hand into her mothers
Come Uncle Seth said Dinah
Aye aye were coming Seth answered from within and presently appeared stooping under the doorway being taller than usual by the black head of a sturdy twoyearold nephew who had caused some delay by demanding to be carried on uncles shoulder
Better take him on thy arm Seth said Dinah looking fondly at the stout blackeyed fellow
Hes troublesome to thee so
Nay nay Addy likes a ride on my shoulder
I can carry him so for a bit
A kindness which young Addy acknowledged by drumming his heels with promising force against Uncle Seths chest
But to walk by Dinahs side and be tyrannized over by Dinahs and Adams children was Uncle Seths earthly happiness
Where didst see him
asked Seth as they walked on into the adjoining field
I cant catch sight of him anywhere
Between the hedges by the roadside said Dinah
I saw his hat and his shoulder
There he is again
Trust thee for catching sight of him if hes anywhere to be seen said Seth smiling
Theet like poor mother used to be
She was always on the look out for Adam and could see him sooner than other folks for all her eyes got dim
Hes been longer than he expected said Dinah taking Arthurs watch from a small side pocket and looking at it its nigh upon seven now
Aye theyd have a deal to say to one another said Seth and the meeting ud touch em both pretty closish
Why its getting on towards eight years since they parted
Yes said Dinah Adam was greatly moved this morning at the thought of the change he should see in the poor young man from the sickness he has undergone as well as the years which have changed us all
And the death of the poor wanderer when she was coming back to us has been sorrow upon sorrow
See Addy said Seth lowering the young one to his arm now and pointing theres Father comingat the far stile
Dinah hastened her steps and little Lisbeth ran on at her utmost speed till she clasped her fathers leg
Adam patted her head and lifted her up to kiss her but Dinah could see the marks of agitation on his face as she approached him and he put her arm within his in silence
Well youngster must I take you
he said trying to smile when Addy stretched out his armsready with the usual baseness of infancy to give up his Uncle Seth at once now there was some rarer patronage at hand
Its cut me a good deal Dinah Adam said at last when they were walking on
Didst find him greatly altered
said Dinah
Why hes altered and yet not altered
I should ha known him anywhere
But his colours changed and he looks sadly
However the doctors say hell soon be set right in his own country air
Hes all sound in th inside its only the fever shattered him so
But he speaks just the same and smiles at me just as he did when he was a lad
Its wonderful how hes always had just the same sort o look when he smiles
Ive never seen him smile poor young man said Dinah
But thee wilt see him smile tomorrow said Adam
He asked after thee the first thing when he began to come round and we could talk to one another
I hope she isnt altered he said I remember her face so well
I told him no Adam continued looking fondly at the eyes that were turned towards his only a bit plumper as theedst a right to be after seven year
I may come and see her tomorrow maynt I
he said I long to tell her how Ive thought of her all these years
Didst tell him Id always used the watch
said Dinah
Aye and we talked a deal about thee for he says he never saw a woman a bit like thee
I shall turn Methodist some day he said when she preaches out of doors and go to hear her
And I said Nay sir you cant do that for Conference has forbid the women preaching and shes given it up all but talking to the people a bit in their houses
Ah said Seth who could not repress a comment on this point and a sore pity it was o Conference and if Dinah had seen as I did wed ha left the Wesleyans and joined a body that ud put no bonds on Christian liberty
Nay lad nay said Adam she was right and thee wast wrong
Theres no rules so wise but what its a pity for somebody or other
Most o the women do more harm nor good with their preachingtheyve not got Dinahs gift nor her sperritand shes seen that and she thought it right to set th example o submitting for shes not held from other sorts o teaching
And I agree with her and approve o what she did
Seth was silent
This was a standing subject of difference rarely alluded to and Dinah wishing to quit it at once said Didst remember Adam to speak to Colonel Donnithorne the words my uncle and aunt entrusted to thee
Yes and hes going to the Hall Farm with Mr Irwine the day after tomorrow
Mr Irwine came in while we were talking about it and he would have it as the Colonel must see nobody but thee tomorrow
He saidand hes in the right of itas itll be bad for him t have his feelings stirred with seeing many people one after another
We must get you strong and hearty he said thats the first thing to be done Arthur and then you shall have your own way
But I shall keep you under your old tutors thumb till then
Mr Irwines fine and joyful at having him home again
Adam was silent a little while and then said It was very cutting when we first saw one another
Hed never heard about poor Hetty till Mr Irwine met him in London for the letters missed him on his journey
The first thing he said to me when wed got hold o one anothers hands was I could never do anything for her Adamshe lived long enough for all the sufferingand Id thought so of the time when I might do something for her
But you told me the truth when you said to me once Theres a sort of wrong that can never be made up for
Why theres Mr and Mrs Poyser coming in at the yard gate said Seth
So there is said Dinah
Run Lisbeth run to meet Aunt Poyser
Come in Adam and rest it has been a hard day for thee
