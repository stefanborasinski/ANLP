The Lesson of the Master by Henry James Scanned and proofed by David Price ccx074coventryacuk The Lesson of the Master He had been told the ladies were at church but this was corrected by what he saw from the top of the steps  they descended from a great height in two arms with a circular sweep of the most charming effect  at the threshold of the door which from the long bright gallery overlooked the immense lawn
Three gentlemen on the grass at a distance sat under the great trees while the fourth figure showed a crimson dress that told as a bit of colour amid the fresh rich green
The servant had so far accompanied Paul Overt as to introduce him to this view after asking him if he wished first to go to his room
The young man declined that privilege conscious of no disrepair from so short and easy a journey and always liking to take at once a general perceptive possession of a new scene
He stood there a little with his eyes on the group and on the admirable picture the wide grounds of an old countryhouse near London  that only made it better  on a splendid Sunday in June
But that lady whos SHE
he said to the servant before the man left him
I think shes Mrs St George sir
Mrs St George the wife of the distinguished   Then Paul Overt checked himself doubting if a footman would know
Yes sir  probably sir said his guide who appeared to wish to intimate that a person staying at Summersoft would naturally be if only by alliance distinguished
His tone however made poor Overt himself feel for the moment scantly so
And the gentlemen
Overt went on
Well sir one of thems General Fancourt
Ah yes I know thank you
General Fancourt was distinguished there was no doubt of that for something he had done or perhaps even hadnt done  the young man couldnt remember which  some years before in India
The servant went away leaving the glass doors open into the gallery and Paul Overt remained at the head of the wide double staircase saying to himself that the place was sweet and promised a pleasant visit while he leaned on the balustrade of fine old ironwork which like all the other details was of the same period as the house
It all went together and spoke in one voice  a rich English voice of the early part of the eighteenth century
It might have been churchtime on a summers day in the reign of Queen Anne the stillness was too perfect to be modern the nearness counted so as distance and there was something so fresh and sound in the originality of the large smooth house the expanse of beautiful brickwork that showed for pink rather than red and that had been kept clear of messy creepers by the law under which a woman with a rare complexion disdains a veil
When Paul Overt became aware that the people under the trees had noticed him he turned back through the open doors into the great gallery which was the pride of the place
It marched across from end to end and seemed  with its bright colours its high panelled windows its faded flowered chintzes its quicklyrecognised portraits and pictures the blueandwhite china of its cabinets and the attenuated festoons and rosettes of its ceiling  a cheerful upholstered avenue into the other century
Our friend was slightly nervous that went with his character as a student of fine prose went with the artists general disposition to vibrate and there was a particular thrill in the idea that Henry St George might be a member of the party
For the young aspirant he had remained a high literary figure in spite of the lower range of production to which he had fallen after his first three great successes the comparative absence of quality in his later work
There had been moments when Paul Overt almost shed tears for this but now that he was near him  he had never met him  he was conscious only of the fine original source and of his own immense debt
After he had taken a turn or two up and down the gallery he came out again and descended the steps
He was but slenderly supplied with a certain social boldness  it was really a weakness in him  so that conscious of a want of acquaintance with the four persons in the distance he gave way to motions recommended by their not committing him to a positive approach
There was a fine English awkwardness in this  he felt that too as he sauntered vaguely and obliquely across the lawn taking an independent line
Fortunately there was an equally fine English directness in the way one of the gentlemen presently rose and made as if to stalk him though with an air of conciliation and reassurance
To this demonstration Paul Overt instantly responded even if the gentleman were not his host
He was tall straight and elderly and had like the great house itself a pink smiling face and into the bargain a white moustache
Our young man met him halfway while he laughed and said Er  Lady Watermouth told us you were coming she asked me just to look after you
Paul Overt thanked him liking him on the spot and turned round with him to walk toward the others
Theyve all gone to church  all except us the stranger continued as they went were just sitting here  its so jolly
Overt pronounced it jolly indeed it was such a lovely place
He mentioned that he was having the charming impression for the first time
Ah youve not been here before
said his companion
Its a nice little place  not much to DO you know
Overt wondered what he wanted to do  he felt that he himself was doing so much
By the time they came to where the others sat he had recognised his initiator for a military man and  such was the turn of Overts imagination  had found him thus still more sympathetic
He would naturally have a need for action for deeds at variance with the pacific pastoral scene
He was evidently so goodnatured however that he accepted the inglorious hour for what it was worth
Paul Overt shared it with him and with his companions for the next twenty minutes the latter looked at him and he looked at them without knowing much who they were while the talk went on without much telling him even what it meant
It seemed indeed to mean nothing in particular it wandered with casual pointless pauses and short terrestrial flights amid names of persons and places  names which for our friend had no great power of evocation
It was all sociable and slow as was right and natural of a warm Sunday morning
His first attention was given to the question privately considered of whether one of the two younger men would be Henry St George
He knew many of his distinguished contemporaries by their photographs but had never as happened seen a portrait of the great misguided novelist
One of the gentlemen was unimaginable  he was too young and the other scarcely looked clever enough with such mild undiscriminating eyes
If those eyes were St Georges the problem presented by the illmatched parts of his genius would be still more difficult of solution
Besides the deportment of their proprietor was not as regards the lady in the red dress such as could be natural toward the wife of his bosom even to a writer accused by several critics of sacrificing too much to manner
Lastly Paul Overt had a vague sense that if the gentleman with the expressionless eyes bore the name that had set his heart beating faster he also had contradictory conventional whiskers  the young admirer of the celebrity had never in a mental vision seen HIS face in so vulgar a frame he would have given him a sign of recognition or of friendliness would have heard of him a little would know something about Ginistrella would have an impression of how that fresh fiction had caught the eye of real criticism
Paul Overt had a dread of being grossly proud but even morbid modesty might view the authorship of Ginistrella as constituting a degree of identity
His soldierly friend became clear enough he was Fancourt but was also the General and he mentioned to the new visitor in the course of a few moments that he had but lately returned from twenty years service abroad
And now you remain in England
the young man asked
Oh yes Ive bought a small house in London
And I hope you like it said Overt looking at Mrs St George
Well a little house in Manchester Square  theres a limit to the enthusiasm THAT inspires
Oh I meant being at home again  being back in Piccadilly
My daughter likes Piccadilly  thats the main thing
Shes very fond of art and music and literature and all that kind of thing
She missed it in India and she finds it in London or she hopes shell find it
Mr St George has promised to help her  he has been awfully kind to her
She has gone to church  shes fond of that too  but theyll all be back in a quarter of an hour
You must let me introduce you to her  shell be so glad to know you
I dare say she has read every blest word youve written
I shall be delighted  I havent written so very many Overt pleaded feeling and without resentment that the General at least was vagueness itself about that
But he wondered a little why expressing this friendly disposition it didnt occur to the doubtless eminent soldier to pronounce the word that would put him in relation with Mrs St George
If it was a question of introductions Miss Fancourt  apparently as yet unmarried  was far away while the wife of his illustrious confrere was almost between them
This lady struck Paul Overt as altogether pretty with a surprising juvenility and a high smartness of aspect something that  he could scarcely have said why  served for mystification
St George certainly had every right to a charming wife but he himself would never have imagined the important little woman in the aggressively Parisian dress the partner for life the alter ego of a man of letters
That partner in general he knew that second self was far from presenting herself in a single type observation had taught him that she was not inveterately not necessarily plain
But he had never before seen her look so much as if her prosperity had deeper foundations than an inkspotted studytable littered with proofsheets
Mrs St George might have been the wife of a gentleman who kept books rather than wrote them who carried on great affairs in the City and made better bargains than those that poets mostly make with publishers
With this she hinted at a success more personal  a success peculiarly stamping the age in which society the world of conversation is a great drawingroom with the City for its antechamber
Overt numbered her years at first as some thirty and then ended by believing that she might approach her fiftieth
But she somehow in this case juggled away the excess and the difference  you only saw them in a rare glimpse like the rabbit in the conjurers sleeve
She was extraordinarily white and her every element and item was pretty her eyes her ears her hair her voice her hands her feet  to which her relaxed attitude in her wicker chair gave a great publicity  and the numerous ribbons and trinkets with which she was bedecked
She looked as if she had put on her best clothes to go to church and then had decided they were too good for that and had stayed at home
She told a story of some length about the shabby way Lady Jane had treated the Duchess as well as an anecdote in relation to a purchase she had made in Paris  on her way back from Cannes made for Lady Egbert who had never refunded the money
Paul Overt suspected her of a tendency to figure great people as larger than life until he noticed the manner in which she handled Lady Egbert which was so sharply mutinous that it reassured him
He felt he should have understood her better if he might have met her eye but she scarcely so much as glanced at him
Ah here they come  all the good ones
she said at last and Paul Overt admired at his distance the return of the churchgoers  several persons in couples and threes advancing in a flicker of sun and shade at the end of a large green vista formed by the level grass and the overarching boughs
If you mean to imply that WERE bad I protest said one of the gentlemen  after making ones self agreeable all the morning
Ah if theyve found you agreeable  
Mrs St George gaily cried
But if were good the others are better
They must be angels then said the amused General
Your husband was an angel the way he went off at your bidding the gentleman who had first spoken declared to Mrs St George
At my bidding
Didnt you make him go to church
I never made him do anything in my life but once  when I made him burn up a bad book
Thats all
At her Thats all
our young friend broke into an irrepressible laugh it lasted only a second but it drew her eyes to him
His own met them though not long enough to help him to understand her unless it were a step towards this that he saw on the instant how the burnt book  the way she alluded to it
 would have been one of her husbands finest things
A bad book
her interlocutor repeated
I didnt like it
He went to church because your daughter went she continued to General Fancourt
I think it my duty to call your attention to his extraordinary demonstrations to your daughter
Well if you dont mind them I dont the General laughed
Il sattache e ses pas
But I dont wonder  shes so charming
I hope she wont make him burn any books
Paul Overt ventured to exclaim
If shed make him write a few it would be more to the purpose said Mrs St George
He has been of a laziness of late  
Our young man stared  he was so struck with the ladys phraseology
Her Write a few seemed to him almost as good as her Thats all
Didnt she as the wife of a rare artist know what it was to produce one perfect work of art
How in the world did she think they were turned on
His private conviction was that admirably as Henry St George wrote he had written for the last ten years and especially for the last five only too much and there was an instant during which he felt inwardly solicited to make this public
But before he had spoken a diversion was effected by the return of the absentees
They strolled up dispersedly  there were eight or ten of them  and the circle under the trees rearranged itself as they took their place in it
They made it much larger so that Paul Overt could feel  he was always feeling that sort of thing as he said to himself  that if the company had already been interesting to watch the interest would now become intense
He shook hands with his hostess who welcomed him without many words in the manner of a woman able to trust him to understand and conscious that so pleasant an occasion would in every way speak for itself
She offered him no particular facility for sitting by her and when they had all subsided again he found himself still next General Fancourt with an unknown lady on his other flank
Thats my daughter  that one opposite the General said to him without lose of time
Overt saw a tall girl with magnificent red hair in a dress of a pretty greygreen tint and of a limp silken texture a garment that clearly shirked every modern effect
It had therefore somehow the stamp of the latest thing so that our beholder quickly took her for nothing if not contemporaneous
Shes very handsome  very handsome he repeated while he considered her
There was something noble in her head and she appeared fresh and strong
Her good father surveyed her with complacency remarking soon She looks too hot  thats her walk
But shell be all right presently
Then Ill make her come over and speak to you
I should be sorry to give you that trouble
If you were to take me over THERE  
the young man murmured
My dear sir do you suppose I put myself out that way
I dont mean for you but for Marian the General added
I would put myself out for her soon enough Overt replied after which he went on Will you be so good as to tell me which of those gentlemen is Henry St
George
The fellow talking to my girl
By Jove he IS making up to her  theyre going off for another walk
Ah is that he  really
Our friend felt a certain surprise for the personage before him seemed to trouble a vision which had been vague only while not confronted with the reality
As soon as the reality dawned the mental image retiring with a sigh became substantial enough to suffer a slight wrong
Overt who had spent a considerable part of his short life in foreign lands made now but not for the first time the reflexion that whereas in those countries he had almost always recognised the artist and the man of letters by his personal type the mould of his face the character of his head the expression of his figure and even the indications of his dress so in England this identification was as little as possible a matter of course thanks to the greater conformity the habit of sinking the profession instead of advertising it the general diffusion of the air of the gentleman  the gentleman committed to no particular set of ideas
More than once on returning to his own country he had said to himself about people met in society One sees them in this place and that and one even talks with them but to find out what they DO one would really have to be a detective
In respect to several individuals whose work he was the opposite of drawn to  perhaps he was wrong  he found himself adding No wonder they conceal it  when its so bad
He noted that oftener than in France and in Germany his artist looked like a gentleman  that is like an English one  while certainly outside a few exceptions his gentlemen didnt look like an artist
St George was not one of the exceptions that circumstance he definitely apprehended before the great man had turned his back to walk off with Miss Fancourt
He certainly looked better behind than any foreign man of letters  showed for beautifully correct in his tall black hat and his superior frock coat
Somehow all the same these very garments  he wouldnt have minded them so much on a weekday  were disconcerting to Paul Overt who forgot for the moment that the head of the profession was not a bit better dressed than himself
He had caught a glimpse of a regular face a fresh colour a brown moustache and a pair of eyes surely never visited by a fine frenzy and he promised himself to study these denotements on the first occasion
His superficial sense was that their owner might have passed for a lucky stockbroker  a gentleman driving eastward every morning from a sanitary suburb in a smart dogcart
That carried out the impression already derived from his wife
Pauls glance after a moment travelled back to this lady and he saw how her own had followed her husband as he moved off with Miss Fancourt
Overt permitted himself to wonder a little if she were jealous when another woman took him away
Then he made out that Mrs St George wasnt glaring at the indifferent maiden
Her eyes rested but on her husband and with unmistakeable serenity
That was the way she wanted him to be  she liked his conventional uniform
Overt longed to hear more about the book she had induced him to destroy
CHAPTER II As they all came out from luncheon General Fancourt took hold of him with an I say I want you to know my girl
as if the idea had just occurred to him and he hadnt spoken of it before
With the other hand he possessed himself all paternally of the young lady
You know all about him
Ive seen you with his books
She reads everything  everything
he went on to Paul
The girl smiled at him and then laughed at her father
The General turned away and his daughter spoke  Isnt papa delightful
He is indeed Miss Fancourt
As if I read you because I read everything
Oh I dont mean for saying that said Paul Overt
I liked him from the moment he began to be kind to me
Then he promised me this privilege
It isnt for you he means it  its for me
If you flatter yourself that he thinks of anything in life but me youll find youre mistaken
He introduces every one
He thinks me insatiable
You speak just like him laughed our youth
Ah but sometimes I want to  and the girl coloured
I dont read everything  I read very little
But I HAVE read you
Suppose we go into the gallery said Paul Overt
She pleased him greatly not so much because of this last remark  though that of course was not too disconcerting  as because seated opposite to him at luncheon she had given him for half an hour the impression of her beautiful face
Something else had come with it  a sense of generosity of an enthusiasm which unlike many enthusiasms was not all manner
That was not spoiled for him by his seeing that the repast had placed her again in familiar contact with Henry St George
Sitting next her this celebrity was also opposite our young man who had been able to note that he multiplied the attentions lately brought by his wife to the Generals notice
Paul Overt had gathered as well that this lady was not in the least discomposed by these fond excesses and that she gave every sign of an unclouded spirit
She had Lord Masham on one side of her and on the other the accomplished Mr Mulliner editor of the new high class lively evening paper which was expected to meet a want felt in circles increasingly conscious that Conservatism must be made amusing and unconvinced when assured by those of another political colour that it was already amusing enough
At the end of an hour spent in her company Paul Overt thought her still prettier than at the first radiation and if her profane allusions to her husbands work had not still rung in his ears he should have liked her  so far as it could be a question of that in connexion with a woman to whom he had not yet spoken and to whom probably he should never speak if it were left to her
Pretty women were a clear need to this genius and for the hour it was Miss Fancourt who supplied the want
If Overt had promised himself a closer view the occasion was now of the best and it brought consequences felt by the young man as important
He saw more in St Georges face which he liked the better for its not having told its whole story in the first three minutes
That story came out as one read in short instalments  it was excusable that ones analogies should be somewhat professional  and the text was a style considerably involved a language not easy to translate at sight
There were shades of meaning in it and a vague perspective of history which receded as you advanced
Two facts Paul had particularly heeded
The first of these was that he liked the measured mask much better at inscrutable rest than in social agitation its almost convulsive smile above all displeased him as much as any impression from that source could whereas the quiet face had a charm that grew in proportion as stillness settled again
The change to the expression of gaiety excited he made out very much the private protest of a person sitting gratefully in the twilight when the lamp is brought in too soon
His second reflexion was that though generally averse to the flagrant use of ingratiating arts by a man of age making up to a pretty girl he was not in this case too painfully affected which seemed to prove either that St George had a light hand or the air of being younger than he was or else that Miss Fancourts own manner somehow made everything right
Overt walked with her into the gallery and they strolled to the end of it looking at the pictures the cabinets the charming vista which harmonised with the prospect of the summer afternoon resembling it by a long brightness with great divans and old chairs that figured hours of rest
Such a place as that had the added merit of giving those who came into it plenty to talk about
Miss Fancourt sat down with her new acquaintance on a flowered sofa the cushions of which very numerous were tight ancient cubes of many sizes and presently said Im so glad to have a chance to thank you
To thank me  
He had to wonder
I liked your book so much
I think it splendid
She sat there smiling at him and he never asked himself which book she meant for after all he had written three or four
That seemed a vulgar detail and he wasnt even gratified by the idea of the pleasure she told him  her handsome bright face told him  he had given her
The feeling she appealed to or at any rate the feeling she excited was something larger something that had little to do with any quickened pulsation of his own vanity
It was responsive admiration of the life she embodied the young purity and richness of which appeared to imply that real success was to resemble THAT to live to bloom to present the perfection of a fine type not to have hammered out headachy fancies with a bent back at an ink stained table
While her grey eyes rested on him  there was a wideish space between these and the division of her richcoloured hair so thick that it ventured to be smooth made a free arch above them  he was almost ashamed of that exercise of the pen which it was her present inclination to commend
He was conscious he should have liked better to please her in some other way
The lines of her face were those of a woman grown but the child lingered on in her complexion and in the sweetness of her mouth
Above all she was natural  that was indubitable now more natural than he had supposed at first perhaps on account of her aesthetic toggery which was conventionally unconventional suggesting what he might have called a tortuous spontaneity
He had feared that sort of thing in other cases and his fears had been justified for though he was an artist to the essence the modern reactionary nymph with the brambles of the woodland caught in her folds and a look as if the satyrs had toyed with her hair made him shrink not as a man of starch and patent leather but as a man potentially himself a poet or even a faun
The girl was really more candid than her costume and the best proof of it was her supposing her liberal character suited by any uniform
This was a fallacy since if she was draped as a pessimist he was sure she liked the taste of life
He thanked her for her appreciation  aware at the same time that he didnt appear to thank her enough and that she might think him ungracious
He was afraid she would ask him to explain something he had written and he always winced at that  perhaps too timidly  for to his own ear the explanation of a work of art sounded fatuous
But he liked her so much as to feel a confidence that in the long run he should be able to show her he wasnt rudely evasive
Moreover she surely wasnt quick to take offence wasnt irritable she could be trusted to wait
So when he said to her Ah dont talk of anything Ive done dont talk of it HERE theres another man in the house whos the actuality
 when he uttered this short sincere protest it was with the sense that she would see in the words neither mock humility nor the impatience of a successful man bored with praise
You mean Mr St George  isnt he delightful
Paul Overt met her eyes which had a cool morninglight that would have halfbroken his heart if he hadnt been so young
Alas I dont know him
I only admire him at a distance
Oh you must know him  he wants so to talk to you returned Miss Fancourt who evidently had the habit of saying the things that by her quick calculation would give people pleasure
Paul saw how she would always calculate on everythings being simple between others
I shouldnt have supposed he knew anything about me he professed
He does then  everything
And if he didnt I should be able to tell him
To tell him everything
our friend smiled
You talk just like the people in your book
she answered
Then they must all talk alike
She thought a moment not a bit disconcerted
Well it must be so difficult
Mr St George tells me it IS  terribly
Ive tried too  and I find it so
Ive tried to write a novel
Mr St George oughtnt to discourage you Paul went so far as to say
You do much more  when you wear that expression
Well after all why try to be an artist
the young man pursued
Its so poor  so poor
I dont know what you mean said Miss Fancourt who looked grave
I mean as compared with being a person of action  as living your works
But whats art but an intense life  if it be real
she asked
I think its the only one  everything else is so clumsy
Her companion laughed and she brought out with her charming serenity what next struck her
Its so interesting to meet so many celebrated people
So I should think  but surely it isnt new to you
Why Ive never seen any one  any one living always in Asia
The way she talked of Asia somehow enchanted him
But doesnt that continent swarm with great figures
Havent you administered provinces in India and had captive rajahs and tributary princes chained to your car
It was as if she didnt care even SHOULD he amuse himself at her cost
I was with my father after I left school to go out there
It was delightful being with him  were alone together in the world he and I  but there was none of the society I like best
One never heard of a picture  never of a book except bad ones
Never of a picture
Why wasnt all life a picture
She looked over the delightful place where they sat
Nothing to compare to this
I adore England
she cried
It fairly stirred in him the sacred chord
Ah of course I dont deny that we must do something with her poor old dear yet
She hasnt been touched really said the girl
Did Mr St George say that
There was a small and as he felt harmless spark of irony in his question which however she answered very simply not noticing the insinuation
Yes he says England hasnt been touched  not considering all there is she went on eagerly
Hes so interesting about our country
To listen to him makes one want so to do something
It would make ME want to said Paul Overt feeling strongly on the instant the suggestion of what she said and that of the emotion with which she said it and well aware of what an incentive on St Georges lips such a speech might be
Oh you  as if you hadnt
I should like so to hear you talk together she added ardently
Thats very genial of you but hed have it all his own way
Im prostrate before him
She had an air of earnestness
Do you think then hes so perfect
Far from it
Some of his later books seem to me of a queerness  
Yes yes  he knows that
Paul Overt stared
That they seem to me of a queerness  
Well yes or at any rate that theyre not what they should be
He told me he didnt esteem them
He has told me such wonderful things  hes so interesting
There was a certain shock for Paul Overt in the knowledge that the fine genius they were talking of had been reduced to so explicit a confession and had made it in his misery to the first comer for though Miss Fancourt was charming what was she after all but an immature girl encountered at a countryhouse
Yet precisely this was part of the sentiment he himself had just expressed he would make way completely for the poor peccable great man not because he didnt read him clear but altogether because he did
His consideration was half composed of tenderness for superficialities which he was sure their perpetrator judged privately judged more ferociously than any one and which represented some tragic intellectual secret
He would have his reasons for his psychology e fleur de peau and these reasons could only be cruel ones such as would make him dearer to those who already were fond of him
You excite my envy
I have my reserves I discriminate  but I love him Paul said in a moment
And seeing him for the first time this way is a great event for me
How momentous  how magnificent
cried the girl
How delicious to bring you together
Your doing it  that makes it perfect our friend returned
Hes as eager as you she went on
But its so odd you shouldnt have met
Its not really so odd as it strikes you
Ive been out of England so much  made repeated absences all these last years
She took this in with interest
And yet you write of it as well as if you were always here
Its just the being away perhaps
At any rate the best bits I suspect are those that were done in dreary places abroad
And why were they dreary
Because they were healthresorts  where my poor mother was dying
Your poor mother
 she was all sweet wonder
We went from place to place to help her to get better
But she never did
To the deadly Riviera I hate it
to the high Alps to Algiers and far away  a hideous journey  to Colorado
And she isnt better
Miss Fancourt went on
She died a year ago
Really
 like mine
Only thats years since
Some day you must tell me about your mother she added
He could at first on this only gaze at her
What right things you say
If you say them to St George I dont wonder hes in bondage
It pulled her up for a moment
I dont know what you mean
He doesnt make speeches and professions at all  he isnt ridiculous
Im afraid you consider then that I am
No I dont  she spoke it rather shortly
And then she added He understands  understands everything
The young man was on the point of saying jocosely And I dont  is that it
But these words in time changed themselves to others slightly less trivial Do you suppose he understands his wife
Miss Fancourt made no direct answer but after a moments hesitation put it Isnt she charming
Not in the least
Here he comes
Now you must know him she went on
A small group of visitors had gathered at the other end of the gallery and had been there overtaken by Henry St George who strolled in from a neighbouring room
He stood near them a moment not falling into the talk but taking up an old miniature from a table and vaguely regarding it
At the end of a minute he became aware of Miss Fancourt and her companion in the distance whereupon laying down his miniature he approached them with the same procrastinating air his hands in his pockets and his eyes turned right and left to the pictures
The gallery was so long that this transit took some little time especially as there was a moment when he stopped to admire the fine Gainsborough
He says Mrs St George has been the making of him the girl continued in a voice slightly lowered
Ah hes often obscure
Paul laughed
Obscure
she repeated as if she heard it for the first time
Her eyes rested on her other friend and it wasnt lost upon Paul that they appeared to send out great shafts of softness
Hes going to speak to us
she fondly breathed
There was a sort of rapture in her voice and our friend was startled
Bless my soul does she care for him like THAT
 is she in love with him
he mentally enquired
Didnt I tell you he was eager
she had meanwhile asked of him
Its eagerness dissimulated the young man returned as the subject of their observation lingered before his Gainsborough
He edges toward us shyly
Does he mean that she saved him by burning that book
That book
what book did she burn
The girl quickly turned her face to him
Hasnt he told you then
Not a word
Then he doesnt tell you everything
Paul had guessed that she pretty much supposed he did
The great man had now resumed his course and come nearer in spite of which his more qualified admirer risked a profane observation St George and the Dragon is what the anecdote suggests
His companion however didnt hear it she smiled at the dragons adversary
He IS eager  he is
she insisted
Eager for you  yes
But meanwhile she had called out Im sure you want to know Mr
Overt
Youll be great friends and it will always be delightful to me to remember I was here when you first met and that I had something to do with it
There was a freshness of intention in the words that carried them off nevertheless our young man was sorry for Henry St George as he was sorry at any time for any person publicly invited to be responsive and delightful
He would have been so touched to believe that a man he deeply admired should care a straw for him that he wouldnt play with such a presumption if it were possibly vain
In a single glance of the eye of the pardonable Master he read  having the sort of divination that belonged to his talent  that this personage had ever a store of friendly patience which was part of his rich outfit but was versed in no printed page of a rising scribbler
There was even a relief a simplification in that liking him so much already for what he had done how could one have liked him any more for a perception which must at the best have been vague
Paul Overt got up trying to show his compassion but at the same instant he found himself encompassed by St Georges happy personal art  a manner of which it was the essence to conjure away false positions
It all took place in a moment
Paul was conscious that he knew him now conscious of his handshake and of the very quality of his hand of his face seen nearer and consequently seen better of a general fraternising assurance and in particular of the circumstance that St George didnt dislike him as yet at least for being imposed by a charming but too gushing girl attractive enough without such danglers
No irritation at any rate was reflected in the voice with which he questioned Miss Fancourt as to some project of a walk  a general walk of the company round the park
He had soon said something to Paul about a talk  We must have a tremendous lot of talk there are so many things arent there
 but our friend could see this idea wouldnt in the present case take very immediate effect
All the same he was extremely happy even after the matter of the walk had been settled  the three presently passed back to the other part of the gallery where it was discussed with several members of the party even when after they had all gone out together he found himself for half an hour conjoined with Mrs St George
Her husband had taken the advance with Miss Fancourt and this pair were quite out of sight
It was the prettiest of rambles for a summer afternoon  a grassy circuit of immense extent skirting the limit of the park within
The park was completely surrounded by its old mottled but perfect red wall which all the way on their left constituted in itself an object of interest
Mrs St George mentioned to him the surprising number of acres thus enclosed together with numerous other facts relating to the property and the family and the familys other properties she couldnt too strongly urge on him the importance of seeing their other houses
She ran over the names of these and rang the changes on them with the facility of practice making them appear an almost endless list
She had received Paul Overt very amiably on his breaking ground with her by the mention of his joy in having just made her husbands acquaintance and struck him as so alert and so accommodating a little woman that he was rather ashamed of his MOT about her to Miss Fancourt though he reflected that a hundred other people on a hundred occasions would have been sure to make it
He got on with Ms St George in short better than he expected but this didnt prevent her suddenly becoming aware that she was faint with fatigue and must take her way back to the house by the shortest cut
She professed that she hadnt the strength of a kitten and was a miserable wreck a character he had been too preoccupied to discern in her while he wondered in what sense she could be held to have been the making of her husband
He had arrived at a glimmering of the answer when she announced that she must leave him though this perception was of course provisional
While he was in the very act of placing himself at her disposal for the return the situation underwent a change Lord Masham had suddenly turned up coming back to them overtaking them emerging from the shrubbery  Overt could scarcely have said how he appeared  and Mrs St George had protested that she wanted to be left alone and not to break up the party
A moment later she was walking off with Lord Masham
Our friend fell back and joined Lady Watermouth to whom he presently mentioned that Mrs St George had been obliged to renounce the attempt to go further
She oughtnt to have come out at all her ladyship rather grumpily remarked
Is she so very much of an invalid
Very bad indeed
And his hostess added with still greater austerity She oughtnt really to come to one
He wondered what was implied by this and presently gathered that it was not a reflexion on the ladys conduct or her moral nature it only represented that her strength was not equal to her aspirations
CHAPTER III The smokingroom at Summersoft was on the scale of the rest of the place high light commodious and decorated with such refined old carvings and mouldings that it seemed rather a bower for ladies who should sit at work at fading crewels than a parliament of gentlemen smoking strong cigars
The gentlemen mustered there in considerable force on the Sunday evening collecting mainly at one end in front of one of the cool fair fireplaces of white marble the entablature of which was adorned with a delicate little Italian subject
There was another in the wall that faced it and thanks to the mild summer night a fire in neither but a nucleus for aggregation was furnished on one side by a table in the chimneycorner laden with bottles decanters and tall tumblers
Paul Overt was a faithless smoker he would puff a cigarette for reasons with which tobacco had nothing to do
This was particularly the case on the occasion of which I speak his motive was the vision of a little direct talk with Henry St George
The tremendous communion of which the great man had held out hopes to him earlier in the day had not yet come off and this saddened him considerably for the party was to go its several ways immediately after breakfast on the morrow
He had however the disappointment of finding that apparently the author of Shadowmere was not disposed to prolong his vigil
He wasnt among the gentlemen assembled when Paul entered nor was he one of those who turned up in bright habiliments during the next ten minutes
The young man waited a little wondering if he had only gone to put on something extraordinary this would account for his delay as well as contribute further to Overts impression of his tendency to do the approved superficial thing
But he didnt arrive  he must have been putting on something more extraordinary than was probable
Our hero gave him up feeling a little injured a little wounded at this loss of twenty coveted words
He wasnt angry but he puffed his cigarette sighingly with the sense of something rare possibly missed
He wandered away with his regret and moved slowly round the room looking at the old prints on the walls
In this attitude he presently felt a hand on his shoulder and a friendly voice in his ear This is good
I hoped I should find you
I came down on purpose
St George was there without a change of dress and with a fine face  his graver one  to which our young man all in a flutter responded
He explained that it was only for the Master  the idea of a little talk  that he had sat up and that not finding him he had been on the point of going to bed
Well you know I dont smoke  my wife doesnt let me said St George looking for a place to sit down
Its very good for me  very good for me
Let us take that sofa
Do you mean smokings good for you
No no  her not letting me
Its a great thing to have a wife whos so sure of all the things one can do without
One might never find them out ones self
She doesnt allow me to touch a cigarette
They took possession of a sofa at a distance from the group of smokers and St George went on Have you got one yourself
Do you mean a cigarette
Dear no  a wife
No and yet Id give up my cigarette for one
Youd give up a good deal more than that St George returned
However youd get a great deal in return
Theres a something to be said for wives he added folding his arms and crossing his outstretched legs
He declined tobacco altogether and sat there without returning fire
His companion stopped smoking touched by his courtesy and after all they were out of the fumes their sofa was in a faraway corner
It would have been a mistake St George went on a great mistake for them to have separated without a little chat for I know all about you he said I know youre very remarkable
Youve written a very distinguished book
And how do you know it
Paul asked
Why my dear fellow its in the air its in the papers its everywhere
St George spoke with the immediate familiarity of a confrere  a tone that seemed to his neighbour the very rustle of the laurel
Youre on all mens lips and whats better on all womens
And Ive just been reading your book
Just
You hadnt read it this afternoon said Overt
How do you know that
I think you should know how I know it the young man laughed
I suppose Miss Fancourt told you
No indeed  she led me rather to suppose you had
Yes  thats much more what shed do
Doesnt she shed a rosy glow over life
But you didnt believe her
asked St George
No not when you came to us there
Did I pretend
did I pretend badly
But without waiting for an answer to this St George went on You ought always to believe such a girl as that  always always
Some women are meant to be taken with allowances and reserves but you must take HER just as she is
I like her very much said Paul Overt
Something in his tone appeared to excite on his companions part a momentary sense of the absurd perhaps it was the air of deliberation attending this judgement
St George broke into a laugh to reply
Its the best thing you can do with her
Shes a rare young lady
In point of fact however I confess I hadnt read you this afternoon
Then you see how right I was in this particular case not to believe Miss Fancourt
How right
how can I agree to that when I lost credit by it
Do you wish to pass exactly for what she represents you
Certainly you neednt be afraid Paul said
Ah my dear young man dont talk about passing  for the likes of me
Im passing away  nothing else than that
She has a better use for her young imagination isnt it fine
than in representing in any way such a weary wasted usedup animal
The Master spoke with a sudden sadness that produced a protest on Pauls part but before the protest could be uttered he went on reverting to the latters striking novel I had no idea you were so good  one hears of so many things
But youre surprisingly good
Im going to be surprisingly better Overt made bold to reply
I see that and its what fetches me
I dont see so much else  as one looks about  thats going to be surprisingly better
Theyre going to be consistently worse  most of the things
Its so much easier to be worse  heaven knows Ive found it so
Im not in a great glow you know about whats breaking out all over the place
But you MUST be better  you really must keep it up
I havent of course
Its very difficult  thats the devil of the whole thing keeping it up
But I see youll be able to
It will be a great disgrace if you dont
Its very interesting to hear you speak of yourself but I dont know what you mean by your allusions to your having fallen off Paul Overt observed with pardonable hypocrisy
He liked his companion so much now that the fact of any decline of talent or of care had ceased for the moment to be vivid to him
Dont say that  dont say that St George returned gravely his head resting on the top of the sofaback and his eyes on the ceiling
You know perfectly what I mean
I havent read twenty pages of your book without seeing that you cant help it
You make me very miserable Paul ecstatically breathed
Im glad of that for it may serve as a kind of warning
Shocking enough it must be especially to a young fresh mind full of faith  the spectacle of a man meant for better things sunk at my age in such dishonour
St George in the same contemplative attitude spoke softly but deliberately and without perceptible emotion
His tone indeed suggested an impersonal lucidity that was practically cruel  cruel to himself  and made his young friend lay an argumentative hand on his arm
But he went on while his eyes seemed to follow the graces of the eighteenthcentury ceiling Look at me well take my lesson to heart  for it IS a lesson
Let that good come of it at least that you shudder with your pitiful impression and that this may help to keep you straight in the future
Dont become in your old age what I have in mine  the depressing the deplorable illustration of the worship of false gods
What do you mean by your old age
the young man asked
It has made me old
But I like your youth
Paul answered nothing  they sat for a minute in silence
They heard the others going on about the governmental majority
Then What do you mean by false gods
he enquired
His companion had no difficulty whatever in saying The idols of the market money and luxury and the world placing ones children and dressing ones wife everything that drives one to the short and easy way
Ah the vile things they make one do
But surely ones right to want to place ones children
One has no business to have any children St George placidly declared
I mean of course if one wants to do anything good
But arent they an inspiration  an incentive
An incentive to damnation artistically speaking
You touch on very deep things  things I should like to discuss with you Paul said
I should like you to tell me volumes about yourself
This is a great feast for ME
Of course it is cruel youth
But to show you Im still not incapable degraded as I am of an act of faith Ill tie my vanity to the stake for you and burn it to ashes
You must come and see me  you must come and see us the Master quickly substituted
Mrs St George is charming I dont know whether youve had any opportunity to talk with her
Shell be delighted to see you she likes great celebrities whether incipient or predominant
You must come and dine  my wife will write to you
Where are you to be found
This is my little address  and Overt drew out his pocketbook and extracted a visitingcard
On second thoughts however he kept it back remarking that he wouldnt trouble his friend to take charge of it but would come and see him straightway in London and leave it at his door if he should fail to obtain entrance
Ah youll probably fail my wifes always out  or when she isnt out is knocked up from having been out
You must come and dine  though that wont do much good either for my wife insists on big dinners
St George turned it over further but then went on You must come down and see us in the country thats the best way weve plenty of room and it isnt bad
Youve a house in the country
Paul asked enviously
Ah not like this
But we have a sort of place we go to  an hour from Euston
Thats one of the reasons
One of the reasons
Why my books are so bad
You must tell me all the others
Paul longingly laughed
His friend made no direct rejoinder to this but spoke again abruptly
Why have I never seen you before
The tone of the question was singularly flattering to our hero who felt it to imply the great mans now perceiving he had for years missed something
Partly I suppose because there has been no particular reason why you should see me
I havent lived in the world  in your world
Ive spent many years out of England in different places abroad
Well please dont do it any more
You must do England  theres such a lot of it
Do you mean I must write about it
and Paul struck the note of the listening candour of a child
Of course you must
And tremendously well do you mind
That takes off a little of my esteem for this thing of yours  that it goes on abroad
Hang abroad
Stay at home and do things here  do subjects we can measure
Ill do whatever you tell me Overt said deeply attentive
But pardon me if I say I dont understand how youve been reading my book he added
Ive had you before me all the afternoon first in that long walk then at tea on the lawn till we went to dress for dinner and all the evening at dinner and in this place
St George turned his face about with a smile
I gave it but a quarter of an hour
A quarter of an hours immense but I dont understand where you put it in
In the drawingroom after dinner you werent reading  you were talking to Miss Fancourt
It comes to the same thing because we talked about Ginistrella
She described it to me  she lent me her copy
Lent it to you
She travels with it
Its incredible Paul blushed
Its glorious for you but it also turned out very well for me
When the ladies went off to bed she kindly offered to send the book down to me
Her maid brought it to me in the hall and I went to my room with it
I hadnt thought of coming here I do that so little
But I dont sleep early I always have to read an hour or two
I sat down to your novel on the spot without undressing without taking off anything but my coat
I think thats a sign my curiosity had been strongly roused about it
I read a quarter of an hour as I tell you and even in a quarter of an hour I was greatly struck
Ah the beginning isnt very good  its the whole thing
said Overt who had listened to this recital with extreme interest
And you laid down the book and came after me
he asked
Thats the way it moved me
I said to myself I see its off his own bat and hes there by the way and the days over and I havent said twenty words to him
It occurred to me that youd probably be in the smokingroom and that it wouldnt be too late to repair my omission
I wanted to do something civil to you so I put on my coat and came down
I shall read your book again when I go up
Our friend faced round in his place  he was touched as he had scarce ever been by the picture of such a demonstration in his favour
Youre really the kindest of men
Cela sest passe comme ca
 and Ive been sitting here with you all this time and never apprehended it and never thanked you
Thank Miss Fancourt  it was she who wound me up
She has made me feel as if I had read your novel
Shes an angel from heaven
Paul declared
She is indeed
Ive never seen any one like her
Her interest in literatures touching  something quite peculiar to herself she takes it all so seriously
She feels the arts and she wants to feel them more
To those who practise them its almost humiliating  her curiosity her sympathy her good faith
How can anything be as fine as she supposes it
Shes a rare organisation the younger man sighed
The richest Ive ever seen  an artistic intelligence really of the first order
And lodged in such a form
St George exclaimed
One would like to represent such a girl as that Paul continued
Ah there it is  theres nothing like life
said his companion
When youre finished squeezed dry and used up and you think the sacks empty youre still appealed to you still get touches and thrills the idea springs up  out of the lap of the actual  and shows you theres always something to be done
But I shant do it  shes not for me
How do you mean not for you
Oh its all over  shes for you if you like
Ah much less
said Paul
Shes not for a dingy little man of letters shes for the world the bright rich world of bribes and rewards
And the world will take hold of her  it will carry her away
It will try  but its just a case in which there may be a fight
It would be worth fighting for a man who had it in him with youth and talent on his side
These words rang not a little in Paul Overts consciousness  they held him briefly silent
Its a wonder she has remained as she is giving herself away so  with so much to give away
Remaining you mean so ingenuous  so natural
Oh she doesnt care a straw  she gives away because she overflows
She has her own feelings her own standards she doesnt keep remembering that she must be proud
And then she hasnt been here long enough to be spoiled she has picked up a fashion or two but only the amusing ones
Shes a provincial  a provincial of genius St George went on her very blunders are charming her mistakes are interesting
She has come back from Asia with all sorts of excited curiosities and unappeased appetities
Shes firstrate herself and she expends herself on the secondrate
Shes life herself and she takes a rare interest in imitations
She mixes all things up but there are none in regard to which she hasnt perceptions
She sees things in a perspective  as if from the top of the Himalayas  and she enlarges everything she touches
Above all she exaggerates  to herself I mean
She exaggerates you and me
There was nothing in that description to allay the agitation caused in our younger friend by such a sketch of a fine subject
It seemed to him to show the art of St Georges admired hand and he lost himself in gazing at the vision  this hovered there before him  of a womans figure which should be part of the glory of a novel
But at the end of a moment the thing had turned into smoke and out of the smoke  the last puff of a big cigar  proceeded the voice of General Fancourt who had left the others and come and planted himself before the gentlemen on the sofa
I suppose that when you fellows get talking you sit up half the night
Half the night
 jamais de la vie
I follow a hygiene  and St George rose to his feet
I see  youre hothouse plants laughed the General
Thats the way you produce your flowers
I produce mine between ten and one every morning  I bloom with a regularity
St George went on
And with a splendour
added the polite General while Paul noted how little the author of Shadowmere minded as he phrased it to himself when addressed as a celebrated storyteller
The young man had an idea HE should never get used to that it would always make him uncomfortable  from the suspicion that people would think they had to  and he would want to prevent it
Evidently his great colleague had toughened and hardened  had made himself a surface
The group of men had finished their cigars and taken up their bedroom candlesticks but before they all passed out Lord Watermouth invited the pair of guests who had been so absorbed together to have something
It happened that they both declined upon which General Fancourt said Is that the hygiene
You dont water the flowers
Oh I should drown them
St George replied but leaving the room still at his young friends side he added whimsically for the latters benefit in a lower tone My wife doesnt let me
Well Im glad Im not one of you fellows
the General richly concluded
The nearness of Summersoft to London had this consequence chilling to a person who had had a vision of sociability in a railway carriage that most of the company after breakfast drove back to town entering their own vehicles which had come out to fetch them while their servants returned by train with their luggage
Three or four young men among whom was Paul Overt also availed themselves of the common convenience but they stood in the portico of the house and saw the others roll away
Miss Fancourt got into a victoria with her father after she had shaken hands with our hero and said smiling in the frankest way in the world I MUST see you more
Mrs St George is so nice she has promised to ask us both to dinner together
This lady and her husband took their places in a perfectlyappointed brougham  she required a closed carriage  and as our young man waved his hat to them in response to their nods and flourishes he reflected that taken together they were an honourable image of success of the material rewards and the social credit of literature
Such things were not the full measure but he nevertheless felt a little proud for literature
CHAPTER IV Before a week had elapsed he met Miss Fancourt in Bond Street at a private view of the works of a young artist in blackandwhite who had been so good as to invite him to the stuffy scene
The drawings were admirable but the crowd in the one little room was so dense that he felt himself up to his neck in a sack of wool
A fringe of people at the outer edge endeavoured by curving forward their backs and presenting below them a still more convex surface of resistance to the pressure of the mass to preserve an interval between their noses and the glazed mounts of the pictures while the central body in the comparative gloom projected by a wide horizontal screen hung under the skylight and allowing only a margin for the day remained upright dense and vague lost in the contemplation of its own ingredients
This contemplation sat especially in the sad eyes of certain female heads surmounted with hats of strange convolution and plumage which rose on long necks above the others
One of the heads Paul perceived was much the so most beautiful of the collection and his next discovery was that it belonged to Miss Fancourt
Its beauty was enhanced by the glad smile she sent him across surrounding obstructions a smile that drew him to her as fast as he could make his way
He had seen for himself at Summersoft that the last thing her nature contained was an affectation of indifference yet even with this circumspection he took a fresh satisfaction in her not having pretended to await his arrival with composure
She smiled as radiantly as if she wished to make him hurry and as soon as he came within earshot she broke out in her voice of joy Hes here  hes here  hes coming back in a moment
Ah your father
Paul returned as she offered him her hand
Oh dear no this isnt in my poor fathers line
I mean Mr St George
He has just left me to speak to some one  hes coming back
Its he who brought me  wasnt it charming
Ah that gives him a pull over me  I couldnt have brought you could I
If you had been so kind as to propose it  why not you as well as he
the girl returned with a face that expressing no cheap coquetry simply affirmed a happy fact
Why hes a pere de famille
Theyve privileges Paul explained
And then quickly Will you go to see places with ME
he asked
Anything you like
she smiled
I know what you mean that girls have to have a lot of people   Then she broke off I dont know Im free
Ive always been like that  I can go about with any one
Im so glad to meet you she added with a sweet distinctness that made those near her turn round
Let me at least repay that speech by taking you out of this squash her friend said
Surely people arent happy here
No theyre awfully mornes arent they
But Im very happy indeed and I promised Mr St George to remain in this spot till he comes back
Hes going to take me away
They send him invitations for things of this sort  more than he wants
It was so kind of him to think of me
They also send me invitations of this kind  more than I want
And if thinking of YOU will do it  
Paul went on
Oh I delight in them  everything thats life  everything thats London
They dont have private views in Asia I suppose he laughed
But what a pity that for this year even in this gorged city theyre pretty well over
Well next year will do for I hope you believe were going to be friends always
Here he comes
Miss Fancourt continued before Paul had time to respond
He made out St George in the gaps of the crowd and this perhaps led to his hurrying a little to say I hope that doesnt mean Im to wait till next year to see you
No no  arent we to meet at dinner on the twentyfifth
she panted with an eagerness as happy as his own
Thats almost next year
Is there no means of seeing you before
She stared with all her brightness
Do you mean youd COME
Like a shot if youll be so good as to ask me
On Sunday then  this next Sunday
What have I done that you should doubt it
the young man asked with delight
Miss Fancourt turned instantly to St George who had now joined them and announced triumphantly Hes coming on Sunday  this next Sunday
Ah my day  my day too
said the famous novelist laughing to their companion
Yes but not yours only
You shall meet in Manchester Square you shall talk  you shall be wonderful
We dont meet often enough St George allowed shaking hands with his disciple
Too many things  ah too many things
But we must make it up in the country in September
You wont forget youve promised me that
Why hes coming on the twentyfifth  youll see him then said the girl
On the twentyfifth
St George asked vaguely
We dine with you I hope you havent forgotten
Hes dining out that day she added gaily to Paul
Oh bless me yes  thats charming
And youre coming
My wife didnt tell me St George said to him
Too many things  too many things
he repeated
Too many people  too many people
Paul exclaimed giving ground before the penetration of an elbow
You oughtnt to say that
They all read you
Me
I should like to see them
Only two or three at most the young man returned
Did you ever hear anything like that
He knows haughtily how good he is
St George declared laughing to Miss Fancourt
They read ME but that doesnt make me like them any better
Come away from them come away
And he led the way out of the exhibition
Hes going to take me to the Park Miss Fancourt observed to Overt with elation as they passed along the corridor that led to the street
Ah does he go there
Paul asked taking the fact for a somewhat unexpected illustration of St Georges moeurs
Its a beautiful day  therell be a great crowd
Were going to look at the people to look at types the girl went on
We shall sit under the trees we shall walk by the Row
I go once a year  on business said St George who had overheard Pauls question
Or with a country cousin didnt you tell me
Im the country cousin
she continued over her shoulder to Paul as their friend drew her toward a hansom to which he had signalled
The young man watched them get in he returned as he stood there the friendly wave of the hand with which ensconced in the vehicle beside her St George took leave of him
He even lingered to see the vehicle start away and lose itself in the confusion of Bond Street
He followed it with his eyes it put to him embarrassing things
Shes not for ME
the great novelist had said emphatically at Summersoft but his manner of conducting himself toward her appeared not quite in harmony with such a conviction
How could he have behaved differently if she HAD been for him
An indefinite envy rose in Paul Overts heart as he took his way on foot alone a feeling addressed alike strangely enough to each of the occupants of the hansom
How much he should like to rattle about London with such a girl
How much he should like to go and look at types with St George
The next Sunday at four oclock he called in Manchester Square where his secret wish was gratified by his finding Miss Fancourt alone
She was in a large bright friendly occupied room which was painted red all over draped with the quaint cheap florid stuffs that are represented as coming from southern and eastern countries where they are fabled to serve as the counterpanes of the peasantry and bedecked with pottery of vivid hues ranged on casual shelves and with many watercolour drawings from the hand as the visitor learned of the young lady herself commemorating with a brave breadth the sunsets the mountains the temples and palaces of India
He sat an hour  more than an hour two hours  and all the while no one came in
His hostess was so good as to remark with her liberal humanity that it was delightful they werent interrupted it was so rare in London especially at that season that people got a good talk
But luckily now of a fine Sunday half the world went out of town and that made it better for those who didnt go when these others were in sympathy
It was the defect of London  one of two or three the very short list of those she recognised in the teeming worldcity she adored  that there were too few good chances for talk you never had time to carry anything far
Too many things  too many things
Paul said quoting St Georges exclamation of a few days before
Ah yes for him there are too many  his lifes too complicated
Have you seen it NEAR
Thats what I should like to do it might explain some mysteries her visitor went on
She asked him what mysteries he meant and he said Oh peculiarities of his work inequalities superficialities
For one who looks at it from the artistic point of view it contains a bottomless ambiguity
She became at this on the spot all intensity
Ah do describe that more  its so interesting
There are no such suggestive questions
Im so fond of them
He thinks hes a failure  fancy
she beautifully wailed
That depends on what his ideal may have been
With his gifts it ought to have been high
But till one knows what he really proposed to himself  
Do YOU know by chance
the young man broke off
Oh he doesnt talk to me about himself
I cant make him
Its too provoking
Paul was on the point of asking what then he did talk about but discretion checked it and he said instead Do you think hes unhappy at home
She seemed to wonder
At home
I mean in his relations with his wife
He has a mystifying little way of alluding to her
Not to me said Marian Fancourt with her clear eyes
That wouldnt be right would it
she asked gravely
Not particularly so Im glad he doesnt mention her to you
To praise her might bore you and he has no business to do anything else
Yet he knows you better than me
Ah but he respects YOU
the girl cried as with envy
Her visitor stared a moment then broke into a laugh
Doesnt he respect you
Of course but not in the same way
He respects what youve done  he told me so the other day
Paul drank it in but retained his faculties
When you went to look at types
Yes  we found so many he has such an observation of them
He talked a great deal about your book
He says its really important
Important
Ah the grand creature
 and the author of the work in question groaned for joy
He was wonderfully amusing he was inexpressibly droll while we walked about
He sees everything he has so many comparisons and images and theyre always exactly right
Cest dun trouve as they say
Yes with his gifts such things as he ought to have done
Paul sighed
And dont you think he HAS done them
Ah it was just the point
A part of them and of course even that parts immense
But he might have been one of the greatest
However let us not make this an hour of qualifications
Even as they stand our friend earnestly concluded his writings are a mine of gold
To this proposition she ardently responded and for half an hour the pair talked over the Masters principal productions
She knew them well  she knew them even better than her visitor who was struck with her critical intelligence and with something large and bold in the movement in her mind
She said things that startled him and that evidently had come to her directly they werent pickedup phrases  she placed them too well
St George had been right about her being firstrate about her not being afraid to gush not remembering that she must be proud
Suddenly something came back to her and she said I recollect that he did speak of Mrs St George to me once
He said apropos of something or other that she didnt care for perfection
Thats a great crime in an artists wife Paul returned
Yes poor thing
and the girl sighed with a suggestion of many reflexions some of them mitigating
But she presently added Ah perfection perfection  how one ought to go in for it
I wish I could
Every one can in his way her companion opined
In HIS way yes  but not in hers
Women are so hampered  so condemned
Yet its a kind of dishonour if you dont when you want to DO something isnt it
Miss Fancourt pursued dropping one train in her quickness to take up another an accident that was common with her
So these two young persons sat discussing high themes in their eclectic drawingroom in their London season  discussing with extreme seriousness the high theme of perfection
It must be said in extenuation of this eccentricity that they were interested in the business
Their tone had truth and their emotion beauty they werent posturing for each other or for some one else
The subject was so wide that they found themselves reducing it the perfection to which for the moment they agreed to confine their speculations was that of the valid the exemplary work of art
Our young womans imagination it appeared had wandered far in that direction and her guest had the rare delight of feeling in their conversation a full interchange
This episode will have lived for years in his memory and even in his wonder it had the quality that fortune distils in a single drop at a time  the quality that lubricates many ensuing frictions
He still whenever he likes has a vision of the room the bright red sociable talkative room with the curtains that by a stroke of successful audacity had the note of vivid blue
He remembers where certain things stood the particular book open on the table and the almost intense odour of the flowers placed at the left somewhere behind him
These facts were the fringe as it were of a fine special agitation which had its birth in those two hours and of which perhaps the main sign was in its leading him inwardly and repeatedly to breathe I had no idea there was any one like this  I had no idea there was any one like this
Her freedom amazed him and charmed him  it seemed so to simplify the practical question
She was on the footing of an independent personage  a motherless girl who had passed out of her teens and had a position and responsibilities who wasnt held down to the limitations of a little miss
She came and went with no dragged duenna she received people alone and though she was totally without hardness the question of protection or patronage had no relevancy in regard to her
She gave such an impression of the clear and the noble combined with the easy and the natural that in spite of her eminent modern situation she suggested no sort of sisterhood with the fast girl
Modern she was indeed and made Paul Overt who loved old colour the golden glaze of time think with some alarm of the muddled palette of the future
He couldnt get used to her interest in the arts he cared for it seemed too good to be real  it was so unlikely an adventure to tumble into such a well of sympathy
One might stray into the desert easily  that was on the cards and that was the law of life but it was too rare an accident to stumble on a crystal well
Yet if her aspirations seemed at one moment too extravagant to be real they struck him at the next as too intelligent to be false
They were both high and lame and whims for whims he preferred them to any he had met in a like relation
It was probable enough she would leave them behind  exchange them for politics or smartness or mere prolific maternity as was the custom of scribbling daubing educated flattered girls in an age of luxury and a society of leisure
He noted that the watercolours on the walls of the room she sat in had mainly the quality of being naives and reflected that naivete in art is like a zero in a number its importance depends on the figure it is united with
Meanwhile however he had fallen in love with her
Before he went away at any rate he said to her I thought St George was coming to see you today but he doesnt turn up
For a moment he supposed she was going to cry Comment donc
Did you come here only to meet him
But the next he became aware of how little such a speech would have fallen in with any note of flirtation he had as yet perceived in her
She only replied Ah yes but I dont think hell come
He recommended me not to expect him
Then she gaily but all gently added He said it wasnt fair to you
But I think I could manage two
So could I Paul Overt returned stretching the point a little to meet her
In reality his appreciation of the occasion was so completely an appreciation of the woman before him that another figure in the scene even so esteemed a one as St George might for the hour have appealed to him vainly
He left the house wondering what the great man had meant by its not being fair to him and still more than that whether he had actually stayed away from the force of that idea
As he took his course through the Sunday solitude of Manchester Square swinging his stick and with a good deal of emotion fermenting in his soul it appeared to him he was living in a world strangely magnanimous
Miss Fancourt had told him it was possible she should be away and that her father should be on the following Sunday but that she had the hope of a visit from him in the other event
She promised to let him know should their absence fail and then he might act accordingly
After he had passed into one of the streets that open from the Square he stopped without definite intentions looking sceptically for a cab
In a moment he saw a hansom roll through the place from the other side and come a part of the way toward him
He was on the point of hailing the driver when he noticed a fare within then he waited seeing the man prepare to deposit his passenger by pulling up at one of the houses
The house was apparently the one he himself had just quitted at least he drew that inference as he recognised Henry St George in the person who stepped out of the hansom
Paul turned off as quickly as if he had been caught in the act of spying
He gave up his cab  he preferred to walk he would go nowhere else
He was glad St George hadnt renounced his visit altogether  that would have been too absurd
Yes the world was magnanimous and even he himself felt so as on looking at his watch he noted but six oclock so that he could mentally congratulate his successor on having an hour still to sit in Miss Fancourts drawingroom
He himself might use that hour for another visit but by the time he reached the Marble Arch the idea of such a course had become incongruous to him
He passed beneath that architectural effort and walked into the Park till he got upon the spreading grass
Here he continued to walk he took his way across the elastic turf and came out by the Serpentine
He watched with a friendly eye the diversions of the London people he bent a glance almost encouraging on the young ladies paddling their sweethearts about the lake and the guardsmen tickling tenderly with their bearskins the artificial flowers in the Sunday hats of their partners
He prolonged his meditative walk he went into Kensington Gardens he sat upon the penny chairs he looked at the little sailboats launched upon the round pond and was glad he had no engagement to dine
He repaired for this purpose very late to his club where he found himself unable to order a repast and told the waiter to bring whatever there was
He didnt even observe what he was served with and he spent the evening in the library of the establishment pretending to read an article in an American magazine
He failed to discover what it was about it appeared in a dim way to be about Marian Fancourt
Quite late in the week she wrote to him that she was not to go into the country  it had only just been settled
Her father she added would never settle anything but put it all on her
She felt her responsibility  she had to  and since she was forced this was the way she had decided
She mentioned no reasons which gave our friend all the clearer field for bold conjecture about them
In Manchester Square on this second Sunday he esteemed his fortune less good for she had three or four other visitors
But there were three or four compensations perhaps the greatest of which was that learning how her father had after all at the last hour gone out of town alone the bold conjecture I just now spoke of found itself becoming a shade more bold
And then her presence was her presence and the personal red room was there and was full of it whatever phantoms passed and vanished emitting incomprehensible sounds
Lastly he had the resource of staying till every one had come and gone and of believing this grateful to her though she gave no particular sign
When they were alone together he came to his point
But St George did come  last Sunday
I saw him as I looked back
Yes but it was the last time
The last time
He said he would never come again
Paul Overt stared
Does he mean he wishes to cease to see you
I dont know what he means the girl bravely smiled
He wont at any rate see me here
And pray why not
I havent the least idea said Marian Fancourt whose visitor found her more perversely sublime than ever yet as she professed this clear helplessness
CHAPTER V Oh I say I want you to stop a little Henry St George said to him at eleven oclock the night he dined with the head of the profession
The company  none of it indeed OF the profession  had been numerous and was taking its leave our young man after bidding goodnight to his hostess had put out his hand in farewell to the master of the house
Besides drawing from the latter the protest I have cited this movement provoked a further priceless word about their chance now to have a talk their going into his room his having still everything to say
Paul Overt was all delight at this kindness nevertheless he mentioned in weak jocose qualification the bare fact that he had promised to go to another place which was at a considerable distance
Well then youll break your promise thats all
You quite awful humbug
St George added in a tone that confirmed our young mans ease
Certainly Ill break it  but it was a real promise
Do you mean to Miss Fancourt
Youre following her
his friend asked
He answered by a question
Oh is SHE going
Base impostor
his ironic host went on
Ive treated you handsomely on the article of that young lady I wont make another concession
Wait three minutes  Ill be with you
He gave himself to his departing guests accompanied the longtrained ladies to the door
It was a hot night the windows were open the sound of the quick carriages and of the linkmens call came into the house
The affair had rather glittered a sense of festal things was in the heavy air not only the influence of that particular entertainment but the suggestion of the wide hurry of pleasure which in London on summer nights fills so many of the happier quarters of the complicated town
Gradually Mrs St Georges drawingroom emptied itself Paul was left alone with his hostess to whom he explained the motive of his waiting
Ah yes some intellectual some PROFESSIONAL talk she leered at this season doesnt one miss it
Poor dear Henry Im so glad
The young man looked out of the window a moment at the called hansoms that lurched up at the smooth broughams that rolled away
When he turned round Mrs St George had disappeared her husbands voice rose to him from below  he was laughing and talking in the portico with some lady who awaited her carriage
Paul had solitary possession for some minutes of the warm deserted rooms where the covered tinted lamplight was soft the seats had been pushed about and the odour of flowers lingered
They were large they were pretty they contained objects of value everything in the picture told of a good house
At the end of five minutes a servant came in with a request from the Master that he would join him downstairs upon which descending he followed his conductor through a long passage to an apartment thrown out in the rear of the habitation for the special requirements as he guessed of a busy man of letters
St George was in his shirtsleeves in the middle of a large high room  a room without windows but with a wide skylight at the top that of a place of exhibition
It was furnished as a library and the serried bookshelves rose to the ceiling a surface of incomparable tone produced by dimlygilt backs interrupted here and there by the suspension of old prints and drawings
At the end furthest from the door of admission was a tall desk of great extent at which the person using it could write only in the erect posture of a clerk in a countinghouse and stretched from the entrance to this structure was a wide plain band of crimson cloth as straight as a gardenpath and almost as long where in his minds eye Paul at once beheld the Master pace to and fro during vexed hours  hours that is of admirable composition
The servant gave him a coat an old jacket with a hang of experience from a cupboard in the wall retiring afterwards with the garment he had taken off
Paul Overt welcomed the coat it was a coat for talk it promised confidences  having visibly received so many  and had tragic literary elbows
Ah were practical  were practical
St George said as he saw his visitor look the place over
Isnt it a good big cage for going round and round
My wife invented it and she locks me up here every morning
Our young man breathed  by way of tribute  with a certain oppression
You dont miss a window  a place to look out
I did at first awfully but her calculation was just
It saves time it has saved me many months in these ten years
Here I stand under the eye of day  in London of course very often its rather a bleared old eye  walled in to my trade
I cant get away  so the rooms a fine lesson in concentration
Ive learnt the lesson I think look at that big bundle of proof and acknowledge it
He pointed to a fat roll of papers on one of the tables which had not been undone
Are you bringing out another 
Paul asked in a tone the fond deficiencies of which he didnt recognise till his companion burst out laughing and indeed scarce even then
You humbug you humbug
 St George appeared to enjoy caressing him as it were with that opprobrium
Dont I know what you think of them
he asked standing there with his hands in his pockets and with a new kind of smile
It was as if he were going to let his young votary see him all now
Upon my word in that case you know more than I do
the latter ventured to respond revealing a part of the torment of being able neither clearly to esteem nor distinctly to renounce him
My dear fellow said the more and more interesting Master dont imagine I talk about my books specifically theyre not a decent subject  il ne manquerait plus que ca
Im not so bad as you may apprehend
About myself yes a little if you like though it wasnt for that I brought you down here
I want to ask you something  very much indeed I value this chance
Therefore sit down
Were practical but there IS a sofa you see  for she does humour my poor bones so far
Like all really great administrators and disciplinarians she knows when wisely to relax
Paul sank into the corner of a deep leathern couch but his friend remained standing and explanatory
If you dont mind in this room this is my habit
From the door to the desk and from the desk to the door
That shakes up my imagination gently and dont you see what a good thing it is that theres no window for her to fly out of
The eternal standing as I write I stop at that bureau and put it down when anything comes and so we go on was rather wearisome at first but we adopted it with an eye to the long run youre in better order  if your legs dont break down
 and you can keep it up for more years
Oh were practical  were practical
St George repeated going to the table and taking up all mechanically the bundle of proofs
But pulling off the wrapper he had a change of attention that appealed afresh to our hero
He lost himself a moment examining the sheets of his new book while the younger mans eyes wandered over the room again
Lord what good things I should do if I had such a charming place as this to do them in
Paul reflected
The outer world the world of accident and ugliness was so successfully excluded and within the rich protecting square beneath the patronising sky the dream figures the summoned company could hold their particular revel
It was a fond prevision of Overts rather than an observation on actual data for which occasions had been too few that the Master thus more closely viewed would have the quality the charming gift of flashing out all surprisingly in personal intercourse and at moments of suspended or perhaps even of diminished expectation
A happy relation with him would be a thing proceeding by jumps not by traceable stages
Do you read them  really
he asked laying down the proofs on Pauls enquiring of him how soon the work would be published
And when the young man answered Oh yes always he was moved to mirth again by something he caught in his manner of saying that
You go to see your grandmother on her birthday  and very proper it is especially as she wont last for ever
She has lost every faculty and every sense she neither sees nor hears nor speaks but all customary pieties and kindly habits are respectable
Only youre strong if you DO read em
I couldnt my dear fellow
You are strong I know and thats just a part of what I wanted to say to you
Youre very strong indeed
Ive been going into your other things  theyve interested me immensely
Some one ought to have told me about them before  some one I could believe
But whom can one believe
Youre wonderfully on the right road  its awfully decent work
Now do you mean to keep it up
 thats what I want to ask you
Do I mean to do others
Paul asked looking up from his sofa at his erect inquisitor and feeling partly like a happy little boy when the schoolmaster is gay and partly like some pilgrim of old who might have consulted a worldfamous oracle
St Georges own performance had been infirm but as an adviser he would be infallible
Others  others
Ah the number wont matter one other would do if it were really a further step  a throb of the same effort
What I mean is have you it in your heart to go in for some sort of decent perfection
Ah decency ah perfection 
the young man sincerely sighed
I talked of them the other Sunday with Miss Fancourt
It produced on the Masters part a laugh of odd acrimony
Yes theyll talk of them as much as you like
But theyll do little to help one to them
Theres no obligation of course only you strike me as capable he went on
You must have thought it all over
I cant believe youre without a plan
Thats the sensation you give me and its so rare that it really stirs one up  it makes you remarkable
If you havent a plan if you DONT mean to keep it up surely youre within your rights its nobodys business no one can force you and not more than two or three people will notice you dont go straight
The others  ALL the rest every blest soul in England will think you do  will think you are keeping it up upon my honour they will
I shall be one of the two or three who know better
Now the question is whether you can do it for two or three
Is that the stuff youre made of
It locked his guest a minute as in closed throbbing arms
I could do it for one if you were the one
Dont say that I dont deserve it it scorches me he protested with eyes suddenly grave and glowing
The one is of course ones self ones conscience ones idea the singleness of ones aim
I think of that pure spirit as a man thinks of a woman he has in some detested hour of his youth loved and forsaken
She haunts him with reproachful eyes she lives for ever before him
As an artist you know Ive married for money
Paul stared and even blushed a little confounded by this avowal whereupon his host observing the expression of his face dropped a quick laugh and pursued You dont follow my figure
Im not speaking of my dear wife who had a small fortune  which however was not my bribe
I fell in love with her as many other people have done
I refer to the mercenary muse whom I led to the altar of literature
Dont my boy put your nose into THAT yoke
The awful jade will lead you a life
Our hero watched him wondering and deeply touched
Havent you been happy
Happy
Its a kind of hell
There are things I should like to ask you Paul said after a pause
Ask me anything in all the world
Id turn myself inside out to save you
To save me
he quavered
To make you stick to it  to make you see it through
As I said to you the other night at Summersoft let my example be vivid to you
Why your books are not so bad as that said Paul fairly laughing and feeling that if ever a fellow had breathed the air of art  
So bad as what
Your talents so great that its in everything you do in whats less good as well as in whats best
Youve some forty volumes to show for it  forty volumes of wonderful life of rare observation of magnificent ability
Im very clever of course I know that  but it was a thing in fine this author made nothing of
Lord what rot theyd all be if I hadnt been Im a successful charlatan he went on  Ive been able to pass off my system
But do you know what it is
Its cartonpierre
Cartonpierre
Paul was struck and gaped
LincrustaWalton
Ah dont say such things  you make me bleed
the younger man protested
I see you in a beautiful fortunate home living in comfort and honour
Do you call it honour
 his host took him up with an intonation that often comes back to him
Thats what I want YOU to go in for
I mean the real thing
This is brummagem
Brummagem
Paul ejaculated while his eyes wandered by a movement natural at the moment over the luxurious room
Ah they make it so well today  its wonderfully deceptive
Our friend thrilled with the interest and perhaps even more with the pity of it
Yet he wasnt afraid to seem to patronise when he could still so far envy
Is it deceptive that I find you living with every appearance of domestic felicity  blest with a devoted accomplished wife with children whose acquaintance I havent yet had the pleasure of making but who MUST be delightful young people from what I know of their parents
St George smiled as for the candour of his question
Its all excellent my dear fellow  heaven forbid I should deny it
Ive made a great deal of money my wife has known how to take care of it to use it without wasting it to put a good bit of it by to make it fructify
Ive got a loaf on the shelf Ive got everything in fact but the great thing
The great thing
Paul kept echoing
The sense of having done the best  the sense which is the real life of the artist and the absence of which is his death of having drawn from his intellectual instrument the finest music that nature had hidden in it of having played it as it should be played
He either does that or he doesnt  and if he doesnt he isnt worth speaking of
Therefore precisely those who really know DONT speak of him
He may still hear a great chatter but what he hears most is the incorruptible silence of Fame
Ive squared her you may say for my little hour  but whats my little hour
Dont imagine for a moment the Master pursued that Im such a cad as to have brought you down here to abuse or to complain of my wife to you
Shes a woman of distinguished qualities to whom my obligations are immense so that if you please well say nothing about her
My boys  my children are all boys  are straight and strong thank God and have no poverty of growth about them no penury of needs
I receive periodically the most satisfactory attestation from Harrow from Oxford from Sandhurst  oh weve done the best for them
 of their eminence as living thriving consuming organisms
It must be delightful to feel that the son of ones loins is at Sandhurst Paul remarked enthusiastically
It is  its charming
Oh Im a patriot
The young man then could but have the greater tribute of questions to pay
Then what did you mean  the other night at Summersoft  by saying that children are a curse
My dear youth on what basis are we talking
and St George dropped upon the sofa at a short distance from him
Sitting a little sideways he leaned back against the opposite arm with his hands raised and interlocked behind his head
On the supposition that a certain perfections possible and even desirable  isnt it so
Well all I say is that ones children interfere with perfection
Ones wife interferes
Marriage interferes
You think then the artist shouldnt marry
He does so at his peril  he does so at his cost
Not even when his wifes in sympathy with his work
She never is  she cant be
Women havent a conception of such things
Surely they on occasion work themselves Paul objected
Yes very badly indeed
Oh of course often they think they understand they think they sympathise
Then it is theyre most dangerous
Their idea is that you shall do a great lot and get a great lot of money
Their great nobleness and virtue their exemplary conscientiousness as British females is in keeping you up to that
My wife makes all my bargains with my publishers for me and has done so for twenty years
She does it consummately well  thats why Im really pretty well off
Arent you the father of their innocent babes and will you withhold from them their natural sustenance
You asked me the other night if theyre not an immense incentive
Of course they are  theres no doubt of that
Paul turned it over it took from eyes he had never felt open so wide so much looking at
For myself Ive an idea I need incentives
Ah well then nen parlons plus
his companion handsomely smiled
YOU are an incentive I maintain the young man went on
You dont affect me in the way youd apparently like to
Your great success is what I see  the pomp of Ennismore Gardens
Success
 St Georges eyes had a cold fine light
Do you call it success to be spoken of as youd speak of me if you were sitting here with another artist  a young man intelligent and sincere like yourself
Do you call it success to make you blush  as you would blush
 if some foreign critic some fellow of course I mean who should know what he was talking about and should have shown you he did as foreign critics like to show it were to say to you Hes the one in this country whom they consider the most perfect isnt he
Is it success to be the occasion of a young Englishmans having to stammer as you would have to stammer at such a moment for old England
No no success is to have made people wriggle to another tune
Do try it
Paul continued all gravely to glow
Try what
Try to do some really good work
Oh I want to heaven knows
Well you cant do it without sacrifices  dont believe that for a moment the Master said
Ive made none
Ive had everything
In other words Ive missed everything
Youve had the full rich masculine human general life with all the responsibilities and duties and burdens and sorrows and joys  all the domestic and social initiations and complications
They must be immensely suggestive immensely amusing Paul anxiously submitted
Amusing
For a strong man  yes
Theyve given me subjects without number if thats what you mean but theyve taken away at the same time the power to use them
Ive touched a thousand things but which one of them have I turned into gold
The artist has to do only with that  he knows nothing of any baser metal
Ive led the life of the world with my wife and my progeny the clumsy conventional expensive materialised vulgarised brutalised life of London
Weve got everything handsome even a carriage  were perfect Philistines and prosperous hospitable eminent people
But my dear fellow dont try to stultify yourself and pretend you dont know what we HAVENT got
Its bigger than all the rest
Between artists  come
the Master wound up
You know as well as you sit there that youd put a pistolball into your brain if you had written my books
It struck his listener that the tremendous talk promised by him at Summersoft had indeed come off and with a promptitude a fulness with which the latters young imagination had scarcely reckoned
His impression fairly shook him and he throbbed with the excitement of such deep soundings and such strange confidences
He throbbed indeed with the conflict of his feelings  bewilderment and recognition and alarm enjoyment and protest and assent all commingled with tenderness and a kind of shame in the participation for the sores and bruises exhibited by so fine a creature and with a sense of the tragic secret nursed under his trappings
The idea of HIS Paul Overts becoming the occasion of such an act of humility made him flush and pant at the same time that his consciousness was in certain directions too much alive not to swallow  and not intensely to taste  every offered spoonful of the revelation
It had been his odd fortune to blow upon the deep waters to make them surge and break in waves of strange eloquence
But how couldnt he give out a passionate contradiction of his hosts last extravagance how couldnt he enumerate to him the parts of his work he loved the splendid things he had found in it beyond the compass of any other writer of the day
St George listened a while courteously then he said laying his hand on his visitors Thats all very well and if your ideas to do nothing better theres no reason you shouldnt have as many good things as I  as many human and material appendages as many sons or daughters a wife with as many gowns a house with as many servants a stable with as many horses a heart with as many aches
The Master got up when he had spoken thus  he stood a moment  near the sofa looking down on his agitated pupil
Are you possessed of any property
it occurred to him to ask
None to speak of
Oh well then theres no reason why you shouldnt make a goodish income  if you set about it the right way
Study ME for that  study me well
You may really have horses
Paul sat there some minutes without speaking
He looked straight before him  he turned over many things
His friend had wandered away taking up a parcel of letters from the table where the roll of proofs had lain
What was the book Mrs St George made you burn  the one she didnt like
our young man brought out
The book she made me burn  how did you know that
The Master looked up from his letters quite without the facial convulsion the pupil had feared
I heard her speak of it at Summersoft
Ah yes  shes proud of it
I dont know  it was rather good
What was it about
Let me see
And he seemed to make an effort to remember
Oh yes  it was about myself
Paul gave an irrepressible groan for the disappearance of such a production and the elder man went on Oh but YOU should write it  YOU should do me
And he pulled up  from the restless motion that had come upon him his fine smile a generous glare
Theres a subject my boy no end of stuff in it
Again Paul was silent but it was all tormenting
Are there no women who really understand  who can take part in a sacrifice
How can they take part
They themselves are the sacrifice
Theyre the idol and the altar and the flame
Isnt there even ONE who sees further
Paul continued
For a moment St George made no answer after which having torn up his letters he came back to the point all ironic
Of course I know the one you mean
But not even Miss Fancourt
I thought you admired her so much
Its impossible to admire her more
Are you in love with her
St George asked
Yes Paul Overt presently said
Well then give it up
Paul stared
Give up my love
Bless me no
Your idea
And then as our hero but still gazed The one you talked with her about
The idea of a decent perfection
Shed help it  shed help it
the young man cried
For about a year  the first year yes
After that shed be as a millstone round its neck
Paul frankly wondered
Why she has a passion for the real thing for good work  for everything you and I care for most
You and I is charming my dear fellow
his friend laughed
She has it indeed but shed have a still greater passion for her children  and very proper too
Shed insist on everythings being made comfortable advantageous propitious for them
That isnt the artists business
The artist  the artist
Isnt he a man all the same
St George had a grand grimace
I mostly think not
You know as well as I what he has to do the concentration the finish the independence he must strive for from the moment he begins to wish his work really decent
Ah my young friend his relation to women and especially to the one hes most intimately concerned with is at the mercy of the damning fact that whereas he can in the nature of things have but one standard they have about fifty
Thats what makes them so superior St George amusingly added
Fancy an artist with a change of standards as youd have a change of shirts or of dinnerplates
To DO it  to do it and make it divine  is the only thing he has to think about
Is it done or not
is his only question
Not Is it done as well as a proper solicitude for my dear little family will allow
He has nothing to do with the relative  he has only to do with the absolute and a dear little family may represent a dozen relatives
Then you dont allow him the common passions and affections of men
Paul asked
Hasnt he a passion an affection which includes all the rest
Besides let him have all the passions he likes  if he only keeps his independence
He must be able to be poor
Paul slowly got up
Why then did you advise me to make up to her
St George laid his hand on his shoulder
Because shed make a splendid wife
And I hadnt read you then
The young man had a strained smile
I wish you had left me alone
I didnt know that that wasnt good enough for you his host returned
What a false position what a condemnation of the artist that hes a mere disfranchised monk and can produce his effect only by giving up personal happiness
What an arraignment of art
Paul went on with a trembling voice
Ah you dont imagine by chance that Im defending art
Arraignment  I should think so
Happy the societies in which it hasnt made its appearance for from the moment it comes they have a consuming ache they have an incurable corruption in their breast
Most assuredly is the artist in a false position
But I thought we were taking him for granted
Pardon me St George continued Ginistrella made me
Paul stood looking at the floor  one oclock struck in the stillness from a neighbouring churchtower
Do you think shed ever look at me
he put to his friend at last
Miss Fancourt  as a suitor
Why shouldnt I think it
Thats why Ive tried to favour you  Ive had a little chance or two of bettering your opportunity
Forgive my asking you but do you mean by keeping away yourself
Paul said with a blush
Im an old idiot  my place isnt there St George stated gravely
Im nothing yet Ive no fortune and there must be so many others his companion pursued
The Master took this considerably in but made little of it
Youre a gentleman and a man of genius
I think you might do something
But if I must give that up  the genius
Lots of people you know think Ive kept mine St George wonderfully grinned
Youve a genius for mystification
Paul declared but grasping his hand gratefully in attenuation of this judgement
Poor dear boy I do worry you
But try try all the same
I think your chances are good and youll win a great prize
Paul held fast the others hand a minute he looked into the strange deep face
No I AM an artist  I cant help it
Ah show it then
St George pleadingly broke out
Let me see before I die the thing I most want the thing I yearn for a life in which the passion  ours  is really intense
If you can be rare dont fail of it
Think what it is  how it counts  how it lives
They had moved to the door and he had closed both his hands over his companions
Here they paused again and our hero breathed deep
I want to live
In what sense
In the greatest
Well then stick to it  see it through
With your sympathy  your help
Count on that  youll be a great figure to me
Count on my highest appreciation my devotion
Youll give me satisfaction  if that has any weight with you
After which as Paul appeared still to waver his host added Do you remember what you said to me at Summersoft
Something infatuated no doubt
Ill do anything in the world you tell me
You said that
And you hold me to it
Ah what am I
the Master expressively sighed
Lord what things I shall have to do
Paul almost moaned as be departed
CHAPTER VI It goes on too much abroad  hang abroad
These or something like them had been the Masters remarkable words in relation to the action of Ginistrella and yet though they had made a sharp impression on the author of that work like almost all spoken words from the same source he a week after the conversation I have noted left England for a long absence and full of brave intentions
It is not a perversion of the truth to pronounce that encounter the direct cause of his departure
If the oral utterance of the eminent writer had the privilege of moving him deeply it was especially on his turning it over at leisure hours and days later that it appeared to yield him its full meaning and exhibit its extreme importance
He spent the summer in Switzerland and having in September begun a new task determined not to cross the Alps till he should have made a good start
To this end he returned to a quiet corner he knew well on the edge of the Lake of Geneva and within sight of the towers of Chillon a region and a view for which he had an affection that sprang from old associations and was capable of mysterious revivals and refreshments
Here he lingered late till the snow was on the nearer hills almost down to the limit to which he could climb when his stint on the shortening afternoons was performed
The autumn was fine the lake was blue and his book took form and direction
These felicities for the time embroidered his life which he suffered to cover him with its mantle
At the end of six weeks he felt he had learnt St Georges lesson by heart had tested and proved its doctrine
Nevertheless he did a very inconsistent thing before crossing the Alps he wrote to Marian Fancourt
He was aware of the perversity of this act and it was only as a luxury an amusement the reward of a strenuous autumn that he justified it
She had asked of him no such favour when shortly before he left London three days after their dinner in Ennismore Gardens he went to take leave of her
It was true she had had no ground  he hadnt named his intention of absence
He had kept his counsel for want of due assurance it was that particular visit that was the next thing to settle the matter
He had paid the visit to see how much he really cared for her and quick departure without so much as an explicit farewell was the sequel to this enquiry the answer to which had created within him a deep yearning
When he wrote her from Clarens he noted that he owed her an explanation more than three months after
for not having told her what he was doing
She replied now briefly but promptly and gave him a striking piece of news that of the death a week before of Mrs St George
This exemplary woman had succumbed in the country to a violent attack of inflammation of the lungs  he would remember that for a long time she had been delicate
Miss Fancourt added that she believed her husband overwhelmed by the blow he would miss her too terribly  she had been everything in life to him
Paul Overt on this immediately wrote to St George
He would from the day of their parting have been glad to remain in communication with him but had hitherto lacked the right excuse for troubling so busy a man
Their long nocturnal talk came back to him in every detail but this was no bar to an expression of proper sympathy with the head of the profession for hadnt that very talk made it clear that the late accomplished lady was the influence that ruled his life
What catastrophe could be more cruel than the extinction of such an influence
This was to be exactly the tone taken by St George in answering his young friend upwards of a month later
He made no allusion of course to their important discussion
He spoke of his wife as frankly and generously as if he had quite forgotten that occasion and the feeling of deep bereavement was visible in his words
She took everything off my hands  off my mind
She carried on our life with the greatest art the rarest devotion and I was free as few men can have been to drive my pen to shut myself up with my trade
This was a rare service  the highest she could have rendered me
Would I could have acknowledged it more fitly
A certain bewilderment for our hero disengaged itself from these remarks they struck him as a contradiction a retractation strange on the part of a man who hadnt the excuse of witlessness
He had certainly not expected his correspondent to rejoice in the death of his wife and it was perfectly in order that the rupture of a tie of more than twenty years should have left him sore
But if she had been so clear a blessing what in the name of consistency had the dear man meant by turning him upside down that night  by dosing him to that degree at the most sensitive hour of his life with the doctrine of renunciation
If Mrs St George was an irreparable loss then her husbands inspired advice had been a bad joke and renunciation was a mistake
Overt was on the point of rushing back to London to show that for his part he was perfectly willing to consider it so and he went so far as to take the manuscript of the first chapters of his new book out of his table drawer to insert it into a pocket of his portmanteau
This led to his catching a glimpse of certain pages he hadnt looked at for months and that accident in turn to his being struck with the high promise they revealed  a rare result of such retrospections which it was his habit to avoid as much as possible they usually brought home to him that the glow of composition might be a purely subjective and misleading emotion
On this occasion a certain belief in himself disengaged itself whimsically from the serried erasures of his first draft making him think it best after all to pursue his present trial to the end
If he could write as well under the rigour of privation it might be a mistake to change the conditions before that spell had spent itself
He would go back to London of course but he would go back only when he should have finished his book
This was the vow he privately made restoring his manuscript to the tabledrawer
It may be added that it took him a long time to finish his book for the subject was as difficult as it was fine and he was literally embarrassed by the fulness of his notes
Something within him warned him that he must make it supremely good  otherwise he should lack as regards his private behaviour a handsome excuse
He had a horror of this deficiency and found himself as firm as need be on the question of the lamp and the file
He crossed the Alps at last and spent the winter the spring the ensuing summer in Italy where still at the end of a twelvemonth his task was unachieved
Stick to it  see it through this general injunction of St Georges was good also for the particular case
He applied it to the utmost with the result that when in its slow order the summer had come round again he felt he had given all that was in him
This time he put his papers into his portmanteau with the address of his publisher attached and took his way northward
He had been absent from London for two years  two years which seeming to count as more had made such a difference in his own life  through the production of a novel far stronger he believed than Ginistrella  that he turned out into Piccadilly the morning after his arrival with a vague expectation of changes of finding great things had happened
But there were few transformations in Piccadilly  only three or four big red houses where there had been low black ones  and the brightness of the end of June peeped through the rusty railings of the Green Park and glittered in the varnish of the rolling carriages as he had seen it in other more cursory Junes
It was a greeting he appreciated it seemed friendly and pointed added to the exhilaration of his finished book of his having his own country and the huge oppressive amusing city that suggested everything that contained everything under his hand again
Stay at home and do things here  do subjects we can measure St George had said and now it struck him he should ask nothing better than to stay at home for ever
Late in the afternoon he took his way to Manchester Square looking out for a number he hadnt forgotten
Miss Fancourt however was not at home so that he turned rather dejectedly from the door
His movement brought him face to face with a gentleman just approaching it and recognised on another glance as Miss Fancourts father
Paul saluted this personage and the General returned the greeting with his customary good manner  a manner so good however that you could never tell whether it meant he placed you
The disappointed caller felt the impulse to address him then hesitating became both aware of having no particular remark to make and convinced that though the old soldier remembered him he remembered him wrong
He therefore went his way without computing the irresistible effect his own evident recognition would have on the General who never neglected a chance to gossip
Our young mans face was expressive and observation seldom let it pass
He hadnt taken ten steps before he heard himself called after with a friendly semiarticulate Er  I beg your pardon
He turned round and the General smiling at him from the porch said Wont you come in
I wont leave you the advantage of me
Paul declined to come in and then felt regret for Miss Fancourt so late in the afternoon might return at any moment
But her father gave him no second chance he appeared mainly to wish not to have struck him as ungracious
A further look at the visitor had recalled something enough at least to enable him to say Youve come back youve come back
Paul was on the point of replying that he had come back the night before but he suppressed the next instant this strong light on the immediacy of his visit and giving merely a general assent alluded to the young lady he deplored not having found
He had come late in the hope she would be in
Ill tell her  Ill tell her said the old man and then he added quickly gallantly Youll be giving us something new
Its a long time isnt it
Now he remembered him right
Rather long
Im very slow
Paul explained
I met you at Summersoft a long time ago
Oh yes  with Henry St George
I remember very well
Before his poor wife   General Fancourt paused a moment smiling a little less
I dare say you know
About Mrs St Georges death
Certainly  I heard at the time
Oh no I mean  I mean hes to be married
Ah Ive not heard that
But just as Paul was about to add To whom
the General crossed his intention
When did you come back
I know youve been away  by my daughter
She was very sorry
You ought to give her something new
I came back last night said our young man to whom something had occurred which made his speech for the moment a little thick
Ah most kind of you to come so soon
Couldnt you turn up at dinner
At dinner
Paul just mechanically repeated not liking to ask whom St George was going to marry but thinking only of that
There are several people I believe
Certainly St George
Or afterwards if you like better
I believe my daughter expects   He appeared to notice something in the visitors raised face on his steps he stood higher which led him to interrupt himself and the interruption gave him a momentary sense of awkwardness from which he sought a quick issue
Perhaps then you havent heard shes to be married
Paul gaped again
To be married
To Mr St George  it has just been settled
Odd marriage isnt it
Our listener uttered no opinion on this point he only continued to stare
But I dare say it will do  shes so awfully literary
said the General
Paul had turned very red
Oh its a surprise  very interesting very charming
Im afraid I cant dine  so many thanks
Well you must come to the wedding
cried the General
Oh I remember that day at Summersoft
Hes a great man you know
Charming  charming
Paul stammered for retreat
He shook hands with the General and got off
His face was red and he had the sense of its growing more and more crimson
All the evening at home  he went straight to his rooms and remained there dinnerless  his cheek burned at intervals as if it had been smitten
He didnt understand what had happened to him what trick had been played him what treachery practised
None none he said to himself
Ive nothing to do with it
Im out of it  it s none of my business
But that bewildered murmur was followed again and again by the incongruous ejaculation Was it a plan  was it a plan
Sometimes he cried to himself breathless Have I been duped sold swindled
If at all he was an absurd an abject victim
It was as if he hadnt lost her till now
He had renounced her yes but that was another affair  that was a closed but not a locked door
Now he seemed to see the door quite slammed in his face
Did he expect her to wait  was she to give him his time like that two years at a stretch
He didnt know what he had expected  he only knew what he hadnt
It wasnt this  it wasnt this
Mystification bitterness and wrath rose and boiled in him when he thought of the deference the devotion the credulity with which he had listened to St George
The evening wore on and the light was long but even when it had darkened he remained without a lamp
He had flung himself on the sofa where he lay through the hours with his eyes either closed or gazing at the gloom in the attitude of a man teaching himself to bear something to bear having been made a fool of
He had made it too easy  that idea passed over him like a hot wave
Suddenly as he heard eleven oclock strike he jumped up remembering what General Fancourt had said about his coming after dinner
Hed go  hed see her at least perhaps he should see what it meant
He felt as if some of the elements of a hard sum had been given him and the others were wanting he couldnt do his sum till he had got all his figures
He dressed and drove quickly so that by halfpast eleven he was at Manchester Square
There were a good many carriages at the door  a party was going on a circumstance which at the last gave him a slight relief for now he would rather see her in a crowd
People passed him on the staircase they were going away going on with the hunted herdlike movement of London society at night
But sundry groups remained in the drawingroom and it was some minutes as she didnt hear him announced before he discovered and spoke to her
In this short interval he had seen St George talking to a lady before the fireplace but he at once looked away feeling unready for an encounter and therefore couldnt be sure the author of Shadowmere noticed him
At all events he didnt come over though Miss Fancourt did as soon as she saw him  she almost rushed at him smiling rustling radiant beautiful
He had forgotten what her head what her face offered to the sight she was in white there were gold figures on her dress and her hair was a casque of gold
He saw in a single moment that she was happy happy with an aggressive splendour
But she wouldnt speak to him of that she would speak only of himself
Im so delighted my father told me
How kind of you to come
She struck him as so fresh and brave while his eyes moved over her that he said to himself irresistibly Why to him why not to youth to strength to ambition to a future
Why in her rich young force to failure to abdication to superannuation
In his thought at that sharp moment he blasphemed even against all that had been left of his faith in the peccable Master
Im so sorry I missed you she went on
My father told me
How charming of you to have come so soon
Does that surprise you
Paul Overt asked
The first day
No from you  nothing thats nice
She was interrupted by a lady who bade her goodnight and he seemed to read that it cost her nothing to speak to him in that tone it was her old liberal lavish way with a certain added amplitude that time had brought and if this manner began to operate on the spot at such a juncture in her history perhaps in the other days too it had meant just as little or as much  a mere mechanical charity with the difference now that she was satisfied ready to give but in want of nothing
Oh she was satisfied  and why shouldnt she be
Why shouldnt she have been surprised at his coming the first day  for all the good she had ever got from him
As the lady continued to hold her attention Paul turned from her with a strange irritation in his complicated artistic soul and a sort of disinterested disappointment
She was so happy that it was almost stupid  a disproof of the extraordinary intelligence he had formerly found in her
Didnt she know how bad St George could be hadnt she recognised the awful thinness 
If she didnt she was nothing and if she did why such an insolence of serenity
This question expired as our young mans eyes settled at last on the genius who had advised him in a great crisis
St George was still before the chimneypiece but now he was alone  fixed waiting as if he meant to stop after every one  and he met the clouded gaze of the young friend so troubled as to the degree of his right the right his resentment would have enjoyed to regard himself as a victim
Somehow the ravage of the question was checked by the Masters radiance
It was as fine in its way as Marian Fancourts it denoted the happy human being but also it represented to Paul Overt that the author of Shadowmere had now definitely ceased to count  ceased to count as a writer
As he smiled a welcome across the place he was almost banal was almost smug
Paul fancied that for a moment he hesitated to make a movement as if for all the world he HAD his bad conscience then they had already met in the middle of the room and had shaken hands  expressively cordially on St Georges part
With which they had passed back together to where the elder man had been standing while St George said I hope youre never going away again
Ive been dining here the General told me
He was handsome he was young he looked as if he had still a great fund of life
He bent the friendliest most unconfessing eyes on his disciple of a couple of years before asked him about everything his health his plans his late occupations the new book
When will it be out  soon soon I hope
Splendid eh
Thats right youre a comfort youre a luxury
Ive read you all over again these last six months
Paul waited to see if he would tell him what the General had told him in the afternoon and what Miss Fancourt verbally at least of course hadnt
But as it didnt come out he at last put the question
Is it true the great news I hear  that youre to be married
Ah you have heard it then
Didnt the General tell you
Paul asked
The Masters face was wonderful
Tell me what
That he mentioned it to me this afternoon
My dear fellow I dont remember
Weve been in the midst of people
Im sorry in that case that I lose the pleasure myself of announcing to you a fact that touches me so nearly
It IS a fact strange as it may appear
It has only just become one
Isnt it ridiculous
St George made this speech without confusion but on the other hand so far as our friend could judge without latent impudence
It struck his interlocutor that to talk so comfortably and coolly he must simply have forgotten what had passed between them
His next words however showed he hadnt and they produced as an appeal to Pauls own memory an effect which would have been ludicrous if it hadnt been cruel
Do you recall the talk we had at my house that night into which Miss Fancourts name entered
Ive often thought of it since
Yes no wonder you said what you did  Paul was careful to meet his eyes
In the light of the present occasion
Ah but there was no light then
How could I have foreseen this hour
Didnt you think it probable
Upon my honour no said Henry St George
Certainly I owe you that assurance
Think how my situation has changed
I see  I see our young man murmured
His companion went on as if now that the subject had been broached he was as a person of imagination and tact quite ready to give every satisfaction  being both by his genius and his method so able to enter into everything another might feel
But its not only that for honestly at my age I never dreamed  a widower with big boys and with so little else
It has turned out differently from anything one could have dreamed and Im fortunate beyond all measure
She has been so free and yet she consents
Better than any one else perhaps  for I remember how you liked her before you went away and how she liked you  you can intelligently congratulate me
She has been so free
Those words made a great impression on Paul Overt and he almost writhed under that irony in them as to which it so little mattered whether it was designed or casual
Of course she had been free and appreciably perhaps by his own act for wasnt the Masters allusion to her having liked him a part of the irony too
I thought that by your theory you disapproved of a writers marrying
Surely  surely
But you dont call me a writer
You ought to be ashamed said Paul
Ashamed of marrying again
I wont say that  but ashamed of your reasons
The elder man beautifully smiled
You must let me judge of them my good friend
Yes why not
For you judged wonderfully of mine
The tone of these words appeared suddenly for St George to suggest the unsuspected
He stared as if divining a bitterness
Dont you think Ive been straight
You might have told me at the time perhaps
My dear fellow when I say I couldnt pierce futurity 
I mean afterwards
The Master wondered
After my wifes death
When this idea came to you
Ah never never
I wanted to save you rare and precious as you are
Poor Overt looked hard at him
Are you marrying Miss Fancourt to save me
Not absolutely but it adds to the pleasure
I shall be the making of you St George smiled
I was greatly struck after our talk with the brave devoted way you quitted the country and still more perhaps with your force of character in remaining abroad
Youre very strong  youre wonderfully strong
Paul tried to sound his shining eyes the strange thing was that he seemed sincere  not a mocking fiend
He turned away and as he did so heard the Master say something about his giving them all the proof being the joy of his old age
He faced him again taking another look
Do you mean to say youve stopped writing
My dear fellow of course I have
Its too late
Didnt I tell you
I cant believe it
Of course you cant  with your own talent
No no for the rest of my life I shall only read YOU
Does she know that  Miss Fancourt
She will  she will
Did he mean this our young man wondered as a covert intimation that the assistance he should derive from that young ladys fortune moderate as it was would make the difference of putting it in his power to cease to work ungratefully an exhausted vein
Somehow standing there in the ripeness of his successful manhood he didnt suggest that any of his veins were exhausted
Dont you remember the moral I offered myself to you that night as pointing
St George continued
Consider at any rate the warning I am at present
This was too much  he WAS the mocking fiend
Paul turned from him with a mere nod for goodnight and the sense in a sore heart that he might come back to him and his easy grace his fine way of arranging things some time in the far future but couldnt fraternise with him now
It was necessary to his soreness to believe for the hour in the intensity of his grievance  all the more cruel for its not being a legal one
It was doubtless in the attitude of hugging this wrong that he descended the stairs without taking leave of Miss Fancourt who hadnt been in view at the moment he quitted the room
He was glad to get out into the honest dusky unsophisticating night to move fast to take his way home on foot
He walked a long time going astray paying no attention
He was thinking of too many other things
His steps recovered their direction however and at the end of an hour he found himself before his door in the small inexpensive empty street
He lingered questioning himself still before going in with nothing around and above him but moonless blackness a bad lamp or two and a few faraway dim stars
To these last faint features he raised his eyes he had been saying to himself that he should have been sold indeed diabolically sold if now on his new foundation at the end of a year St George were to put forth something of his prime quality  something of the type of Shadowmere and finer than his finest
Greatly as he admired his talent Paul literally hoped such an incident wouldnt occur it seemed to him just then that he shouldnt be able to bear it
His late advisers words were still in his ears  Youre very strong wonderfully strong
Was he really
Certainly he would have to be and it might a little serve for revenge
IS he
the reader may ask in turn if his interest has followed the perplexed young man so far
The best answer to that perhaps is that hes doing his best but that its too soon to say
When the new book came out in the autumn Mr and Mrs St George found it really magnificent
The former still has published nothing but Paul doesnt even yet feel safe
I may say for him however that if this event were to occur he would really be the very first to appreciate it which is perhaps a proof that the Master was essentially right and that Nature had dedicated him to intellectual not to personal passion
