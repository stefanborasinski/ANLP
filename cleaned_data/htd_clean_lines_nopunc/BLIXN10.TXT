BLIX by Frank Norris 1899 Chapter I IT had just struck nine from the cuckoo clock that hung over the mantelpiece in the diningroom when Victorine brought in the halved watermelon and set it in front of Mr Bessemers plate
Then she went down to the front door for the damp twisted roll of the Sunday mornings paper and came back and rang the breakfast bell for the second time
As the family still hesitated to appear she went to the bay window at the end of the room and stood there for a moment looking out
The view was wonderful
The Bessemers lived upon the Washington Street hill almost at its very summit in a flat in the third story of the building
The contractor had been clever enough to reverse the position of kitchen and diningroom so that the latter room was at the rear of the house
From its window one could command a sweep of San Francisco Bay and the Contra Costa shore from Mount Diablo along past Oakland Berkeley Sausalito and Mount Tamalpais out to the Golden Gate the Presidio the ocean and evenon very clear daysto the Farrallone islands
For some time Victorine stood looking down at the great expanse of land and sea then faced about with an impatient exclamation
On Sundays all the weekday regime of the family was deranged and breakfast was a movable feast to be had any time after seven or before halfpast nine
As Victorine was pouring the icewater Mr Bessemer himself came in and addressed himself at once to his meal without so much as a thought of waiting for the others
He was a little round man
He wore a skullcap to keep his bald spot warm and read his paper through a readingglass
The expression of his face wrinkled and bearded the eyes shadowed by enormous gray eyebrows was that of an amiable gorilla
Bessemer was one of those men who seem entirely disassociated from their families
Only on rare and intense occasions did his paternal spirit or instincts assert themselves
At table he talked but little
Though devotedly fond of his eldest daughter she was a puzzle and a stranger to him
His interests and hers were absolutely dissimilar
The children he seldom spoke to but to reprove while Howard the son the tenyearold and terrible infant of the household he always referred to as that boy
He was an abstracted selfcentred old man with but two hobbies homoeopathy and the mechanism of clocks
But he had a strange way of talking to himself in a low voice keeping up a running half whispered comment upon his own doings and actions as for instance upon this occasion Nine oclockthe clocks a little fast
I think Ill wind my watch
No Ive forgotten my watch
Watermelon this morning eh
Wheres a knife
Ill have a little salt
Victorines forgot the spoonsha heres a spoon
No its a knife I want
After he had finished his watermelon and while Victorine was pouring his coffee the two children came in scrambling to their places and drumming on the table with their knifehandles
The son and heir Howard was very much a boy
He played baseball too well to be a very good boy and for the sake of his own self respect maintained an attitude of perpetual revolt against his older sister who as much as possible took the place of the mother long since dead
Under her supervision Howard blacked his own shoes every morning before breakfast changed his underclothes twice a week and was dissuaded from playing with the dentists son who lived three doors below and who had St Vitus dance
His little sister was much more tractable
She had been christened Alberta and was called Snooky
She promised to be pretty when she grew up but was at this time in that distressing transitional stage between twelve and fifteen was longlegged and endowed with all the awkwardness of a colt
Her shoes were still innocent of heels but on those occasions when she was allowed to wear her tiny first pair of corsets she was exalted to an almost celestial pitch of silent ecstasy
The clasp of the miniature stays around her small body was like the embrace of a little lover and awoke in her ideas that were as vague as immature and unformed as the straight little figure itself
When Snooky and Howard had seated themselves but one chairat the end of the breakfasttable opposite Mr Bessemerremained vacant
Is your sisteris Miss Travis going to have her breakfast now
Is she got up yet
inquired Victorine of Howard and Snooky as she pushed the cream pitcher out of Howards reach
It was significant of Mr Bessemers relations with his family that Victorine did not address her question to him
Yes yes shes coming said both the children speaking together and Howard added Here she comes now
Travis Bessemer came in
Even in San Francisco where all women are more or less beautiful Travis passed for a beautiful girl
She was young but tall as most men and solidly almost heavily built
Her shoulders were broad her chest was deep her neck round and firm
She radiated health there were exuberance and vitality in the very touch of her foot upon the carpet and there was that cleanliness about her that freshness that suggested a recent plunge in the surf and a constitutional along the beach
One felt that here was stamina good physical force and fine animal vigor
Her arms were large her wrists were large and her fingers did not taper
Her hair was of a brown so light as to be almost yellow
In fact it would be safer to call it yellow from the startnot golden nor flaxen but plain honest yellow
The skin of her face was clean and white except where it flushed to a most charming pink upon her smooth cool cheeks
Her lips were full and red her chin very round and a little salient
Curiously enough her eyes were smallsmall but of the deepest deepest brown and always twinkling and alight as though she were just ready to smile or had just done smiling one could not say which
And nothing could have been more delightful than these sloebrown glinting little eyes of hers set off by her white skin and yellow hair
She impressed one as being a very normal girl nothing morbid about her nothing nervous or false or overwrought
You did not expect to find her introspective
You felt sure that her mental life was not at all the result of thoughts and reflections germinating from within but rather of impressions and sensations that came to her from without
There was nothing extraordinary about Travis
She never had her vagaries was not moody depressed one day and exalted the next
She was just a good sweet natural healthyminded healthybodied girl honest strong selfreliant and goodtempered
Though she was not yet dressed for church there was style in her to the pointed tips of her patentleather slippers
She wore a heavy black overskirt that rustled in delicious fashion over the colored silk skirt beneath and a white shirtwaist striped black and starched to a rattling stiffness
Her neck was swathed tight and high with a broad ribbon of white satin while around her waist in place of a belt she wore the huge dogcollar of a St Bernarda chic little idea which was all her own and of which she was very proud
She was as trig and trim and crisp as a crack yacht not a pin was loose not a seam that did not fall in its precise right line and with every movement there emanated from her a barely perceptible delicious feminine odoran odor that was in part perfume but mostly a subtle vague smell charming beyond words that came from her hair her neck her armsher whole sweet personality
She was nineteen years old
She sat down to breakfast and ate heartily though with her attention divided between Howardwho was atrociously bad as usual of a Sunday morningand her fathers plate
Mr Bessemer was as like as not to leave the table without any breakfast at all unless his fruit chops and coffee were actually thrust under his nose
Papum she called speaking clear and distinct as though to the deaf theres your coffee there at your elbow be careful youll tip it over
Victorine push his cup further on the table
Is it strong enough for you Papum Eh
Ah yesyesyes murmured the old man looking vaguely about him coffee to be sureand he emptied the cup at a single draught hardly knowing whether it was coffee or tea
Now Ill take a roll he continued in a monotonous murmur
Where are the rolls
Here they are
Hot rolls are bad for my digestion I ought to eat bread
I think I eat too much
Wheres my place in the paperalways lose my place in the paper
Clever editorials this fellow Eastman writes unbiassed by party prejudiceunbiassedunbiassed
His voice died to a whisper
The breakfast proceeded Travis supervising everything that went forward even giving directions to Victorine as to the hour for serving dinner
It was while she was talking to Victorine as to this matter that Snooky began to whine
Stop
And tell Maggie pursued Travis to fricassee her chicken and not to have it too well done Stooop
whined Snooky again
And leave the heart out for Papum
He likes the heart Stooop
Unbiassed by prejudice murmured Mr Bessemer vigorous and to the point
Ill have another roll
Pa make Howard stop
Howard
exclaimed Travis what is it now
Howards squirting watermelonseeds at me whined Snooky and Pa wont make him stop
Oh I didnt so
vociferated Howard
I only held one between my fingers and it just kind of shot out
Youll come upstairs with me in just five minutes announced Travis and get ready for Sundayschool
Howard knew that his older sisters decisions were as the laws of the Persians and found means to finish his breakfast within the specified time though not without protest
Once upstairs however the usual Sunday morning drama of despatching him to Sundayschool in presentable condition was enacted
At every moment his voice could be heard uplifted in shrill expostulation and debate
No his hands were clean enough and he didnt see why he had to wear that little old pink tie and oh
his new shoes were too tight and hurt his sore toe and he wouldnt he wouldntno not if he were killed for it change his shirt
Not for a moment did Travis lose her temper with him
But very well she declared at length the next time she saw that little Miner girl she would tell her that he had said she was his beau heart
NOW would he hold still while she brushed his hair
At a few minutes before eleven Travis and her father went to church
They were Episcopalians and for time out of mind had rented a halfpew in the church of their denomination on California Street not far from Chinatown
By noon the family reassembled
at dinnertable where Mr Bessemer ate his chicken heartafter Travis had thrice reminded him of itand expressed himself as to the sermon and the ministers theology sometimes to his daughter and sometimes to himself
After dinner Howard and Snooky foregathered in the nursery with their beloved lead soldiers Travis went to her room to write letters and Mr Bessemer sat in the bay window of the diningroom reading the paper from end to end
At five Travis bestirred herself
It was Victorines afternoon out
Travis set the table spreading a cover of blue denim edged with white braid which showed off the silver and the set of delfther great and neverending joyto great effect
Then she tied her apron about her and went into the kitchen to make the mayonnaise dressing for the potato salad to slice the ham and to help the cook a most inefficient Irish person taken on only for that month during the absence of the familys beloved and venerated Sing Wo in the matter of preparing the Sunday evening tea
Tea was had at halfpast five
Never in the history of the family had its menu varied cold ham potato salad pork and beans canned fruit chocolate and the inevitable pitcher of icewater
In the absence of Victorine Maggie waited on the table very uncomfortable in her one good dress and stiff white apron
She stood off from the table making awkward dabs at it from time to time
In her excess of deference she developed a clumsiness that was beyond all expression
She passed the plates upon the wrong side and remembered herself with a broken apology at inopportune moments
She dropped a spoon she spilled the icewater
She handled the delft cups and platters with an exaggerated solicitude as though they were glass bombs
She brushed the crumbs into their laps instead of into the crumbtray and at last when she had sat even Travis placid nerves in a jangle was dismissed to the kitchen and retired with a gasp of unspeakable relief
Suddenly there came a prolonged trilling of the electric bell and Howard flashed a grin at Travis
Snooky jumped up and pushed back crying out Ill go
Ill go
Mr Bessemer glanced nervously at Travis
Thats Mr Rivers isnt it daughter
Travis smiled
Well I think IllI think Id better he began
No said Travis I dont want you to Papum you sit right where you are
How absurd
The old man dropped obediently back into his seat
Thats all right Maggie said Travis as the cook reappeared from the pantry
Snooky went
Huh
exclaimed Howard his grin widening
Huh
And remember one thing Howard remarked Travis calmly dont you ever again ask Mr Rivers for a nickel to put in your bank
Mr Bessemer roused up
Did that boy do that
he inquired sharply of Travis
Well well he wont do it again said Travis soothingly
The old man glared for an instant at Howard who shifted uneasily in his seat
But meanwhile Snooky had clambered down to the outside door and before anything further could be said young Rivers came into the diningroom
Chapter II FOR some reason never made sufficiently clear Rivers parents had handicapped him from the baptismal font with the prenomen of Conde which however upon AngloSaxon tongues had been promptly modified to Condy or even among his familiar and intimate friends to Conny
Asked as to his birthplacefor no Californian assumes that his neighbor is born in the StateCondy was wont to reply that he was bawn n rais in Chicago but he always added I couldnt help that you know
His people had come West in the early eighties just in time to bury the father in alien soil
Condy was an only child
He was educated at the State University had a finishing year at Yale and a few months after his return home was taken on the staff of the San Francisco Daily Times as an associate editor of its Sunday supplement
For Condy had developed a taste and talent in the matter of writing
Short stories were his mania
He had begun by an inoculation of the Kipling virus had suffered an almost fatal attack of Harding Davis and had even been affected by Maupassant
He went in for accuracy of detail held that if one wrote a story involving firemen one should have or seem to have every detail of the department at his fingers ends and should bring in to the tale all manner of technical names and cant phrases
Much of his work on the Sunday supplement of The Times was of the hack orderspecial articles writeups and interviews
About once a month however he wrote a short story and of late now that he was convalescing from Maupassant and had begun to be somewhat himself these stories had improved in quality and one or two had even been copied in the Eastern journals
He earned 100 a month
When Snooky had let him in Rivers dashed up the stairs of the Bessemers flat two at a time tossed his stick into a porcelain canerack in the hall wrenched off his overcoat with a single movement and precipitated himself panting into the diningroom tugging at his gloves
He was twentyeight years oldnearly ten years older than Travis tall and somewhat lean his face smoothshaven and pink all over as if he had just given it a violent rubbing with a crash towel
Unlike most writing folk he dressed himself according to prevailing custom
But Condy overdid the matter
His scarfs and cravats were too bright his colored shirtbosoms were too broadly barred his waistcoats too extreme
Even Travis as she rose to his abrupt entrance
told herself that of a Sunday evening a pink shirt and scarlet tie were a combination hardly to be forgiven
Condy shook her hand in both of his then rushed over to Mr Bessemer exclaiming between breaths Dont get up sirdont THINK of it
Heavens
Im disgustingly late
Youre all through
My watchthis beastly watch of mineI cant imagine how I came to be so late
You did quite right not to wait
Then as his morbidly keen observation caught a certain look of blankness on Travis face and his rapid glance noted no vacant chair at table he gave a quick gasp of dismay
Heavens and earth
didnt you EXPECT me
he cried
I thought you saidI thoughtI must have forgottenI must have got it mixed up somehow
What a hideous mistake what a blunder
What a fool I am
He dropped into a chair against the wall and mopped his forehead with a bluebordered handkerchief
Well what difference does it make Condy
said Travis quietly
Ill put another place for you
No no
he vociferated jumping up
I wont hear of it I wont permit it
Youll think I did it on purpose
Travis ignored his interference and made a place for him opposite the children and had Maggie make some more chocolate
Condy meanwhile covered himself with opprobrium
And all this troubleI always make trouble everywhere I go
Always a round man in a square hole or a square man in a round hole
He got up and sat down again crossed and recrossed his legs picked up little ornaments from the mantelpiece and replaced them without consciousness of what they were and finally broke the crystal of his watch as he was resetting it by the cuckoo clock
Hello
he exclaimed suddenly where did you get that clock
Where did you get that clock
Thats new to me
Where did that come from
That cuckoo clock
inquired Travis with a stare
Condy Rivers youve been here and in this room at least twice a week for the last year and a half and that clock and no other has always hung there
But already Condy had forgotten or lost interest in the clock
Is that so
is that so
he murmured absentmindedly seating himself at the table
Mr Bessemer was murmuring That clocks a little fast
I can not make that clock keep time
Victorine has lost the key
I have to wind it with a monkeywrench
Now Ill try some more beans
Maggie has put in too much pepper
Ill have to have a new key made tomorrow
Hey
Yesyes
Is that so
answered Condy Rivers bewildered wishing to be polite yet unable to follow the old mans mutterings
Hes not talking to you remarked Travis without lowering her voice
You know how Papum goes on
He wont hear a word you say
Well I read your story in this mornings Times
A few moments later while Travers and Condy were still discussing this story Mr Bessemer rose
Well Mr Rivers he announced I guess Ill say goodnight
Come Snooky
Yes take her with you Papum said Travis
Shell go to sleep on the lounge here if you dont
Howard have you got your lessons for tomorrow
It appeared that he had not
Snooky whined to stay up a little longer but at last consented to go with her father
They all bade Condy goodnight and took themselves away Howard lingering a moment in the door in the hope of the nickel he dared not ask for
Maggie reappeared to clear away the table
Lets go in the parlor suggested Travis rising
Dont you want to
The parlor was the front room overlooking the street and was reached by the long hall that ran the whole length of the flat passing by the door of each one of its eight rooms in turn
Travis preceded Condy and turned up one of the burners in colored globe of the little brass chandelier
The parlor was a small affair peopled by a family of chairs and sofas robed in white drugget
A goldandwhite effect had been striven for throughout the room
The walls had been tinted instead of papered and bunches of handpainted pink flowers tied up with blue ribbons straggled from one corner of the ceiling
Across one angle of the room straddled a brass easel upholding a crayon portrait of Travis at the age of nine enlarged from a photograph
A yellow drape ornamented one corner of the frame while another drape of blue depended from one end of the mantelpiece
The piano upon which nobody ever played balanced the easel in an opposite corner
Over the mantelpiece hung in a gilded frame a steel engraving of Priscilla and John Alden and on the mantel itself two bisque figures of an Italian fisher boy and girl kept company with the clock a huge timepiece set in a red plush palette that never was known to go
But at the right of the fireplace and balancing the tuft of pampagrass to the left was an inverted section of a sewerpipe painted blue and decorated with daisies
Into it was thrust a sheaf of cattails gilded and tied with a pink ribbon
Travis dropped upon the shrouded sofa and Condy set himself carefully down on one of the frail chairs with its spindling golden legs and they began to talk
Condy had taken her to the theatre the Monday night of that week as had been his custom ever since he had known her well and there was something left for them to say on that subject
But in ten minutes they had exhausted it
An engagement of a girl known to both of them had just been announced
Condy brought that up and kept conversation going for another twenty minutes and then filled in what threatened to be a gap by telling her stories of the society reporters and how they got inside news by listening to telephone party wires for days at a time
Travis condemnation of this occupied another five or ten minutes and so what with this and with that they reached nine oclock
Then decidedly the evening began to drag
It was too early to go
Condy could find no good excuse for takng himself away and though Travis was goodnatured enough and met him more than halfway their talk lapsed and lapsed and lapsed
The breaks became more numerous and lasted longer
Condy began to wonder if he was boring her
No sooner had the suspicion entered his head than it hardened into a certainty and at once what little fluency and freshness he yet retained forsook him on the spot
What made matters worse was his recollection of other evenings that of late he had failed in precisely the same manner
Even while he struggled to save the situation Condy was wondering if they two were talked outif they had lost charm for each other
Did he not know Travis through and through by nowher opinions her ideas her convictions
Was there any more freshness in her for him
Was their little flirtation of the last eighteen months charming as it had been about to end
Had they played out the play had they come to the end of each others resources
He had never considered the possibility of this before but all at once as he looked at Travislooked fairly into her little brownblack eyesit was borne in upon him that she was thinking precisely the same thing
Condy Rivers had met Travis at a dance a year and a half before this and because she was so very pretty so unaffected and so goodnatured had found means to see her three or four times a week ever since
They two went out not a little in San Francisco society and had been in a measure identified with what was known as the Younger Set though Travis was too young to come out and Rivers too old to feel very much at home with girls of twenty and boys of eighteen
They had known each other in the conventional way as conventionality goes in San Francisco during the season Rivers took her to the theatres Monday nights and called regularly Wednesdays and Sundays
Then they met at dances and managed to be invited to the same houses for teas and dinners
They had flirted rather desperately and at times Condy even told himself that he loved this girl so much younger than hethis girl with the smiling eyes and robust figure and yellow hair who was so frank so straightforward and so wonderfully pretty
But evidently they had come to the last move in the game and as Condy reflected that after all he had never known the real Travis that the girl whom he told himself he knew through and through was only the Travis of dinner parties and afternoon functions he was suddenly surprised to experience a sudden qualm of deep and genuine regret
He had never been NEAR to her after all
They were as far apart as when they had first met
And yet he knew enough of her to know that she was worth while
He had had experienceall the experience he wantedwith other older women and girls of society
They were sophisticated they were all a little tired they had run the gamut of amusementsin a word they were jaded
But Travis this girl of nineteen who was not yet even a debutante had been fresh and unspoiled had been new and strong and young
Of course you may call it what you like
He was nothing more nor less than intoxicatedyes drunk
Hah
whowhatwhwhat are you talking about
gasped Condy sitting bolt upright
Jack Carter answered Travis
No she added
shaking her head at him helplessly he hasnt been listening to a word
Im talking about Jack Carter and the Saturday Evening last night
No no I havent heard
Forgive me I was thinkingthinking of something else
Who was drunk
Travis paused a moment settling her sidecombs in her hair then If you will try to listen Ill tell it all over again because its serious with me and Im going to take a very decided stand about it
You know she went onyou know what the Saturday Evening is
Plenty of the girls who are not out belong and a good many of last years debutantes come as well as the older girls of three or four seasons standing
You could call it representative couldnt you
Well they always serve punch and you know yourself that you have seen men there who have taken more than they should
Yes yes admitted Condy
I know Carter and the two Catlin boys always do
It gets pretty bad sometimes doesnt it
she said
It does it doesand its shameful
But most of the girls MOST of them dont seem to mind
Miss Bessemer stiffened a bit
There are one or two girls that do she said quietly
Frank Catlin had the decency to go home last night she continued and his brother wasnt any worse than usual
But Jack Carter must have been drinking before he came
He was very bad indeedas bad she said between her teeth as he could be and yet walk straight
As you say most of the girls dont mind
They say Its only Johnnie Carter what do you expect
But one of the girlsyou know her Laurie Flaggcut a dance with him last night and told him exactly why
Of course Carter was furious
He was sober enough to think he had been insulted and what do you suppose he did
What
what
exclaimed Condy breathless leaning toward her
Went about the halls and dressingrooms circulating some dirty little lie about Laurie
Actually trying totoTravis hesitatedto make a scandal about her
Condy bounded in his seat
Beast cad swine
he exclaimed
I didnt think said Travis that Carter would so much as dare to ask me to dance with him Did he
diddid Wait she interrupted
So I wasnt at all prepared for what happened
During the german before I knew it there he was in front of me
It was a break and he wanted it
I hadnt time to think
The only idea I had was that if I refused him he might tell some dirty little lie about me
I was all confusedmixed up
I felt just as though it were a snake that I had to humor to get rid of
I gave him the break
Condy sat speechless
Suddenly he arose
Well now lets see he began speaking rapidly his hands twisting and untwisting till the knuckles cracked
Now lets see
You leave it to me
I know Carter
Hes going to be at a stag dinner where I am invited tomorrow night and II No you wont Condy said Travis placidly
Youll pay no attention to it and Ill tell you why
Suppose you should make a scene with Mr CarterI dont know how men settle these things
Well it would be told in all the clubs and in all the newspaper offices that two men had quarreled over a girl and my name is mentioned discussed and handed around from one crowd of men to another from one club to another and then of course the papers take it up
By that time Mr Carter will have told his side of the story and invented another dirty little lie and Im the one who suffers the most in the end
And remember Condy that I havent any mother in such an affair not even an older sister
No well just let the matter drop
It would be more dignified anyhow
Only I have made up my mind what I am going to do
Whats that
Im not coming out
If thats the sort of thing one has to put up with in societyTravis drew a little line on the sofa at her side with her fingertipI am going tostoprightthere
Its notMiss Bessemer stiffened againthat Im afraid of Jack Carter and his dirty stories I simply dont want to know the kind of people who have made Jack Carter possible
The other girls dont mind it nor many men besides you Condy and Im not going to be associated with people who take it as a joke for a man to come to a function drunk
And as for having a good time Ill find my amusements somewhere else
Ill ride a wheel take long walks study something
But as for leading the life of a society girlno
And whether I have a good time or not Ill keep my own selfrespect
At least Ill never have to dance with a drunken man
I wont have to humiliate myself like that a second time
But I presume you will still continue to go out somewhere protested Condy Rivers
She shook her head
I have thought it all over and Ive talked about it with Papum
Theres no half way about it
The only way to stop is to stop short
Just this afternoon Ive regretted three functions for next week and I shall resign from the Saturday Evening
Oh its not the Jack Carter affair alone
she exclaimed the whole thing tires me
Mind Condy she exclaimed Im not going to break with it because I have any purpose in life or that sort of thing
I want to have a good time and Im going to see if I cant have it in my own way
If the kind of thing that makes Jack Carter possible is conventionality then Im done with conventionality for good
I am going to try from this time on to be just as true to myself as I can be
I am going to be sincere and not pretend to like people and things that I dont like and Im going to do the things that I like to dojust so long as they are the things a good girl can do
See Condy
Youre fine murmured Condy breathless
Youre fine as gold Travis and II love you all the better for it
Ah NOW
exclaimed Travis with a brusque movement theres mother thing we must talk about
No more foolishness between us
Weve had a jolly little flirtation I know and its been good fun while it lasted
I know you like me and you know that I like you but as for loving each other you know we dont
Yes you say that you love me and that Im the only girl
Thats part of the game
I can play ither little eyes began to dancequite as well as you
But its playing with something thats quite too serious to be played withafter all isnt it now
Its insincere and as I tell you from now on Im going to be as true and as sincere and as honest as I can
But I tell you that I DO love you protested Condy trying to make the words ring true
Travis looked about the room an instant as if in deliberation then abruptly Ah
what am I going to DO with such a boy as you are after alla great big overgrown boy
Condy Rivers look at me straight in the eye
Tell me do you honestly love me
You know what I mean when I say love
Do you love me
No I dont
he exclaimed blankly as though he had just discovered the fact
There
declared Travisand I dont love you
They both began to laugh
Now added Travis we dont need to have the burden and trouble of keeping up the pretences any more
We understand each other dont we
This is queer enough said Condy drolly
But isnt it an improvement
Condy scoured his head
Tell me the truth she insisted YOU be sincere
I do believe it is
WhywhyTravis by Jingo
Travis I think Im going to like you better than ever now
Never mind
Is it an agreement
What is
That we dont pretend to love each other any more
All rightyesyoure right because the moment I began to love you I should like you so much less
She put out her hand
Thats an agreement then
Condy took her hand in his
Yes its an agreement
But when as had been his custom he made as though to kiss her hand Travis drew it quickly away
No
no
she said firmly smiling for all thatno more foolishness
Butbut he protested its not so radical as that is it
Youre not going to overturn such timeworn timehonored customs as that
Why this is a regular rebellion
No sire quoted Travis trying not to laugh it is a revolution
Chapter III Although Monday was practically a holiday for the Sunday supplement staff of The Times Condy Rivers made a point to get down to the office betimes the next morning
There were reasons why a certain article descriptive of a great whaleback steamer taking on grain for faminestricken India should be written that day and Rivers wanted his afternoon free in order to go to Laurie Flaggs comingout tea
But as he came into his room at The Times office which he shared with the exchange and sporting editors and settled himself at his desk he suddenly remembered that under the new order of things he need not expect to see Travis at the Flaggs
Well he muttered maybe it doesnt make so much difference after all
She was a corking fine girl butmight as well admit itthe play is played out
Of course I dont love herany more whan she loves me
Ill see less and less of her now
Its inevitable and after a while well hardly even meet
In a way its a pity but of course one has to be sensible about these thingsWell this whaleback now
He rang up the Chamber of Commerce and found out that the City of Everett which was the whalebacks name was at the Mission Street wharf
This made it possible for him to write the article in two ways
He either could fake his copy from a clipping on the subject which the exchange editor had laid on his desk or he could go down in person to the wharf interview the captain and inspect the craft for himself
The former was the short and easy method
The latter was more troublesome but would result in a far more interesting article
Condy debated the subject a few minutes then decided to go down to the wharf
San Franciscos waterfront was always interesting and he might get hold of a photograph of the whaleback
All at once the idea of the article struck him the certain underlying notion that would give importance and weight to the mere details and descriptions
Condys enthusiasm flared up in an instant
By Jove
he exclaimed by Jove
He clapped on his hat wrong side foremost crammed a sheaf of copypaper into his pocket and was on the street again in another moment
Then it occurred to him that he had forgotten to call at his club that morning for his mail as was his custom on the way to the office
He looked at his watch
It was early yet and his club was but two blocks distance
He decided that he would get his letters at the club and read them on the way down to the wharf
For Condy had joined a certain San Francisco club of artists journalists musicians and professional men that is one of the institutions of the city and in fact famous throughout the United States
He was one of the younger members but was popular and well liked and on more than one occasion had materially contributed to the fun of the clubs low jinks
In his box this morning he found one letter that he told himself he must read upon the instant
It bore upon the envelope the name of a New York publishing house to whom Condy had sent a collection of his short stories about a month before
He took the letter into the round window of the club overlooking the street and tore it open excitedly
The fact that he had received a letter from the firm without the return of his manuscript seemed a good omen
This was what he read Conde Rivers Esq Bohemian Club San Francisco Cal
DEAR SIR We return to you by this mail the manuscript of your stories which we do not consider as available for publication at the present moment
We would say however that we find in several of them indications of a quite unusual order of merit
The bestselling book just now is the short novelsay thirty thousand wordsof action and adventure
Judging from the stories of your collection we suspect that your talent lies in this direction and we would suggest that you write such a novel and submit the same to us
Very respectfully THE CENTENNIAL CO New York
Condy shoved the letter into his pocket and collapsed limply into his chair
Whats the good of trying to do anything anyhow
he muttered looking gloomily down into the street
My level is just the hackwork of a local Sunday supplement and I am a fool to think of anything else
His enthusiasm in the matter of the City of Everett was cold and dead in a moment
He could see no possibilities in the subject whatever
His idea of a few minutes previous seemed ridiculous and overwrought
He would go back to the office and grind out his copy from the exchange editors clipping
Just then his eye was caught by a familiar figure in trim well fitting black halted on the opposite corner waiting for the passage of a cable car
It was Travis Bessemer
No one but she could carry off such rigorous simplicity in the matter of dress so well black skirt black Russian blouse tiny black bonnet and black veil white kids with black stitching
Simplicity itself
Yet the style of her as Condy Rivers told himself flew up and hit you in the face and her figurewas there anything more perfect
and the soft pretty effect of her yellow hair seen through the veilcould anything be more fetching
and her smart carriage and the fling of her fine broad shoulders andno it was no use Condy had to run down to speak to her
Come come
she said as he pretended to jostle against her on the curbstone without noticing her you had best go to work
Loafing at ten oclock on the street cornersthe idea
It IS notit can not beand yet it isit is SHE he burlesqued and after all these years
Then in his natural voice Hello TB
Hello CR
Where are you going
Home
Ive just run down for half an hour to have the head of my banjo tightened
If I put you on the car will you expect me to pay your car fare
Condy Rivers Ive long since got over the idea of ever expecting you to have any change concealed about your person
Huh
no it all goes for theatre tickets and flowers and boxes of candy for a certain girl I know
Butand he glared at her significantlyno more foolishness
She laughed
What are you on this morning Condy
Condy told her as they started to walk toward Kearney Street
But why DONT you go to the dock and see the vessel if you can make a better article that way
Oh whats the good
The Centennial people have turned down my stories
She commiserated him for this then suddenly exclaimed No you must go down to the dock
You ought to Condy Oh I tell you let me go down with you
In an instant Condy leaped to the notion
Splendid
splendid
no reason why you shouldnt
he exclaimed
And within fifteen minutes the two were treading the wharves and quays of the citys waterfront
Ships innumerable nuzzled at the endless line of docks mast overspiring mast and bowsprit overlapping bowsprit till the eye was bewildered as if by the confusion of branches in a leafless forest
In the distance the mass of rigging resolved itself into a solid gray blur against the sky
The great hulks green and black and slate gray laid themselves along the docks straining leisurely at their mammoth chains their flanks opened their cargoes as it were their entrails spewed out in a wild disarray of crate and bale and box
Sailors and stevedores swarmed them like vermin
Trucks rolled along the wharves like peals of ordnance the horsehoofs beating the boards like heavy drumtaps
Chains clanked a ships dog barked incessantly from a companionway ropes creaked in complaining pulleys blocks rattled hoistingengines coughed and strangled while all the air was redolent of oakum of pitch of paint of spices of ripe fruit of clean cool lumber of coffee of tar of bilge and the brisk nimble odor of the sea
Travis was delighted her little brown eyes snapping her cheeks flushing as she drank in the scene
To think she cried where all these ships have come from
Look at their names arent they perfect
Just the names see the Mary Baker Hull and the Anandale Liverpool and the Two Sisters Calcutta and see that one theyre calking the Montevideo Callao and there look
look
the very one youre looking for the City of Everett San Francisco
The whaleback an immense tube of steel plates lay at her wharf sucking in entire harvests of wheat from the San Joaquin valley harvests that were to feed strangely clad skeletons on the southern slopes of the Himalaya foothills
Travis and Condy edged their way among piles of wheatbags dodging drays and rumbling trucks and finally brought up at the after gangplank where a sailor halted them
Condy exhibited his reporters badge
I represent The Times he said with profound solemnity and I want to see the officer in charge
The sailor fell back upon the instant
Power of the press whispered Condy to Travis as the two gained the deck
A second sailor directed them to the mate whom they found in the chartroom engaged singularly enough in trimming the leaves of a scraggly geranium
Condy explained his mission with flattering allusions to the whaleback and the novelty of the construction
The matean old man with a patriarchal beardsoftened at once asked them into his own cabin aft and even brought out a campstool for Travis brushing it with his sleeve before setting it down
While Condy was interviewing the old fellow Travis was examining with the interest of a child the details of the cabin the rack like bunk the washstand ingeniously constructed so as to shut into the bulkhead when not in use the alarmclock screwed to the wall and the array of photographs thrust into the mirror between frame and glass
One an old daguerreotype particularly caught her fancy
It was the portrait of a very beautiful girl wearing the oldfashioned side curls and high comb of a halfcentury previous
The old mate noticed the attention she paid to it and as soon as he had done giving information to Condy turned and nodded to Travis and said quietly She was pretty wasnt she
Oh very
answered Travis without looking away
There was a silence
Then the mate his eyes wide and thoughtful said with a long breath And she was just about your age miss when I saw her and you favor her too
Condy and Travis held their breaths in attention
There in the cabin of that curious nondescript whaleback they had come suddenly to the edge of a romancea romance that had been lived through before they were born
Then Travis said in a low voice and sweetly She died
Before I ever set eyes on her miss
That is MAYBE she died
I sometimes thinkfact is I really believe shes alive yet and waiting for me
He hesitated awkwardly
I dunno he said pulling his beard
I dont usually tell that story to strange folk but you remind me so of her that I guess I will
Condy sat down on the edge of the bunk and the mate seated himself on the plush settle opposite the door his elbows on his knees his eyes fixed on a patch of bright sunlight upon the deck outside
I began life he said as a deepsea diverbegan pretty young too
I first put on the armor when I was twenty nothing but a lad but I could take the pressure up to seventy pounds even then
One of my very first dives was off Trincomalee on the coast of Ceylon
A mail packet had gone down in a squall with all on board
Six of the bodies had come up and had been recovered but the seventh hadnt
It was the body of the daughter of the governor of the island a beautiful young girl of nineteen whom everybody loved
I was sent for to go down and bring the body up
Well I went down
The packet lay in a hundred feet of water and thats a wonder deep dive
I had to go down twice
The first time I couldnt find anything though I went all through the berthdeck
I came up to the wreckingfloat and reported that I had seen nothing
There were a lot of men there belonging to the wrecking gang and some correspondents of London papers
But they would have it that she was below and had me go down again
I did and this time I found her
The mate paused a moment Ill have to tell you he went on that when a body dont come to the surface it will stand or sit in a perfectly natural position until a current or movement of the water around touches it
When that happenswell youd say the body was alive and old divers have a superstitionno it AINT just a superstition I believe its sothat drowned people really dont die till they come to the surface and the air touches them
We say that the drowned who dont come up still have some sort of life of their own way down there in all that green watersome kind of lifesurelysurely
When I went down the second time I came across the door of what I thought at first was the linencloset
But it turned out to be a little stateroom
I opened it
There was the girl
She was sitting on the sofa opposite the door with a little hat on her head and holding a satchel in her lap just as if she was ready to go ashore
Her eyes were wide open and she was looking right at me and smiling
It didnt seem terrible or ghastly in the least
She seemed very sweet
When I opened the door it set the water in motion and she got up and dropped the satchel and came toward me smiling and holding out her arms
I stepped back quick and shut the door and sat down in one of the saloon chairs to fetch my breath for it had given me a start
The next thing to do was to send her up
But I began to think
She seemed so pretty as she was
What was the use of bringing her upup there on the wrecking float with that crowd of menup where the air would get at her and where they would put her in the ground along o the worms
If I left her there shed always be sweet and prettyalways be nineteen and I remembered what old divers said about drowned people living just so long as they stayed below
You see I was only a lad then and things like that impress you when youre young
Well I signaled to be hauled up
They asked me on the float if Id seen anything and I said no
That was all there was to the affair
They never raised the ship and in a little while it was all forgotten
But I never forgot it and I always remembered her way down there in all that still green water waiting there in that little stateroom for me to come back and open the door
And Ive growed to be an old man remembering her but shes always stayed just as she was the first day I saw her when she came toward me smiling and holding out her arms
Shes always stayed young and fresh and pretty
I never saw her but that once
Only afterward I got her picture from a native woman of Trincomalee who was housekeeper at the Residency where the governor of the island lived
Somehow I never could care for other women after that and I aint never married for that reason
No no of course not
exclaimed Travis in a low voice as the old fellow paused
Fine fine oh fine as gold
murmured Condy under his breath
Well said the mate getting up and rubbing his knee thats the story
Now you know all about that picture
Will you have a glass of Madeira miss
He got out a bottle of wine bearing the genuine Funchal label and filled three tiny glasses
Travis pushed up her veil and she and Condy rose
This is to HER said Travis gravely
Thank you miss answered the mate and the three drank in silence
As Travis and Condy were going down the gangplank they met the captain of the whaleback coming up
I saw you in there talking to old McPherson he explained
Did you get what you wanted from him
More more
exclaimed Condy
My hand in the fire he told you that yarn about the girl who was drowned off Trincomalee
Of course I knew it
The old boys wits are turned on that subject
He WILL have it that the body hasnt decomposed in all this time
Good seaman enough and a firstclass navigator but hes soft in that one spot
Chapter IV Oh but the STORY of it
exclaimed Condy as he and Travis regained the wharfthe story of it
Isnt it a ripper
Isnt it a corker
His leaving her that way and never caring for any other girl afterward
And so original she commented quite as enthusiastic as he
Originalwhy its new as paint
ItsitsTravis Ill make a story out of this that will be copied in every paper between the two oceans
They were so interested in the mates story that they forgot to take a car and walked up Clay Street talking it over suggesting rearranging and embellishing and Condy was astonished and delighted to note that she caught on to the idea as quickly as he and knew the telling points and what details to leave out
And Ill make a bangup article out of the whaleback herself declared Condy
The idea of the article had returned to him and all his enthusiasm with it
And look here he said showing her the letter from the Centennial Company
They turned down my book but see what they say
Quite an unusual order of merit
cried Travis
Why thats fine
Why didnt you show this to me beforeand asking you like this to write them a novel of adventure
What MORE can you want
Oh
she exclaimed impatiently thats so like you you would tell everybody about your reverses and carry on about them yourself but never say a word when you get a little boom
Have you an idea for a thirtythousandword novel
Wouldnt that divers story do
No theres not enough in that for thirty thousand words
I havent any idea at allnever wrote a story of adventurenever wrote anything longer than six thousand words
But Ill keep my eye open for something that will do
By the wayby Jove
Travis where are we
They looked briskly around them and the bustling breezy water front faded from their recollections
They were in a world of narrow streets of galleries and overhanging balconies
Craziest structures riddled and honeycombed with stairways and passages shut out the sky though here and there rose a building of extraordinary richness and most elaborate ornamentation
Color was everywhere
A thousand little notes of green and yellow of vermilion and sky blue assaulted the eye
Here it was a doorway here a vivid glint of cloth or hanging here a huge scarlet sign lettered with gold and here a kaleidoscopic effect in the garments of a passerby
Directly opposite and two stories above their heads a sort of huge loggia one blaze of gilding and crude vermilions opened in the gray cement of a crumbling facade like a sudden burst of flame
Gigantic potbellied lanterns of red and gold swung from its ceiling while along its railing stood a row of potsbrass ruddy bronze and blue porcelainfrom which were growing red saffron purple pink and golden tulips without number
The air was vibrant with unfamiliar noises
From one of the balconies near at hand though unseen a gong a pipe and some kind of stringed instrument wailed and thundered in unison
There was a vast shuffling of padded soles and a continuous interchange of singsong monosyllables highpitched and staccato while from every hand rose the strange aromas of the East sandalwood punk incense oil and the smell of mysterious cookery
Chinatown
exclaimed Travis
I hadnt the faintest idea we had come up so far
Condy Rivers do you know what time it is
She pointed a white kid finger through the doorway of a drugstore where amid lacquer boxes and bronze urns of herbs and dried seeds a round Seth Thomas marked halfpast two
And your lunch
cried Condy
Great heavens
I never thought
Its too late to get any at home
Never mind Ill go somewhere and have a cup of tea
Why not get a package of Chinese tea now that youre down here and take it home with you
Or drink it here
Where
In one of the restaurants
There wouldnt be a soul there at this hour
I know they serve tea any time
Condy lets try it
Wouldnt it be fun
Condy smote his thigh
Fun
he vociferated fun
It isby Joveit would be HEAVENLY
Wait a moment
Ill tell you what we will do
Tea wont be enough
Well go down to Kearney Street or to the market and get some crackers to go with it
They hurried back to the California market a few blocks distant and bought some crackers and a wedge of new cheese
On the way back to Chinatown Travis stopped at a music store on Kearney Street to get her banjo which she had left to have its head tightened and thus burdened they regained the town Condy grieving audibly at having to carry brownpaper bundles through the street
First catch your restaurant said Travis as they turned into Dupont Street with its thronging coolies and swarming gayly clad children
But they had not far to seek
Here you are
suddenly exclaimed Condy halting in front of a wholesale teahouse bearing a sign in Chinese and English
Come on Travis
They ascended two flights of a broad brassbound staircase leading up from the ground floor and gained the restaurant on the top story of the building
As Travis had foretold it was deserted
She clasped her gloved hands gayly crying Isnt it delightful
Weve the whole place to ourselves
The restaurant ran the whole depth of the building and was finished off at either extremity with a gilded balcony one overlooking Dupont Street and the other the old Plaza
Enormous screens of gilded ebony intricately carved and set with colored glass panes divided the room into three and one of these divisions in the rear part from which they could step out upon the balcony that commanded the view of the Plaza they elected as their own
It was charming
At their backs they had the huge fantastic screen brave and fine with its coat of gold
In front through the glasspaned valves of a pair of folding doors they could see the roofs of the houses beyond the Plaza and beyond these the blue of the bay with its anchored ships and even beyond this the faint purple of the Oakland shore
On either side of these doors in deep alcoves were divans with mattings and headrests for opium smokers
The walls were painted blue and hung with vertical Cantonese legends in red and silver while all around the sides of the room small ebony tables alternated with ebony stools each inlaid with a slab of mottled marble
A chandelier all aglitter with tinsel swung from the centre of the ceiling over a huge round table of mahogany
And not a soul was there to disturb them
Below them out there around the old Plaza the city drummed through its work with a lazy soothing rumble
Nearer at hand Chinatown sent up the vague murmur of the life of the Orient
In the direction of the Mexican quarter the bell of the cathedral knolled at intervals
The sky was without a cloud and the afternoon was warm
Condy was inarticulate with the joy of what he called their discovery
He got up and sat down
He went out into the other room and came back again
He dragged up a couple of the marble seated stools to the table
He took off his hat lighted a cigarette let it go out lighted it again and burned his fingers
He opened and closed the foldingdoors pushed the table into a better light and finally brought Travis out upon the balcony to show her the points of historical interest in and around the Plaza
Theres the Stevenson memorial ship in the centre see and right there where the flagstaff is General Baker made the funeral oration over the body of Terry
Broderick killed him in a duel or was it Terry killed Broderick
I forget which
Anyhow right opposite where that pawnshop is is where the Overland stages used to start in 49
And every other building that fronts on the Plaza even this one were in now used to be a gamblinghouse in bonanza times and see over yonder is the Morgue and the City Prison
They turned back into the room and a great fat Chinaman brought them tea on Condys order
But besides tea he brought dried almonds pickled watermelon rinds candied quince and China nuts
Travis cut the cheese into cubes with Condys penknife and arranged the cubes in geometric figures upon the crackers
But Condy she complained why in the world did you get so many crackers
Theres hundreds of them hereenough to feed a regiment
Why didnt you ask me
Huh
what
what
I dont know
Whats the matter with the crackers
You were dickering with the cheese and the man said How many crackers
I didnt know
I said Oh give me a quarters worth
And we couldnt possibly have eaten ten cents worth
Oh Condy you areyou areBut never mind heres your tea
I wonder if this green pasty stuff is good
They found that it was but so sweet that it made their tea taste bitter
The watermelon rinds were flat to their Western palates but the dried almonds were a great success
Then Condy promptly got the hiccoughs from drinking his tea too fast and fretted up and down the room like a chicken with the pip till Travis grew faint and weak with laughter
Oh well he exclaimed aggrievedlylaugh thats right
I dont laugh
It isnt such fun when youve got em yoursel HULP
But sit down for goodness sake
You make me so nervous
You cant walk them off
Sit down and hold your breath while you count nine
Condy Im going to take off my gloves and veil
What do you think
Sure of course and Ill have a cigarette
Do you mind if I smoke
Well whats that in your hand now
By Jove I have been smoking
II beg your pardon
Im a regular stable boy
Ill throw it away
Travis caught his wrist
What nonsense
I would have told you before if Id minded
But its gone out
he exclaimed
Ill have another
As he reached into his pocket for his case his hand encountered a papercovered volume
and he drew it out in some perplexity
Now how in the wide world did that book come in my pocket
he muttered frowning
What have I been carrying it around for
Ive forgotten
I declare I have
What book is it
Hey
bookhm he murmured staring
Travis pounded on the table
Wake up Condy Im talking to you she called
Its Lifes Handicap he answered with a start but why and but why have I Whats it about
I never heard of it she declared
You never heard of Lifes Handicap
he shouted you never heardyou neveryou mean to say you never heardbut here this wont do
Sit right still and Ill read you one of these yarns before youre another minute older
Any one of themopen the book at random
Here we areThe Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes and its a stemwinder too
And then for the first time in her life there in that airy golden Chinese restaurant in the city from which he hasted to flee Travis Bessemer fell under the charm of the little spectacled colonial to whose song we all must listen and to whose pipe we all must dance
There was one point in the story of Jukes strange ride that Condy prided himself upon having discovered
So far as he knew all critics had overlooked it
It is where Jukes is describing the mantrap of the City of the Dead who are alive and mentions that the slope of the inclosing sandhills was about fortyfive degrees
Jukes was a civil engineer and Condy held that it was a capital bit of realism on the part of the author to have him speak of the pitch of the hills in just such technical terms
At first he thought he would call Travis attention to this bit of cleverness but as he read he abruptly changed his mind
He would see if she would find it out for herself
It would be a test of her quickness he told himself almost an unfair test because the point was extremely subtle and could easily be ignored by the most experienced of fiction readers
He read steadily on working himself into a positive excitement as he approached the passage
He came to it and read it through without any emphasis almost slurring over it in his eagerness to be perfectly fair
But as he began to read the next paragraph Travis her little eyes sparkling with interest and attention exclaimed Just as an engineer would describe it
Isnt that good
Glory hallelujah
cried Condy slamming down the book joyfully
Travis you are one in a thousand
Whatwhat is it
she inquired blankly
Never mind never mind youre a wonder thats alland he finished the tale without further explanation
Then while he smoked another cigarette and she drank another cup of tea he read to her The Return of Imri and the Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney
He found her an easy and enrapt convert to the little Englishmans creed and for himself tasted the intense delight of revealing to another an appreciation of a literature hitherto ignored
Isnt he strong
cried Travis
Just a LITTLE better than Marie Corelli and the Duchess
And to think of having all those stories to read
You havent read any of them yet
Not a one
Ive been reading only the novels we take up in the Wednesday class
Lord
muttered Condy
Condys spirits had been steadily rising since the incident aboard the whaleback
The exhilaration of the waterfront his delight over the story he was to make out of the old mates yarn Chinatown the charming unconventionality of their lunch in the Chinese restaurant the sparkling serenity of the afternoon and the joy of discovering Travis appreciation of his adored and venerated author had put him into a mood bordering close upon hilarity
The next event upon our interesting programme he announced will be a banjosephine obligato in Asia minor by that justly renowned impresario Signor Conde Tinpani Rivers specially engaged for this performance with a pleasing and panhellenic songanddance turn by Miss Travis Bessemer the infant phenomenon otherwise known as Babby Bessie
Youre not going to play that banjo here
said Travis as he stripped away the canvas covering
Order in the gallery
cried Condy beginning to tune up
Then in a rapid professional monotone Ladiesandgentlemen  with  your  kind  permission  I  will  endeavor  to  give  you  an  imitation  of  a  Carolina  coon  songand without more ado singing the words to a rattling catchy accompaniment swung off into For MY gals a highborn leddy SHES brack but not too shady
He did not sing loud and the clack and snarl of the banjo carried hardly further than the adjoining room but there was no one to hear and as he went along even Travis began to hum the words but at that Condy stopped abruptly laid the instrument across his knees with exaggerated solicitude and said deliberately Travis you are a good sweet girl and what you lack in beauty you make up in amiability and Ive no doubt you are kind to your aged father but youcannotsing
Travis was cross in a moment all the more so because Condy had spoken the exact truth
It was quite impossible for her to carry a tune half a dozen bars without entangling herself in as many different keys
What voice she had was not absolutely bad but as she persisted in singing in spite of Condys guying he put back his head and began a mournful and lugubrious howling
Ho
she exclaimed grabbing the banjo from his knees if I cant sing I can play better than some smart people
Yes by note rallied Condy as Travis executed a banjo piece of no little intricacy
Thats just like a machinelike a hand piano
Order in the gallery
she retorted without pausing in her playing
She finished with a great flourish and gazed at him in triumph only to find him pretending a profound slumber
Oo o
she remarked between her teeth I just hate you Condy Rivers
There are others he returned airily
Talk about slang
NOW what will we do
he cried
Lets DO something
Suppose we break somethingjust for fun
Then suddenly the gayety went out of his face and he started up and clapped his hand to his head with a gasp of dismay
Great Heavens
he exclaimed
Condy cried Travis in alarm what is it The Tea
he vociferated
Laurie Flaggs Tea
I ought to be thereright this minute
Travis fetched a sigh of relief
Is that all
All
he retorted
All
Why its past four nowand Id forgotten every last thing
Then suddenlly falling calm again and quietly resuming his seat I dont see as it makes any difference
I wont go thats all
Push those almonds here will you Miss LadyBut we arent DOING anything he exclaimed with a brusque return of exuberance
Lets do things
Whatll we do
Think of something
Is there anything we can break
Then without any transition he vaulted upon the table and began to declaim with tremendous gestures There once was a beast called an Ounce Who went with a spring and a bounce
His head was as flat As the head of a cat This quadrupetantical Ounce tical Ounce This quadrupetantical Ounce
Youd think from his name he was small But that was not like him at all
He weighed Ill be bound Three or four hundred pound And he looked most uncommonly tall monly tall And he looked most uncommonly tall
Bravo
bravo
cried Travis pounding on the table
Hear hear none Brutus none
Condy sat down on the table and swung his legs But during the next few moments while they were eating the last of their cheese his good spirits fell rapidly away from him
He heaved a sigh and thrust both hands gloomily into his pockets
Cheese Condy
asked Travis
He shook his head with a dark frown muttering No cheese no cheese
Whats wrong Condywhats the matter
asked Travis with concern
For some time he would not tell her answering all her inquiries by closing his eyes and putting his chin in the air nodding his head in knowing fashion
But what is it
You dont respect me he muttered and for a long time this was all that could be got from him
No no she did not respect him no she did not take him seriously
But of course I do
Why dont I
Condy Rivers whats got into you NOW
No no I know it
I can tell
You dont take me seriously
You dont respect me
But why
Make a blooming buffoon of myself he mumbled tragically
In great distress Travis labored to contradict him
Why they had just been having a good time that was all
Why she had been just as silly as he
Condy caught at the word
Silly
There
I knew it
I told you
Im silly
Im a buffoonBut havent we had a great afternoon
he added with a sudden grin
I never remember announced Travis emphatically when Ive had a better time than Ive had today and I know just why its been such a success
Why then
Because weve had no foolishness
Weve just been ourselves and havent pretended we were in love with each other when we are not
Condy lets do this lots
Do what
Go round to queer little interesting little places
Weve had a glorious time today havent weand we havent been talked out once
As we were last night for instance he hazarded
I THOUGHT you felt it the same as I did
It WAS a bit awful wasnt it
It was
From now on lets make a resolution
I know youve had a good time today
Havent you had a better time than if you had gone to the Tea
Well RATHER
I dont know when Ive had a better jollier afternoon
Well now were going to try to have lots more good times but just as chums
Weve tried the other and it failed
Now be sincere didnt it fail
It worked out
It DID work out
Now from this time on no more foolishness
Well just be chums
Chums it is
No more foolishness
The moment you begin to pretend youre in love with me it will spoil everything
Its funny said Travis drawing on her gloves
Were doing a funny thing Condy
With ninetynine people out of one hundred this little affair would have been all ended after our explanation of last nightconfessing as we did that we didnt love each other
Most couples would have drifted apart but here we are planning to be chums and have good times in our own original unconventional wayand we can do it too
There there hes a thousand miles away
Hes not heard a single word Ive said
Condy are you listening to me
Blix he murmured staring at her vaguely
Blixyou look that way I dont know look kind of blix
Dont you feel sort of blix
he inquired anxiously
Blix
He smote the table with his palm
Capital
he cried sounds bully and snappy and crisp and bright and sort of sudden
Soundsdont you know THIS way
and he snapped his fingers
Dont you see what I mean
Blix thats who you are
Youve always been Blix and Ive just found it out
Blix he added listening to the sound of the name
Blix Blix
Yes yes thats your name
Blix
she repeated but why Blix
Why not
I dont know why not
Well then he declared as though that settled the question
They made ready to go as it was growing late
Will you tie that for me Condy she asked rising and turning the back of her head toward him the ends of the veil held under her fingers
Not too tight
Condy dont pull it so tight
There there that will do
Have you everything that belongs to you
I know youll go away and leave something here
Theres your cigarette case and your book and of course the banjo
As if warned by a mysterious instinct the fat Chinaman made his appearance in the outer room
Condy put his fingers into his vest pocket then dropped back upon his stool with a suppressed exclamation of horror
Condy
exclaimed Blix in alarm are you sick
for he had turned a positive white
I havent a cent of money he murmured faintly
I spent my last quarter for those beastly crackers
Whats to be done
What is to be done
IllIll leave him my watch
Yes thats the only thing
Blix calmly took out her purse
I expected it she said resignedly
I knew this would happen sooner or later and I always have been prepared
How much is it John
she asked of the Chinaman
Hefahdollah
Ill never be able to look you in the face again protested Condy
Ill pay you back tonight
I will
Ill send it up by a messenger boy
Then you WOULD be a buffoon
Dont
he exclaimed
Dont it humiliates me to the dust
Oh come along and dont be so absurd
It must be after five
Halfway down the brassbound stairs he clapped his hand to his head with a start
And NOW what is it
she inquired meekly
Forgotten forgotten
he exclaimed
I knew I would forget something
I knew it you mean
He ran back and returned with the great bag of crackers and thrust it into her hands
Here here take these
We mustnt leave these he declared earnestly
It would be a shameful waste of money and in spite of all her protests he insisted upon taking the crackers along
I wonder said Blix as the two skirted the Plaza going down to Kearney Street I wonder if I ought to ask him to supper
Ask whomehow funny to I wonder if we are talked outif it would spoil the day
Anyhow Im going to have supper at the Club and Ive got to write my article some time tonight
Blix fixed him with a swift glance of genuine concern
Dont play tonight Condy she said with a sudden gravity
Fat lot I can play
What money have I got to play with
You might get some somewheres
But anyhow promise me you wont play
Well of course Ill promise
How can I if I havent any money
And besides Ive got my whaleback stuff to write
Ill have supper at the Club and go up in the library and grind out copy for a while
Condy said Blix I think that divers story is almost too good for The Times
Why dont you write it and send it East
Send it to the Centennial Company why dont you
Theyve paid some attention to you now and it would keep your name in their minds if you sent the story to them even if they didnt publish it
Why dont you think of that
Finegreat idea
Ill do that
Only Ill have to write it out of business hours
It will be extra work
Never mind you do it and she added as he put her on the cable car keep your mind on that thirtythousandword story of adventure
Goodby Condy havent we had the jolliest day that ever was
Couldnt have been better
Goodby Blix
Condy returned to his club It was about six oclock
In response to his question the hallboy told him that Tracy Sargeant had arrived a few moments previous and had been asking for him
The Saturday of the week before Condy had made an engagement with young Sargeant to have supper together that night and perhaps go to the theatre afterward
And now at the sight of Sargeant in the round window of the main room buried in the file of the Gil Blas Condy was pleased to note that neither of them had forgotten the matter
Sargeant greeted him with extreme cordiality as he came up and at once proposed a drink
Sargeant was a sleek wellgroomed well looking fellow of thirty just beginning to show the effects of a certain amount of dissipation in the little puffs under the eyes and the faint blueness of the temples
The sudden death of his father for which event Sargeant was still mourning had left him in such position that his monthly income was about five times as large as Condys salary
The two had supper together and Sargeant proposed the theatre
No no Ive got to work tonight asserted Condy
After dinner while they were smoking their cigars in a window of the main room one of the hallboys came up and touched Condy on the arm
Mr Eckert and Mr Hendricks and Mr George Hands and several other of those gentlemen are up in the cardroom and are asking for you and Mr
Sargeant
Why I didnt know the boys were here
Theyve got a game going Condy
Lets go up and get in
Shall we
Condy remembered that he had no money
Im flat broke Tracy he announced for he knew Sargeant well enough to make the confession without wincing
No Ill not get in but Ill go up and watch you a few minutes
They ascended to the cardroom where the air was heavy and acrid with cigar smoke and where the silence was broken only by the click of pokerchips
At the end of twenty minutes Condy was playing having borrowed enough money of Sargeant to start him in the game
Unusually talkative and restless he had suddenly hardened and stiffened to a repressed tense calm speechless almost rigid in his chair
Excitable under even ordinary circumstances his every faculty was now keyed to its highest pitch
The nervous strain upon him was like the stretching and tightening of harpstrings too taut to quiver
The color left his face and the moisture fled his lips
His projected article his promise to Blix all the jollity of the afternoon all thought of time or place faded away as the one indomitable evil passion of the man leaped into life within him and lashed and roweled him with excitement
His world resolved itself to a round green table columns of tri colored chips and five everchanging cards that came and went and came again before his tired eyes like the changing weaving colors of the kaleidoscope
Midnight struck then one oclock then two three and four
Still his passion rode him like a hag spurring the jaded body rousing up the wearied brain
Finally at halfpast four at a time when Condy was precisely where he had started neither winner nor loser by so much as a dime a round of Jackpots was declared and the game broke up
Condy walked home to the uptown hotel where he lived with his mother and went to bed as the first milkwagons began to make their appearance and the newsboys to cry the morning papers
Then as his tired eyes closed at last occurred that strange trick of picturemaking that the overtaxed brain plays upon the retina
A swift series of pictures of the days doings began to whirl THROUGH rather than BEFORE the pupils of his shut eyes
Condy saw again a brief vision of the street and Blix upon the corner waiting to cross then it was the gay brisk confusion of the waterfront the old mates cabin aboard the whaleback Chinatown and a loop of vermilion cloth over a gallery rail the golden balcony the glint of the Stevenson ship upon the green Plaza Blix playing the banjo the delightful and picturesque confusion of the deserted Chinese restaurant Blix again turning her head for him to fasten her veil holding the ends with her whitekid fingers Blix once more walking at his side with her trim black skirt her round little turban hat her yellow hair and her small dark dancing eyes
Then suddenly he remembered the promise he had made her in the matter of playing that night
He winced sharply at this and the remembrance of his fault harried and harassed him
In spite of himself he felt contemptible
Yet he had broken his promises to her in this very matter of playing beforebefore that day of their visit to the Chinese restaurantand had felt no great qualm of selfreproach
Had their relations changed
Rather the reverse for they had done with foolishness
Never worried me before muttered Condy as he punched up his pillownever worried me before
Why should it worry me now worry me like the deviland she caught on to that point about the slope of fortyfive degrees
Chapter V Condy began his weeks work for the supplement behindhand
Naturally he overslept himself Tuesday morning and not having any change in his pockets was obliged to walk down to the office
He arrived late to find the compositors already fretting for copy
His editor promptly asked for the whaleback stuff and Condy was forced into promising it within a halfhour
It was out of the question to write the article according to his own idea in so short a time so Condy faked the stuff from the exchange clipping after all
His description of the boat and his comments upon her missiontaken largely at second handserved only to fill space in the paper
They were lacking both in interest and in point
There were no illustrations
The article was a failure
But Condy redeemed himself by a witty interview later in the week with an emotional actress and by a solemn article compiled after an hours reading in Lafcadio Hearn and the Encyclopediaon the Industrial Renaissance in Japan
But the idea of the divers story came back to him again and again and Thursday night after supper he went down to his club and hid himself at a corner desk in the library and in a burst of enthusiasm wrote out some two thousand words of it
In order to get the technical details upon which he set such store he consulted the Encyclopedias again and worked in a number of unfamiliar phrases and oddsounding names
He was so proud of the result that he felt he could not wait until the tale was finished and in print to try its effect
He wanted appreciation and encouragement upon the instant
He thought of Blix
She saw the point in Morrowbie Jukes description of the slope of the sandhill he told himself and the next moment had resolved to go up and see her the next evening and read to her what he had written
This was on Thursday
All through that week Blix had kept much to herself and for the first time in two years had begun to spend every evening at home
In the morning of each day she helped Victorine with the upstairs work making the beds putting the rooms to rights or consulted with the butchers and grocers boys at the head of the back stairs or chaffered with urbane and smiling Chinamen with their balanced vegetable baskets
She knew the house and its management at her fingers ends and supervised everything that went forward
Laurie Flagg coming to call upon her on Wednesday afternoon to remonstrate upon her sudden defection found her in the act of tacking up a curtain across the pantry window
But Blix had the afternoons and evenings almost entirely to herself
These hours heretofore taken up with functions and the discharge of obligations dragged not a little during the week that followed upon her declaration of independence
Wednesday afternoon however was warm and fine and she went to the Park with Snooky
Without looking for it or even expecting it Blix came across a little Japanese teahouse or rather a tiny Japanese garden set with almost toy Japanese houses and pavilions where tea was served and thin sweetish wafers for five cents
Blix and Snooky went in
There was nobody about but the Japanese serving woman
Snooky was in raptures and Blix spent a delightful half hour there drinking Japanese tea and feeding the wafers to the carp and goldfish in the tiny pond immediately below where she sat
A Chinaman evidently of the merchant class came in with a Chinese woman following
As he took his place and the Japanese girl came up to get his order Blix overheard him say in English Bring tea forum leddy
He had to speak in English to her she whispered isnt that splendid
Did you notice that Snooky
On the way home Blix was wondering how she should pass her evening
She was to have made one of a theatre party where Jack Carter was to be present
Then she suddenly remembered Morrowbie Jukes The Return of Imri and Krishna Mulvaney
She continued on past her home downtown and returned late for supper with Plain Tales and Many Inventions
Toward halfpast eight there came a titter of the electric bell
At the moment Blix was in the upper chamber of the house of Suddhoo quaking with exquisite horror at the Sealcutters magic
She looked up quickly as the bell rang
It was not Condy Rivers touch
She swiftly reflected that it was Wednesday night and that she might probably expect Frank Catlin
He was a fair specimen of the Younger Set a sort of modified Jack Carter and called upon her about once a fortnight
No doubt he would hint darkly as to his riotous living during the past few days and refer to his diet of bromoseltzers
He would be slangy familiar call her by her first name as many times as he dared discuss the last dance of the Saturday cotillion and try to make her laugh over Carters drunkenness
Blix knew the type
Catlin was hardly out of college but the older girls even the young women of twenty five or six encouraged and petted these youngsters driven to the alternative by the absolute dearth of older men
Im not at home Victorine announced Blix intercepting the maid in the hall
It chanced that it was not Frank Catlin but another boy of precisely the same breed and Blix returned to Suddhoo Mrs Hawksbee and Mulvaney with a little cuddling movement of satisfaction
There is only one thing I regret about this she said to Condy Rivers on the Friday night of that week that is that I never thought of doing it before
Then suddenly she put up her hand to shield her eyes as though from an intense light turning away her head abruptly
I say what is it
Whatwhats the matter
he exclaimed
Blix peeped at him fearfully from between her fingers
Hes got it on she whisperedthat awful crimson scarf
Hoh
said Condy touching his scarf nervously itsits very swell
Is it too loud
he asked uneasily
Blix put her fingers in her ears then Condy youre a nice amiable young man and if youre not brilliant youre good and kind to your aged mother but your scarfs and neckties are simply impossible
Well look at this room
he shoutedthey were in the parlor
You neednt talk about bad taste
Those drapesohh
those drapes
Yellow shelp me
And those bisque figures that you get with every pound of tea you buy and this this THIS he whimpered waving his hands at the decorated sewerpipe with its gilded cattails
Oh speak to me of this speak to me of art speak to me of aesthetics
Cattails GILDED
Of course why not GILDED
He wrung his hands
Somewhere people are happy
Somewhere little children are at play Oh hush
she interrupted
I know its bad but weve always had it so and I wont have it abused
Lets go into the dining room anyway
Well sit in there after this
Weve always been stiff and constrained in here
They went out into the diningroom and drew up a couple of arm chairs into the bay window and sat there looking out
Blix had not yet lighted the gasit was hardly dark enough for that and for upward of ten minutes they sat and watched the evening dropping into night
Below them the hill fell away so abruptly that the roofs of the nearest houses were almost at their feet and beyond these the city tumbled raggedly down to meet the bay in a confused vague mass of roofs cornices cupolas and chimneys blurred and indistinct in the twilight but here and there pierced by a new lighted street lamp
Then came the bay
To the east they could see Goat Island and the fleet of sailingships anchored off the waterfront while directly in their line of vision the island of Alcatraz with its triple crown of forts started from the surface of the water
Beyond was the Contra Costa shore a vast streak of purple against the sky
The eye followed its skyline westward till it climbed climbed climbed up a long slope that suddenly leaped heavenward with the crest of Tamalpais purple and still looking always to the sunset like a great watching sphinx
Then further on the slope seemed to break like the breaking of an advancing billow and go tumbling crumbling downward to meet the Golden Gatethe narrow inlet of green tidewater with its flanking Presidio
But further than this the eye was stayed
Further than this there was nothing nothing but a vast illimitable plain of greenthe open Pacific
But at this hour the color of the scene was its greatest charm
It glowed with all the sombre radiance of a cathedral
Everything was seen through a haze of purplefrom the low green hills in the Presidio Reservation to the faint red mass of Mount Diablo shrugging its rugged shoulder over the Contra Costa foothills
As the evening faded the west burned down to a dull red glow that overlaid the blue of the bay with a sheen of ruddy gold
The foothills of the opposite shore Diablo and at last even Tamalpais resolved themselves in the velvet gray of the sky
Outlines were lost
Only the masses remained and these soon began to blend into one another
The sky and land and the citys huddled roofs were one
Only the sheen of dull gold remained piercing the single vast mass of purple like the blade of a golden sword
Theres a ship
said Blix in a low tone
A fourmaster was dropping quietly through the Golden Gate swimming on that sheen of gold a mere shadow specked with lights red and green
In a few moments her bows were shut from sight by the old fort at the Gate
Then her red light vanished then the mainmast
She was gone
By midnight she would be out of sight of land rolling on the swell of the lonely ocean under the moons white eye
Condy and Blix sat quiet and without speech not caring to break the charm of the evening
For quite five minutes they sat thus watching the stars light one by one and the immense gray night settle and broaden and widen from mountaintop to horizon
They did not feel the necessity of making conversation
There was no constraint in their silence now
Gently and a little at a time Condy turned his head and looked at Blix
There was just light enough to see
She was leaning back in her chair her hands fallen into her lap her head back and a little to one side
As usual she was in black but now it was some sort of dinnergown that left her arms and neck bare
The line of the chin and the throat and the sweet round curve of the shoulder had in it something indescribablesomething that was related to music and that eluded speech
Her hair was nothing more than a warm colored mist without form or outline
The sloe brown of her little eyes and the flush of her cheek were mere inferenceslike the faintest stars that are never visible when looked at directly and it seemed to him that there was disengaged from her something for which there was no name something that appealed to a mysterious sixth sensea sense that only stirred at such quiet moments as this something that was now a dim sweet radiance now a faint aroma and now again a mere essence an influence an impressionnothing more
It seemed to him as if her sweet clean purity and womanliness took a form of its own which his accustomed senses were too gross to perceive
Only a certain vague tenderness in him went out to meet and receive this impalpable presence a tenderness not for her only but for all the good things of the world
Often he had experienced the same feeling when listening to music
Her sweetness her goodness appealed to what he guessed must be the noblest in him
And she was only nineteen
Suddenly his heart swelled the ache came to his throat and the smart to his eyes
Blixy he said just above a whisper Blixy wish I was a better sort of chap
Thats the beginning of being better isnt it Condy
she answered turning toward him her chin on her hand
It does seem a pity he went on that when you WANT to do the right straight thing and be clean and fine that you cant just BE it and have it over with
Its the keeping it up thats the grind
But its the keeping it up Condy that makes you WORTH BEING GOOD when you finally get to be good dont you think
Its the keeping it up that makes you strong and then when you get to be good you can make your goodness count
Whats a good man if hes weakif his goodness is better than he is himself
Its the good man who is strongas strong as his goodness and who can make his goodness countwho is the right kind of man
Thats what I think
Theres something in that theres something in that
Then after a pause I played Monday night after all Blix after promising I wouldnt
For a time she did not answer and when she spoke she spoke quietly WellIm glad you told me and after a little she added Cant you stop Condy
Why yesyes of courseIoh Blix sometimes I dont know
You cant understand
How could a girl understand the power of it
Other things I dont say but when it comes to gambling there seems to be another me that does precisely as he chooses whether I will or not
But Im going to do my best
I havent played since although there was plenty of chance
You see this card business is only a part of this club life this city lifelike drinking andother vices of men
If I didnt have to lead the life or if I didnt go with that crowdSargeant and the rest of those menit would be different easier maybe
But a man ought to be strong enough to be himself and master of himself anywhere
Condy IS there anything in the world better or finer than a strong man
Not unless it is a good woman Blix
I suppose I look at it from a womans point of view but for me a STRONG manstrong in everythingis the grandest thing in the world
Women love strong men Condy
They can forgive a strong man almost anything
Condy did not immediately answer and in the interval an idea occurred to Blix that at once hardened into a determination
But she said nothing at the moment
The spell of the sunset was gone and they had evidently reached the end of that subject of their talk
Blix rose to light the gas
Will you promise me one thing Condy
she said
Dont if you dont want to
But will you promise me that you will tell me whenever you do play
That Ill promise you
exclaimed Condy and Ill keep that too
And now lets hear the storyor what youve done of it
They drew up to the diningroom table with its cover of blue denim edged with white cord and Condy unrolled his manuscript and read through what he had written
She approved and as he had foreseen caught on to every one of his points
He was almost ready to burst into cheers when she said Any one reading that would almost believe you had been a diver yourself or at least had lived with divers
Those little details count dont they
Condy Ive an idea
See what you think of it
Instead of having the story end with his leaving her down there and going away do it this way
Let him leave her there and then go back after a long time when he gets to be an old man
Fix it up some way to make it natural
Have him go down to see her and never come up again see
And leave the reader in doubt as to whether it was an accident or whether he did it on purpose
Condy choked back a whoop and smote his knee
Blix youre the eighth wonder
Magnificentglorious
Say
he fixed her with a glance of curiosityyou ought to take to storywriting yourself
No no she retorted significantly
Ill just stay with my singing and be content with that
But remember that story dont go to The Times supplement
At least not until you have tried it Eastwith the Centennial Company at any rate
Well I guess NOT
snorted Condy
Why this is going to be one of the best yarns I ever wrote
A little later on he inquired with sudden concern Have you got anything to eat in the house
I never saw such a man
declared Blix you are always hungry
I love to eat he protested
Well well make some creamed oysters how would that do
suggested Blix
Condy rolled his eyes
Oh speak to me of creamed oysters
Then with abrupt solemnity Blix I never in my life had as many oysters as I could eat
She made the creamed oysters in the kitchen over the gasstove and they ate them thereCondy sitting on the washboard of the sink his plate in his lap
Condy had a way of catching up in his hands whatever happened to be nearest him and while still continuing to talk examining it with apparent deep interest
Just now it happened to be the mornings paper that Victorine had left on the table
For five minutes Condy had been picking it up and laying it down frowning abstractedly at it during the pauses in the conversation
Suddenly he became aware of what it was and instantly read aloud the first item that caught his glance PersonalYoung woman thirtyone good housekeeper desires acquaintance respectable middleaged gentleman
Object matrimony
Address K D B this officeHum
he commented nothing equivocal about K D B has the heroism to call herself young at thirtyone
Ill bet she IS a good housekeeper
Right to the point
If K D B dont see what she wants she asks for it
I wonder mused Blix what kind of people they are who put personals in the papers
K D B for instance who is she and what is she like
Theyre not tough Condy assured her
I see em often down at The Times office
They are usually a plain matteroffact sort quite conscientious you know generally middleagedor thirtyone outgrown their youthful follies and illusions and want to settle down
Read some more urged Blix
Condy went on
Bachelor good habits twentyfive affectionate disposition accomplishments money desires acquaintance pretty refined girl
Object matrimony
McB this office
No I dont like McB said Blix
Hes tooornamental somehow
He wouldnt do for K D B would he
Oh my no
Hed make her very unhappy
Widower two children homeloving disposition desires introduction to good honest woman to make home for his children
Matrimony if suitable
B P T Box A this office
Hes not for K D B thats flat declared Blix the idea matrimony if suitablepatronizing enough
I know just what kind of an old man B P T is
I know he would want K D B to warm his slippers and would be fretful and grumpy
B P T just an abbreviation of bumptious
No he cant have her
Condy read the next two or three to himself despite her protests
Condy dont be mean
Read them to Ah
he exclaimed heres one for K D B
Behold the bridegroom cometh
Listen
Bachelor thirtynine sober and industrious retired sea captain desires acquaintance respectable young woman good house keeper and manager
Object matrimony
Address Captain Jack office this paper
I know hes got a wooden leg
cried Blix
Cant you just see it sticking out between the lines
And he lives all alone somewhere down near the bay with a parrot And makes a glass of grog every night
And smokes a long clay pipe
But he chews tobacco
Yes isnt it a pity he will chew that nasty smelly tobacco
But K D B will break him of that
Oh is he for K D
B
Sent by Providence
declared Blix
They were born for each other
Just see K D B is a good housekeeper and wants a respectable middleaged gentleman
Captain Jack is a respectable middleaged gentleman and wants a good housekeeper
Oh and besides I can read between the lines
I just feel they would be congenial
If they know whats best for themselves they would write to each other right away
But wouldnt you love to be there and see them meet
exclaimed Condy
Cant we fix it up some way said Blix to bring these two togetherto help them out in some way
Condy smote the table and jumped to his feet
Write to em
he shouted
Write to K D B and sign it Captain Jack and write to Captain Jack And sign it K D B she interrupted catching his idea
And have him tell her and her tell him he added to meet at some place and then we can go to that place and hide and watch
But how will we know them
How would they know each other
Theyve never met
Well tell them both to wear a kind of flower
Then we can know them and they can know each other
Of course as soon as they began to talk they would find out they hadnt written
But they wouldnt care
Nothey want to meet each other
They would be thankful to us for bringing them together
Wont it be the greatest fun
Fun
Why it will be a regular drama
Only we are running the show and everything is real
Lets get at it
Blix ran into her room and returned with writing material
Condy looked at the notepaper critically
This kinds too swell
K D B wouldnt use Irish linennever
Here this is better glazed with blue lines and a flying bird stamped in the corner
Now Ill write for the Captain and you write for K D
B
But where will we have them meet
This was a point
They considered the Chinese restaurant the Plaza Lottas fountain the Mechanics Library and even the cathedral over in the Mexican quarter but arrived at no decision
Did you ever hear of Lunas restaurant
said Condy
By Jove its just the place
Its the restaurant where you get Mexican dinners right in the heart of the Latin quarter quiet little oldfashioned place below the level of the street respectable as a tomb
I was there just once
Well have em meet there at seven in the evening
No one is there at that hour
The place isnt patronized much and it shuts up at eight
You and I can go there and have dinner at six say and watch for them to come
Then they set to work at their letters
Now said Condy we must have these sound perfectly natural because if either of these people smell the smallest kind of a rat you wont catch em
You must write not as YOU would write but as you think THEY would
This is an art a kind of fiction dont you see
We must imagine a certain character and write a letter consistent with that character
Then itll sound natural
Now K D B
Well K D B shes prim
Lets have her prim and proud of using correct precise elegant language
I guess she wears mits and believes in cremation
Lets have her believe in cremation
And Captain Jack oh
hes got a terrible voice like this ROWROWROW see
and whiskers very fierce and he says Belay there
and Avast
and is very grandiloquent and orotund and gallant when it comes to women
Oh hes the devil of a man when it comes to women is Captain Jack
After countless trials and failures they evolved the two following missives which Condy posted that night Captain Jack
SIRI have perused with entire satisfaction your personal in The Times
I should like to know more of you
I read between the lines and my perception ineradicably convinces me that you are honest and respectable
I do not believe I should compromise my selfesteem at all in granting you an interview
I shall be at Lunas restaurant at seven precisely next Monday eve and will bear a bunch of white marguerites
Will you likewise and wear a marguerite in your lapel
Trusting this will find you in health I am Respectfully yours K D
B
Miss K D B
DEAR MISSFrom the modest and retiring description of your qualities and character I am led to believe that I will find in you an agreeable life companion
Will you not accord me the great favor of a personal interview
I shall esteem it a high honor
I will be at Lunas Mexican restaurant at seven of the clock PM on Monday evening next
May I express the fervent hope that you also will be there
I name the locality because it is quiet and respectable
I shall wear a white marguerite in my buttonhole
Will you also carry a bunch of the same flower
Yours to command CAPTAIN JACK
So great was her interest in the affair that Blix even went out with Condy while he mailed the letters in the nearest box for he was quite capable of forgetting the whole matter as soon as he was out of the house
Now let it work
she exclaimed as the iron flap clanked down upon the disappearing envelopes
But Condy was suddenly smitten with nameless misgiving
Now weve done it
now weve done it
he cried aghast
I wish we hadnt
Were in a fine fix now
Still uneasy he saw Blix back to the flat and bade her goodby at the door
But before she went to bed that night Blix sought out her father who was still sitting up tinkering with the cuckoo clock which he had taken all to pieces under the pretext that it was out of order and went too fast
Papum said Blix sitting down on the rug before him did you everwhen you were a pioneer when you first came out here in the fiftiesdid you ever play poker
Ioh well
it was the only amusement the miners had for a long time
I want you to teach me
The old man let the clock fall into his lap and stared
But Blix explained her reasons
Chapter VI The next day was Saturday and Blix had planned a walk out to the Presidio
But at breakfast while she was debating whether she should take with her Howard and Snooky or Many Inventions she received a note from Condy sent by special messenger All our fun is spoiled he wrote
Ive got ptomaine poisoning from eating the creamed oysters last night and am in for a solid fortnight spent in bed
Have passed a horrible night
Cant you look in at the hotel this afternoon
My mother will be here at the time
Ptomaine poisoning
The name had an ugly sound and Condys use of the term inferred the doctors visit
Blix decided that she would put off her walk until the afternoon and call on Mrs Rivers at once and ask how Condy did
She got away from the flat about ten oclock but on the steps outside met Condy dressed as if for bicycling and smoking a cigarette
Ive got eleven dollars
he announced cheerily
But I thought it was ptomaine poisoning
she cried with sudden vexation
Pshaw
thats what the doctor says
Hes a flapdoodle nothing but a kind of a sort of a pain
Its all gone now
Im as fit as a fiddleand Ive got eleven dollars
Lets go somewhere and do something
But your work
They dont expect me
When I thought I was going to be sick I telephoned the office and they said all right that they didnt need me
Now Ive got eleven dollars and there are three holidays of perfect weather before us today tomorrow and Monday
What will we do
What must we do to be saved
Our matrimonial objects dont materialize till Monday night
In the meanwhile what
Shall we go down to Chinatownto the restaurant or to the waterfront again
Maybe the mate on the whaleback would invite us to lunch
Or added Condy his eye caught by a fresh fish peddler who had just turned into the street we can go fishing
For oysters perhaps
But the idea had caught Condys fancy
Blix
he exclaimed lets go fishing
Where
I dont know
Where DO people fish around here
Where theres water I presume
No is it possible
she asked with deep concern
I thought they fished in their back yards or in their front parlors perhaps
Oh you be quiet
youre all the time guying me he answered
Let me thinklet me think he went on frowning heavily scouring at his hair
Suddenly he slapped a thigh
Come on he cried Ive an idea
He was already halfway down the steps when Blix called him back
Leave it all to me he assured her trust me IMPLICITLY
Dont you want to go
he demanded with abrupt disappointment
Want to
she exclaimed
Why it would be the very best kind of fun but Well then come along
They took a downtown car
Ive got a couple of split bamboo rods he explained as the car slid down the terrific grade of the WashingtonStreet hill
I havent used em in yearsnot since we lived East but theyre handmade and are tiptop
I havent any other kind of tackle but its just as well because the tackle will all depend upon where we are going to fish
Wheres that
Dont know yet am going down now to find out
He took her down to the principal dealer in sporting goods on Market Street
It was a delicious world whose atmosphere and charm were not to be resisted
There were shotguns in rows their gray barrels looking like so many organpipes sheaves of fishingrods from the fourounce whisp of the brooktrout up to the rigid eighteenounce lance of the kingsalmon and seabass showcases of wicked revolvers swelling by calibres into the thirtyeight and fortyfour mankillers of the plainsmen and Arizona cavalry hunting knives and dirks and the slender steel whips of the fencers files of Winchesters sleeping quietly in their racks waiting patiently for the signal to speak the one grim word they knew swarms of artificial flies of every conceivable shade brown gray black graybrown grayblack with here and there a brisk vermilion note coils of line from the thickness of a pencil spun to hold the sullen plunges of a jewfish off the Catalina Islands down to the seagreen gossamers that a vigorous fingerling might snap hooks snells guts leaders gaffs cartridges shells and all the entrancing munitions of the sportsman that savored of lonely canons deer licks mountain streams quail uplands and the still reaches of inlet and marsh grounds gray and cool in the early autumn dawn
Condy and Blix got the attention of a clerk and Condy explained
I want to go fishingwe want to go fishing
We want some place where we can go and come in the same day and we want to catch fairsized fishno minnows
The following halfhour was charming
Never was there a clerk more delightful
It would appear that his one object in life was that Condy and Blix should catch fish
The affairs of the nation stood still while he pondered suggested advised and deliberated
He told them where to go how to get there what train to take coming back and who to ask for when they arrived
They would have to wait till Monday before going but could return long before the fated hour of 7 PM Ask for Richardson said the clerk and here give him my card
Hell put you on to the good spots some places are A1 today and tomorrow in the same place you cant kill a single fish
Condy nudged Blix as the Mentor turned away to get his card
Notice that he whispered KILL a fish
You dont say catch you say killtechnical detail
Then they bought their tackle a couple of cheap reels lines leaders sinkers a book of assorted flies that the delightful clerk suggested and a beautiful little tin box painted green and stenciled with a gorgeous gold trout upon the lid in which they were to keep the pint of salted shrimps to be used as bait in addition to the flies
Blix would get these shrimps at a little market near her home
But said the clerk you got to get a permit to fish in that lake
Have you got a pull with the Water Company
Are you a stockholder
Condys face fell and Blix gave a little gasp of dismay
They looked at each other
Here was a check indeed
Well said the sublime being in shirt sleeves from behind the counter see what you can do and if you cant make it come back here an lemmeno and well fix you up in some other place
But Lake San Andreas has been bangup this last weekbeen some great kills there hope to the deuce you can make it
Everything now hinged upon this permit
It was not until their expedition had been in doubt that Condy and Blix realized how alluring had been its prospects
Oh I guess you can get a permit said the clerk soothingly
An if you make any good kills lemmeno and Ill put it in the paper
Im the editor of the SportwithGunandRod column in The Press he added with a flush of pride
Toward the middle of the afternoon Blix who was waiting at home in great suspense for that very purpose received another telegram from Condy Tension of situation relieved
Unconditional permission obtained
Dont forget the shrimps
It had been understood that Condy was to come to the flat on Sunday afternoon to talk over final arrangements with Blix
But as it was Saturday evening saw him again at the Bessemers
He had been down at his club in the library writing the last paragraphs of his divers story when just as he finished Sargeant discovered him
Why Conny old man all alone here
Lets go downstairs and have a cigar
Hendricks and George Hands are coming around in half an hour
They told me not to let you get away
Condy stirred nervously in his chair
He knew what that meant
He had enough money in his pockets to play that night and in an instant the enemy was all awake
The rowel was in his flank again and the scourge at his back
Sargeant stood there the wellgroomed clubman of thirty a little cynical perhaps but a really good fellow for all that and undeniably fond of Condy
But somewhere with the eyes of some second self Condy saw the girl of nineteen part child and part woman saw her goodness her fine sweet feminine strength as it were a dim radiance Whats a good man worth Condy she had said if hes not a strong man
I suppose well have a game going before midnight admitted Sargeant resignedly smiling goodhumoredly nevertheless
Condy set his teeth
Ill join you later
Wait a few moments he said
He hurried to the office of the club and sent a despatch to Blixthe third since morning Can I come up right away
Its urgent
Send answer by this messenger
He got his answer within threequarters of an hour and left the club as Hendricks and George Hands arrived by the elevator entrance
Sitting in the bay window of the diningroom he told Blix why he had come
Oh you were right
she told him
Always ALWAYS come when when you feel you must
It gets so bad sometimes Blix he confessed with abject self contempt that when I cant get some one to play against Ill sit down and deal dummy hands and bet on them
Just the touch of the cardsjust the FEEL of the chips
Faugh
its shameful
The day following Sunday Condy came to tea as usual and after the meal as soon as the family and Victorine had left the pair alone in the diningroom they set about preparing for their morrows excursion
Blix put up their lunchsandwiches of what Condy called devilish ham hardboiled eggs stuffed olives and a bottle of claret
Condy took off his coat and made a great show of stringing the tackle winding the lines from the spools on to the reels and attaching the sinkers and flies to the leaders smoking the while and scowling fiercely
He got the lines fearfully and wonderfully snarled he caught the hooks in the tablecloth he lost the almost invisible gut leaders on the floor and looped the sinkers on the lines when they should have gone on the leaders
In the end Blix had to help him out disentangling the lines foot by foot with a patience that seemed to Condy little short of superhuman
At nine oclock she said decisively Do you know what time we must get up in the morning if we are to have breakfast and get the sevenforty train
Quarter of six by the latest and YOU must get up earlier than that because youre at the hotel and have further to go
Come here for breakfast andlistenbe here by halfpast sixare you LISTENING Condy and well go down to the depot from here
Dont forget to bring the rods
Ill wear my bicycle suit he said and one of those golf scarfs that wrap around your neck
No she declared I wont have it
Wear the oldest clothes youve got but look fairly respectable because were to go to Lunas when we get back remember
And now go home you need all the sleep you can get if you are to get up at six oclock
Instead of being late as Blix had feared Condy was absurdly ahead of time the next morning
For a wonder he had not forgotten the rods but he was one tremor of nervousness
He would eat no breakfast
Were going to miss that train he would announce from time to time I just know it
Blix look what time it is
We ought to be on the way to the depot now
Come on you dont want any more coffee
Have you got everything
Did you put the reels in the lunchbasketand the flybook
Lord if we should forget the flybook
He managed to get her to the depot over half an hour ahead of time
The train had not even backed in nor the ticket office opened
I told you Condy I told you complained Blix sinking helplessly upon a bench in the waitingroom
Nonono he answered vaguely looking nervously about his head in the air
Were none too soonhave more time to rest now
I wonder what track the train leaves from
I wonder if it stops at San Bruno
I wonder how far it is from San Bruno to Lake San Andreas
Im afraid its going to rain
Heavens and earth Blix we forgot the shrimps
No NO
Sit down Ive got the shrimps
Condy you make me so nervous I shall scream in a minute
Some threequarters of an hour later the train had set them down at San Brunonothing more than a roadhouse the headquarters for duckshooters and fishermen from the city
However Blix and Condy were the only visitors
Everybody seemed to be especially nice to them on that wonderful morning
Even the supercilious ticketseller at the San Francisco depot had unbent and wished them good luck
The conductor of the train had shown himself affable
The very brakeman had gone out of his way to apprise them quite five minutes ahead of time that the next stop was their place
And at San Bruno the proprietor of the roadhouse himself hitched up to drive them over to the lake announcing that he would call for them at Richardsons in time for the evening train
And he only asked me four bits for both trips whispered Condy to Blix as they jogged along
The country was beautiful
It was hardly eight oclock and the morning still retained much of the brisk effervescence of the early dawn
Great bare rolling hills of graygreen thinly scattered with liveoak bore back from the road on either hand
The sky was pale blue
There was a smell of cows in the air and twice they heard an unseen lark singing
It was very still
The old buggy and complacent horse were embalmed in a pungent aroma of old leather and of stables that was entrancing and a sweet smell of grass and sap came to them in occasional long whiffs
There was exhilaration in the very thought of being alive on that odorous still morning
The young blood went spanking in the veins
Blixs cheeks were ruddy her little darkbrown eyes fairly coruscating with pleasure
Condy isnt it all splendid
she suddenly burst out
I feel regularly bigger he declared solemnly
I could do anything a morning like this
Then they came to the lake and to Richardsons where the farmer lived who was also the custodian of the lake
The complacent horse jogged back and Condy and Blix set about the serious business of the day
Condy had no need to show Richardson the delightful sporting clerks card
The old Yankeehis twang and dry humor singularly incongruous on that royal morningwas solicitude itself
He picked out the best boat on the beach for them loaned them his own anchor of railroad iron indicated minutely the point on the opposite shore off which the last big trout had been killed and wetted himself to his ankles as he pushed off the boat
Condy took the oars
Blix sat in the stern jointing the rods and running the lines through the guides
She even baited the hooks with the salt shrimp herself and by nine oclock they were at anchor some forty feet off shore and fishing according to Richardsons advice a leetle mite off the edge o the weeds
If we dont get a bite the whole blessed day said Condy as he paid out his line to the ratchet music of the reel well have fun just the same
Look aroundisnt this great
They were absolutely alone
The day was young yet
The lake smooth and still as gray silk widened to the west and south without so much as a wrinkle to roughen the surface
Only to the east where the sun looked over a shoulder of a higher hill it flamed up into a blinding diamond iridescence
The surrounding land lay between sky and water hushed to a Sunday stillness
Far off across the lake by Richardsons they heard a dog bark and the sound came fine and small and delicate
At long intervals the boat stirred with a gentle clapclapping of the water along its sides
From the nearby shore in the growth of manzanita bushes quail called and clucked comfortably to each other a bewildered yellow butterfly danced by over their heads and slim blue dragon flies came and poised on their lines and fishingrods bowing their backs
From his seat in the bow Condy cast a glance at Blix
She was holding her rod in both hands absorbed watchful very intent
She was as trim as ever even in the old clothes she had worn for the occasion
Her round strong neck was as usual swathed high and tight in white and the huge dogcollar girdled her waist according to her custom
She had taken off her hat
Her yellow hair rolled back from her round forehead and cool pink cheeks like a veritable nimbus and for the fiftieth time Condy remarked the charming contrast of her small deepbrown eyes in the midst of this white satin yellow hair white skin and exquisite pink cheeks
An hour passed
Then two
No fish murmured Condy drawing in his line to examine the bait
But as he was fumbling with the flies he was startled by a sharp exclamation from Blix
OhCondyIvegotabite
He looked up just in time to see the tip of her rod twitch twitch twitch
Then the whole rod arched suddenly the reel sang the line tautened and cut diagonally through the water
You got him
you got him
he shouted palpitating with excitement
And hes a good one
Blix rose reeling in as rapidly as was possible the butt of the twitching living rod braced against her belt
All at once the rod straightened out again the strain was released and the line began to slant rapidly away from the boat
Hes off
she cried
Off nothing
HES GOING TO JUMP
Look out for him now
And then the two watching from the boat tense and quivering with the drama of the moment saw that most inspiriting of sightsthe break of a salmontrout
Up he went from a brusque explosion of ripples and foamup into the gray of the morning from out the gray of the water scales all gleaming hackles all abristle a sudden flash of silver a sweep as of a scimitar in gray smoke with a splash a turmoil an abrupt burst of troubled sound that stabbed through the silence of the morning and in a single instant dissipated all the placid calm of the previous hours
Keep the line taut whispered Condy gritting his teeth
When he comes toward you reel him in an if he pulls too hard give him his head
Blix was breathing fast her cheeks blazing her eyes all alight
Oh she gasped Im so afraid Ill lose him
Oh look at that
she cried as the trout darted straight for the bottom bending the rod till the tip was submerged
Condy Ill lose himI know I shall you YOU take the rod
Not for a thousand dollars
Steady there hes away again
Oh talk about SPORT
Yard by yard Blix reeled in until they began to see the silver glint of the trouts flanks through the green water
She brought him nearer
Swimming parallel with the boat he was plainly visible from his wideopened mouththe hook and fly protruding from his lower jawto the red quivering flanges of the tail
His sides were faintly speckled his belly white as chalk
He was almost as long as Condys forearm
Oh hes a beauty
Oh isnt he a beauty
murmured Condy
Now careful careful bring him up to the boat where I can reach him eeasy Blix
If he bolts again let him run
Twice the trout shied from the boats shadow and twice as Blix gave him his head the reel sang and hummed like a watchmans rattle
But the third time he came to the surface and turned slowly on his side the white belly and one red fin out of the water the gills opening and shutting
He was tired out
A third time Blix drew him gently to the boats side
Condy reached out and down into the water till his very shoulder was wet hooked two fingers under the distended gills and with a long easy movement of the arm swung him into the boat
Their exultation was that of veritable children
Condy whooped like an Apache throwing his hat into the air Blix was hardly articulate her hands clasped her hair in disarray her eyes swimming with tears of sheer excitement
They shook each others hands they talked wildly at the same time they pounded on the boats thwarts with their fists they laughed at their own absurdity they looked at the trout again and again guessed at his weight and recalled to each other details of the struggle
When he broke that time wasnt it grand
And when I first felt him bite
It was so suddenwhy it actually frightened me
I neverno never in my life
exclaimed Blix was so happy as I am at this moment
Oh Condy to think just to THINK
Isnt it glory hallelujah
Isnt it better than teas and dancing and functions
Blixhow old are we
I dont care how old we are I think that trout will weigh two pounds
When they were calm again they returned to their fishing
The morning passed and it was noon before they were aware of it
By halfpast twelve Blix had caught three trout though the first was by far the heaviest
Condy had not had so much as a bite
At one oclock they rowed ashore and had lunch under a huge liveoak in a little amphitheatre of manzanita
Never had a lunch tasted so delicious
What if the wine was warm and the stuffed olives oily
What if the pepper for the hard boiled eggs had sifted all over the devilish ham sandwiches
What if the eggs themselves had not been sufficiently cooked and the corkscrew forgotten
They COULD not be anything else but inordinately happy sublimely gay
Nothing short of actual tragedy could have marred the joy of that day
But after they were done eating and Blix had put away the forks and spoons and while Condy was stretched upon his back smoking a cigar she said to him Now Condy what do you say to a little game of cards with me
The cigar dropped from Condys lips and he sat suddenly upright brushing the fallen leaves from his hair
Blix had taken a deck of cards from the lunchbasket and four rolls of chips wrapped in tissue paper
He stared at her in speechless amazement
What do you say
she repeated looking at him and smiling
Why Blix
he exclaimed in amazement what do you mean
Just what I say
I want you to play cards with me
Ill not to do it he declared almost coldly
Listen to me Condy answered Blix and for quite five minutes while he interrupted and protested and pshawed and argued she talked to him calmly and quietly
I dont ask you to stop playing Condy she said as she finished I just ask you that when you feel you must playorI mean when you want to very bad you will come and play with me instead of playing at your club
But its absurd its preposterous
I hate to see a girl gamblingand you of all girls
Its no worse for me than it is for you andwell do you suppose I would play with any one else
Maybe you think I cant play well enough to make it interesting for you she said gayly
Is that it
I can soon show you Condy Riversnever mind when I learned how
But Blix you dont know how often we play those men and I
Why it is almost everyyou dont know how often we play
Condy whenever you want to play and will play with ME no matter what Ive got in hand Ill stop everything and play with you
But why
Because I think Condy that THIS way perhaps you wont play quite so often at first and then little by little perhaps perhapswell never mind that now
I want to play put it that way
But I want you to promise me never to play with any one elsesay for six months
And in the end whipped by a sense of shame Condy made her the promise
They became very gay upon the instant
Hoh
exclaimed Condy what do YOU know of poker
I think we had best play old sledge or cassino
Blix had dealt a hand and partitioned the chips
Straights and flushes BEFORE the draw she announced calmly
Condy started and stared then looking at her askance picked up his hand
Its up to you
Ill make it five to play
Five
Very well
How many cards
Three
Ill take two
Bet you five more
Blix looked at her hand
Then without trace of expression in her voice or face said Theres your five and I ll raise you five
Five better
And five better than that
Call you
Full house
Aces on tens said Blix throwing down her cards
Heavens
theyre good as gold muttered Condy as Blix gathered in the chips
An hour later she had won all the chips but five
Now well stop and get to fishing again dont you want to
He agreed and she counted the chips
Condy you owe me seven dollars and a half she announced
Condy began to smile
Well he said jocosely Ill send you around a check tomorrow
But at this Blix was cross upon the instant
You wouldnt do thatwouldnt talk that way with one of your friends at the club
she exclaimed and its not right to do it with me
Condy give me seven dollars and a half
When you play cards with me its just as though it were with another man
I would have paid you if you had won
But I havent got more than nine dollars
Wholl pay for the supper tonight at Lunas and our railroad fare going home
Ill pay
But II cant afford to lose money this way
Shouldnt have played then
I took the same chances as you
Condy I want my money
Youyouwhy youve regularly flimflammed me
Will you give me my money
Oh take your money then
Blix shut the money in her purse and rose dusting her dress
Now she saidnow that the pastime of cardplaying is over we will return to the serious business of life which is the catchingno  KILLINGof lake trout
At five oclock in the afternoon Condy pulled up the anchor of railroad iron and rowed back to Richardsons
Blix had six trout to her credit but Condys illluck had been actually ludicrous
I can hold a string in the water as long as anybody he complained but Id like to have the satisfaction of merely changing the bait OCCASIONALLY
Ive not had a single bitenot a nibble y know all day
Never mind you got the big trout Blix that first one
That five minutes was worth the whole day
Its been glorious the whole thing
Well come down here once a week right along now
But the one incident that completed the happiness of that wonderful day occurred just as they were getting out of the boat on the shore by Richardsons
In a mudhole between two rocks they discovered a tiny striped snake hardly bigger than a lead pencil in the act of swallowing a little green frog and they passed a rapt ten minutes in witnessing the progress of this miniature drama which culminated happily in the victims escape and triumph of virtue
That declared Blix as they climbed into the old buggy which was to take them to the train was the one thing necessary
That made the day perfect
They reached the city at dusk and sent their fish lunchbasket and rods up to the Bessemers flat by a messenger boy with an explanatory note for Blixs father
Now said Condy for Lunas and the matrimonial objects
Chapter VII Lunas Mexican restaurant has no address
It is on no particular street at no particular corner even its habitues its most enthusiastic devotees are unable to locate it upon demand
It is over there in the quarter not far from the cathedral there
One could find it if one started out with that intent but to direct another thereno that is out of the question
It CAN be reached by following the alleys of Chinatown
You will come out of the last alleythe one where the slave girls areupon the edge of the Mexican quarter and by going straight forward a block or two and by keeping a sharp lookout to right and left you will hit upon it
It is always to be searched for
Always to be discovered
On that particular Monday evening Blix and Condy arrived at Lunas some fifteen minutes before seven
Condy had lost himself and all sense of direction in the strange streets of the quarter and they were on the very brink of despair when Blix discovered the sign upon an opposite corner
As Condy had foretold they had the place to themselves
They went into the back room with its one mirror six tables and astonishing curtains of Nottingham lace and the waiter whose name was Richard or Riccardo according to taste began to officiate at the solemn rites of the supper Mexican
Condy and Blix ate with their eyes continually wandering to the door and as the FRIJOLES were being served started simultaneously and exchanged glances
A man wearing two marguerites in the lapel of his coat had entered abruptly and sat down to a table close at hand
Condy drew a breath of suppressed excitement
There he is he whisperedCaptain Jack
They looked at the newcomer with furtive anxiety and told themselves that they were disappointed
For a retired sea captain he was desperately commonplace
His hair was red he was younger than they had expected and worst of all he did look tough
Oh poor K D
B
sighed Blix shaking her head
Hell never do Im afraid
Perhaps he has a good heart though redheaded people are SOMETIMES affectionate
They are impulsive hazarded Condy
As he spoke the words a second man entered the little room
He too sat down at a nearby table
He too ordered the supper Mexican
He too wore marguerites in his buttonhole
Death and destruction
gasped Condy turning pale
Blix collapsed helplessly in her chair her hands dropping in her lap
They stared at each other in utter confusion
Heres a howdoyoudo murmured Condy pretending to strip a TAMALE that Richard had just set before him
But Blix had pushed hers aside
What does it mean
whispered Condy across the table
In Heavens name what does it mean
It can only mean one thing Blix declared one of them is the captain and one is a coincidence
Anybody might wear a marguerite we ought to have thought of that
But which is which
If K D B should come now
But the last man looks more like the captain
The last man was a sturdy broadshouldered fellow who might have been forty
His heavy mustache was just touched with gray and he did have a certain vaguely sober and industrious appearance
But the difference between the two men was slight after all the redheaded man could easily have been a sea captain and he certainly was over thirtyfive
Which
which
whichhow can we tell
We might think of some way to get rid of the coincidence if we could only tell which the coincidence was
We owe it to K D B
In a way Condy its our duty
We brought her here or we are going to and we ought to help her all we can and she may be here at any moment
What time is it now
Five minutes after seven
But Blix I should think the right onethe captainwould be all put out himself by seeing another chap here wearing marguerites
Does either one of em seem put out to you
Look
I should think the captain whichever one he is would kind of GLARE at the coincidence
Stealthily they studied the two men for a moment
No no murmured Blix you cant tell
Neither of them seems to glare much
Oh Condyher voice dropped to a faint whisper
The redheaded one has put his hat on a chair just behind him notice
Do you suppose if you stood up you could see inside
What good would that do
He might have his initials inside the crown or his whole name even and you could see if he had a captain before it
Condy made a pretence of rising to get a match in a ribbed truncated cone of china that stood upon an adjacent table and Blix held her breath as he glanced down into the depths of the hat
He resumed his seat
Only initials he breathedW J
A
It might be Jack that J and it might be Joe or Jeremiah or Joshua and even if he was a captain he might not use the title
Were no better off than we were before
And K D B may come at any moment
Maybe she has come already and looked through the windows and saw TWO men with marguerites and went away
Shed be just that timid
What can we do
Wait a minute look here murmured Condy
Ive an idea
ILL find out which the captain is
You see that picture that chromo on the wall opposite
Blix looked as he indicated
The picture was a gorgeously colored lithograph of a pilotboat schoonerrigged all sails set dashing bravely through seas of emerald green color
You mean that schooner
asked Blix
That schooner exactly
Now listen
You ask me in a loud voice what kind of a boat that is and when I answer you keep your eye on the two men
Why what are you going to do
Youll see
Try it now weve no time to lose
Blix shifted in her seat and cleared her throat
Then What a pretty boat that is up there that picture on the wall
See over there on the wall opposite
Do you notice it
Isnt she pretty
Condy tell me what kind of a boat is that
Condy turned about in his place with great deliberation fixed the picture with a judicial eye and announced decisively Thatwhy thats a BARKENTINE
Condy had no need to wait for Blixs report
The demonstration came far too quickly for that
The redheaded man at his loud declaration merely glanced in the direction of the chromo and returned to his enchellados
But he of the black mustache followed Condys glance noted the picture of which he spoke and snorted contemptuously
They even heard him mutter beneath his mustache BARKENTINE your eye
No doubt as to which is the captain now whispered Condy so soon as the other had removed from him a glance of withering scorn
They could hardly restrain their gayety but their gravity promptly returned when Blix kicked Condys foot under the table and murmured Hes looking at his watch the captain is
K D B isnt here yet and the redheaded man the coincidence is
We MUST get rid of him
Condy cant you think of something
Well he wont go till hes through his supper you can depend upon that
If hes here when K D B arrives it will spoil everything
She wouldnt stay a moment
She wouldnt even come in
Isnt it disappointing
And I had so counted upon bringing these two together
And Captain Jack is a nice man
You can see that with one hand tied behind you whispered Condy
The other chaps tough
Looks just like the kind of man to get into jail sooner or later
Maybe hes into some mischief now you never can tell
And the Mexican quarter of San Francisco is just the place for affairs
Ill warrant hes got PALS
Well here he isthats the main pointjust keeping those people apart spoiling a whole romance
Maybe ruining their lives
Its QUITE possible really it is
Just stop and think
This is a positive crisis were looking at now
Cant we get rid of him SOMEHOW
Ooh
whispered Blix all at once in a quiver of excitement
There is a way if wed ever have the courage to do it
It might work and if it didnt hed never know the difference never would suspect us
Oh
but we wouldnt dare
What
what
In Heavens name what is it Blix
We wouldnt darewe couldnt
Oh
but it would be such K D B may come in that door at any second
Im half afraid but all the sameCondy let me have a pencil
She dashed off a couple of lines on the back of the bill of fare and her hand trembled like a leaf as she handed him what she had written
Send himthe redheaded manthat telegram
Theres an office just two doors below here next the drugstore
I saw it as we came by
You know his initials remember you saw them in his hat
W J
A Lunas restaurant
Thats all you want
Lord muttered Condy as he gazed upon what Blix had written
Do you dare
she whispered with a little hysterical shudder
If it failed weve nothing to lose
And K D B is coming nearer every instant
But would he gothat is at once
We can only try
You wont be gone a hundred seconds
You can leave me here that length of time
Quick Condy decide one way or the other
Its getting desperate
Condy reached for his hat
Give me some money then he said
You won all of mine  A few moments later he was back again and the two sat pretending to eat their chili peppers their hearts in their throats hardly daring to raise their eyes from their plates
Condy was actually sick with excitement and all but tipped the seltzer bottle to the floor when a messenger boy appeared in the outer room
The boy and the proprietor held a conference over the counter
Then Richard appeared between the portieres of Nottingham lace the telegram in his hand and the boy at his heels
Evidently Richard knew the redheaded man for he crossed over to him at once with the words I guess this is for you Mr
Atkins
He handed him the despatch and retired
The redheaded man signed the receipt the boy departed
Blix and Condy heard the sound of torn paper as the redheaded man opened the telegram
Ten seconds passed then fifteen then twenty
There was a silence
Condy dared to steal a glance at the redheaded mans reflection in the mirror
He was studying the despatch frowning horribly
He put it away in his pocket took it out again with a fierce movement of impatience and consulted it a second time
His supper Mexican remained untasted before him Condy and Blix heard him breathing loud through his nose
That he was profoundly agitated they could not doubt for a single moment
All at once a little panic terror seemed to take possession of him
He rose seized his hat jammed it over his ears slapped a halfdollar upon the table and strode from the restaurant
This is what the readheaded man had read in the despatch this is what Blix had written ALL IS DISCOVERED
FLY AT ONCE
And never in all their subsequent rambles about the city did Blix or Condy set eyes upon the redheaded man again nor did Lunas restaurant where he seemed to have been a habitue ever afterward know his presence
He disappeared he was swallowed up
He had left the restaurant true
Had he also left that neighborhood
Had he fled the city the State the country even
What skeleton in the redheaded mans closet had those six words called to life and the light of day
Had they frightened him forth to spend the rest of his days fleeing from an unnamed unknown avengera veritable wandering Jew
What mystery had they touched upon there in the bald bare back room of the Quarters restaurant
What dark door had they opened what redheaded phantom had they evoked
Had they broken up a plot thwarted a conspiracy prevented a crime
They never knew
One thing only was certain
The redheaded man had had a past
Meanwhile the minutes were passing and K D B still failed to appear
Captain Jack was visibly growing impatient anxious
By now he had come to the fiery liqueur called mescal
He was nearly through his supper
At every moment he consulted his watch and fixed the outside door with a scowl
It was already twenty minutes after seven
I know the redheaded man spoiled it after all murmured Blix
K D B saw the two of them in here and was frightened
We could send Captain Jack a telegram from her suggested Condy
Im ready for anything now
What could you say
Oh that she couldnt come
Make another appointment
Hed be offended with her
Hed never make another appointment
Sea captains are always so punctilious y know
Richard brought them their coffee and kirsch and Condy showed Blix how to burn a lump of sugar and sweeten the coffee with syrup
But they were disappointed
Captain Jack was getting ready to leave
K D B had evidently broken the appointment
Then all at once she appeared
They knew it upon the instant by a brisk opening and shutting of the street door and by a sudden alertness on the part of Captain Jack which he immediately followed by a quite inexplicable move
The street door in the outside room had hardly closed before his hand shot to his coat lapel and tore out the two marguerites
The action was instinctive Blix knew it for such immediately
The retired captain had not premeditated it
He had not seen the face of the newcomer
She had not time to come into the back room or even to close the street door
But the instant that the captain had recognized a bunch of white marguerites in her belt he had without knowing why been moved to conceal his identity
Hes afraid whispered Blix
Positively I believe hes afraid
How absolutely stupid men are
But meanwhile K D B the lookedfor the plannedfor and intriguedfor the object of so much diplomacy such delicate manoeuvring the pivot upon which all plans were to turn the stormcentre round which so many conflicting currents revolved and for whose benefit the peace of mind of the redheaded man had been forever broken uphad entered the room
Why shes PRETTY
was Blixs first smothered exclamation as if she had expected a harridan
K D B looked like a servantgirl of the better sort and was really very neatly dressed
She was small little even
She had snappy black eyes a resolute mouth and a general air of being very quiet very matteroffact and complacent
She would be disturbed at nothing excited at nothing Blix was sure of that
She was placid but it was the placidity not of the absence of emotion but of emotion disdained
Not the placidity of the mollusk but that of a mature and contemplative cat
Quietly she sat down at a corner table quietly she removed her veil and gloves and quietly she took in the room and its three occupants
Condy and Blix glued their eyes upon their coffee cups like guilty conspirators but a crash of falling crockery called their attention to the captains table
Captain Jack was in a tremor
Hitherto he had acted the role of a sane and sensible gentleman of middle age master of himself and of the situation
The entrance of K D B had evidently reduced him to a semiidiotic condition
He enlarged himself he eased his neck in his collar with a rotary movement of head and shoulders
He frowned terribly at trifling objects in corners of the room
He cleared his throat till the glassware jingled
He pulled at his mustache
He perspired fumed fretted and was suddenly seized with an insane desire to laugh
Once only he caught the eye of K D B calmly sitting in her corner picking daintily at her fish whereupon he immediately overturned the vinegar and pepper casters upon the floor
Just so might have behaved an overgrown puppy in the presence of a sleepy unperturbed chessycat dozing by the fire
He ought to be shaken murmured Blix at the end of her patience
Does he think SHE is going to make the first move
Ha ahm
thundered the captain clearing his throat for the twentieth time twirling his mustache and burying his scarlet face in an enormous pocket handkerchief
Five minutes passed and he was still in his place
From time to time K D B fixed him with a quiet deliberate look and resumed her delicate picking
Do you think she knows its he now that hes taken off his marguerites
whispered Condy
Know itof course she does
Do you think women are absolutely BLIND or so imbecile as men are
And then if she didnt think it was he shed go away
And shes so really pretty too
He ought to thank his stars alive
Think what a fright she might have been
She doesnt LOOK thirtyone
Huh
returned Condy
As long as she SAID she was thirtyone you can bet everything you have that she is thats as true as revealed religion
Well its something to have seen the kind of people who write the personals said Blix
I had always imagined that they were kind of tough
You see they are not he answered
I told you they were not
Maybe however we have been exceptionally fortunate
At any rate these are respectable enough
Not the least doubt about that
But why dont he do something that captain
mourned Blix
Why WILL he act like such a ninny
Hes waiting for us to go said Condy Im sure of it
Theyll never meet so long as were here
Lets go and give em a chance
If you leave the two alone here one or the other will HAVE to speak
The suspense would become too terrible
It would be as though they were on a desert island
But I wanted to SEE them meet she protested
You wouldnt hear what they said
But wed never know if they did meet and ohand WHO spoke first
Shell speak first declared Condy
Never
returned Blix in an indignant whisper
I tell you what
We could go and then come back in five minutes
Ill forget my stick here
Savvy
You would probably do it anyhow she told him
They decided this would be the better course
They got together their things and Condy neglected his stick hanging upon a hook on the wall
At the counter in the outside room Blix to the stupefaction of Richard the waiter paid the bill
But as she was moving toward the door Condy called her back
Remember the waiter he said severely while Richard grinned and bobbed
Fifty cents is the very least you could tip him
Richard actually protested but Condy was firm and insisted upon a halfdollar tip
Noblesse oblige he declared with vast solemnity
They walked as far as the cathedral listened for a moment to the bell striking the hour of eight then as they remembered that the restaurant closed at that time hurried back and entered the outside room in feigned perturbation
Did I could I have possibly left my stick here
exclaimed Condy to Richard who was untying his apron behind the counter
But Richard had not noticed
I think I must have left it back here where we were sitting
Condy stepped into the back room Blix following
They got his stick and returned to the outside room
Yes yes I did leave it he said as he showed it to Richard
Im always leaving that stick wherever I go
Come again said Richard as he bowed them out of the door
On the curb outside Condy and Blix shook hands and congratulated each other on the success of all their labors
In the back room seated at the same table a bunch of wilting marguerites between them they had seen their matrimonial objects conferring earnestly together absorbed in the business of getting acquainted
Blix heaved a great sigh of relief and satisfaction exclaiming At last K D B and Captain Jack have met
Chapter VIII But she added as they started to walk we will never know which one spoke first
But Condy was already worrying
I dont know I dont know
he murmured anxiously
Perhaps weve done an awful thing
Suppose they arent happy together after theyre married
I wish we hadnt I wish we hadnt now
Weve been playing a game of checkers with human souls
Weve an awful responsibility
Suppose he kills her some time
Fiddlesticks Condy
And besides if weve done wrong with our matrimonial objects weve offset it by doing well with our red headed coincidence
How do you know you may have foiled a villain with that telegramprevented a crime
Condy grinned at the recollection of the incident
Fly at once he repeated
I guess hes flying yet
All is discovered
Id give a dollar and a half If you had it
Oh well if I had itto know just what it was we have discovered
Suddenly Blix caught his arm
Condy here they come
Who
Who
Our objects Captain Jack and K D
B
Of course of course
They couldnt stay
The restaurant shuts up at eight  Blix and Condy had been walking slowly in the direction of Pacific Street and K D B and her escort soon overtook them going in the same direction
As they passed the captain was saying jumped on my hatches and says well make it an international affair
That didnt A passing wagon drowned the sound of his voice
He was telling her of his adventures
cried Blix
Splendid
Othello and Desdemona
Theyre getting on
Lets follow them
exclaimed Condy
Should we
Wouldnt it be indiscreet
No
We are the arbiters of their fate we MUST take an interest
They allowed their objects to get ahead some half a block and then fell in behind
There was little danger of their being detected
The captain and K D B were absorbed in each other
She had even taken his arm
They make a finelooking couple really said Blix
Where do you suppose they are going
To another restaurant
But this was not the case
Blix and Condy followed them as far as Washington Square where the Geodetic Survey stone stands and the enormous flagstaff and there in front of a commonplace little house two doors above the Russian church with its minarets like inverted balloons K D B and the captain halted
For a few moments they conversed in low tones at the gate then said good night K D B entering the house the captain bowing with great deference his hat in his hand
Then he turned about glanced once or twice at the house set his hat at an angle and disappeared across the square whistling a tune his chin in the air
Very good excellent highly respectable approved Blix and Condy himself fetched a sigh of relief
Yes yes it might have been worse
Well never see them again our Matrimonial Objects said Blix and theyll never know about us but we have brought them together
Weve started a romance
Yes I think weve done a good days work
And now Condy I think we had best be thinking of home ourselves
Im just beginning to get most awfully sleepy
What a day weve had
A sea fog or rather THE sea fogSan Franciscos old and inseparable companionhad gathered by the time they reached the top of the Washington Street hill
Everything was wet with it
The asphalt was like varnished ebony
Indistinct masses and huge dim shadows stood for the houses on either side
From the eucalyptus trees and the palms the water dripped like rain
Far off oceanward the foghorn was lowing like a lost gigantic bull
The gray bulk of a policemanthe light from the street lamp reflected in his starloomed up on the corner as they descended from the car
          Condy had intended to call his divers story A Submarine Romance but Blix had disapproved
Its too Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea she had said
You want something much more dignified
There is that about you Condy you like to be too showy you dont know when to stop
But you have left off redandwhite scarfs and I am very glad to see you wearing white shirtfronts instead of pink ones
Yes yes I thought it would be quieter he had answered as though the idea had come from him
Blix allowed him to think so
But A Victory Over Death as the story was finally called was a success
Condy was too much of a born storyteller not to know when he had done something distinctly good
When the story came back from the typewriters with the additional strength that print lends to fiction and he had read it over he could not repress a sense of jubilation
The story rang true
Bully bully
he muttered between his teeth as he finished the last paragraph
Its a corker
If its rejected everywhere its an outofsight yarn just the same
And there Condys enthusiasm in the matter began to dwindle
The fine fire which had sustained him during the story s composition had died out
He was satisfied with his work
He had written a good story and that was the end of it
No doubt he would send it Eastto the Centennial Companytomorrow or the day aftersome time that week
To mail the manuscript meant quite half an hours effort
He would have to buy stamps for return postage a letter would have to be written a large envelope procured the accurate address ascertained
For the moment his supplement work demanded his attention
He put off sending the story from day to day
His interest in it had abated
And for that matter he soon discovered he had other things to think of
It had been easy to promise Blix that he would no longer gamble at his club with the other men of his acquaintance but it was death and the devil as he told himself to abide by that promise
More than once in the fortnight following upon his resolution he had come up to the little flat on the Washington Street hill as to a place of refuge and Blix always pretending that it was all a huge joke and part of their good times had brought out the cards and played with him
But she knew very well the fight he was making against the enemy and how hard it was for him to keep from the round green tables and group of silent shirtsleeved men in the cardrooms of his club
She looked forward to the time when Condy would cease to play even with her
But she was too sensible and practical a girl to expect him to break a habit of years standing in a couple of weeks
The thing would have to be accomplished little by little
At times she had misgivings as to the honesty of the course she had adopted
But nowadays playing as he did with her only Condy gambled but two or three evenings in the week and then not for more than two hours at a time
Heretofore hardly an evening that had not seen him at the round table in his clubs cardroom whence he had not risen until long after midnight
Condy had told young Sargeant that he had reformed in the matter of gambling and intended to swear off for a few months
Sargeant like the thoroughbred he was never urged him to play after that and never spoke of the previous nights game when Condy was about
The other men of his set were no less thoughtful and though they rallied him a little at first upon his defection soon let the matter drop
Condy told himself that there were plenty of good people in the world after all
Every one seemed conspiring to make it easy for him and he swore at himself for a weakkneed cad
On a certain Tuesday about a week after the fishing excursion and the affair of the Matrimonial Objects toward halfpast six in the evening Condy was in his room dressing for a dinner engagement
Young Sargeants sister had invited him to be one of a party who were to dine at the University Club and later on fill a box at a charity play given by amateurs at one of the downtown theatres
But as he was washing his linen shirtstuds with his toothbrush his eye fell upon a note in Laurie Flaggs hand writing that lay on his writingdesk and that he had received some ten days previous
Condy turned cold upon the instant hurled the toothbrush across the room and dropped into a chair with a groan of despair
Miss Flagg was giving a theatre party for the same affair and he remembered now that he had promised to join her party as well forgetting all about the engagement he had made with Miss Sargeant
It was impossible at this late hour to accept either one of the young womens invitations without offending the other
Well I wont go to EITHER thats all he vociferated aloud to the opposite wall
Ill send em each a wire and say that Im sick or have got to go down to the office andand by George
Ill go up and see Blix and well read and make things to eat
And no sooner had this alternative occurred to him than it appeared too fascinating to be resisted
A weight seemed removed from his mind
When it came to that what amusement would he have at either affair
Sit up there with your shirtfront starched like a board he blustered and your collar throttling you and smile till your face is sore and reel off small talk to a girl whose last name you cant remember
Do I have any fun does it do me any good do I get ideas for yarns
What do I do it for
I dont know
While speaking he had been kicking off his tight shoes and such of his full dress as he had already put on and with a feeling of enormous relief turned again to his sack suit of tweed
Lord these feel better
he exclaimed as he substituted the loose business suit for the formal rigidity of his evening dress
It was with a sensation of positive luxury that he put on a soft shirt of blue cheviot and his tan walkingshoes
But no more red scarfs he declared as he knotted his black satin club before the mirror
She WAS right there
He put his cigarettes in his pocket caught up his gloves and stick clapped on his hat and started for the Bessemers flat with a feeling of joyous expectancy he had not known for days
Evidently Blix had seen him coming for she opened the door herself and it suited her humor for the moment to treat him as a peddler or bookagent
No no she said airily her head in the air as she held the door
No we dont want any today
We HAVE the biography of Abraham Lincoln
Dont want to subscribe to any Home Book of Art
Were not artistic we use drapes in our parlors
Dont want The Wives and Mothers of Great Men
But Condy had noticed a couple of young women on the lower steps of the adjacent flat quite within earshot and at once he began in a loud harsh voice Well y know we cant wait for our rent forever Im only the collector and Ive nothing to do with repairs
Pay your rent thats three months overdue and then But Blix pulled him within the house and clapped to the door
Condy RIVERS
she exclaimed her cheeks flaming those are our neighbors
They heard every word
What do you suppose they think
Huh
Id rather have em think I was a rentcollector than a bookagent
You began it
Evenin Miss Lady
Evenin Mister Man
But Condys visit begun thus gayly soon developed along much more serious lines
After supper while the light still lasted Blix read stories to him while he smoked cigarettes in the bay window of the diningroom
But as soon as the light began to go she put the book aside and the two took their accustomed places in the window and watched the evening burning itself out over the Golden Gate
It was just warm enough to have one of the windows opened and for a long time after the dusk they sat listening to the vague clamor of the city lapsing by degrees till it settled into a measured soothing murmur like the breathing of some vast monster asleep
Condys cigarette was a mere red point in the halfdarkness
The smoke drifted out of the open window in long blue strata
At his elbow Blix was leaning forward looking down upon the darkening drowsing city her round strong chin propped upon her hand
She was just close enough for Candy to catch the sweet delicious feminine perfume that came indefinitely from her clothes her hair her neck
From where Condy sat he could see the silhouette of her head and shoulders against the dull golden blur of the open window her round high forehead with the thick yellow hair rolling back from her temples and ears her pink clean cheeks her little darkbrown scintillating eyes and her firm red mouth made all the firmer by the position of her chin upon her hand
As ever her round strong neck was swathed high and tight in white satin but between the topmost fold of the satin and the rose of one small earlobe was a little triangle of white skin that was partly her neck and partly her cheek and that Condy knew should be softer than down smoother than satin warm and sweet and redolent as new apples
Condy imagined himself having the right to lean toward her there and kiss that little spot upon her neck or her cheek and as he fancied it was surprised to find his breath come suddenly quick and a barely perceptible qualm as of a certain faintness thrill him to his fingertips and then he thought how would it be if he could without fear of rebuff reach out his arm and put it about her trim firm waist and draw her very close to him till he should feel the satiny coolness of her smooth cheek against his till he could sink his face in the delicious fragrant confusion of her hair then turn that face to histhat face with its strong calm mouth and sweet full lips the face of this dear young girl of nineteen and then I sayIshall welets read again
Letslets do something
Condy how you frightened me
exclaimed Blix with a great start
No listen I want to talk to you to tell you something
Papum and I have been having some very long and serious talks since you were last here
What do you think I may go away
The deuce you say
exclaimed Condy sitting suddenly upright
Where to in Heavens name
he addedand when
and what for
To New York to study medicine
There was a silence then Condy exclaimed waving his hands at her Oh go right on
Dont mind me
Little thing like going to New Yorkto study medicine
Of course that happens every day a mere detail
I presume youll go back and forth for your meals
Then Blix began to explain
It appeared that she had two aunts both sisters of her fatherone a widow the other unmarried
The widow a certain Mrs Kihm lived in New York and was wealthy and had views on womens sphere of usefulness
The other Miss Bessemer a little old maid of fifty Condy had on rare occasions seen at the flat where every one called her Aunt Dodd
She lived in that vague region of the city known as the Mission where she owned a little property
From what Blix told him that evening Condy learned that Mrs Kihm had visited the coast a few winters previous and had taken a great fancy to Blix
Even then she had proposed to Mr Bessemer to take Blix back to New York with her and educate her to some womans profession but at that time the old man would not listen to it
Now it seemed that the opportunity had again presented itself
Shes a dear old lady Blix said not a bit strongminded as you would think and ever so much cleverer than most men
She manages all her property herself
For the last month shes been writing again to Papum for me to come on and stay with her three or four years
She hasnt a chick nor a child and she dont entertain or go out any so maybe she feels lonesome
Of course if I studied there Papum wouldnt think of Aunt Kihmdont you knowpaying for it all
I wouldnt go if it was that way
But I could stay with her and she could make a home for me while I was thereif I should studyanythingstudy medicine
But why
he exclaimed
What do you want to study to be a doctor for
It isnt as though you had to support yourself
I know I know Ive not got to support myself
But why shouldnt I have a profession just like a manjust like you Condy
You stop and think
It seemed strange to me when I first thought of it but I got thinking about it and talking it over with Papum and I should LOVE it
Id do it not because I would have to do it but because it would interest me
Condy you know that Im not a bit strongminded and that I hate a masculine unfeminine girl as much as you do
But a medical college Blix
You dont know what you are talking about
Yes I do
Theres a college in New York just for women
Aunt Kihm sent me the prospectus and its one of the best in the country
I dont dream of practicing you know at least I dont think about that now
But one must have some occupation and isnt studying medicine Condy better than pianoplaying or French courses or literary classes and Browning circles
Oh Ive no patience with that kind of girl
And look at the chance I have now and Aunt Kihm is such a dear
Think she writes I could go to and from the college in her coupe every day and I would see New York and just being in a big city like that is an education
Youre right it would be a big thing for you assented Condy and I like the idea of you studying something
It would be the making of such a girl as you Blix
And then Blix seeing him thus acquiescent said Well its all settled Papum and I both wrote last night
When are you going
The first week in January
Well thats not so AWFULLY soon
But who will take your place here
However in the world would your father get along without youand Snooky and Howard
Aunt Dodd is going to come
Sudden enough said Condy but it IS a great thing for you Blix and Im mighty glad for you
Your future is all cut out for you now
Of course your aunt if shes so fond of you and hasnt any children will leave you everythingmaybe settle something on you right away and youll marry some one of those New York chaps and be great big people before you know it
The idea Condy
she protested
No Im going there to study medicine
Oh you dont know how enthusiastic I am over the idea
Ive bought some of the firstyear books already and have been reading them
Really Condy they are even better than Many Inventions
Wish I could get East muttered Condy gloomily
Blix forgot her own good fortune upon the instant
I do so wish you COULD Condy
she exclaimed
You are too good for a Sunday supplement
I know it and YOU know it and Ive heard ever so many people who have read your stories say the same thing
You could spend twenty years working as you are now and at the end what would you be
Just an assistant editor of a Sunday supplement and still in the same place and worse youd come to be contented with that and think you were only good for that and nothing better
Youve got it in you Condy to be a great story teller
I believe in you and Ive every confidence in you
But just so long as you stay here and are willing to do hack work just so long you will be a hack writer
You must break from it you MUST get away
I know you have a good time here but there are so many things better than that and more worth while
You ought to make up your mind to get East and work for that and nothing else
I know you want to go but wanting isnt enough
Enthusiasm without energy isnt enough
You have enthusiasm Condy but you MUST have energy
You must be willing to give up things you must make up your mind that you will go East and then set your teeth together and do it
Oh I LOVE a man that can do thatmake up his mind to a thing and then put it through
Condy watched her as she talked her brownblack eyes coruscating her cheeks glowing her small hands curled into round pink fists
Blix youre splendid
he exclaimed youre fine
You could put life into a dead man
Youre the kind of girl that are the making of men
By Jove youd back a man up wouldnt you
Youd stand by him till the last ditch
Of course he went on after a pause of course I ought to go to New York
But Blix suppose I went well then what
It isnt as though I had any income of my own or rich aunt
Suppose I didnt find something to doand the chances are that I wouldnt for three or four monthswhat would I live on in the meanwhile
What would the robin do then poor thing
Im a poor young man Miss Bessemer and Ive got to eat
No my only chance is to be discovered by a magazine or a publishing house or somebody and get a bid of some kind
Well there is the Centennial Company
They have taken an interest in you Condy
You must follow that right up and keep your name before them all the time
Have you sent them A Victory Over Death yet
Condy sat down to his eggs and coffee the next morning in the hotel harried with a certain sense of depression and disappointment for which he could assign no cause
Nothing seemed to interest him
The newspaper was dull
He could look forward to no pleasure in his days work and what was the matter with the sun that morning
As he walked down to the office he noted no cloud in the sky but the brightness was gone from the day
He sat down to his desk and attacked his work but copy would not come
The sporting editor and his inane jokes harassed him beyond expression
Just the sight of the clipping editors back was an irritation
The office boy was a mere incentive to profanity
There was no spring in Condy that morning no elasticity none of his natural buoyancy
As the day wore on his ennui increased his luncheon at the club was tasteless tobacco had lost its charm
He ordered a cocktail in the wineroom and put it aside with a wry face
The afternoon was one long tedium
At every hour he flung his pencil down utterly unable to formulate the next sentence of his article and his hands in his pockets gazed gloomily out of the window over the wilderness of roofsgrimy dirty ugly roofs that spread out below
He craved diversion amusement excitement
Something there was that he wanted with all his heart and soul yet he was quite unable to say what it was
Something was gone from him today that he had possessed yesterday and he knew he would not regain it on the morrow nor the next day nor the day after that
What was it
He could not say
For half an hour he imagined he was going to be sick
His mother was not to be at home that evening and Condy dined at his club in the hopes of finding some one with whom he could go to the theatre later on in the evening
Sargeant joined him over his coffee and cigarette but declined to go with him to the theatre
Another game on tonight
asked Condy
I suppose so admitted the other
I guess Ill join you tonight said Condy
Ive had the blue devils since morning and Ive got to have something to drive them off
Dont let me urge you you know returned Sargeant
Oh thats all right
Condy assured him
My times about up anyways
An hour later just as he Sargeant and the other men of their set were in the act of going upstairs to the cardrooms a hall boy gave Condy a note at that moment brought by a messenger who was waiting for an answer
It was from Blix
She wrote Dont you want to come up and play cards with me tonight
We havent had a game in over a week
How did she know
thought Condy to himselfhow could she tell
Aloud he said I cant join you fellows after all
Despatch from the managing editor
Some special detail or other
For the first time since the previous evening Condy felt his spirits rise as he set off toward the Washington Street hill
But though he and Blix spent as merry an evening as they remembered in a long time his nameless formless irritation returned upon him almost as soon as he had bidden her goodnight
It stayed with him all through the week and told upon his work
As a result three of his articles were thrown out by the editor
We cant run such rot as that in the paper the chief had said
Cant you give us a story
Oh Ive got a kind of a yarn you can run if you like answered Condy his weeks depression at its very lowest
A Victory Over Death was published in the following Sundays supplement of the Times with illustrations by one of the staff artists
It attracted not the least attention
Just before he went to bed the Sunday evening of its appearance Condy read it over again for the last time
Its a rotten failure he muttered gloomily as he cast the paper from him
Simple drivel
I wonder what Blix will think of it
I wonder if I amount to a hill of beans
I wonder WHAT she wants to go East for anyway
Chapter IX The oldfashioned Union Street cable car with its low comfortable outside seats put Blix and Condy down just inside the Presidio Government Reservation
Condy asked a direction of a sentry nursing his KragJorgensen at the terminus of the track and then with Blix set off down the long board walk through the tunnel of overhanging evergreens
The day could not have been more desirable
It was a little after ten of a Monday morning Condys weekly holiday
The air was neither cool nor warm effervescent merely brisk and full of the smell of grass and of the sea
The sky was a speckless sheen of pale blue
To their right and not far off was the bay blue as indigo
Alcatraz seemed close at hand beyond was the enormous green red and purple pyramid of Tamalpais climbing out of the water head and shoulders above the little foothills and looking out to the sea and to the west
The Reservation itself was delightful
There were rows of the officers houses all alike drawn up in lines like an assembly of the staff there were huge barracks most like college dormitories and on their porches enlisted men in shirt sleeves and overalls were cleaning saddles and polishing the brass of headstalls and bridles whistling the while or smoking corncob pipes
Here on the paradeground a soldier his coat and vest removed was batting grounders and flies to a halfdozen of his fellows
Over by the stables strings of horses all of the same color were being curried and cleaned
A young lieutenant upon a bicycle spun silently past
An officer came from his front gate his coat unbuttoned and a briar in his teeth
The walks and roads were flanked with lines of blackpainted cannonballs inverted pieces of abandoned ordnance stood at corners
From a distance came the mellow snarling of a bugle
Blix and Condy had planned a long walk for that day
They were to go out through the Presidio Reservation past the barracks and officers quarters and on to the old fort at the Golden Gate
Here they would turn and follow the shoreline for a way then strike inland across the hills for a short halfmile and regain the city and the streetcar lines by way of the golflinks
Condy had insisted upon wearing his bicycle outfit for the occasion and moreover carried a little satchel which he said contained a pair of shoes
But Blix was as sweet as a rose that morning all in tailormade black but for the inevitable bands of white satin wrapped high and tight about her neck
The St Bernard dogcollar did duty as a belt
She had disdained a veil and her yellow hair was already blowing about her smooth pink cheeks
She walked at his side her step as firm and solid as his own her round strong arms swinging her little brown eyes shining with good spirits and vigor and the pure clean animal joy of being alive on that fine cool Western morning
She talked almost incessantly
She was positively garrulous
She talked about the fine day that it was about the queer new forage caps of the soldiers about the bare green hills of the Reservation about the little cemetery they passed just beyond the limits of the barracks about a rabbit she saw and about the quail they both heard whistling and calling in the hollows under the bushes
Condy walked at her side in silence yet no less happy than she smoking his pipe and casting occasional glances at a great shipa fourmaster that was being towed out toward the Golden Gate
At every moment and at every turn they noted things that interested them and to which they called each others attention
Look Blix
Oh Condy look at that
They were soon out of the miniature city of the Post and held on down through the low reach of tules and sanddunes that stretch between the barracks and the old red fort
Look Condy
said Blix
Whats that building down there on the shore of the baythe one with the flagstaff
I think that must be the lifeboat station
I wonder if we could go down and visit it
I think it would be good fun
Idea
exclaimed Condy
The station was close at hand
To reach it they had but to leave the crazy board walk that led on toward the fort and cross a few hundred yards of sanddune
Condy opened the gate that broke the line of evergreen hedge around the little twostory house and promptly unchained a veritable pandemonium of dogs
Inside the place was not without a certain charm of its own
A brick wall bordered with shells led to the front of the station which gave directly upon the bay a little wellkept lawn opened to right and left and six or eight gailypainted old rowboats were set about half filled with loam in which fuchsias geraniums and mignonettes were flowering
A cat or two dozed upon the windowsills in the sun
Upon a sort of porch overhead two of the crew paced up and down in a manner that at once suggested the poop
Here and there was a gleam of highly polished red copper or brass trimmings
The bay was within two steps of the front door while a little further down the beach was the house where the surfboat was kept and the long runway leading down from it to the water
Condy rapped loudly at the front door
It was opened by Captain Jack
Captain Jack and no other only now he wore a blue sweater and a leathervisored cap with the letters U S L B S around the band
Not an instant was given them for preparation
The thing had happened with the abruptness of a transformation scene at a theatre
Condys knock had evoked a situation
Speech was stricken from their mouths
For a moment they were bereft even of action and stood there on the threshold staring openmouthed and openeyed at the sudden reappearance of their matrimonial object
Condy was literally dumb in the end it was Blix who tided them over the crisis
We were just going byjust taking a walk she explained and we thought wed like to see the station
Is it all right
Can we look around
Why of course assented the Captain with great cordiality
Come right in
This is visitors day
You just happened to hit itonly its mighty few visitors we ever have he added
While Condy was registering for himself and Blix they managed to exchange a lightning glance
It was evident the Captain did not recognize them
The situation readjusted itself even promised to be of extraordinary interest
And for that matter it made little difference whether the captain remembered them or not
No we dont get many visitors the Captain went on as he led them out of the station and down the small gravel walk to the house where the surfboat was kept
This is a quiet station
People dont fetch out this way very often and were not called out very often either
Were an inside post you see and usually we dont get a call unless the seas so high that the Cliff House station cant launch their boat
So you see we dont go out much but when we DO it means business with a great big B
Now this here you see continued the Captain rolling back the sliding doors of the house is the surfboat
By the way lets see I aint just caught your names yet
Well my names Rivers said Condy and this is Miss Bessemer
Were both from the city
Happy to know you sir happy to know you miss he returned pulling off his cap
My names Hoskins but you can just call me Captain Jack
Im so used to it that I dont kind of answer to the other
Well now Miss Bessemer this heres the surfboat shes selfrightin selfbailin she cant capsize and if I was to tell you how many thousands of dollars she cost you wouldnt believe me
Condy and Blix spent a delightful halfhour in the boathouse while Captain Jack explained and illustrated and told them anecdotes of wrecks escapes and rescues till they held their breaths like tenyearolds
It did not take Condy long to know that he had discovered what the storyteller so often tells of but so seldom finds and what for want of a better name he elects to call a character
Captain Jack had been everywhere had seen everything and had done most of the things worth doing including a great many things that he had far better have left undone
But on this latter point the Captain seemed to be innocently and completely devoid of a moral sense of right and wrong
It was quite evident that he saw no matter for conscience in the smuggling of Chinamen across the Canadian border at thirty dollars a heada venture in which he had had the assistance of the prodigal son of an American divine of international renown
The trade to Peruvian insurgents of condemned rifles was to be regretted only because the ring manipulating it was broken up
The appropriation of a schooner in the harbor of Callao was a story in itself while the robbery of thirty thousand dollars worth of seaotter skins from a Russian tradingpost in Alaska accomplished chiefly through the agency of a barrel of rum manufactured from sugarcane was a veritable achievement
He had been born so he told them in Winchester in England and Heaven save the markhad been brought up with a view of taking orders
For some time he was a choir boy in the great Winchester Cathedral then while yet a lad had gone to sea
He had been boatsteerer on a New Bedford whaler and struck his first whale when only sixteen
He had filibustered down to Chili had acted as ice pilot on an Arctic relief expedition had captained a crew of Chinamen sharkfishing in Magdalena Bay and had been nearly murdered by his men had been a deepsea diver and had burst his eardrums at the business so that now he could blow tobacco smoke out of his ears he had been shipwrecked in the Gilberts fought with the Seris on the lower California Islands sold champagne made from rock candy effervescent salts and Reisling wineto the Coreans had dreamed of holding up a Cunard liner and had ridden on the Strand in a hansom with William Ewart Gladstone
But the one thing of which he was proud the one picture of his life he most delighted to recall was himself as manager of a negro minstrel troupe in a hired drummajors uniform marching down the streets of Sacramento at the head of the brass band in burnt cork and regimentals
The star of the troupe he told them was the lady with the iron jore
We busted in Stockton and she gave me her diamonds to pawn
I pawned em and kept back something in the hand for myself and hooked it to San Francisco
Strike me straight if she didnt follow me that ironjored piece met me one day in front of the Bush Street Theatre and horsewhipped me properly
Now just think of thatand he laughed as though it was the best kind of a joke
But hazarded Blix dont you find it rather dull out here lonesome
I should think you would want to have some one with you to keep you companytoto do your cooking for you
But Condy ignoring her diplomacy and thinking only of possible stories blundered off upon another track
Yes he said youve led such a life of action I should think this station would be pretty dull for you
How did you happen to choose it
Well you see answered the Captain leaning against the smooth white flank of the surfboat his hands in his pockets Im lying low just now
I got into a scrape down at Libertad in Mexico that made talk and Im waiting for that to die down some
You see it was this way
Mindful of their experience with the mate of the whaleback Condy and Blix were all attention in an instant
Blix sat down upon an upturned box her elbows on her knees leaning forward her little eyes fixed and shining with interest and expectation Condy the storyteller all alive and vibrant in him stood at her elbow smoking cigarette after cigarette his fingers dancing with excitement and animation as the Captain spoke
And then it was that Condy and Blix in that isolated station the bay lapping at the shore within earshot in that atmosphere redolent of paint and oakum and of seaweed decaying upon the beach outside first heard the story of In Defiance of Authority
Captain Jack began it with his experience as a restaurant keeper during the boom days in Seattle Washington
He told them how he was the cashier of a diningsaloon whose daily net profits exceeded eight hundred dollars how its proprietor suddenly died and how he Captain Jack continued the management of the restaurant pending a settlement of the proprietors affairs and an appearance of heirs how in the confusion and excitement of the boom no settlement was ever made and how no heirs appearing he assumed charge of the establishment himself paying bills making contracts and signing notes until he came to consider the business and all its enormous profits as his own and how at last when the restaurant was burned he found himself some forty thousand dollars ahead of the game
Then he told them of the strange club of the place called The Exiles made up chiefly of younger sons of English and British Canadian families every member possessed of a past more or less disreputable men who had left their country for their countrys good and for their familys peace of mindadventurers wanderers soldiers of fortune gentlemenvagabonds men of hyphenated names and even noble birth whose appellations were avowedly aliases
He told them of his meeting with Billy Isham one of the clubs directors and of the happygolucky reckless unpractical character of the man of their acquaintance intimacy and subsequent partnership of how the filibustering project was started with Captain Jacks forty thousand and the nevertobe forgotten interview in San Francisco with Senora Estrada the agent of the insurgents of the incident of her callingcardhow she tore it in two and gave onehalf to Isham of their outfitting and the broken sextant that was to cause their ultimate discomfiture and disaster and of the voyage to the rendezvous on a Panama liner
Strike me
continued Captain Jack you should have seen Billy Isham on that Panama doughdish a passenger ship she was and Billy was the life of her from stem to sternpost
There was a church pulpit aboard that they were taking down to Mazatlan for some chapel or other and this here pulpit was lashed on deck aft
Well Billy had been most kinds of a fool in his life and among others a playactor called himself Gaston Maundeville and was clean daft on his knowledge of Shakespeare and his own power of interpretin the hidden meanin of the lines
I aint never going to forgit the day he gave us Portias speech
We were just under the tropic and the day was a scorcher
There was mostly men folk aboard and we lay around the deck in our pajamas while Billy Gaston Maundeville dressed in striped red and white pajamasclum up in that bally pulpit with the ships Shakespeare in his hands an let us haveThe quality o mercy isnt strained it droppeth as the genteel dew from heavun
Laugh I tell you I was sore with it
Lord how we guyed him
An the more we guyed and the more we laughed the more serious he got and the madder he grew
He said he was interpretin the hidden meanin of the lines
And so the Captain ran through that wild fiery taleof fighting and loving buccaneering and conspiring mandolins tinkling knives clicking oaths mingling with sonnets and spilled wine with spilled blood
He told them of Ishams knife duel with the Mexican lieutenant their left wrists lashed together of the battle of the thirty in the pitch dark of the Custom House cellar of Senora Estradas love for Isham and all the roll and plunge of action that make up the story of In Defiance of Authority
At the end Blixs little eyes were snapping like sparks Condys face was flaming his hands were cold and he was shifting his weight from foot to foot like an excited thoroughbred horse
Heavens and earth what a yarn
he exclaimed almost in a whisper
Blix drew a long tremulous breath and sat back upon the upturned box looking around her as though she had but that moment been awakened
Yes sir said the Captain rolling a cigarette
Yes sir those were great days
Get down there around the line in those little outotheway republics along the South American coast and things happen to you
You hold a mans life in the crook of your forefinger an nothings done by halves
If you hate a man you lay awake nights biting your mattress just thinking how you hate him an if you love a womangood Lord how you do LOVE her
Butbut
exclaimed Condy I dont see how you can want to do anything else
Why youre living sixty to the minute when youre playing a game like that
Oh I aint dead yet
answered the Captain
I got a few schemes left that I could get fun out of
How can you wait a minute
exclaimed Blix breathlessly
Why dont you get a ship right awaytomorrowand go right off on some other adventure
Well I cant just now returned the Captain blowing the smoke from his cigarette through his ears
Theres a good many reasons one of em is that Ive just been married
Chapter X Mummarmarried
gasped Condy swallowing something in his throat
Blix rose to her feet
Just been MARRIED
she repeated a little frightened
Why whywhy how DELIGHTFUL
Yesyes mumbled Condy
How delightful
I congratulate you
Come income back to the station said the Captain jovially and Ill introduce you to m wife
We were married only last Sunday
Why yesyes of course wed be delighted vociferated the two conspirators a little hysterically
Shes a mighty fine little woman declared the Captain as he rolled the door of the boathouse to its place and preceded them up the gravel walk to the station
Of course she is responded Blix
Behind Captain Jacks back she fixed Condy with a wideeyed look and nudged him fiercely with an elbow to recall him to himself for Condys wits were scattered like a flock of terrified birds and he was gazing blankly at the Captains coat collar with a vacant maniacal smile
For Heavens sake Condy
she had time to whisper before they arrived in the hallway of the station
But fortunately they were allowed a minute or so to recover themselves and prepare for what was coming
Captain Jack ushered them into what was either the parlor office or sittingroom of the station and left them with the words Just make yourselves comfortable here an Ill go fetch the little woman
No sooner had he gone than the two turned to each other
Well
WELL
Were in for it now
But we must see it through Condy act just as natural as you can and were all right
But supposing SHE recognizes us
Supposing she doeswhat then
How ARE they to know that we wrote the letters
Sh Blix not so loud
They know by now that THEY didnt
But it seems that it hasnt made any difference to them they are married
And besides they wouldnt speak about putting personals in the paper to us
They would never let anybody know that
Do you suppose they could possibly suspect
Im sure they couldnt
Here they come
Keep perfectly calm and were saved
Suppose it isnt K D B after all
But it was of course and she recognized them in an instant
She and the Captainthe latter all grinscame in from the direction of the kitchen K D B wearing a neat blue calico gown and an apron that was really a marvel of cleanliness and starch
Kitty
exclaimed Captain Jack seized again with an unexplainable mirth heres some young folks come out to see the place an I want you to know em
Mr Rivers this is m wife Kitty andlessee miss I dont rightly remember your name
Bessemer
exclaimed Condy and Blix in a breath
Oh
exclaimed K D B you were in the restaurant the night that the Captain and IIthat isyes Im quite sure Ive seen you before
She turned from one to the other
beginning to blush furiously
Yes yes in Lunas restaurant wasnt it
said Condy desperately
It seems to me I do just barely remember
And wasnt the Captain there
Blix ventured
I forgot my stick I remember continued Condy
I came back for it and just as I was going out it seems to me I saw you two at a table near the door
He thought it best to allow their matrimonial objects to believe he had not seen them before
Yes yes we were there answered K D B tactfully
We dine there almost every Monday night
Blix guessed that K D B would prefer to have the real facts of the situation ignored and determined she should have the chance to change the conversation if she wished
What a delicious supper one has there
she said
Cant say I like Mexican cooking myself answered K D B forgetting that they dined there every Monday night
Plain United States is good enough for me
Suddenly Captain Jack turned abruptly to Condy exclaiming Oh you was the chap that called the picture of that schooner a barkentine
Yes WASNT that a barkentine
he answered innocently
Barkentine your EYE
spluttered the Captain
Why that was a schooner as plain as a pie plate
But ten minutes later the ordeal was over and Blix and Condy once more breathing easily were on their walk again
The Captain and K D B had even accompanied them to the gate of the station and had strenuously urged them to come in and see them again the next time they were out that way
Married
murmured Condy putting both hands to his head
Weve done it weve done it now
Well what of it
declared Blix a little defiantly
I think its all right
You can see the Captain is in love with her and she with him
No weve nothing to reproach ourselves with
Butbutbut so sudden
whispered Condy all aghast
Thats what makes me faintthe suddenness of it
It shows how much they are in love howhow readily they adapted themselves to each other
No its all right
They seemed to like usactually
Well they had betterif they knew the truth
Without us they never would have met
They both asked us to come out and see them again did you notice that
Lets do it Blix Condy suddenly exclaimed lets get to know them
Of course we must
Wouldnt it be fun to call on themto get regularly acquainted with them
They might ask us to dinner some time
And think of the stories he could tell you
They enthused immediately upon this subject both talking excitedly at the same time going over the details of the Captains yarns recalling the incidents to each other
Fancy
exclaimed Condyfancy Billy Isham in his pajamas red and white stripes reading Shakespeare from that pulpit on board the ship and the other men guying him
Isnt that a SCENE for you
Cant you just SEE it
I wonder if the Captain wasnt making all those things up as he went along
He dont seem to have any sense of right and wrong at all
He might have been lying Condy
What difference would that make
And so they went along in that fine clear Western morning on the edge of the Continent both of them young and strong and vigorous the Pacific under their eyes the great clean Trades blowing in their faces the smell of the salt sea coming in long aromatic whiffs to their nostrils
Young and strong and fresh their imaginations thronging with pictures of vigorous action and adventure buccaneering filibustering and all the swing the leap the rush and gallop the exuberant strong life of the great uncharted world of Romance
And all unknowingly they were a Romance in themselves
Cynicism old age and the weariness of all things done had no place in the world in which they walked
They still had their illusions all the keenness of their sensations all the vividness of their impressions
The simple things of the world the great broad primal emotions of the race stirred in them
As they swung along going toward the ocean their brains were almost as empty of thought or of reflection as those of two fine clean animals
They were all for the immediate sensation they did not think they FELT
The intellect was dormant they looked at things they heard things they smelled the smell of the sea and of the seaweed of the fat rank growth of cresses in the salt marshes they turned their cheeks to the passing wind and filled their mouths and breasts with it
Their life was sweet to them every hour was one glad effervescence
The fact that the ocean was blue was a matter for rejoicing
It was good to be alive on that royal morning
Just to be young was an exhilaration and everything was young with themthe day was young the country was young and the civilization to which they belonged teeming there upon the green Western fringe of the continent was young and heady and tumultuous with the boisterous red blood of a new race
Condy even forgot or rather disdained on such a morning as that to piece together and rearrange Captain Jacks yarns into story form
To look at the sea and the green hills to watch the pink on Blixs cheek and her yellow hair blowing across her eyes and lips was better than thinking
Life was better than literature
To live was better than to read one live human being was better than ten thousand Shakespeares an act was better than a thought
Why just to love Blix to be with her to see the sweet clean flush of her cheek to know that she was there at his side and to have the touch of her elbow as they walked was better than the best story the greatest novel he could ever hope to write
Life was better than literature and love was the best thing in life
To love Blix and to be near herwhat else was worth while
Could he ever think of finding anything in life sweeter and finer than this dear young girl of nineteen
Suddenly Condy came to himself with an abrupt start
What was this he was thinkingwhat was this he was telling himself
Love Blix
He loved Blix
Why of COURSE he loved herloved her so that with the thought of it there came a great sudden clutch at the heart and a strange sense of tenderness so vague and yet so great that it eluded speech and all expression
Love her
Of course he loved her
He had all unknowing loved her even before this wonderful morning had loved her that day at the lake and that nevertobeforgotten delicious afternoon in the Chinese restaurant all those long quiet evenings spent in the window of the little diningroom looking down upon the darkening city he had loved her
Why all his days for the last few months had been full of the love of her
How else had he been so happy
how else did it come about that little by little he was withdrawing from the society and influence of his artificial world as represented by such men as Sargeant
how else was he slowly loosening the grip of the one evil and vicious habit that had clutched him so long
how else was his ambition stirring
how else was his hitherto aimless enthusiasm hardening to energy and determination
She had not always so influenced him
In the days when they had just known each other and met each other in the weekly course of their formal life it had not been so even though they pretended a certain amount of affection
He remembered the evening when Blix had brought those days to an abrupt end and how at the moment he had told himself that after all he had never known the real Blix
Since then in the charming unconventional life they had led everything had been changed
He had come to know her for what she was to know her genuine goodness her sincerity her contempt of affectations her comradeship her calm fine strength and unbroken good nature and day by day here a little and there a little his love for her had grown so quietly so evenly that he had never known it until now behold
it was suddenly come to flower full and stronga flower whose fragrance had suddenly filled all his life and all his world with its sweetness
Half an hour after leaving the lifeboat station Condy and Blix reached the old redbrick fort deserted abandoned and rime incrusted at the entrance of the Golden Gate
They turned its angle and there rolled the Pacific a blue floor of shifting water stretching out there forever and forever over the curve of the earth over the shoulder of the world with never a sail in view and never a break from horizon to horizon
They followed down the shore sometimes upon the old and broken flume that runs along the seaward face of the hills that rise from the beach or sometimes upon the beach itself stepping from bowlder to bowlder or holding along at the edge of the water upon reaches of white hard sand
The beach was solitary not a soul was in sight
Close at hand to landward great hills bare and green shut off the sky and here and there the land came tumbling down into the sea in great jagged craggy rocks kneedeep in swirling foam and all black with wet
The air was full of the prolonged thunder of the surf and at intervals seabirds passed overhead with an occasional piping cry
Wreckage was tumbled about here and there and innumerable cocoanut shards huge brown cups of fuzzy bark lay underfoot and in the crevices of the rocks
They found a jelly fisha pulpy translucent mass and once even caught a sight of a seal in the hollow of a breaker with sleek and shining head his barbels bristling and heard his hoarse croaking bark as he hunted the offshore fish
Blix refused to allow Condy to help her in the least
She was quite as active and strong as he and clambered from rock to rock and over the shattered scantling of the flume with the vigor and agility of a young boy
She muddied her shoes to the very tops scratched her hands tore her skirt and even twisted her ankle but her little eyes were never so bright nor was the pink flush of her cheeks ever more adorable
And she was never done talking a veritable chatterbox
She saw everything and talked about everything she saw quite indifferent as to whether or no Condy listened
Now it was a queer bit of seaweed now it was a group of gulls clamoring over a dead fish now a purple starfish now a breaker of unusual size
Her splendid vitality carried her away
She was excited alive to her very fingertips vibrant to the least sensation quivering to the least impression
Lets get up here and sit down somewhere said Condy at length
They left the beach and climbed up the slope of the hills near a point where a long arm of land thrust out into the sea and shut off the wind a path was there and they followed it for a few yards till they had come to a little amphitheatre surrounded with blackberry bushes
Here they sat down Blix settling herself on an old log with a little sigh of contentment Condy stretching himself out a new lighted pipe in his teeth his head resting on the little handbag he had persistently carried ever since morning
Then Blix fell suddenly silent and for a long time the two sat there without speaking absorbed in the enjoyment of looking at the enormous green hills rolling down to the sea the breakers thundering at the beach the gashed pinnacles of rock the vast reach of the Pacific and the distant prospect of the old fort at the entrance of the Golden Gate
We might be a thousand miles away from the city for all the looks of it mightnt we Condy
said Blix after a while
And Im that HUNGRY
It must be nearly noon
For answer Condy sat up with profound gravity and with a great air of nonchalance opened the handbag and instead of shoes took out first a pint bottle of claret then devilish ham sandwiches in oiled paper a bottle of stuffed olives a great bag of salted almonds two little tumblers a papercovered novel and a mouth organ
Blix fairly crowed with delight clasping her hands upon her knees and rocking to and fro where she sat upon the log
Oh Condy and you thought of a LUNCHyou said it was shoesand you remembered I loved stuffed olives too and a book to read
What is itThe Seven Seas
No I never WAS so happy
But the mouth organwhats that for
To play on
What did you thinkthink it was a canopener
Blix choked with merriment over his foolery and Condy added proudly Look there
I made those sandwiches
They looked as though he hadgreat fat chunks of bread the crust still on the devilish ham in thick strata between and positively he had BUTTERED the bread
But it was all one with them they ate as though at a banquet and Blix even took off her hat and hung it upon one of the nearby bushes
Of course Condy had forgotten a corkscrew
He tried to dig out the cork of the claret bottle with his knife until he had broken both blades and was about to give up in despair when Blix at the end of her patience took the bottle from him and pushed in the cork with her finger
Wine music literature and feasting observed Condy
Were getting regularly luxurious just like Sardineapalus
But Condy himself had suddenly entered into an atmosphere of happiness the like of which he had never known or dreamed of before
He loved Blixhe had just discovered it
He loved her because she was so genuine so radiantly fresh and strong loved her because she liked the things that he liked because they two looked at the world from precisely the same point of view hating shams and affectations happy in the things that were simple and honest and natural
He loved her because she liked his books appreciating the things therein that he appreciated liking what he liked disapproving of what he condemned
He loved her because she was nineteen and because she was so young and unspoiled and was happy just because the ocean was blue and the morning fine
He loved her because she was so pretty because of the softness of her yellow hair because of her round white forehead and pink cheeks because of her little darkbrown eyes with that look in them as if she were just done smiling or just about to smile one could not say which loved her because of her good firm mouth and chin because of her full neck and its high tight bands of white satin
And he loved her because her arms were strong and round and because she wore the great dogcollar around her trim firm corseted waist and because there emanated from her with every movement a barely perceptible delicious feminine odor that was in part perfume but mostly a subtle vague aroma charming beyond words that came from her mouth her hair her neck her arms her whole sweet personality
And he loved her because she was herself because she was Blix because of that strange sweet influence that was disengaged from her in those quiet moments when she seemed so close to him when some unnamed mysterious sixth sense in him stirred and woke and told him of her goodness of her clean purity and womanliness and that certain vague tenderness in him went out toward her a tenderness not for her only but for all the good things of the world and he felt his nobler side rousing up and the awakening of the desire to be his better self
Covertly he looked at her as she sat near him her yellow hair rolling and blowing back from her forehead her hands clasped over her knee looking out over the ocean thoughtful her eyes wide
She had told him she did not love him
Condy remembered that perfectly well
She was sincere in the matter she did not love him
That subject had been once and for all banished from their intercourse
And it was because of that very reason that their companionship of the last three or four months had been so charming
She looked upon him merely as a chum
She had not changed in the least from that time until now whereas hewhy all his world was new for him that morning
Why he loved her so she had become so dear to him that the very thought of her made his heart swell and leap
But he must keep all this to himself
If he spoke to her told her of how he loved her it would spoil and end their companionship upon the instant
They had both agreed upon that they had tried the other and it had worked out
As lovers they had wearied of each other as chums they had been perfectly congenial thoroughly and completely happy
Condy set his teeth
It was a hard situation
He must choose between bringing an end to this charming comradeship of theirs or else fight back all show of love for her keep it down and under hand and that at a time when every nerve of him quivered like a smitten harpstring
It was not in him or in his temperament to love her calmly quietly or at a distance he wanted the touch of her hand the touch of her cool smooth cheek the delicious aroma of her breath in his nostrils her lips against his her hair and all its fragrance in his face Condy whats the matter
Blix was looking at him with an expression of no little concern
What are you frowning so about and clinching your fists
And youre pale too
Whats gone wrong
He shot a glance at her and bestirred himself sharply
Isnt this a jolly little corner
he said
Blix how long is it before you go
Six weeks from tomorrow
And youre going to be gone four yearsfour years
Maybe you never will come back
Cant tell what will happen in four years
Wheres the blooming mouthorgan
But the mouthorgan was full of crumbs
Condy could not play on it
To all his efforts it responded only by gasps mournfulest deathrattles and lamentable wails
Condy hurled it into the sea
Well wheres the blooming book then
he demanded
Youre sitting on it Blix
Here read something in it
Open it anywhere
No you read to me
I will not
Havent I done enough
Didnt I buy the book and get the lunch and make the sandwiches and pay the carfare
I think this expedition will cost me pretty near three dollars before were through with the day
No the least you can do is to read to me
Here well match for it
Condy drew a dime from his pocket and Blix a quarter from her purse
Youre matching me she said
Condy tossed the coin and lost and Blix said as he picked up the book For a man that has such unvarying bad luck as you gambling is just simple madness
You and I have never played a game of poker yet that Ive not won every cent of money you had
Yes and what are you doing with it all
Spending it she returned loftily gloves and veils and lace pinsall kinds of things
But Condy knew the way she spoke that this was not true
For the next hour or so he read to her from The Seven Seas while the afternoon passed the wind stirring the chaparral and blackberry bushes in the hollows of the huge bare hills the surf rolling and grumbling on the beach below the seabirds wheeling overhead
Blix listened intently but Condy could not have told of what he was reading
Living was better than reading life was better than literature and his newfound love for her was poetry enough for him
He read so that he might not talk to her or look at her for it seemed to him at times as though some second self in him would speak and betray him in spite of his best efforts
Never before in all his life had he been so happy never before had he been so troubled
He began to jumble the lines and words as he read overrunning periods even turning two pages at once
What a splendid line
Blix exclaimed
What linewhatwhat are you talking about
Blix lets always remember today
Lets make a promise no matter what happens or where we are lets always write to each other on the anniversary of today
What do you say
Yes Ill promiseand you Ill promise faithfully
Oh Ill never forget today noryes yes Ill promisewhy todayBlixwheres that damn book gone
Condy
Well I cant find the book
Youre sitting on it again
Confound the book anyway
Lets walk some more
Weve a long ways to go if were to get home in time for supper
Lets go to Lunas for supper
I never saw such a girl as you to think of ways for spending money
What kind of a purseproud plutocrat do you think I am
Ive only seventyfive cents left
How much have you got
Blix had fiftyfive cents in her purse and they had a grave council over their finances
They had just enough for carfare and two suppers Mexican with ten cents left over
Thats for Richards tip said Blix
Thats for my CIGAR he retorted
You made ME give him fifty cents
You said it was the least I could offer himnoblesse oblige
Well then I COULDNT offer him a dime dont you see
Ill tell him we are broke this time
They started home not as they had come but climbing the hill and going across a breezy open down radiant with blue iris wild heliotrope yellow poppies and even a violet here and there
A little further on they gained one of the roads of the Reservation red earth smooth as a billiard table and just at an angle where the road made a sharp elbow and trended cityward they paused for a moment and looked down and back at the superb view of the ocean the vast halfmoon of land and the rolling hills in the foreground tumbling down toward the beach and all spangled with wild flowers
Some fifteen minutes later they reached the golflinks
We can go across the links said Condy and strike any number of car lines on the other side
They left the road and struck across the links Condy smoking his newlighted pipe
But as they came around the edge of a long line of eucalyptus trees near the teeing ground a warning voice suddenly called out Fore
Condy and Blix looked up sharply and there in a group not twenty feet away in tweeds and knickers in smart short golfing skirts and plaid cloaks they saw young Sargeant and his sister two other girls whom they knew as members of the fashionable set and Jack Carter in the act of swinging his driving iron
Chapter XI As the clock in the library of the club struck midnight Condy laid down his pen shoved the closely written sheets of paper from him and leaned back in his chair his fingers to his tired eyes
He was sitting at a desk in one of the further corners of the room and shut off by a great Japanese screen
He was in his shirt sleeves his hair was tumbled his fingers inkstained and his face a little pale
Since late in the evening he had been steadily writing
Three chapters of In Defiance of Authority were done and he was now at work on the fourth
The day after the excursion to the Presidiothat wonderful event which seemed to Condy to mark the birthday of some new man within himthe idea had suddenly occurred to him that Captain Jacks story of the club of the exiles the boom restaurant and the filibustering expedition was precisely the novel of adventure of which the Centennial Company had spoken
At once he had set to work upon it with an enthusiasm that with shut teeth he declared would not be lacking in energy
The story would have to be written out of his business hours
That meant he would have to give up his evenings to it
But he had done this and for nearly a week had settled himself to his task in the quiet corner of the club at eight oclock and held to it resolutely until twelve
The first two chapters had run off his pen with delightful ease
The third came harder the events and incidents of the story became confused and contradictory the character of Billy Isham obstinately refused to take the prominent place which Condy had designed for him and with the beginning of the fourth chapter Condy had finally come to know the enormous difficulties the exasperating complications the discouragements that begin anew with every paragraph the obstacles that refuse to be surmounted and all the pain the labor the downright mental travail and anguish that fall to the lot of the writer of novels
To write a short story with the end in plain sight from the beginning was an easy matter compared to the upbuilding grain by grain atom by atom of the fabric of In Defiance of Authority
Condy soon found that there was but one way to go about the business
He must shut his eyes to the end of his novelthat faroff divine eventand take his task chapter by chapter even paragraph by paragraph grinding out the tale as it were by main strength driving his pen from line to line hating the effort happy only with the termination of each chapter and working away hour by hour minute by minute with the dogged sullen hammer andtongs obstinacy of the galleyslave scourged to his daily toil
At times the tale apparently out of sheer perversity would come to a full stop
To write another word seemed beyond the power of human ingenuity and for an hour or more Condy would sit scowling at the halfwritten page gnawing his nails scouring his hair dipping his pen into the inkwell and squaring himself to the sheet of paper all to no purpose
There was no pleasure in it for him
A character once fixed in his mind a scene once pictured in his imagination and even before he had written a word the character lost the charm of its novelty the scene the freshness of its original conception
Then with infinite painstaking and with a patience little short of miraculous he must slowly build up brick by brick the plan his brain had outlined in a single instant
It was all work hard disagreeable laborious work and no juggling with phrases no false notions as to the delight of creation could make it appear otherwise
And for what he muttered as he rose rolled up his sheaf of manuscript and put on his coat what do I do it for I dont know
It was beyond question that had he begun his novel three months before this time Condy would have long since abandoned the hateful task
But Blix had changed all that
A sudden male force had begun to develop in Condy
A masteremotion had shaken him and he had commenced to see and to feel the serious more abiding and perhaps the sterner side of life
Blix had steadied him there was no denying that
He was not quite the same boyish hairbrained fellow who had made a buffoon of himself in the Chinese restaurant three months before
The cars had stopped running by the time Condy reached the street
He walked home and flung himself to bed his mind tired his nerves unstrung and all the blood of his body apparently concentrated in his brain
Working at night after writing all day long was telling upon him and he knew it
What with his work and his companionship with Blix Condy soon began to drop out of his wonted place in his set
He was obliged to decline one invitation after another that would take him out in the evening and instead of lunching at his club with Sargeant or George Hands as he had been accustomed to do at one time he fell into another habit of lunching with Blix at the flat on Washington Street and spending the two hours allowed to him in the middle of the day in her company
Condys desertion of them was often spoken of by the men of his club with whom he had been at one time so intimate and the subject happened to be brought up again one noon when Jack Carter was in the club as George Hands guest
Hands Carter and Eckert were at one of the windows over their afterdinner cigars and liqueurs
I say said Eckert suddenly whos that girl across the street therethe one in black just going by that furriers sign
Ive seen her somewhere before
Know who it is
Thats Miss Bessemer isnt it
said George Hands leaning forward
Rather a stunninglooking girl
Yes thats Travis Bessemer assented Jack Carter adding a moment later its too bad about that girl
Whats the matter
asked Eckert
Carter lifted a shoulder
Isnt ANYTHING the matter as far as I know only somehow the best people have dropped her
She USED to be received everywhere
Come to think I HAVENT seen her out much this season said Eckert
But I heard she had bolted from Society with the big S and was going Eastgoing to study medicine I believe
Ive always noticed said Carter with a smile that so soon as a girl is declassee she develops a purpose in life and gets earnest and all that sort of thing
Oh well come growled George Hands Travis Bessemer is not declassee
I didnt say she was answered Carter but she has made herself talked about a good deal lately
Going around with Rivers as she does isnt the most discreet thing in the world
Of course its all right but it all makes talk and I came across them by a grove of trees out on the links the other day Yes observed Sargeant leaning on the back of Carters armchair yes and I noticed too that she cut you dead
You fellows should have been there he went on in perfect good humor turning to the others
You missed a good little scene
Rivers and Miss Bessemer had been taking a tramp over the Reservationand by the way its a great place to walk so my sister tells me she and Dick Forsythe take a constitutional out there every Saturday morningwell as I was saying Rivers and Miss Bessemer came upon our party rather unexpectedly
We were all togged out in our golfing bags and I presume we looked more like tailors models posing for the gallery than people who were taking an outing but Rivers and Miss Bessemer had been regularly exercising looked as though they had done their fifteen miles since morning
They had their old clothes on and they were dusty and muddy
You would have thought that a young girl such as Miss Bessemer isfor shes very youngwould have been a little embarrassed at running up against such a spick and span lot as we were
Not a bit of it didnt lose her poise for a moment
She bowed to my sister and to me as though from the top of a drag by Jove
and as though she were fresh from Redfern and Virot
You know a girl that can manage herself that way is a thoroughbred
She even remembered to cut little Johnnie Carter here because Johnnie forced himself upon her one night at a dance when he was drunk didnt she Johnnie
Johnnie came up to her there out on the links fresh as a daisy and put out his hand with Why how do you do Miss Bessemer
and wherever did you come from
and I havent seen you in so long and she says No not since our last dance I believe Mr Carter and looked at his hand as though it was something funny
Little Johnnie mumbled and flushed and stammered and backed off and it was well that he did because Rivers had begun to get red around the wattles
I say the little girl is a thoroughbred and my sister wants to give her a dinner as soon as she comes out
But Johnnie says shes declassee so may be my sister had better think it over
I didnt say she was declassee exclaimed Carter
I only said she would do well to be more careful
Sargeant shifted his cigar to the other corner of his mouth one eye shut to avoid the smoke
One might say as much of lots of people he answered
I dont like your tone
Carter flared out
Oh go to the devil Johnnie
Shall we all have a drink
On the Friday evening of that week Condy set himself to his work at his accustomed hour
But he had had a hard day on the Times Supplement and his brain like an overdriven horse refused to work
In half an hour he had not written a paragraph
I thought it would be better in the end to loaf for one evening he explained to Blix some twenty minutes later as they settled themselves in the little diningroom
I can go at it better tomorrow
See how you like this last chapter
Blix was enthusiastic over In Defiance of Authority
Condy had told her the outline of the story and had read to her each chapter as he finished it
Its the best thing you have ever done Condy and you know it
I suppose it has faults but I dont care anything about them
Its the story itself thats so interesting
After that first chapter of the boom restaurant and the exiles club nobody would want to lay the book down
Youre doing the best work of your life so far and you stick to it
Its grinding out copy for the Supplement at the same time that takes all the starch out of me
Youve no idea what it means to write all day and then sit down and write all evening
I WISH you could get off the Times said Blix
Youre just giving the best part of your life to hack work and NOW its interfering with your novel
I know you could do better work on your novel if you didnt have to work on the Times couldnt you
Oh if you come to that of course I could he answered
But they wont give me a vacation
I was sounding the editor on it day before yesterday
No Ill have to manage somehow to swing the two together
Well lets not talk shop now
Condy
You need a rest
Do you want to play poker
They played for upward of an hour that evening and Condy as usual lost
His illluck was positively astonishing
During the last two months he had played poker with Blix on an average of three or four evenings in the week
and at the close of every game it was Blix who had all the chips
Blix had come to know the game quite as well if not better than he
She could almost invariably tell when Condy held a good hand but on her part could assume an air of indifference absolutely inscrutable
Cards
said Condy picking up the deck after the deal
Ill stand pat Condy
The deuce you say he answered with a stare
Ill take three
Ill pass it up to you continued Blix gravely
Wellwell Ill bet you five chips
Raise you twenty
Condy studied his hand laid down the cards picked them up again scratched his head and moved uneasily in his place
Then he threw down two high pairs
No he said I wont see you
What did you have
Lets see just for the fun of it
Blix spread her cards on the table
Not a blessed thing
exclaimed Condy
I might have known it
Theres my last dollar gone too
Lend me fifty cents Blix
Blix shook her head
Why what a little niggard
he exclaimed aggrievedly
Ill pay them all back to you
Now why should I lend you money to play against me
Ill not give you a chip and besides I dont want to play any more
Lets stop
Ive a mind to stop for good stop playing even with you
Blix gave a little cry of joy
Oh Condy will you could you
and never never touch a card again
never play for money
Id be so happybut dont unless you know you would keep your promise
I would much rather have you play every night down there at your club than break your promise
Condy fell silent biting thoughtfully at the knuckle of a forefinger
Think twice about it Condy urged Blix because this would be for always
Condy hesitated then abstractedly and as though speaking to himself Its different now
Before we took thatthree months ago I dont say
It was harder for me to quit then but nowwell everything is different now and it would please you Blixy
More than anything else I can think of Condy
He gave her his hand
That settles it he said quietly
Ill never gamble again Blix
Blix gripped his hand hard then jumped up and with a quick breath of satisfaction gathered up the cards and chips and flung them into the fireplace
Oh Im so glad thats over with she exclaimed her little eyes dancing
Ive pretended to like it but Ive hated it all the time
You dont know HOW Ive hated it
What men can see in it to make them sit up all night long is beyond me
And you truly mean Condy that you never will gamble again
Yes I know you mean it this time
Oh Im so happy I could sing
Good Heavens dont do that
he cried quickly
Youre a nice amiable girl Blix even if youre not pretty and you Oh bother you
she retorted but you promise
On my honor
Thats enough she said quietly
But even when loafing as he was this evening Condy could not rid himself of the thought and recollection of his novel resting or writing it haunted him
Otherwise he would not have been the storywriter that he was
From now on until he should set down the last sentence the thing was never to let him alone never to allow him a moments peace
He could think of nothing else could talk of nothing else every faculty of his brain every sense of observation or imagination incessantly concentrated themselves upon this one point
As they sat in the bay window watching the moon rise his mind was still busy with it and he suddenly broke out I ought to work some kind of a TREASURE into the yarn
Whats a story of adventure without a treasure
By Jove Blix I wish I could give my whole time to this stuff
Its ripping good material and it ought to be handled as carefully as glass
Ought to be worked up you know
Condy said Blix looking at him intently what is it stands in your way of leaving the Times
Would they take you back if you left them long enough to write your novel
You could write it in a month couldnt you if you had nothing else to do
Suppose you left them for a monthwould they hold your place for you
Yesyes I think they would but in the meanwhile Blixtheres the rub
Ive never saved a cent out of my salary
When I stop my pay stops and wherewithal would I be fed
What are you looking for in that drawermatches
Here Ive got a match
Blix faced about at the sideboard shutting the drawer by leaning against it
In both hands she held one of the delft sugarbowls
She came up to the table and emptied its contents upon the blue denim tablecovertwo or three gold pieces some fifteen silver dollars and a handful of small change
Disregarding all Condys inquiries she counted it making little piles of the gold and silver and nickel pieces
Thirtyfive and seven is fortytwo she murmured counting off on her fingers and six is fortyeight and ten is fiftyeight and ten is sixtyeight and here is ten twenty thirty fifty five cents in change
She thrust it all toward him across the table
There she said is your wherewithal
Condy stared
My wherewithal
he muttered
It ought to be enough for over a month
Where did you get all that
Whose is it
Its your money Condy
You loaned it to me and now it has come in very handy
I LOANED it to you
Its the money I won from you during the time youve been playing poker with me
You didnt know it would amount to so much did you
Pshaw Ill not touch it
he exclaimed drawing back from the money as though it was redhot
Yes you will she told him
Ive been saving it up for you Condy every penny of it from the first day we played down there at the lake and I always told myself that the moment you made up your mind to quit playing I would give it back to you
Why the very idea
he vociferated his hands deep in his pockets his face scarlet
Itsits preposterous Blix
I wont let you TALK about it evenI wont touch a nickel of that money
But Blix youreyourethe finest woman I ever knew
Youre a mans woman thats what you are
He set his teeth
If you loved a man youd be a regular pal to him youd back him up youd stand by him till the last gun was fired
I could do ANYTHING if a WOMAN like you cared for me
Why Blix Iyou havent any idea He cleared his throat stopping abruptly
But you must take this money she answered YOUR money
If you didnt Condy it would make me out nothing more nor less than a gambler
I wouldnt have dreamed of playing cards with you if I had ever intended to keep one penny of your money
From the very start I intended to keep it for you and give it back to you so soon as you would stop and now you have a chance to put this money to a good use
You dont have to stay on the Times now
You cant do your novel justice while you are doing your hack work at the same time and I do so want In Defiance of Authority to be a success
Ive faith in you Condy
I know if you got the opportunity you would make a success
But you and I have played like two men playing exclaimed Condy
How would it look if Sargeant say should give me back the money he had won from me
What a cad I would be to take it
Thats just itweve not played like two men
Then I WOULD have been a gambler
Ive played with you because I thought it would make a way for you to break off with the habit and knowing as I did how fond you were of playing cards and how bad it was for you how wicked it would have been for me to have played with you in any other spirit
Dont you see
And as it has turned out youve given up playing and youve enough money to make it possible for you to write your novel
The Centennial Company have asked you to try a story of adventure for them youve found one that is splendid youre just the man who could handle it and now youve got the money to make it possible
Condy she exclaimed suddenly dont you see your CHANCE
Arent you a big enough man to see your chance when it comes
And besides do you think I would take MONEY from you
Cant you understand
If you dont take this money that belongs to you you would insult me
That is just the way I would feel about it
You must see that
If you care for me at all youll take it
                 The editor of the Sunday Supplement put his toothpick behind his ear and fixed Condy with his eyeglasses
Well its like this Rivers he said
Of course you know your own business best
If you stay on here with us it will be all right
But I may as well tell you that I dont believe I can hold your place for a month
I cant get a man in here to do your work for just a month and then fire him out at the end of that time
I dont like to lose you but if you have an opportunity to get in on another paper during this vacation of yours youre at liberty to do so for all of me
Then you think my chance of coming back here would be pretty slim if I leave for a month now
Thats right
There was a silence
Condy hesitated then he rose
Ill take the chance he announced
To Blix that evening as he told her of the affair he said Its neck or nothing now Blix
Chapter XII But did Blix care for him
In the retired corner of his club shut off by the Japanese screen or going up and down the city to and from his work or sitting with her in the bay window of the little diningroom looking down upon the city blurred in the twilight or radiant with the sunset Condy asked himself the question
A score of times each day he came to a final definite negative decision and a score of times reopened the whole subject
Beyond the fact that Blix had enjoyed herself in his company during the last months Condy could find no sign or trace of encouragement and for that matter he told himself that the indications pointed rather in the other direction
She had no compunction in leaving him to go away to New York perhaps never to return
In less than a month now all their companionship was to end and he would probably see the last of her
He dared not let her know that at last he had really come to love herthat it was no pretence now for he knew that with such declaration their good times would end even before she should go away
But every day every hour that they were together made it harder for him to keep himself within bounds
What with this trouble on his mind and the grim determination with which he held to his work Condy changed rapidly
Blix had steadied him and a certain earnestness and seriousness of purpose a certain STRENGTH he had not known before came swiftly into being
Was Blix to go away leave him perhaps for all time and not know how much he cared
Would he speak before she went
Condy did not know
It was a question that circumstances would help him to decide
He would not speak so he resolved unless he was sure that she cared herself and if she did she herself would give him a cue a hint whereon to speak
But days went by the time set for Blixs departure drew nearer and nearer and yet she gave him not the slightest sign
These two interests had now absorbed his entire life for the momenthis love for Blix and his novel
Little by little In Defiance of Authority took shape
The boom restaurant and the club of the exiles were disposed of Billy Isham began to come to the front the filibustering expedition and Senora Estrada with her torn calling card had been introduced and the expedition was ready to put to sea
But here a new difficulty was encountered
What do I know about ships
Condy confessed to Blix
If Billy Isham is going to command a filibustering schooner Ive got to know something about a schoonerappear to anyhow
Ive got to know nautical lingo the real thing you know
I dont believe a REAL sailor ever in his life said belay there or avast
Well have to go out and see Captain Jack get some more technical detail
This move was productive of the most delightful results
Captain Jack was all on fire with interest the moment that Condy and Blix told him of the idea
An youre going to put Billy Isham in a book
Well strike me straight thats a snorkin good idea
Ive always said that all Billy needed was a ticket seller an an advance agent an he was a whole show in himself
Were going to send it East said Blix as soon as its finished and have it published
Well it ought to make prime readin Miss an thats a good fetchin title In Defiance of Authority
Regularly Wednesday and Sunday afternoons Blix and Condy came out to the lifeboat station
Captain Jack received them in sweater and visored cap and ushered them into the front room
Well hows the yarn getting on
Captain Jack would ask
Then Condy would read the last chapter while the Captain paced the floor frowning heavily smoking cigars listening to every word
Condy told the story in the first person as if Billy Ishams partner were narrating scenes and events in which he himself had moved
Condy called this protagonist Burke Cassowan and was rather proud of the name
But the captain would none of it
Cassowan the protagonist was simply Our Mug
Now Condy would say notebook in hand now Cap weve got down to Mazatlan
Now I want to sort of organize the expedition in this next chapter
I see I see Captain Jack would exclaim interested at once
Wait a bit till I take off my shoes
I can think better with my shoes off and having removed his shoes he would begin to pace the room in his stocking feet puffing fiercely on his cigar as he warmed to the tale blowing the smoke out through either ear gesturing savagely his face flushed and his eyes kindling
Well now lessee
First thing Our Mug does when he gets to Mazatlan is to communicate his arrival to Senora Estrada telegraphs you know and by the way have him use a cipher
What kind of cipher
Count three letters on from the right letter see
If you were spelling boat for instance you would begin with an E the third letter after B then R for the O being the third letter from O
So youd spell boat ERDW and Senora Estrada knows when she gets that despatch that she must count three letters BACK from each letter to get the right ones
Take now such a cipher word as ULIOH
That means RIFLE
Count three letters back from each letter of ULIOH and itll spell RIFLE
You can make up a lot of despatches like that just to have the thing look natural savvy
Out of sight
muttered Condy making a note
Then Our Mug and Billy Isham start getting a crew
And Our Mug he buys the sextant there in Mazatlanthe sextant that got out of order and spoiled everything
Or no dont have it a sextant have it a quadrantan oldfashioned ebony quadrant
Have Billy Isham buy it because it was cheap
How did it get out of order Captain Jack
inquired Blix
That would be a good technical detail wouldnt it Condy
Well its like this
Our Mug an Billy get a schooner thats so bally small that they have to do their cooking in the cabin quadrants on a rack over the stove and the heat warps the joints so when Our Mug takes his observation he gets fifty miles off his course and raises the land where the government forces are watching for him
And heres another point Cap said Condy
We ought to work some kind of a treasure into this yarn cant you think up something new and original in the way of a treasure
I dont want the old game of a buried chest of money
Lets have him get track of something thats worth a fortunesomething novel
Yes yes I see the idea answered the Captain striding over the floor with great thuds of his stockinged feet
Now lessee let me think he began rubbing all his hair the wrong way
We want something new and queer something that aint ever been written up before
I tell you what
Here it is
Have Our Mug get wind of a little river schooner that sunk fifty years before his time in one of the big South American rivers during a floodI heard of this myself
Schooner went down and was buried twenty feet under mud and sand and since that timeyou know how the big rivers actthe whole blessed course of the river has changed at that point and the schooner is on dry land or rather twenty feet under it and as sound as the day she was chartered
Well
Well have it that when she sank she had aboard of her a cargo of five hundred cases of whiskey prime stuff seven thousand quart bottles sealed up tight as drums
Now Our Mugnor Billy Isham eitherthey aint born yesterday
No sir theyre right next to themselves
They figure this way
This here whiskeys been kept fifty years without being moved
Now what do you suppose seven thousand quart bottles of fiftyyearold whiskey would be worth
Why twenty dollars a quart wouldnt be too fancy
So there you are theres your treasure
Our Mug and Billy Isham have only got to dig through twenty feet of sand to pick up a hundred thousand dollars IF THEY CAN FIND THE SCHOONER
Blix clapped her hands with a little cry of delight and Condy smote a knee exclaiming By Jove
thats as good as Loudon Dodds opium ship
Why Cap youre a treasure in yourself for a fellow looking for stories
Then after the notes were taken and the story talked over Captain Jack especially if the day happened to be Sunday would insist upon their staying to dinnerboiled beef and cabbage
smoking coffee and picklesthat K D B served in the little brick paved kitchen in the back of the station
The crew messed in their quarters overhead
K D B herself was not uninteresting
Her respectability incased her like armor plate and she never laughed without putting three fingers to her lips
She told them that she had at one time been a costume reader
A costume reader
Yes reading extracts from celebrated authors in the appropriate costume of the character
It used to pay very well and it was very refined
I used to do In a Balcony by Mister Browning and Laska the same evening
and it always made a hit
Id do In a Balcony first and Id put on a LouisQuinzethefifteenth gown and wigtomatch over a female cowboy outfit
When Id finished In a Balcony Id do an exit and shunt the gown and wigtomatch and come on as Laska with thunder noises off
It was one of the strongest effects in my repertoire and it always got me a curtain call
And Captain Jack would wag his head and murmur Extraordinary
extraordinary
Blix and Condy soon noted that upon the occasion of each one of their visits K D B found means to entertain them at great length with long discussions upon certain subjects of curiously diversified character
Upon their first visit she elected to talk upon the Alps mountains
The Sunday following it was bacteriology on the next Wednesday it was crystals while for two hours during their next visit to the station Condy and Blix were obliged to listen to K D
B
s interminable discourse on the origin history and development of the kingdom of Denmark
Condy was dumfounded
I never met such a person man or woman in all my life
Talk about education
Why I think she knows everything
In Defiance of Authority soon began to make good progress but Condy once launched upon technical navigation must have Captain Jack at his elbow continually to keep him from foundering
In some sea novel he remembered to have come across the expression garboard streak and from the context guessed it was to be applied to a detail of a vessels construction
In an unguarded moment he had written that his schooners name was painted in showy gilt letters upon her garboard streak
Whats the garboard streak Condy
Blix had asked when he had read the chapter to her
Thats where they paint her name he declared promptly
I dont know exactly but I like the sound of it
But the next day when he was reading this same chapter to Captain Jack the latter suddenly interrupted with an exclamation as of acute physical anguish
Whats that
Read that last over again he demanded
When they had come within a few boats lengths read Condy they were able to read the schooners name painted in showy gilt letters upon her garboard streak
My God
gasped the Captain clasping his head
Then with a shout Garboard streak
garboard streak
Dont you know that the garboard streak is the last plank next the keel
You mean counter not garboard streak
That regularly graveled me that did
They stayed to dinner with the couple that afternoon and for half an hour afterward K D B told them of the wonders of the caves of Elephantis
One would have believed that she had actually been at the place
But when she changed the subject to the science of fortification Blix could no longer restrain herself
But it is really wonderful that you should know all these things
Where did you find time to study so much
One must have an education returned K D B primly
But Condy had caught sight of a halffilled bookshelf against the opposite wall and had been suddenly smitten with an inspiration
On a leaf of his notebook he wrote Try her on the Gs and Hs and found means to show it furtively to Blix
But Blix was puzzled and at the earliest opportunity Condy himself said to the retired costume reader Speaking of fortifications Mrs Hoskins Gibraltar nowthats a wonderful rock isnt it
Rock
she queried
I thought it was an island
Oh no its a fortress
They have a castle therea castle something likewell like the old Schloss at Heidelberg
Did you ever hear about or read about Heidelberg University
But K D B was all abroad now
Gibraltar and Heidelberg were unknown subjects to her as were also inoculation Japan and Kosciusko
Above the Gs she was sound below that point her ignorance was benighted
But what is it Condy
demanded Blix as soon as they were alone
Ive the idea he answered chuckling
Wait till after Sunday to see if Im right then Ill tell you
Its a dollar to a paper dime K D B will have something for us by Sunday beginning with an I
And she had
It was Internal Revenue
Right
right
Condy shouted gleefully as he and Blix were on their way home
I knew it
Shes done with AshBol BolCar and all those and has worked through CodDem and DemEve
Shes down to HorKin now and shell go through the whole lot before shes doneKinMag MagMot MotPal and all the rest
The Encyclopaedia
Dont you see it
No wonder she didnt know beans about Gibraltar
She hadnt come to the Gs by then
Shes reading the Encyclopaedia
And she gets the volumes on the instahnent plan dont you see
Reads the leading articles and then springs em on us
To know things and talk about em thats her idea of being cultured
One must have an education
Do you remember her saying that Oh our matrimonial objects are panning out beyond all expectation
What a delicious nevertobeforgotten month it was for those two
There in the midst of life they were as much alone as upon a tropic island
Blix had deliberately freed herself from a world that had grown distasteful to her Condy little by little had dropped away from his place among the men and the women of his acquaintance and the two came and went together living in a little world of their own creation happy in each others society living only in the present and asking nothing better than to be left alone and to their own devices
They saw each other every day
In the morning from nine till twelve and in the afternoon until three Condy worked away upon his novel but not an evening passed that did not see him and Blix in the diningroom of the little flat
Thursdays and Sunday afternoons they visited the lifeboat station and at other times prowled about the unfrequented corners of the city now passing an afternoon along the water front watching the departure of a China steamer or the loading of the great steel wheat ships now climbing the ladderlike streets of Telegraph Hill or revisiting the Plaza Chinatown and the restaurant or taking long walks in the Presidio Reservation watching cavalry and artillery drills or sitting for hours on the rocks by the seashore watching the ceaseless roll and plunge of the surf the wheeling seabirds and the sleekheaded seals hunting the offshore fish happy for a halfhour when they surprised one with his prey in his teeth
One day some three weeks before the end of the year toward two in the afternoon Condy sat in his usual corner of the club behind the screen writing rapidly
His coat was off and the stump of a cigar was between his teeth
At his elbow was the rectangular block of his manuscript
During the last week the story had run from him with a facility that had surprised and delighted him words came to him without effort ranging themselves into line with the promptitude of welldrilled soldiery sentences and paragraphs marched down the cleanswept spaces of his paper like companies and platoons defiling upon review his chapters were brigades that he marshaled at will falling them in one behind the other each preceded by its chapterhead like an officer in the space between two divisions
In the guise of a commanderinchief sitting his horse upon an eminence that overlooked the field of operations Condy at last took in the entire situation at a glance and with the force and precision of a machine marched his forces straight to the goal he had set for himself so long a time before
Then at length he took a fresh penful of ink squared his elbows drew closer to the desk
and with a single swift spurt of the pen wrote the last line of his novel dropping the pen upon the instant and pressing the blotter over the words as though setting a seal of approval upon the completed task
There
he muttered between his teeth Ive done for YOU
That same afternoon he read the last chapter to Blix and she helped him to prepare the manuscript for expressage
She insisted that it should go off that very day and herself wrote the directions upon the outside wrapper
Then the two went down together to the Wells Fargo office and In Defiance of Authority was sent on its journey across the continent
Now she said as they came out of the express office and stood for a moment upon the steps now theres nothing to do but wait for the Centennial Company
I do so hope well get their answer before I go away
They OUGHT to take it
Its just what they asked for
Dont you think theyll take it Condy
Oh bother that
answered Condy
I dont care whether they take it or not
How long now is it before you go Blix
Chapter XIII A week passed then another
The year was coming to a close
In ten days Blix would be gone
Letters had been received from Aunt Kihm and also an exquisite black leather travelingcase a present to her niece full of cutglass bottles ebonybacked brushes and shell combs
Blix was to leave on the second day of January
In the meanwhile she had been reading far into her firstyear textbooks underscoring and annotating studying for hours upon such subjects as she did not understand so that she might get hold of her work the readier when it came to classroom routine and lectures
Hers was a temperament admirably suited to the study she had chosenselfreliant cool and robust
But it was not easy for her to go
Never before had Blix been away from her home never for longer than a week had she been separated from her father nor from Howard and Snooky
That huge city upon the Atlantic seaboard with its vast fierce life where beat the heart of the nation and where beyond Aunt Kihm she knew no friend filled Blix with a vague sense of terror and of oppression
She was going out into a new life a life of work and of study a harsher life than she had yet known
Her father her friends her homeall these were to be left behind
It was not surprising that Blix should be daunted at the prospect of so great a change in her life now so close at hand
But if the tears did start at times no one ever saw them fall and with a courage that was all her own Blix watched the last days of the year trooping past and the approach of the New Year that was to begin the new life
But Condy was thoroughly unhappy
Those wonderful three months were at an end
Blix was going
In less than a week now she would be gone
He would see the last of her
Then what
He pictured himselfwhen he had said goodby to her and the train had lessened to a smoky blur in the distancefacing about facing the life that must then begin for him returning to the city alone picking up the routine again
There would be nothing to look forward to then he would not see Blix in the afternoon would not sit with her in the evening in the little diningroom of the flat overlooking the city and the bay would not wake in the morning with the consciousness that before the sun would set he would see her again be with her and hear the sound of her voice
The months that were to follow would be one long ache one long harsh colorless grind without her
How was he to get through that first evening that he must pass alone
And she did not care for him
Condy at last knew this to be so
Even the poor solace of knowing that she too was unhappy was denied him
She had never loved him and never would
He was a chum to her nothing more
Condy was too clearheaded to deceive himself upon this point
The time was come for her to go away and she had given him no sign no cue
The last days passed Blixs trunk was packed her half section engaged her ticket bought
They said goodby to the old places they had come to know so wellChinatown the Golden Balcony the waterfront the lake of San Andreas Telegraph Hill and Lunas and had bade farewell to Riccardo and to old Richardson
They had left K D B and Captain Jack until the last day
Blix was to go on the second of January
On New Years Day she and Condy were to take their last walk were to go out to the lifeboat station and then on around the shore to the little amphitheatre of blackberry busheswhere they had promised always to write one another on the anniversary of their first visitand then for the last time climb the hill and go across the breezy downs to the city
Then came the last day of the old year the last day but one that they would be together
They spent it in a long ramble along the waterfront following the line of the shipping even as far as Meiggss Wharf
They had come back to the flat for supper and afterward as soon as the family had left them alone had settled themselves in the bay window to watch the New Year in
The little diningroom was dark but for the indistinct blur of light that came in through the windowa light that was a mingling of the afterglow the newrisen moon and the faint haze that the city threw off into the sky from its street lamps and electrics
From where they sat they could look down almost as from a tower into the citys streets
Here a corner came into view further on a great puff of green foliagepalms and pines side by sideover looked a wall
Here a street was visible for almost its entire length like a stream of asphalt flowing down the pitch of the hill dammed on either side by rows upon rows of houses while further on the vague confusion of roofs and facades opened out around a patch of green lawn the garden of some larger residence
As they looked and watched the afterglow caught window after window till all that quarter of the city seemed to stare up at them from a thousand ruddy eyes
The windows seemed infinite in number the streets endless in their complications yet everything was deserted
At this hour the streets were empty and would remain so until daylight
Not a soul was stirring no face looked from any of those myriads of glowing windows no footfall disturbed the silence of those asphalt streets
There almost within call behind those windows shut off from those empty streets a thousand human lives were teeming each the centre of its own circle of thoughts and words and actions and yet the solitude was profound the desolation complete
the stillness unbroken by a single echo
The nightthe last night of the old yearwas fine the white clear light from a moon they could not see grew wide and clear over the city as the last gleam of the sunset faded
It was just warm enough for the window to be open and for nearly three hours Condy and Blix sat looking down upon the city in these last moments of the passing year feeling upon their faces an occasional touch of the breeze that carried with it the smell of trees and flowers from the gardens below them and the faint fine taint of the ocean from far out beyond the Heads
But the scene was not in reality silent
At times when they listened intently especially when they closed their eyes there came to them a subdued steady bourdon profound unceasing a vast numb murmur like no other sound in all the gamut of naturethe sound of a city at night the hum of a great conglomerate life wrought out there from moment to moment under the stars and under the moon while the last hours of the old year dropped quietly away
A star fell
Sitting in the window the two noticed it at once and Condy stirred for the first time in fifteen minutes
That was a very long one he said in a low voice
Blix you must write to mewe must write each other often
Oh yes she answered
We must not forget each other we have had too good a time for that
Four years is a long time he went on
Lots can happen in four years
Wonder what Ill be doing at the end of four years
Weve had a pleasant time while it lasted Blix
Havent we
she said her chin on her hand the moonlight shining in her little darkbrown eyes
Well he was going to lose her
He had found out that he loved her only in time to feel the wrench of parting from her all the more keenly
What was he to do with himself after she was gone
What could he turn to in order to fill up the great emptiness that her going would leave in his daily life
And was she never to know how dear she was to him
Why not speak to her why not tell her that he loved her
But Condy knew that Blix did not love him and the knowledge of that must keep him silent he must hug his secret to him like the Spartan boy with his stolen fox no matter how grievously it hurt him to do so
He and Blix had lived through two months of rarest most untroubled happiness with hardly more selfconsciousness than two young and healthy boys
To bring that troublous disquieting element of love between themunrequited love of all thingswould be a folly
She would tell himmust in all honesty tell him that she did not love him and all their delicious camaraderie would end in a scene
Condy above everything wished to look back on those two months after she had gone without being able to remember therein one single note that jarred
If the memory of her was all that he was to have he resolved that at least that memory should be perfect
And the love of her had made a man of himhe could not forget that had given to him just the strength that made it possible for him to keep that resolute grim silence now
In those two months he had grown five years he was more masculine more virile
The very set of his mouth was different between the eyebrows the cleft had deepened his voice itself vibrated to a heavier note
No no so long as he should live he man grown as he was could never forget this girl of nineteen who had come into his life so quietly so unexpectedly who had influenced it so irresistibly and so unmistakably for its betterment and who had passed out of it with the passing of the year
For a few moments Condy had been absentmindedly snapping the lid of his cigarette case while he thought now he selected a cigarette returned the case to his pocket and fumbled for a match
But the little gunmetal case he carried was empty
Blix rose and groped for a moment upon the mantelshelf then returned and handed him a match and stood over him while he scraped it under the arm of the chair wherein he sat
Even when his cigarette was lighted she still stood there looking at him the fingers of her hands clasped in front of her her hair one side of her cheek her chin and sweet round neck outlined by the faint blur of light that came from the open window
Then quietly she said Well Condy
Well Blix
Just well
she repeated
Is that all
Is that all you have to say to me
He gave a great start
Blix
he exclaimed
Is that all
And you are going to let me go away from you for so long and say nothing more than that to me
You think you have been so careful think you have kept your secret so close
Condy dont you suppose I know
Do you suppose women are so blind
No you dont need to tell me I knowIve known itoh for weeks
You knowknowknow what
he exclaimed breathless
That you have been pretending that you did not love me
I know that you do love meI know you have been trying to keep it from me for fear it would spoil our good times and because we had made up our minds to be chums and have no more foolishness
Oncein those days when we first knew each otherI knew you did not love me when you said you did but now sinceoh since that afternoon in the Chinese restaurant rememberIve known that you did love me although you pretended you didnt
It was the pretence I wanted to be rid of I wanted to be rid of it when you said you loved me and didnt and I want to be rid of it now when YOU pretend not to love me and I KNOW you do and Blix leaned back her head as she spoke that know looking at him from under her lids a smile upon her lips
Its the pretence that I wont have she added
We must be sincere with each other you and I
Blix do YOU love ME
Condy had risen to his feet his breath was coming quick his cigarette was flung away and his hands opened and shut swiftly
Oh Blixy little girl do YOU love ME
They stood there for a moment in the half dark facing one another their hearts beating their breath failing them in the tension of the instant
There in that room high above the city a little climax had come swiftly to a head a crisis in two lives had suddenly developed
The moment that had been in preparation for the last few months the last few years the last few centuries behold
it had arrived
Blix do you love me
Suddenly it was the New Year
Somewhere close at hand a chorus of chiming church bells sang together
Far off in the direction of the wharves where the great ocean steamships lay came the glad sonorous shouting of a whistle from a nearby street a bugle called aloud
And then from point to point from street to roof top and from roof to spire the vague murmur of many sounds grew and spread and widened slowly grandly that profound and steady bourdon as of an invisible organ swelling deepening and expanding to the full male diapason of the city aroused and signaling the advent of another year
And they heard it they two heard it standing there face to face looking into each others eyes that unanswered question yet between them the question that had come to them with the turning of the year
It was the old year yet when Condy had asked that question
In that moments pause while Blix hesitated to answer him the New Year had come
And while the huge vast note of the city swelled and vibrated she still kept silent
But only for a moment
Then she came closer to him and put a hand on each of his shoulders
Happy New Year dear she said
                 On New Years Day the last day they were to be together Blix and Condy took their walk as they had come to call itthe walk that included the lifeboat station the Golden Gate the ocean beach beyond the old fort the green bare flowerstarred hills and downs and the smooth levels of the golf links
Blix had been busy with the last details of her packing and they did not get started until toward two in the afternoon
Strike me
exclaimed Captain Jack as Blix informed him that she had come to say goodby
Why aint this very suddenlike Miss Bessemer
Hey Kitty come in here
Heres Miss Bessemer come to say goodby going to New York tomorrow
Well regularly be lonesome without you miss said K D B as she came into the front room bringing with her a brisk pungent odor of boiled vegetables
New Yorksuch a town as it must be
It was called Manhattan at first you know and was settled by the Dutch
Evidently K D B had reached the Ns
With such deftness as she possessed Blix tried to turn the conversation upon the first meeting of the retired sea captain and the onetime costume reader but all to no purpose
The Matrimonial Objects were perhaps a little ashamed of their personals by now and neither Blix nor Condy were ever to hear their version of the meeting in the back diningroom of Lunas Mexican restaurant
Captain Jack was in fact anxious to change the subject
Any news of the yarn yet
he suddenly inquired of Condy What do those Eastern publishin people think of Our Mug and Billy Isham and the whiskey schooner
Condy had received the rejected manuscript of In Defiance of Authority that morning accompanied by a letter from the Centennial Company
Well he said in answer theyre not as you might say falling over themselves trying to see wholl be the first to print it
Its been returned
The devil you say
responded the Captain
Well thats kind of disappointin to you aint it
But Blix hastened to add were not at all discouraged
Were going to send it off again right away
Then she said goodby to them
I dunno as youll see me here when you come back miss said the Captain at the gate his arm around K D B
Ive got to schemin again
Do you know he added in a low confidential tone that all the mines in California send their cleanups and gold bricks down to the Selby smeltin works once every week
They send em to San Francisco first and they are taken up to Selbys Wednesday afternoons on a little sternwheel steamer called the Monticello
All them bricks are in a boxdumped in like so much coaland that box sets just under the wheelhouse forard
How much money do you suppose them bricks represent
Well Ill tell you last week they represented seven hundred and eighty thousand dollars
Well now I got a chart of the bay near Vallejo the channels all right but there are mudflats that run out from shore three miles
Enough water for a whitehall but not enough forwell for the patrol boat for instance
Two or three slick boys of a foggy nightof course Im not in that kind of game but strike
it would be a deal now wouldnt it
Dont you believe him miss put in K D B
Hes just talking to show off
I think your scheme of holding up a Cunard liner said Condy with great earnestness is more feasible
You could lay across her course and fly a distress signal
Shed have to heave to
Yes I been thinkin o that but look herewhats to prevent the liner taking right after your schooner after youve got the stuff aboardjust followin you right around an findin out where you land
Shed be under contract to carry Government mails contradicted Condy
She couldnt do that
Youd leave her mails aboard for just that reason
You wouldnt rob her of her mails just so long as she was carrying government mails she couldnt stop
The Captain clapped his palm down upon the gatepost
Strike me straight
I never thought of that
Chapter XIV Blix and Condy went on on along the narrow road upon the edge of the salt marshes and tules that lay between the station and the Golden Gate on to the Golden Gate itself and around the old grimeincrusted fort to the ocean shore with its reaches of hard white sand where the bowlders lay tumbled and the surf grumbled incessantly
The world seemed very far away from them here on the shores of the Pacific on that first afternoon of the New Year
They were supremely happy and they sufficed to themselves
Condy had forgotten all about the next day when he must say goodby to Blix
It did not seem possible it was not within the bounds of possibility that she was to go awaythat they two were to be separated
And for that matter tomorrow was tomorrow
It was twentyfour hours away
The present moment was sufficient
The persistence with which they clung to the immediate moment their happiness in living only in the present had brought about a rather curious condition of things between them
In their love for each other there was no thought of marriage they were too much occupied with the joy of being together at that particular instant to think of the future
They loved each other and that was enough
They did not look ahead further than the following day and then but furtively and only in order that their morrows parting might intensify their happiness of today
That New Years Day was to be the end of everything
Blix was going she and Condy would never see each other again
The thought of marriagewith its certain responsibilities its duties its gravity its vague troublous seriousness its inevitable disappointmentswas even a little distasteful to them
Their romance had been hitherto without a flaw they had been genuinely happy in little things
It was as well that it should end that day in all its pristine sweetness unsullied by a single bitter moment undimmed by the cloud of a single disillusion or disappointment
Whatever chanced to them in later years they could at least cherish this one memory of a pure unselfish affection young and unstained and almost without thought of sex come and gone on the very threshold of their lives
This was the end they both understood
They were glad that it was to be so
They did not even speak again of writing to each other
They found once more the little semicircle of blackberry bushes and the fallen log halfway up the hill above the shore and sat there a while looking down upon the long green rollers marching incessantly toward the beach and there breaking in a prolonged explosion of solid green water and flying spume
And their glance followed their succeeding ranks further and further out to sea till the multitude blended into the massthe vast green shifting mass that drew the eye on and on to the abrupt fine line of the horizon
There was no detail in the scene
There was nothing but the great reach of the ocean floor the unbroken plane of blue sky and the bare green slope of landthree immensities gigantic vast primordial
It was no place for trival ideas and thoughts of little things
The mind harked back unconsciously to the broad simpler basic emotions the fundamental instincts of the race
The huge spaces of earth and air and water carried with them a feeling of kindly but enormous forceelemental force fresh untutored new and young
There was buoyancy in it a fine breathless sense of uplifting and exhilaration a sensation as of bigness and a return to the homely human natural life to the primitive old impulses irresistible changeless and unhampered old as the ocean stable as the hills vast as the unplumbed depths of the sky
Condy and Blix sat still listening looking and watchingthe intellect drowsy and numb the emotions the senses all alive and brimming to the surface
Vaguely they felt the influence of the moment
Something was preparing for them
From the lowest untouched depths in the hearts of each of them something was rising steadily to consciousness and the light of day
There is no name for such things no name for the mystery that spans the interval between man and womanthe mystery that bears no relation to their love for each other but that is something better than love and whose coming savors of the miraculous
The afternoon had waned and the sun had begun to set when Blix rose
We should be going Condy she told him
They started up the hill and Condy said I feel as though I had been somehow asleep with my eyes wide open
What a glorious sunset
It seems to me as though I were living double every minute and oh
Blix isnt it the greatest thing in the world to love each other as we do
They had come to the top of the hill by now and went on across the open breezy downs all starred with blue iris and wild heliotrope
Blix drew his arm about her waist and laid her cheek upon his shoulder with a little caressing motion
And I do love you dear she saidlove you with all my heart
And its for always too I know that
Ive been a girl until within the last three or four daysjust a girl dearest not very serious Im afraid and not caring for anything else beyond what was happening close around medont you understand
But since Ive found out how much I loved you and knew that you loved me why everything is changed for me
Im not the same I enjoy things that I never thought of enjoying before and I feel sooh LARGER dont you knowand stronger and so much more serious
Just a little while ago I was only nineteen but I think dear that by loving you I have becomeall of a sudden and without knowing ita woman
A little trembling ran through her with the words
She stopped and put both arms around his neck her head tipped back her eyes half closed her sweet yellow hair rolling from her forehead
Her whole dear being radiated with that sweet clean perfume that seemed to come alike from her clothes her neck her arms her hair and mouththe delicious almost divine feminine aroma that was part of herself
You do love me Condy dont you just as I love you
Such words as he could think of seemed pitifully inadequate
For answer he could only hold her the closer
She understood
Her eyes closed slowly and her face drew nearer to his
Just above a whisper she said I love you dear
I love you Blix
And they kissed each other then upon the mouth
Meanwhile the sun had been setting
Such a sunset
The whole world the three great spaces of sea and land and sky were incarnadined with the glory of it
The ocean floor was a blinding red radiance the hills were amethyst the sky one gigantic opal and they two seemed poised in the midst of all the chaotic glory of a primitive world
It was New Years Day the earth was new the year was new and their love was new and strong
Everything was before them
There was no longer any past no longer any present
Regrets and memories had no place in their new world
It was Hope Hope Hope that sang to them and called to them and smote into life the new keen blood of them
Then suddenly came the miracle like the flashing out of a new star whose radiance they felt but could not see like a burst of music whose harmony they felt but could not hear
And as they stood there alone in all that simple glory of sky and earth and sea they knew all in an instant that THEY WERE FOR EACH OTHER forever and forever for better or for worse till death should them part
Into their romance into their world of little things their joys of the moment their happiness of the hour had suddenly descended a great and lasting joy the happiness of the great grave issues of lifea happiness so deep so intense as to thrill them with a sense of solemnity and wonder
Instead of being the end that New Years Day was but the beginningthe beginning of their real romance
All the fine virile masculine energy of him was aroused and rampant
All her sweet strong womanliness had been suddenly deepened and broadened
In fine he had become a man and she woman
Youth life and the love of man and woman the strength of the hills the depth of the ocean and the beauty of the sky at sunset that was what the New Year had brought to them
                 Its goodby dear isnt it
said Blix
But Condy would not have it so
No no he told her no Blix no matter how often we separate after this wonderful New Years Day no matter how far we are apart WE two shall never never say goodby
Oh youre right youre right
she answered the tears beginning to shine in her little darkbrown eyes
No so long as we love each other nothing matters
Theres no such thing as distance for us is there
Just think you will be here on the shores of the Pacific and I on the shores of the Atlantic but the whole continent cant come between US
And well be together again Blix he said and it wont be very long now
Just give me timea few years now
But so long as we love each other TIME wont matter either
What are the tears for Blixy
he asked pressing his handkerchief to her cheek
Because this is the saddest and happiest day of my life she answered
Then she pulled from him with a little laugh adding Look Condy youve dropped your letter
You pulled it out just now with your handkerchief
As Condy picked it up she noted the name of the Centennial Company upon the corner
Its the letter I got with the manuscript of the novel when they sent it back he explained
What did they say
Oh the usual thing
I havent read it yet
Heres what they say
He opened it and read We return to you herewith the MS of your novel In Defiance of Authority and regret that our reader does not recommend it as available for publication at present
We have however followed your work with considerable interest and have read a story by you copied in one of our exchanges under the title A Victory Over Death which we would have been glad to publish ourselves had you given us the chance
Would you consider the offer of the assistant editorship of our QUARTERLY a literary and critical pamphlet that we publish in New York and with which we presume you are familiar
We do not believe there would be any difficulty in the matter of financial arrangements
In case you should decide to come on we inclose R R passes via the A T  S F C  A and New York Central
Very truly THE CENTENNIAL PUBLISHING COMPANY NEW YORK
The two exchanged glances
But Blix was too excited to speak and could only give vent to a little quivering choking sigh
The letter was a veritable god from the machine the one thing lacking to complete their happiness
I dont know how this looks to you Condy began trying to be calm but it seems to me that this isthat thisthis But what they said then they could never afterward remember
The golden haze of the sunset somehow got into their recollection of the moment and they could only recall the fact that they had been gayer in that moment than ever before in all their lives
Perhaps as gay as they ever were to be again
They began to know the difference between gayety and happiness
That New Years Day that sunset marked for them an end and a beginning
It was the end of their gay irresponsible hourtohour life of the past three months and it was the beginning of a new life whose possibilities of sorrow and of trouble of pleasure and of happiness were greater than aught they had yet experienced
They knew thisthey felt it instinctively as with a common impulse they turned and looked back upon the glowing earth and sea and sky the breaking surf the beach the distant rimeincrusted ancient fortall that scene that to their eyes stood for the dear free careless companionship of those last few months
Their newfound happiness was not without its sadness already
All was over now their solitary walks the long still evenings in the little diningroom overlooking the sleeping city their excursions to Lunas their afternoons spent in the golden Chinese balcony their mornings on the lake calm and still and hot
Forever and forever they had said goodby to that life
Already the sunset was losing its glory
Then with one last look they turned about and set their faces from it to the new life to the East where lay the Nation
Out beyond the purple bulwarks of the Sierras far off the great grim world went clashing through its groovesthe world that now they were to know the world that called to them and woke them and roused them
Their little gayeties were done the life of little things was all behind
Now for the future
The sterner note had struckwork was to be done that too the New Year had brought to themwork for each of them work and the world of men
For a moment they shrank from it loth to take the first step beyond the confines of the garden wherein they had lived so joyously and learned to love each other and as they stood there facing the gray and darkening Eastern sky their backs forever turned to the sunset Blix drew closer to him putting her hand in his looking a little timidly into his eyes
But his arm was around her and the strong young force that looked into her eyes from his gave her courage
A happy New Year dear she said
A very very happy New Year Blix he answered
The End
