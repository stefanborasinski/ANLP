Baron Trigaults Vengeance by Emile Gaboriau A Sequel to The Counts Millions Translated from the French I Vengeance
that is the first the only thought when a man finds himself victimized when his honor and fortune his present and future are wrecked by a vile conspiracy
The torment he endures under such circumstances can only be alleviated by the prospect of inflicting them a hundredfold upon his persecutors
And nothing seems impossible at the first moment when hatred surges in the brain and the foam of anger rises to the lips no obstacle seems insurmountable or rather none are perceived
But later when the faculties have regained their equilibrium one can measure the distance which separates the dream from reality the project from execution
And on setting to work how many discouragements arise
The fever of revolt passes by and the victim wavers
He still breathes bitter vengeance but he does not act
He despairs and asks himself what would be the good of it
And in this way the success of villainy is once more assured
Similar despondency attacked Pascal Ferailleur when he awoke for the first time in the abode where he had hidden himself under the name of Maumejan
A frightful slander had crushed him to the earthhe could kill his slanderer but afterward
How was he to reach and stifle the slander itself
As well try to hold a handful of water as well try to stay with extended arms the progress of the poisonous breeze which wafts an epidemic on its wings
So the hope that had momentarily lightened his heart faded away again
Since he had received that fatal letter from Madame Leon the evening before he believed that Marguerite was lost to him forever and in this case it was useless to struggle against fate
What would be the use of victory even if he conquered
Marguerite lost to himwhat did the rest matter
Ah
if he had been alone in the world
But he had his mother to think ofhe belonged to this bravehearted woman who had saved him from suicide already
I will not yield then I will struggle on for her sake he muttered like a man who foresees the futility of his efforts
He rose and had nearly finished dressing when he heard a rap at his chamber door
It is I my son said Madame Ferailleur outside
Pascal hastened to admit her
I have come for you because the woman you spoke about last evening is already here and before employing her I want your advice
Then the woman doesnt please you mother
I want you to see her
On entering the little parlor with his mother Pascal found himself in the presence of a portly palefaced woman with thin lips and restless eyes who bowed obsequiously
It was indeed Madame Vantrasson the landlady of the model lodginghouse who was seeking employment for the three or four hours which were at her disposal in the morning she said
It certainly was not for pleasure that she had decided to go out to service again her dignity suffered terribly by this fallbut then the stomach has to be cared for
Tenants were not numerous at the model lodging house in spite of its seductive title and those who slept there occasionally almost invariably succeeded in stealing something
Nor did the grocery store pay the few halfpence which were left there occasionally in exchange for a glass of liquor were pocketed by Vantrasson who spent them at some neighboring establishment for it is a wellknown fact that the wine a man drinks in his own shop is always bitter in flavor
So having no credit at the butchers or the bakers Madame Vantrasson was sometimes reduced to living for days together upon the contents of the shopmouldy figs or dry raisinswhich she washed down with torrents of ratafia her only consolation here below
But this was not a satisfying diet as she was forced to confess so she decided to find some work that would furnish her with food and a little money which she vowed she would never allow her worthy husband to see
What would you charge per month
inquired Pascal
She seemed to reflect and after a great deal of counting on her fingers she finally declared that she would be content with breakfast and fifteen francs a month on condition she was allowed to do the marketing
The first question of French cooks on presenting themselves for a situation is almost invariably Shall I do the marketing
which of course means Shall I have any opportunities for stealing
Everybody knows this and nobody is astonished at it
I shall do the marketing myself declared Madame Ferailleur boldly
Then I shall want thirty francs a month replied Madame Vantrasson promptly
Pascal and his mother exchanged glances
They were both unfavorably impressed by this woman and were equally determined to rid themselves of her which it was easy enough to do
Too dear
said Madame Ferailleur I have never given over fifteen francs
But Madame Vantrasson was not the woman to be easily discouraged especially as she knew that if she failed to obtain this situation she might have considerable difficulty in finding another one
She could only hope to obtain employment from strangers and newcomers who were ignorant of the reputation of the model lodginghouse
So in view of softening the hearts of Pascal and his mother she began to relate the history of her life skilfully mingling the false with the true and representing herself as an unfortunate victim of circumstances and the inhuman cruelty of relatives
For she belonged like her husband to a very respectable family as the Maumejans might easily ascertain by inquiry
Vantrassons sister was the wife of a man named Greloux who had once been a bookbinder in the Rue SaintDenis but who had now retired from business with a competency
Why had this Greloux refused to save them from bankruptcy
Because one could never hope for a favor from relatives she groaned they are jealous if you succeed and if you are unfortunate they cast you off
However these doleful complaints far from rendering Madame Vantrasson interesting imparted a deceitful and most disagreeable expression to her countenance
I told you that I could only give fifteen francs interrupted Madame Ferailleurtake it or leave it
Madame Vantrasson protested
She expressed her willingness to deduct five francs from the sum she had named but moreit was impossible
Would they haggle over ten francs to secure such a treasure as herself an honest settled woman who was entirely devoted to her employers
Besides I have been a grand cook in my time she added and I have not lost all my skill
Monsieur and madame would be delighted with my cooking for I have seen more than one fine gentleman smack his lips over my sauces when was in the employment of the Count de Chalusse
Pascal and his mother could not repress a start on hearing this name but it was in a tone of wellassumed indifference that Madame Ferailleur repeated M de Chalusse
Yes madamea countand so rich that he didnt know how much he was worth
If he were still alive I shouldnt be compelled to go out to service again
But hes dead and hes to be buried this very day
And with an air of profound secrecy she added On going yesterday to the Hotel de Chalusse to ask for a little help I heard of the great misfortune
Vantrasson my husband accompanied me and while we were talking with the concierge a young woman passed through the hall and he recognized her as a person who some time ago waswellno better than she should be
Now however shes a young lady as lofty as the clouds and the deceased count has been passing her off as his daughter
Ah
this is a strange world
Pascal had become whiter than the ceiling
His eyes blazed and Madame Ferailleur trembled
Very well she said I will give you twentyfive francsbut on condition you come without complaining if I sometimes require your services of an evening
On these occasions I will give you your dinner
And taking five francs from her pocket she placed them in Madame Vantrassons hand adding  Here is your earnest money
The other quickly pocketed the coin not a little surprised by this sudden decision which she had scarcely hoped for and which she by no means understood
Still she was so delighted with this denouement that she expressed her willingness to enter upon her duties at once and to get rid of her Madame Ferailleur was obliged to send her out to purchase the necessary supplies for breakfast
Then as soon as she was alone with her son she turned to him and asked Well Pascal
But the wretched man seemed turned to stone and seeing that he neither spoke nor moved she continued in a severe tone Is this the way you keep your resolutions and your oaths
You express your intention of accomplishing a task which requires inexhaustible patience and dissimulation and at the very first unforeseen circumstance your coolness deserts you and you lose your head completely
If it had not been for me you would have betrayed yourself in that womans presence
You must renounce your revenge and tamely submit to be conquered by the Marquis de Valorsay if your face is to be an open book in which any one may read your secret plans and thoughts
Pascal shook his head dejectedly
Didnt you hear mother
he faltered
Hear what
What that vile woman said
This young lady whom she spoke of whom her husband recognized can be none other than Marguerite
I am sure of it
He recoiled in horror
You are sure of it
he repeated and you can tell me this unmovedcoldly as if it were a natural a possible thing
Didnt you understand the shameful meaning of her insinuations
Didnt you see her hypocritical smile and the malice gleaming in her eyes
He pressed his hands to his burning brow and groaned And I did not crush the infamous wretch
I did not fell her to the ground
Ah
if she had obeyed the impulse of her heart
Madame Ferailleur would have thrown her arms round her sons neck and have mingled her tears with his but reason prevailed
The worthy womans heart was pervaded with that lofty sentiment of duty which sustains the humble heroines of the fireside and lends them even more courage than the reckless adventurers whose names are recorded by history could boast of
She felt that Pascal must not be consoled but spurred on to fresh efforts and so mustering all her courage she said Are you acquainted with Mademoiselle Marguerites past life
No
You only know that hers has been a life of great vicissitudesand so it is not strange that she should be slandered
In that case mother said Pascal you were wrong to interrupt Madame Vantrasson
She would probably have told us many things
I interrupted her it is true and sent her awayand you know why
But she is in our service now and when you are calm when you have regained your senses nothing will prevent you from questioning her
It may be useful for you to know who this man Vantrasson is and how and where he met Mademoiselle Marguerite
Shame sorrow and rage brought tears to Pascals eyes
My God
he exclaimed to be reduced to the unspeakable misery of hearing my mother doubt Marguerite
He did not doubt her
HE could have listened to the most infamous accusations against her without feeling a single doubt
However Madame Ferailleur had sufficient selfcontrol to shrug her shoulders
Ah well
silence this slander she exclaimed
I wish for nothing better but dont forget that we have ourselves to rehabilitate
To crush your enemies will be far more profitable to Mademoiselle Marguerite than vain threats and weak lamentations
It seemed to me that you had sworn to act not to complain
This ironical thrust touched Pascals sensitive mind to the quick he rose at once to his feet and coldly said Thats true
I thank you for having recalled me to myself
She made no rejoinder but mentally thanked God
She had read her sons heart and perceiving his hesitation and weakness she had supplied the stimulus he needed
Now she saw him as she wished to see him
Now he was ready to reproach himself for his lack of courage and his weakness in displaying his feelings
And as a test of his powers of endurance he decided not to question Madame Vantrasson till four or five days had elapsed
If her suspicions had been aroused this delay would suffice to dispel them
He said but little during breakfast for he was now eager to commence the struggle
He longed to act and yet he scarcely knew how to begin the campaign
First of all he must study the enemys positiongain some knowledge of the men he had to deal with find out exactly who the Marquis de Valorsay and the Viscount de Coralth were
Where could he obtain information respecting these two men
Should he be compelled to follow them and to gather up here and there such scraps of intelligence as came in his way
This method of proceeding would be slow and inconvenient in the extreme
He was revolving the subject in his mind when he suddenly remembered the man who on the morning that followed the scene at Madame dArgeless house had come to him in the Rue dUlm to give him a proof of his confidence
He remembered that this strange man had said If you ever need a helping hand come to me
And at the recollection he made up his mind
I am going to Baron Trigaults he remarked to his mother if my presentiments dont deceive me he will be of service to us
In less than half an hour he was on his way
He had dressed himself in the oldest clothes he possessed and this with the change he had made by cutting off his hair and beard had so altered his appearance that it was necessary to look at him several times and most attentively to recognize him
The visiting cards which he carried in his pocket bore the inscription P Maumejan Business Agent Route de la Revolte
His knowledge of Parisian life had induced him to choose the same profession as M Fortunat followeda profession which opens almost every door
I will enter the nearest cafe and ask for a directory he said to himself
I shall certainly find Baron Trigaults address in it
The baron lived in the Rue de la VillelEveque
His mansion was one of the largest and most magnificent in the opulent district of the Madeleine and its aspect was perfectly in keeping with its owners character as an expert financier and a shrewd manufacturer the possessor of valuable mines
The marvellous luxury so surprised Pascal that he asked himself how the owner of this princely abode could find any pleasure at the gaming table of the Hotel dArgeles
Five or six footmen were lounging about the courtyard when he entered it
He walked straight up to one of them and with his hat in his hand asked Baron Trigault if you please
If he had asked for the Grand Turk the valet would not have looked at him with greater astonishment
His surprise indeed seemed so profound that Pascal feared he had made some mistake and added Doesnt he live here
The servant laughed heartily
This is certainly his house he replied and strange to say by some fortunate chance hes here
I wish to speak with him on business
The servant called one of his colleagues
Eh
Florestanis the baron receiving
The baroness hasnt forbidden it
This seemed to satisfy the footman for turning to Pascal he said In that case you can follow me
II
The sumptuous interior of the Trigault mansion was on a par with its external magnificence
Even the entrance bespoke the lavish millionaire eager to conquer difficulties jealous of achieving the impossible and never haggling when his fancies were concerned
The spacious hall paved with costly mosaics had been transformed into a conservatory full of flowers which were renewed every morning
Rare plants climbed the walls up gilded trellis work or hung from the ceiling in vases of rare old china while from among the depths of verdure peered forth exquisite statues the work of sculptors of renown
On a rustic bench sat a couple of tall footmen as bright in their gorgeous liveries as gold coins fresh from the mint still despite their splendor they were stretching and yawning to such a degree that it seemed as if they would ultimately dislocate their jaws and arms
Tell me inquired the servant who was escorting Pascal can any one speak to the baron
Why
This gentleman has something to say to him
The two valets eyed the unknown visitor plainly considering him to be one of those persons who have no existence for the menials of fashionable establishments and finally burst into a hearty laugh
Upon my word
exclaimed the eldest hes just in time
Announce him and madame will be greatly obliged to you
She and monsieur have been quarrelling for a good halfhour
And heavenly powers isnt he tantalizing
The most intense curiosity gleamed in the eyes of Pascals conductor and with an airy of secrecy he asked What is the cause of the rumpus
That Fernand no doubtor some one else
No this morning its about M Van Klopen
Madames dressmaker
The same
Monsieur and madame were breakfasting togethera most unusual thingwhen M Van Klopen made his appearance
I thought to myself when I admitted him Look out for storms
I scented one in the air and in fact the dressmaker hadnt been in the room five minutes before we heard the barons voice rising higher and higher
I said to myself Whew
the mantuamaker is presenting his bill
Madame cried and went on like mad but pshaw
when the master really begins theres no one like him
There isnt a cab driver in Paris whos his equal for swearing
And M Van Klopen
Oh hes used to such scenes
When gentlemen abuse him he does the same as dogs do when they come up out of the water he just shakes his head and troubles himself no more about it
He has decidedly the best of the row
He has furnished the goods and hell have to be paid sooner or later What
hasnt he been paid then
I dont know hes still here
A terrible crash of breaking china interrupted this edifying conversation
There
exclaimed one of the footmen thats monsieur he has smashed two or three hundred francs worth of dishes
He MUST be rich to pay such a price for his angry fits
Well observed the other if I were in monsieurs place I should be angry too
Would you let your wife have her dresses fitted on by a man
I says that its indecent
Im only a servant but Nonsense its the fashion
Besides monsieur does not care about that
A man who He stopped short in fact the others had motioned him to be silent
The baron was surrounded by exceptional servants and the presence of a stranger acted as a restraint upon them
For this reason one of them after asking Pascal for his card opened a door and ushered him into a small room saying I will go and inform the baron
Please wait here
Here as he called it was a sort of smokingroom hung with cashmere of fantastic design and gorgeous hues and encircled by a low cushioned divan covered with the same material
A profusion of rare and costly objects was to be seen on all sides armor statuary pictures and richly ornamented weapons
But Pascal already amazed by the conversation of the servants did not think of examining these objects of virtu
Through a partially open doorway directly opposite the one he had entered by came the sound of loud voices in excited conversation
Baron Trigault the baroness and the famous Van Klopen were evidently in the adjoining room
It was a woman the baroness who was speaking and the quivering of her clear and somewhat shrill voice betrayed a violent irritation which was only restrained with the greatest difficulty
It is hard for the wife of one of the richest men in Paris to see a bill for absolute necessities disputed in this style she was saying
A mans voice with a strong Teutonic accent the voice of Van Klopen the Hollander caught up the refrain
Yes strict necessities one can swear to that
And if before flying into a passion Monsieur le Baron had taken the trouble to glance over my little bill he would have seen No more
You bore me to death
Besides I havent time to listen to your nonsense they are waiting for me to play a game of whist at the club
This time it was the master of the house Baron Trigault who spoke and Pascal recognized his voice instantly
If monsieur would only allow me to read the items
It will take but a moment rejoined Van Klopen
And as if he had construed the oath that answered him as an exclamation of assent he began In June a Hungarian costume with jacket and sash two train dresses with upper skirts and trimmings of lace a Medicis polonaise a jockey costume a walking costume a ridinghabit two morningdresses a Velleda costume an evening dress
I was obliged to attend the races very frequently during the month of June remarked the baroness
But the illustrious adorner of female loveliness had already resumed his reading
In July we have two morningjackets one promenade costume one sailor suit one Watteau shepherdess costume one ordinary bathingsuit with material for parasol and shoes to match one Pompadour bathingsuit one dressinggown one closefitting Medicis mantle two opera cloaks And I was certainly not the most elegantly attired of the ladies at Trouville where I spent the month of July interrupted the baroness
There are but few entries in the month of August continued Van Klopen
We have a morningdress a travellingdress with trimmings And he went on and on gasping for breath rattling off the ridiculous names which he gave to his creations and interrupted every now and then by the blow of a clinched fist on the table or by a savage oath
Pascal stood in the smokingroom motionless with astonishment
He did not know what surprised him the most Van Klopens impudence in daring to read such a bill the foolishness of the woman who had ordered all these things or the patience of the husband who was undoubtedly going to pay for them
At last after what seemed an interminable enumeration Van Klopen exclaimed And thats all
Yes thats all repeated the baroness like an echo
Thats all
exclaimed the baronthats all
That is to say in four months at least seven hundred yards of silk velvet satin and muslin have been put on this womans back
The dresses of the present day require a great deal of material
Monsieur le Baron will understand that flounces puffs and ruches Naturally
Total twentyseven thousand francs
Excuse me
Twentyseven thousand nine hundred and thirtythree francs ninety centimes
Call it twentyeight thousand francs then
Ah well M Van Klopen if you are ever paid for this rubbish it wont be by me
If Van Klopen was expecting this denouement Pascal wasnt in fact he was so startled that an exclamation escaped him which would have betrayed his presence under almost any other circumstances
What amazed him most was the barons perfect calmness following as it did such a fit of furious passion violent enough even to be heard in the vestibule
Either he has extraordinary control over himself or this scene conceals some mystery thought Pascal
Meanwhile the manmilliner continued to urge his claimsbut the baron instead of replying only whistled and wounded by this breach of good manners Van Klopen at last exclaimed I have had dealings with all the distinguished men in Europe and never before did one of them refuse to pay me for his wifes toilettes
Very wellI dont pay for themtheres the difference
Do you suppose that I Baron Trigault that Ive worked like a negro for twenty years merely for the purpose of aiding your charming and useful branch of industry
Gather up your papers Mr Ladies Tailor
There may be husbands who believe themselves responsible for their wives folliesits quite possible there arebut Im not made of that kind of stuff
I allow Madame Trigault eight thousand francs a month for her toilettethat is sufficientand it is a matter for you and her to arrange together
What did I tell you last year when I paid a bill of forty thousand francs
That I would not be responsible for any more of my wifes debts
And I not only said it I formally notified you through my private secretary
I remember indeed Then why do you come to me with your bill
It is with my wife that you have opened an account
Apply to her and leave me in peace
Madame promised me Teach her to keep her promises
It costs a great deal to retain ones position as a leader of fashion and many of the most distinguished ladies are obliged to run into debt urged Van Klopen
Thats their business
But my wife is not a fine lady
She is simply Madame Trigault a baroness thanks to her husbands gold and the condescension of a worthy German prince who was in want of money
SHE is not a person of consequenceshe has no rank to keep up
The baroness must have attached immense importance to the satisfying of Van Klopens demands for concealing the anger this humiliating scene undoubtedly caused her she condescended to try and explain and even to entreat
I have been a little extravagant perhaps she said but I will be more prudent in future
Pay monsieurpay just once more
No
If not for my sake for your own
Not a farthing
By the barons tone Pascal realized that his wife would never shake his fixed determination
Such must also have been the opinion of the illustrious ruler of fashion for he returned to the charge with an argument he had held in reserve
If this is the case I shall to my great regret be obliged to fail in the respect I owe to Monsieur le Baron and to place this bill in the hands of a solicitor
Send him alongsend him along
I cannot believe that monsieur wishes a lawsuit
In that you are greatly mistaken
Nothing would please me better
It would at last give me an opportunity to say what I think about your dealings
Do you think that wives are to turn their husbands into machines for supplying money
You draw the bowstring too tightly my dear fellowit will break
Ill proclaim on the housetop what others dare not say and well see if I dont succeed in organizing a little crusade against you
And animated by the sound of his own words his anger came back to him and in a louder and ever louder voice he continued Ah
you prate of the scandal that would be created by my resistance to your demands
Thats your system but with me it wont succeed
You threaten me with a lawsuit very good
Ill take it upon myself to enlighten Paris for I know your secrets Mr Dressmaker
I know the goings on in your establishment
It isnt always to talk about dress that ladies stop at your place on returning from the Bois
You sell silks and satins no doubt but you sell Madeira and excellent cigarettes as well and there are some who dont walk very straight on leaving your establishment but smell suspiciously of tobacco and absinthe
Oh yes let us go to law by all means
I shall have an advocate who will know how to explain the parts your customers pay and who will reveal how with your assistance they obtain money from other sources than their husbands cashbox
When M Van Klopen was addressed in this style he was not at all pleased
And I
he exclaimed I will tell people that Baron Trigault after losing all his money at play repays his creditors with curses
The noise of an overturned chair told Pascal that the baron had sprung up in a furious passion You may say what you like you rascally fool
but not in my house he shouted
Leaveleave or I will ring Monsieur Leave leave I tell you or I shant have the patience to wait for a servant
He must have joined action to word and have seized Van Klopen by the collar to thrust him into the hall for Pascal heard a sound of scuffling a series of oaths worthy of a coalheaver two or three frightened cries from the baroness and several guttural exclamations in German
Then a door closed with such violence that the whole house shook and a magnificent clock fixed to the wall of the smokingroom fell on to the floor
If Pascal had not heard this scene he would have deemed it incredible
How could one suppose that a creditor would leave this princely mansion with his bill unpaid
But more and more clearly he understood that there must be some greater cause of difference between husband and wife than this bill of twentyeight thousand francs
For what was this amount to a confirmed gambler who without as much as a frown gained or lost a fortune every evening of his life
Evidently there was some skeleton in this householdone of those terrible secrets which make a man and his wife enemies and all the more bitter enemies as they are bound together by a chain which it is impossible to break
And undoubtedly a good many of the insults which the baron had heaped upon Van Klopen must have been intended for the baroness
These thoughts darted through Pascals mind with the rapidity of lightning and showed him the horrible position in which he was placed
The baron who had been so favorably disposed toward him and from whom he was expecting a great service would undoubtedly hate him undoubtedly become his enemy when he learned that he had been a listener although an involuntary one to this conversation with Van Klopen
How did it happen that he had been placed in this dangerous position
What had become of the footman who had taken his card
These were questions which he was unable to answer
And what was he to do
If he could have retired noiselessly if he could have reached the courtyard and have made his escape without being observed he would not have hesitated
But was this plan practicable
And would not his card betray him
Would it not be discovered sooner or later that he had been in the smokingroom while M Van Klopen was in the diningroom
In any case delicacy of feeling as well as his own interest forbade him to remain any longer a listener to the private conversation of the baron and his wife
He therefore noisily moved a chair and coughed in that affected style which means in every country Take careIm here
But he did not succeed in attracting attention
And yet the silence was profound he could distinctly hear the creaking of the barons boots as he paced to and fro and the sound of fingers nervously beating a tattoo on the table
If he desired to avoid hearing the confidential conversation which would no doubt ensue between the baron and his wife there was but one course for him to pursue and that was to reveal his presence at once
He was about to do so when some one opened a door which must have led from the hall into the diningroom
He listened attentively but only heard a few confused words to which the baron replied Very well
Thats sufficient
I will see him in a moment
Pascal breathed freely once more
They have just given him my card he thought
I can remain now he will come here in a moment
The baron must really have started to leave the room for his wife exclaimed One word more have you quite decided
Oh fully
You are resolved to leave me exposed to the persecutions of my dressmaker
Van Klopen is too charming and polite to cause you the least worry
You will brave the disgrace of a lawsuit
Nonsense
You know very well that he wont bring any action against meunfortunately
And besides pray tell me where the disgrace would be
I have a foolish wifeis that my fault
I oppose her absurd extravagancehavent I a right to do so
If all husbands were as courageous we should soon close the establishments of these artful men who minister to your vanity and use you ladies as puppets or living advertisements to display the absurd fashions which enrich them
The baron took two or three more steps forward as if about to leave the room but his wife interposed The Baroness Trigault whose husband has an income of seven or eight hundred thousand francs a year cant go about clad like a simple woman of the middle classes
I should see nothing so very improper in that
Oh I know
Only your ideas dont coincide with mine
I shall never consent to make myself ridiculous among the ladies of my setamong my friends
It would indeed be a pity to arouse the disapproval of your friends
This sneering remark certainly irritated the baroness for it was with the greatest vehemence that she replied All my friends are ladies of the highest rank in societynoble ladies
The baron no doubt shrugged his shoulders for in a tone of crushing irony and scorn he exclaimed Noble ladies
whom do you call noble ladies pray
The brainless fools who only think of displaying themselves and making themselves notoriousthe senseless idiots who pique themselves on surpassing lewd women in audacity extravagance and effrontery who fleece their husbands as cleverly as courtesans fleece their lovers
Noble ladies
who drink and smoke and carouse who attend masked balls and talk slang
Noble ladies
the idiots who long for the applause of the crowd and consider notoriety to be desirable and flattering
A woman is only noble by her virtuesand the chief of all virtues modesty is entirely wanting in your illustrious friends Monsieur interrupted the baroness in a voice husky with anger you forget yourselfyou But the baron was well under way
If it is scandal that crowns one a great lady you ARE oneand one of the greatest for you are notoriousalmost as notorious as Jenny Fancy
Cant I learn from the newspapers all your sayings and gestures your amusements your occupations and the toilettes you wear
It is impossible to read of a first performance at a theatre or of a horserace without finding your name coupled with that of Jenny Fancy or Cora Pearl or Ninette Simplon
I should be a very strange husband indeed if I wasnt proud and delighted
Ah
you are a treasure to the reporters
On the day before yesterday the Baroness Trigault skated in the Bois
Yesterday she was driving in her ponycarriage
Today she distinguished herself by her skill at pigeonshooting
Tomorrow she will display herself half nude in some tableaux vivants
On the day after tomorrow she will inaugurate a new style of hairdressing and take part in a comedy
It is always the Baroness Trigault who is the observed of all observers at Vincennes
The Baroness Trigault has lost five hundred louis in betting
The Baroness Trigault uses her lorgnette with charming impertinence
It is she who has declared it proper form to take a drop on returning from the Bois
No one is so famed for form as the baronessand silk merchants have bestowed her name upon a color
People rave of the Trigault bluewhat glory
There are also costumes Trigault for the witty elegant baroness has a host of admirers who follow her everywhere and loudly sing her praises
This is what I a plain honest man read every day in the newspapers
The whole world not only knows how my wife dresses but how she looks en dishabille and how she is formed folks are aware that she has an exquisite foot a divinelyshaped leg and a perfect hand
No one is ignorant of the fact that my wifes shoulders are of dazzling whiteness and that high on the left shoulder there is a most enticing little mole
I had the satisfaction of reading this particular last evening
It is charming upon my word
and I am truly a fortunate man
In the smokingroom Pascal could hear the baroness angrily stamp her foot as she exclaimed It is an outrageous insultyour journalists are most impertinent
Why
Do they ever trouble honest women
They wouldnt trouble me if I had a husband who knew how to make them treat me with respect
The baron laughed a strident nervous laugh which it was not pleasant to hear and which revealed the fact that intense suffering was hidden beneath all this banter
Would you like me to fight a duel then
After twenty years has the idea of ridding yourself of me occurred to you again
I can scarcely believe it
You know too well that you would receive none of my money that I have guarded against that
Besides you would be inconsolable if the newspapers ceased talking about you for a single day
Respect yourself and you will be respected
The publicity you complain of is the last anchor which prevents society from drifting one knows not where
Those who would not listen to the warning voice of honor and conscience are restrained by the fear of a little paragraph which might disclose their shame
Now that a woman no longer has a conscience the newspapers act in place of it
And I think it quite right for it is our only hope of salvation
By the stir in the adjoining room Pascal felt sure that the baroness had stationed herself before the door to prevent her husband from leaving her
Ah
well monsieur she exclaimed I declare to you that I must have Van Klopens twentyeight thousand francs before this evening
I will have them too I am resolved to have them and you will give them to me
Oh
thundered the baron you WILL have themyou will He paused and then after a moments reflection he said Very well
So be it
I will give you this amount but not just now
Still if as you say it is absolutely necessary that you should have it today there is a means of procuring it
Pawn your diamonds for thirty thousand francsI authorize you to do so and I give you my word of honor that I will redeem them within a week
Say will you do this
And as the baroness made no reply he continued You dont answer
shall I tell you why
It is because your diamonds were long since sold and replaced by imitation ones it is because you are head over heels in debt it is because you have stooped so low as to borrow your maids savings it is because you already owe three thousand francs to one of my coachmen it is because our steward lends you money at the rate of thirty or forty per cent
It is false
The baron sneered
You certainly must think me a much greater fool than I really am
he replied
Im not often at home its truethe sight of you exasperates me but I know whats going on
You believe me your dupe but you are altogether mistaken
It is not twentyseven thousand francs you owe Van Klopen but fifty or sixty thousand
However he is careful not to demand payment
If he brought me a bill this morning it was only because you had begged him to do so and because it had been agreed he should give you the money back if I paid him
In short if you require twentyeight thousand francs before tonight it is because M Fernand de Coralth has demanded that sum and because you have promised to give it to him
Leaning against the wall of the smokingroom speechless and motionless holding his breath with his hands pressed upon his heart as if to stop its throbbings Pascal Ferailleur listened
He no longer thought of flying he no longer thought of reproaching himself for his enforced indiscretion
He had lost all consciousness of his position
The name of the Viscount de Coralth thus mentioned in the course of this frightful scene came as a revelation to him
He now understood the meaning of the barons conduct
His visit to the Rue dUlm and his promises of help were all explained
My mother was right he thought the baron hates that miserable viscount mortally
He will do all in his power to assist me
Meanwhile the baroness energetically denied her husbands charges
She swore that she did not know what he meant
What had M de Coralth to do with all this
She commanded her husband to speak more plainlyto explain his odious insinuations
He allowed her to speak for a moment and then suddenly in a harsh sarcastic voice he interrupted her by saying Oh
enough
No more hypocrisy
Why do you try to defend yourself
What matters one crime more
I know only too well that what I say is true and if you desire proofs they shall be in your hands in less than half an hour
It is a long time since I was blindfull twenty years
Nothing concerning you has escaped my knowledge and observation since the cursed day when I discovered the depths of your disgrace and infamysince the terrible evening when I heard you plan to murder me in cold blood
You had grown accustomed to freedom of action while I who had gone off with the first gold seekers was braving a thousand dangers in California so as to win wealth and luxury for you more quickly
Fool that I was
No task seemed too hard or too distasteful when I thought of youand I was always thinking of you
My mind was at peaceI had perfect faith in you
We had a daughter and if a fear or a doubt entered my mind I told myself that the sight of her cradle would drive all evil thoughts from your heart
The adultery of a childless wife may be forgiven or explained but that of a mother never
Fool
idiot
that I was
With what joyous pride on my return after an absence of eighteen months I showed you the treasures I had brought back with me
I had two hundred thousand francs
I said to you as I embraced you It is yours my wellbeloved the source of all my happiness
But you did not care for meI wearied you
You loved another
And while you were deceiving me with your caresses you were with fiendish skill preparing a conspiracy which if it had succeeded would have resulted in my death
I should consider myself amply revenged if I could make you suffer for a single day all the torments that I endured for long months
For this was not all
You had not even the excuse if excuse it be of a powerful allabsorbing passion
Convinced of your treachery I resolved to ascertain everything and I discovered that in my absence you had become a mother
Why didnt I kill you
How did I have the courage to remain silent and conceal what I knew
Ah
it was because by watching you I hoped to discover the cursed bastard and your accomplice
It was because I dreamed of a vengeance as terrible as the offence
I said to myself that the day would come when at any risk you would try to see your child again to embrace her and provide for her future
Fool
fool that I was
You had already forgotten her
When you received news of my intended return she was sent to some foundling asylum or left to die upon some doorstep
Have you ever thought of her
Have you ever asked what has become of her
ever asked yourself if she had needed bread while you have been living in almost regal luxury
ever asked yourself into what depths of vice she may have fallen
Always the same ridiculous accusation
exclaimed the baroness
Yes always
You must know however that this story of a child is only a vile slander
I told you so when you spoke of it to me a dozen years afterward
I have repeated it a thousand times since
The baron uttered a sigh that was very like a sob and without paying any heed to his wifes words he continued If I consented to allow you to remain under my roof it was only for the sake of our daughter
I trembled lest the scandal of a separation should fall upon her
But it was useless suffering on my part
She was as surely lost as you yourself were and it was your work too
What
you blame me for that
Whom ought I to blame then
Who took her to balls and theatres and racesto every place where a young girl ought NOT to be taken
Who initiated her into what you call high life
and who used her as a discreet and easy chaperon
Who married her to a wretch who is a disgrace to the title he bears and who has completed the work of demoralization you began
And what is your daughter today
Her extravagance has made her notorious even among the shameless women who pretend to be leaders of society
She is scarcely twentytwo and there is not a single prejudice left for her to brave
Her husband is the companion of actresses and courtesans her own companions are no betterand in less than two years the million of francs which I bestowed on her as a dowry has been squandered recklessly squanderedfor there isnt a penny of it left
And at this very hour my daughter and my son inlaw are plotting to extort money from me
On the day before yesterdaylisten carefully to thismy soninlaw came to ask me for a hundred thousand francs and when I refused them he threatened if I did not give them to him that he would publish some letters written by my daughterby his wifeto some low scoundrel
I was horrified and gave him what he asked
But that same evening I learned that the husband and wife my daughter and my soninlaw had concocted this vile conspiracy together
Yes I have positive proofs of it
Leaving here and not wishing to return home that day he telegraphed the good news to his wife
But in his delight he made a mistake in the address and the telegram was brought here
I opened it and read Papa has fallen into the trap my darling
I beat my drum and he surrendered at once
Yes that is what he dared to write and sign with his own name and then send to his wifemy daughter
Pascal was absolutely terrified
He wondered if he were not the victim of some absurd nightmareif his senses were not playing him false
He had little conception of the terrible dramas which are constantly enacted in these superb mansions so admired and envied by the passing crowd
He thought that the baroness would be crushedthat she would fall on her knees before her husband
What a mistake
The tone of her voice told him that instead of yielding she was only bent on retaliation
Does your soninlaw do anything worse than you
she exclaimed
How dare you censure himyou who drag your name through all the gambling dens of Europe
Wretch
interrupted the baron wretch
But quickly mastering himself he remarked Yes its true that I gamble
People say That great Baron Trigault is never without cards in his hands
But you know very well that I really hold gambling in horrorthat I loathe it
But when I play I sometimes forgetfor I must forget
I tried drink but it wouldnt drown thought so I had recourse to cards and when the stakes are large and my fortune is imperilled I sometimes lose consciousness of my misery
The baroness gave vent to a cold sneering laugh and in a tone of mocking commiseration she said Poor baron
It is no doubt in the hope of forgetting your sorrows that you spend all your time when you are not gamblingwith a woman named Lia dArgeles
Shes rather pretty
I have seen her several times in the Bois Be silent
exclaimed the baron be silent
Dont insult an unfortunate woman who is a thousand times better than yourself
And feeling that he could endure no morethat he could no longer restrain his passion he cried Out of my sight
Go
or I shant be responsible for my acts
Pascal heard a chair move the floor creak and a moment afterward a lady passed quickly through the smokingroom
How was it that she did not perceive him
No doubt because she was greatly agitated in spite of her bravado
And besides he was standing a little back in the shade
But he saw her and his brain reeled
Good Lord
what a likeness
he murmured
III
It was as if he had seen an apparition and he was vainly striving to drive away a terrible mysterious fear when a heavy footfall made the floor of the diningroom creak anew
The noise restored him to consciousness of his position
It is the baron
he thought he is coming this way
If he finds me here I am lost he will never consent to help me
A man would never forgive another man for hearing what I have just heard
Why should he not try to make his escape
The card bearing the name of Maumejan would be no proof of his visit
He could see the baron somewhere else some other dayelsewhere than at his own house so that he need not fear the recognition of the servants
These thoughts flashed through his mind and he was about to fly when a harsh cry held him spellbound
Baron Trigault was standing on the threshold
His emotion as is almost always the case with corpulent people was evinced by a frightful distortion of his features
His face was transformed his lips had become perfectly white and his eyes seemed to be starting from their sockets
How came you here
he asked in a husky voice
Your servants ushered me into this room
Who are you
What
monsieur dont you recognize me
rejoined Pascal who in his agitation forgot that the baron had seen him only twice before
He forgot the absence of his beard his almost ragged clothing and all the precautions he had taken to render recognition impossible
I have never met any person named Maumejan said the baron
Ah
monsieur thats not my name
Have you forgotten the innocent man who was caught in that infamous snare set for him by the Viscount de Coralth
Yes yes replied the baron I remember you now
And then recollecting the terrible scene that had just taken place in the adjoining room How long have you been here
he asked
Should Pascal tell a falsehood or confess the truth
He hesitated but his hesitation lasted scarcely the tenth part of a second
I have been here about half an hour he replied
The barons livid cheeks suddenly became purple his eyes glittered and it seemed by his threatening gesture as if he were strongly tempted to murder this man who had discovered the terrible disgraceful secrets of his domestic life
But it was a mere flash of energy
The terrible ordeal which he had just passed through had exhausted him mentally and physically and it was in a faltering voice that he resumed Then you have not lost a worda word of what was said in the other room
Not a word
The baron sank on to the divan
So the knowledge of my disgrace is no longer confined to myself
he exclaimed
A strangers eye has penetrated the depths of misery I have fallen into
The secret of my wretchedness and shame is mine no longer
Oh monsieur monsieur
interrupted Pascal
Before I recross the threshold of your home all shall have been forgotten
I swear it by all that is most sacred
He had raised his hand as if to take a solemn oath when the baron caught hold of it and pressing it with sorrowful gratitude exclaimed I believe you
You are a man of honorI only needed to see your home to be convinced of that
You will not laugh at my misfortunes or my misery
He must have been suffering frightfully for big tears rolled slowly down his cheeks
What have I done my God
that I should be so cruelly punished
he continued
I have always been generous and charitable and ready to help all who applied to me
I am utterly alone
I have a wife and a daughterbut they hate me
They long for my death which would give them possession of my wealth
What torture
For months together I dared not eat a morsel of food either in my own house or in the house of my soninlaw
I feared poison and I never partook of a dish until I had seen my daughter or my wife do so
To prevent a crime I was obliged to resort to the strangest expedients
I made a will and left my property in such a way that if I die my family will not receive one penny
So they now have an interest in prolonging my life
As he spoke he sprang up with an almost frenzied air and seizing Pascal by the arm again continued
Nor is this all
This womanmy wifeyou knowyou have heard the extent of her shame and degradation
Ah well
I love her
Pascal recoiled with an exclamation of mingled horror and consternation
This amazes you eh
rejoined the baron
It is indeed incomprehensible monstrousbut it is the truth
It is to gratify her desire for luxury that I have toiled to amass millions
If I purchased a title which is absurd and ridiculous it was only because I wished to satisfy her vanity
Do what she may I can only see in her the chaste and beautiful wife of our early married life
It is cowardly absurd ridiculousI realize it but my love is stronger than my reason or my will
I love her madly passionately I cannot tear her from my heart
So speaking he sank sobbing on to the divan again
Was this indeed the frivolous and jovial Baron Trigault whom Pascal had seen at Madame dArgeless housethe man of selfsatisfied mien and superb assurance the goodnatured cynic the frequenter of gamblingdens
Alas yes
But the baron whom the world knew was only a comedian this was the real man
After a little while he succeeded in controlling his emotion and in a comparatively calm voice he exclaimed But it is useless to distract ones mind with an incurable evil
Let us speak of yourself M Ferailleur
To what do I owe the honor of this visit
To your own kind offer monsieur and the hope that you will help me in refuting this slander and wreaking vengeance upon those who have ruined me
Oh
yes I will help you in that to the full extent of my power exclaimed the baron
But experience reminded him that confidential disclosures ought not to be made with the doors open so he rose shut them and returning to Pascal said Explain in what way I can be of service to you monsieur
It was not without many misgivings that Pascal had presented himself at the barons house but after what he had heard he felt no further hesitation he could speak with perfect freedom
It is quite unnecessary for me to tell you Monsieur le Baron he began that the cards which made me win were inserted in the pack by M de Coralththat is proven beyond question and whatever the consequences may be I shall have my revenge
But before striking him I wish to reach the man whose instrument he was
What
you suppose I dont supposeI am sure that M de Coralth acted in obedience to the instructions of some other scoundrel whose courage does not equal his meanness
Perhaps so
I think he would shrink from nothing in the way of rascality
But who could have employed him in this vile work of dishonoring an honest man
The Marquis de Valorsay
On hearing this name the baron bounded to his feet
Impossible
he exclaimed absolutely impossible
M de Valorsay is incapable of the villainy you ascribe to him
What do I say he is even above suspicion
I have known him for years and I have never met a more loyal more honorable or more courageous man
He is one of my few trusted friends we see each other almost every day
I am expecting a visit from him even now
Still it was he who incited M de Coralth to do the deed
But why
What could have been his object
To win a young girl whom I love
Sheloved me and he saw that I was an obstacle
He put me out of the way more surely than if he had murdered me
If I died she might mourn for me dishonored she would spurn me Is Valorsay so madly in love with the girl then
I think he cares but very little for her
Then why She is the heiress of several millions
It was evident that this explanation did not shake Baron Trigaults faith in his friend
But the marquis has an income of a hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand francs said he that is an allsufficient justification
With his fortune and his name he is in a position to choose his wife from among all the heiresses of France
Why should he address his attentions in particular to the woman you love
Ah
if he were poorif his fortune were impairedif he felt the need of regilding his escutcheon like my soninlaw He paused there was a rap at the door
The baron called out Come in and a valet appeared and informed his master that the Marquis de Valorsay wished to speak with him
It was the enemy
Pascals features were distorted with rage but he did not stirhe did not utter a word
Ask the marquis into the next room said the baron
I will join him there at once
Then as the servant retired the baron turned to Pascal and said Well M Ferailleur do you divine my intentions
I think so monsieur
You probably intend me to hear the conversation you are going to have with M de Valorsay
Exactly
I shall leave the door open and you can listen
This word listen was uttered without bitterness or even reproach and yet Pascal could not help blushing and hanging his head
I wish to prove to you that your suspicions are without foundation pursued the baron
Rest assured that I shall prove this conclusively
I will conduct the conversation in the form of a crossexamination and after the marquiss departure you will be obliged to confess that you were wrong
Or you that I am right
So be it
Any one is liable to be mistaken and I am not obstinate
He was about to leave the room when Pascal detained him
I scarcely know how to testify my gratitude even now monsieur and yetif I daredif I did not fear to abuse your kindness I should ask one more favor
Speak Monsieur Ferailleur
It is this I do not know the Marquis de Valorsay and if instead of leaving the door wide open you would partially close it I should hear as distinctly and I could also see him
Agreed replied the baron
And opening the door he passed into the diningroom with his right hand cordially extended and saying in his most genial tones Excuse me my dear friend for keeping you waiting
I received your letter this morning and I was expecting you but some unexpected business required my attention just now
Are you quite well
As the baron entered the room the marquis had stepped quickly forward to meet him
Either he was inspired with fresh hope or else he had wonderful powers of selfcontrol for never had he looked more calmnever had his face evinced haughtier indifference more complete satisfaction with himself and greater contempt for others
He was dressed with even more than usual care and in perfect taste as well moreover his valet had surpassed himself in dressing his hairfor one would have sworn that his locks were still luxuriant
If he experienced any secret anxiety it only showed itself in a slightly increased stiffness of his right legthe limb broken in hunting
I ought rather to inquire concerning your own health he remarked
You seem greatly disturbed your cravat is untied
And pointing to the broken china scattered about the floor he added On seeing this I asked myself if an accident had not happened
The baroness was taken suddenly ill at the breakfast table
Her fainting fit startled me a little
But it was a mere trifle
She has quite recovered already and you may rely upon her applauding your victory at Vincennes today
She has I dont know how many hundred louis staked upon your horses
The marquiss countenance assumed an expression of cordial regret
I am very sorry upon my word
he exclaimed
But I shant take part in the races at Vincennes
I have withdrawn my horses
And in future I shall have nothing to do with racing
Nonsense
It is the truth however
I have been led to this determination by the infamous slander which has been circulated respecting me
This answer was a mere trifle but it somewhat shook Baron Trigaults confidence
You have been slandered
he muttered
Abominably
Last Sunday the best horse in my stables Domingo came in third
He was the favorite in the ring
You can understand the rest
I have been accused of manoeuvering to have my own horse beaten
People have declared that it was my interest he should be beaten and that I had an understanding with my jockey to that effect
This is an everyday occurrence I know very well but as regards myself it is none the less an infamous lie
Who has dared to circulate such a report
Oh how can I tell
It is a fact however that the story has been circulated everywhere but in such a cautious manner that there is no way of calling the authors to account
They have even gone so far as to say that this piece of knavery brought me in an enormous sum and that I used Rochecottes Kervaulieus and Coralths names in betting against my own horse
The barons agitation was so great that M de Valorsay observed it though he did not understand the cause
Living in the same society with the Baroness Trigault and knowing her story he thought that Coralths name might perhaps have irritated the baron
And so he quickly continued dont be surprised if during the coming week you see the sale of my horses announced
What
you are going to sell All my horsesyes baron
I have nineteen and it will be very strange if I dont get eight or ten thousand louis for the lot
Domingo alone is worth more than forty thousand francs
To talk of sellingof realizing something you possessrings ominously in peoples ears
The person who talks of selling proclaims his need of moneyand often his approaching ruin
It will save you at least a hundred and fifty or sixty thousand francs a year observed the baron
Double it and you wont come up to the mark
Ah
my dear baron you have yet to learn that there is nothing so ruinous as a racing stable
Its worse than gambling and women in comparison are a real economy
Ninette costs me less than Domingo with his jockey his trainer and his grooms
My manager declares that the twentythree thousand francs I won last year cost me at least fifty thousand
Was he boasting or was he speaking the truth
The baron was engaged in a rapid calculation
What does Valorsay spend a year
he was saying to himself
Let us say two hundred and fifty thousand francs for his stable forty thousand francs for Ninette Simplon eighty thousand for his household expenses and at least thirty thousand for personal matters travelling and play
All this amounts to something like four hundred and thirty thousand francs a year
Does his income equal that sum
Certainly not
Then he must have been living on the principalhe is ruined
Meanwhile the marquis gayly continued You see Im going to make a change in my mode of life
Ah
it surprises you
But one must make an end of it sooner or later
I begin to find a bachelor life not so very pleasant after all there is rheumatism in prospect and my digestion is becoming impairedin short I feel that it is time for marriage baron andI am about to marry
You
Yes I
What havent you heard of it yet
It has been talked of at the club for three days or more
No this is the first intimation I have received of it
It is true however that I have not been to the club for three days
I have made a wager with KamiBey you knowthat rich Turkand as our sittings are eight or ten hours long we play in his apartments at the Grand Hotel
And so you are to be married the baron continued after a slight pause
Ah well
I know one person who wont be pleased
Who pray
Ninette Simplon
M de Valorsay laughed heartily
As if that would make any difference to me
he exclaimed
And then in a most confidential manner he resumed She will soon be consoled
Ninette Simplon is a shrewd girla girl whom I have always suspected of having an account book in place of a heart
I know she has at least three hundred thousand francs safely invested her furniture and diamonds are worth as much more
Why should she regret me
Add to this that I have promised her fifty thousand francs to dry her tears with on my weddingday and you will understand that she really longs to see me married
I understand replied the baron Ninette Simplon wont trouble you
But I cant understand why you should talk of economy on the eve of a marriage which will no doubt double your fortune for Im sure you wont surrender your liberty without good and substantial reasons
You are mistaken
How mistaken
Well I wont hesitate to confess to you my dear baron that the girl I am about to marry hasnt a penny of her own
My future wife has no dowry save her black eyesbut they are certainly superb ones
This assertion seemed to disprove Pascals statements
Can it really be you who are talking in this strain
cried the baron
You a practical worldly man give way to such a burst of sentiment
Well yes
The baron opened his eyes in astonishment
Ah
then you adore your future bride
Adore only feebly expresses my feelings
I must be dreaming
Valorsay shrugged his shoulders with the air of a man who has made up his mind to accept the banter of his friends and in a tone of mingled sentimentality and irony he said I know that its absurd and that I shall be the laughingstock of my acquaintances
Still it doesnt matter I have never been coward enough to hide my feelings
Im in love my dear baron as madly in love as a young collegiansufficiently in love to watch my ladys house at night even when I have no possible hope of seeing her
I thought myself blase I boasted of being invulnerable
Well one fine morning I woke up with the heart of a youth of twenty beating in my breasta heart which trembled at the slightest glance from the girl I love and sent purple flushes to my face
Naturally I tried to reason with myself
I was ashamed of my weakness but the more clearly I showed myself my folly the more obstinate my heart became
And perhaps my folly is not such a great one after all
Such perfect beauty united with such modesty grace and nobility of soul such passion candor and talent cannot be met twice in a lifetime
I intend to leave Paris
We shall first of all go to Italy my wife and I
After a while we shall return and install ourselves at Valorsay like two turtledoves
Upon my word my imagination paints a charming picture of the calm and happy life we shall lead there
I dont deserve such good fortune
I must have been born under a lucky star
Had he been less engrossed in his narrative he would have heard the sound of a stifled oath in the adjoining room and had he been less absorbed in the part he was playing he would have observed a cloud on his companions brow
The baron was a keen observer and he had detected a false ring in this apparently vehement outburst of passion
I understand it now my dear marquis said he you have met the descendant of some illustrious but impoverished family
You are wrong
My future bride has no other name than her Christian name of Marguerite
It is a regular romance then
You are quite right it is a romance
Were you acquainted with the Count de Chalusse who died a few days ago
No but I have often heard him spoken of
Well it is his daughter whom I am about to marryhis illegitimate daughter
The baron started
Excuse me said he M de Chalusse was immensely rich and he was a bachelor
How does it happen then that his daughter even though she be his illegitimate child should find herself penniless
A mere chancea fatality
M de Chalusse died very suddenly he had no time to make a will or to acknowledge his daughter
But why had he not taken some precautions
A formal recognition of his daughter was attended by too many difficulties and even dangers
Mademoiselle Marguerite had been abandoned by her mother when only five or six months old it is only a few years since M de Chalusse after a thousand vain attempts at last succeeded in finding her
It was no longer on Pascals account but on his own that Baron Trigault listened with breathless attention
How very strange he exclaimed in default of something better to say
How very strange
Isnt it
It is as good as a novel
Would it beindiscreet To inquire
Certainly not
The count told me the whole story without entering into particularsyou understand
When he was quite young M de Chalusse became enamoured of a charming young lady whose husband had gone to tempt fortune in America
Being an honest woman she resisted the counts advances for awhilea very little while but in less than a year after her husbands departure she gave birth to a pretty little daughter Mademoiselle Marguerite
But then why had the husband gone to America
Yes faltered the baron whywhy indeed
Everything was progressing finely when M de Chalusse was in his turn obliged to start for Germany having been informed that a sister of his who had fled from the paternal roof with nobody knows who had been seen there
He had been absent some four months or so when one morning the post brought him a letter from his pretty mistress who wrote We are lost
My husband is at Marseilles he will be here tomorrow
Never attempt to see me again
Fear everything from him
Farewell
On receiving this letter M de Chalusse flung himself into a postchaise and returned to Paris
He was determined absolutely determined to have his daughter
But he arrived too late
On hearing of her husbands return the young wife had lost her head
She had but one thoughtto conceal her fault at any cost and one night being completely disguised she left her child on a doorstep in the vicinity of the central markets The marquis suddenly paused in his story to exclaim Why what is the matter with you my dear baron
What is the matter
Are you ill
Shall I ring
The baron was as pale as if the last drop of blood had been drawn from his veins and there were dark purple circles about his eyes
Still on being questioned he managed to answer in a choked voice but not without a terrible effort Nothing
It is nothing
A mere trifle
It will be over in a moment
It IS over
Still his limbs trembled so much that he could not stand and he sank on to a chair murmuring I entreat you marquiscontinue
It is very interestingvery interesting indeed
M de Valorsay resumed his narrative
The husband was incontestably an artless fellow but he was also it appears a man of remarkable energy and determination
Having somehow ascertained that his wife had given birth to a child in his absence he moved heaven and earth not only to discover the child but its father also
He had sworn to kill them both and he was a man to keep his vow unmoved by a thought of the guillotine
And if you require a proof of his strength of character here it is He said nothing to his wife on the subject he did not utter a single reproach he treated her exactly as he had done before his absence
But he watched her or employed others to watch her both and night convinced that she would finally commit some act of imprudence which would give him the clue he wanted
Fortunately she was very shrewd
She soon discovered that her husband knew everything and she warned M de Chalusse thus saving his life
It is not at all remarkable that the Marquis de Valorsay should have failed to see any connection between his narrative and the barons agitation
What possible connection could there be between opulent Baron Trigault and the poor devil who went to seek his fortune in America
What imaginable connection could there be between the confirmed gambler who was KamiBeys companion Lia dArgeless friend and the husband who for ten long years had pursued the man who by seducing his wife had robbed him of all the happiness of life
Another point that would have dispelled any suspicions on the marquiss part was that he had found the baron greatly agitated on arriving and that he now seemed to be gradually regaining his composure
So he continued his story in his customary light mocking tone
It is the perfection of good taste and high breedingproper form indeed not to be astonished or moved by anything in fact to sneer at everything and hold ones self quite above the emotions which disturb the minds of plebeians
Thus the marquis continued I am necessarily compelled to omit many particulars my dear baron
The count was not very explicit when he reached this part of his story but in spite of his reticence I learned that he had been tricked in his turn that certain papers had been stolen from him and that he had been defrauded in many ways by his inamorata
I also know that M de Chalusses whole life was haunted by the thought of the husband he had wronged
He felt a presentiment that he would die by this mans hand
He saw danger on every side
If he went out alone in the evening which was an exceedingly rare occurrence he turned the street corners with infinite caution it seemed to him that he could always see the gleam of a poniard or a pistol in the shade
I should never have believed in this constant terror on the part of a really brave man if he had not confessed it to me with his own lips
Ten or twelve years passed before he dared to make the slightest attempt to find his daughter so much did he fear to arouse his enemys attention
It was not until he had discovered that the husband had become discouraged and had discontinued his search that the count began his
It was a long and arduous one but at last it succeeded thanks to the assistance of a clever scoundrel named Fortunat
The baron with difficulty repressed a movement of eager curiosity and remarked What a peculiar name
And his first name is Isidore
Ah
hes a smoothtongued scoundrel a rascal of the most dangerous kind who richly deserves to be in jail
How it is that he is allowed to prosecute his dishonorable calling I cant understand but it is none the less true that he does follow it and without the slightest attempt at concealment at an office he has on the Place de la Bourse
This name and address were engraved upon the barons memory never to be effaced
However resumed M de Valorsay the poor count was fated to have no peace
The husband had scarcely ceased to torment him he had scarcely begun to breathe freely when the wife attacked him in her turn
She must have been one of those vile and despicable women who make a man hate the entire sex
Pretending that the count had turned her from the path of duty and destroyed her life and happiness she lost no opportunity of tormenting him
She would not allow M de Chalusse to keep the child with him nor would she consent to his adopting the girl
She declared it an act of imprudence which would surely set her husband upon the track sooner or later
And when the count announced his intention of legally adopting the child in spite of her protests she declared that rather than allow it she would confess everything to her husband
The count was a patient man sneered the baron
Not so patient as you may suppose
His submission was due to some secret cause which he never confided to me
There must have been some great crime under all this
In any case the poor count found it impossible to escape this terrible woman
He took refuge at Cannes but she followed him
He travelled through Italy for I dont know how many months under an assumed name but all in vain
He was at last compelled to conceal his daughter in some provincial convent
During the last few months of his life he obtained peacethat is to say he bought it
This ladys husband must either be very poor or exceedingly stingy and as she was exceedingly fond of luxury M de Chalusse effected a compromise by giving her a large sum monthly and also by paying her dress makers bills
The baron sprang to his feet with a passionate exclamation
The vile wretch
he said
But he quickly reseated himself and the exclamation astonished M de Valorsay so little that he quietly concluded by saying And this is the reason baron why my beloved Marguerite the future Marquise de Valorsay has no dowry
The baron cast a look of positive anguish at the door of the smokingroom
He had heard a slight movement there and he trembled with fear lest Pascal maddened with anger and jealousy should rush in and throw himself upon the marquis
Plainly enough this perilous situation could not last much longer
The barons own powers of selfcontrol and dissimulation were almost exhausted and so postponing until another time the many questions he still wished to ask M de Valorsay he made haste to check these confidential disclosures
Upon my word he exclaimed with a forced laugh I was expecting something quite different
This affair begins like a genuine romance and ends as everything ends nowadays in money
IV
As a millionaire and a gambler Baron Trigault enjoyed all sorts of privileges
He assumed the right to be brutal illbred cynical and bold to be one of those persons who declare that folks must take them as they find them
But his rudeness now was so thoroughly offensive that under any other circumstances the marquis would have resented it
However he had special reasons for preserving his temper so he decided to laugh
Yes these stories always end in the same way baron said he
You havent touched a card this morning and I know your hands are itching
Excuse me for making you waste precious time as you say but what you have just heard was only a necessary preface
Only a preface
Yes but dont be discouraged
I have arrived at the object of my visit now
As Baron Trigault was supposed to enjoy an income of at least eight hundred thousand francs a year he received in the course of a twelvemonth at least a million applications for money or help and for this reason he had not an equal for detecting a coming appeal
Good heavens
he thought Valorsay is going to ask me for money
In fact he felt certain that the marquiss pretended carelessness concealed real embarrassment and that it was difficult for him to find the words he wanted
So I am about to marry M de Valorsay resumedI wish to break off my former life to turn over a new leaf
And now the wedding gifts the two fetes that I propose giving the repairs at Valorsay and the honeymoon with my wifeall these things will cost a nice little sum
A nice little sum indeed
Ah well
as Im not going to wed an heiress I fear I shall run a trifle short
The matter was worrying me a little when I thought of you
I said to myself The baron who always has money at his disposal will no doubt let me have the use of five thousand louis for a year
The barons eyes were fixed upon his companions face
Zounds
he exclaimed in a halfgrieved halfpetulant tone I havent the amount
It was not disappointment that showed itself on the marquiss face it was absolute despair quickly concealed
But the baron had detected it and he realized his applicants urgent need
He felt certain that M de Valorsay was financially ruinedand yet as it did not suit his plans to refuse he hastily added When I say I havent that amount I mean that I havent got it on hand just at this moment
But I shall have it within fortyeight hours and if you are at home at this time on the day after tomorrow I will send you one of my agents who will arrange the matter with you
A moment before the marquis had allowed his consternation to show itself but this time he knew how to conceal the joy that filled his soul
So it was in the most indifferent manner as if the affair were one of trivial importance that he thanked the baron for being so obliging
Plainly enough he now longed to make his escape and indeed after rattling off a few commonplace remarks
he rose to his feet and took his leave exclaiming Till the day after tomorrow then
The baron sank into an armchair completely overcome
A martyr to a passion that was stronger than reason itself the victim of a fatal love which he had not been able to drive from his heart Baron Trigault had passed many terrible hours but never had he been so completely crushed as at this moment when chance revealed the secret which he had vainly pursued for years
The old wounds in his heart opened afresh and his sufferings were poignant beyond description
All his efforts to save this woman whom he at once loved and hated from the depths of degradation had proved unavailing
And she has extorted money from the Count de Chalusse he thought she sold him the right to adopt their own daughter
And so strange are the workings of the human heart that this circumstance trivial in comparison with many others drove the unfortunate baron almost frantic with rage
What did it avail him that he had become one of the richest men in Paris
He allowed his wife eight thousand francs a month almost one hundred thousand francs a year merely for her dresses and fancies
Not a quarterday passed but what he paid her debts to a large amount and in spite of all this she had sunk so low as to extort money from a man who had once loved her
What can she do with it all
muttered the baron overcome with sorrow and indignation
How can she succeed in spending the income of several millions
A name the name of Ferdinand de Coralth rose to his lips but he did not pronounce it
He saw Pascal emerging from the smoking room and though he had forgotten the young advocates very existence his appearance now restored him to a consciousness of reality
Ah well
M
Ferailleur
he said like a man suddenly aroused from some terrible nightmare
Pascal tried to make some reply but he was unable to do sosuch a flood of incoherent thoughts was seething and foaming in his brain
Did you hear M de Valorsay
continued the baron
Now we know beyond the possibility of doubt who Mademoiselle Marguerites mother is
What is to be done
What would you do in my place
Ah monsieur
how can I tell
Wouldnt your first thought be of vengeance
It is mine
But upon whom can I wreak my vengeance
Upon the Count de Chalusse
He is dead
Upon my wife
Yes I might do so but I lack the courageMademoiselle Marguerite remains
But she is innocent monsieur she has never wronged you
The baron did not seem to hear this exclamation
And to make Mademoiselle Marguerites life one long misery said he I need only favor her marriage with the marquis
Ah he would make her cruelly expiate the crime of her birth
But you wont do so
cried Pascal in a transport it would be shameful I wont allow it
Never I swear before high Heaven
never while I live shall Valorsay marry Marguerite
He may perhaps vanquish me in the coming struggle he may lead her to the threshold of the church but there he will find mearmedand I will have justicehuman justice in default of legal satisfaction
And afterward the law may take its course
The baron looked at him with deep emotion
Ah you know what it is to love
he exclaimed and in a hollow voice he added and thus it was that I loved Marguerites mother
The breakfasttable had not been cleared and a large decanter of water was still standing on it
The baron poured out two large glasses which he drained with feverish avidity and then he began to walk aimlessly about the room
Pascal held his peace
It seemed to him that his own destiny was being decided in this mans mind that his whole future depended upon the determination he arrived at
A prisoner awaiting the verdict of the jury could not have suffered more intense anxiety
At last when a minute which seemed a century had elapsed the baron paused
Now as before M Ferailleur he said roughly Im for you and with you
Give me your handthats right
Honest people ought to protect and assist one another when scoundrels assail them
We will reinstate you in public esteem monsieur
We will unmask Coralth and we will crush Valorsay if we find that he is really the instigator of the infamous plot that ruined you
What monsieur
Can you doubt it after your conversation with him
The baron shook his head
Ive no doubt but what Valorsay is ruined financially said he
I am certain that my hundred thousand francs will be lost forever if I lend them to him
I would be willing to swear that he bet against his own horse and prevented the animal from winning as he is accused of doing
You must see then Excuse meall this does NOT explain the great discrepancy between your allegations and his story
You assure me that he cares nothing whatever for Mademoiselle Marguerite he pretends that he adores her
Yes monsieur yesthe scoundrel dared to say so
Ah
if I had not been deterred by a fear of losing my revenge
I understand but allow me to conclude
According to you Mademoiselle Marguerite possesses several millions
According to him she hasnt a penny of her own
Which is right
I believe he is
His desire to borrow a hundred thousand francs of me proves it and besides he wouldnt have come this morning to tell me a falsehood which would be discovered tomorrow
Still if he is telling the truth it is impossible to explain the foul conspiracy you have suffered by
This objection had previously presented itself to Pascals mind and he had found an explanation which seemed to him a plausible one
M de Chalusse was not dead said he when M de Coralth and M de Valorsay decided on this plan of ridding themselves of me
Consequently Mademoiselle Marguerite was still an heiress
Thats true but the very day after the commission of the crime the accomplices must have discovered that it could do them no good so why have they still persisted in their scheme
Pascal tried to find a satisfactory answer but failed
There must be some iniquitous mystery in this affair which neither you nor I suspect remarked the baron
That is exactly what my mother told me
Ah
thats Madame Ferailleurs opinion
Then it is a good one
Come let us reason a little
Mademoiselle Marguerite loved you you say
Yes
And she has suddenly broken off the engagement
She wrote to me that the Count de Chalusse extorted from her a promise on his deathbed that she would marry the Marquis de Valorsay
The baron sprang to his feet
Stop he criedstop
We now have a clue to the truth perhaps
Ah
so Mademoiselle Marguerite has written to you that M de Chalusse commanded her to marry the marquis
Then the count must have been fully restored to consciousness before he breathed his last
On the other hand Valorsay pretends that Mademoiselle Marguerite is left without resources simply because the count died too suddenly to be able to write or to sign a couple of lines
Can you reconcile these two versions of the affair M Ferailleur
Certainly not
Then which version is false
We must ascertain that point
When shall you see Mademoiselle Marguerite again
She has requested me NEVER to try to see her again
Very well
She must be disobeyed
You must discover some way of seeing her without anyones knowledge
She is undoubtedly watched so dont write on any account
He reflected for a moment and then added We shall perhaps become morally certain of Valorsays and Coralths guilt but theres a wide difference between this and the establishment of their guilt by material proofs
Two scoundrels who league to ruin an honest man dont sign a contract to that effect before a notary
Proofs
Ah
where shall we find them
We must gain an intimate knowledge of Valorsays private life
The best plan would be to find some man devoted to our interests who would watch him and insinuate himself into his confidence
Pascal interrupted the baron with an eager gesture
Hope glittered in his eyes
Yes
he exclaimed yes it is necessary that M de Valorsay should be watched by a man of quick perceptiona man clever enough to make himself useful to the marquis and capable of rendering him an important service in case of need
I will be the man monsieur if you will allow me
The thought occurred to me just now while I was listening to you
You promised to send some one to Valorsays house with money
I entreat you to allow me to take the place of the man you intended to send
The marquis doesnt know me and I am sufficiently sure of myself to promise you that I will not betray my identity
I will present myself as your agent he will give me his confidence
I shall take him money or fair promises I shall be well received and I have a plan He was interrupted by a rap at the door
The next moment a footman entered and informed his master that a messenger wished to speak to him on urgent business
Let him come in said the baron
It was Job Madame Lia dArgeless confidential servant who entered the room
He bowed respectfully and with an air of profound mystery exclaimed I have been looking for the baron everywhere
I was ordered by madame not to return without him
Very well said M Trigault
I will go with you at once
V How was it that a clever man like M Fortunat made such a blunder as to choose a Sunday and a racing Sunday too to call on M Wilkie
His anxiety might explain the mistake but it did not justify it
He felt certain that under any other circumstances he would not have been dismissed so cavalierly
He would at least have been allowed to develop his proposals and then who knows what might have happened
But the races had interfered with his plans
M Wilkie had been compelled to attend to Pompier de Nanterre that famous steeplechaser of which he owned onethird part and he had moreover to give orders to the jockey whose lord and master he was to an equal extent
These were sacred duties since Wilkies share in a racehorse constituted his only claim to a footing in fashionable society
But it was a strong claima claim that justified the display of whips and spurs that decorated his apartments in the Rue du Helder and allowed him to aspire to the character of a sporting man
Wilkie really imagined that folks were waiting for him at Vincennes and that the fete would not be complete without his presence
Still when he presented himself inside the enclosure a cigar in his mouth and his racing card dangling from his buttonhole he was obliged to confess that his entrance did not create much of a sensation
An astonishing bit of news had imparted unusual excitement to the ring
People were eagerly discussing the Marquis de Valorsays sudden determination to pay forfeit and withdraw his horses from the contest and the best informed declared that in the bettingrooms the evening before he had openly announced his intention of selling his racing stable
If the marquis had hoped that by adopting this course he would silence the suspicions which had been aroused he was doomed to grievous disappointment
The rumor that he had secretly bet against his own horse Domingo on the previous Sunday and that he had given orders not to let the animal win the race was steadily gaining credence
Large sums had been staked on Domingos success
He had been the favorite in the betting ring and the losers were by no means pleased
Some declared that they had seen the jockey hold Domingo back and they insisted that it was necessary to make an example and disqualify both the marquis and his jockey
Still one weighty circumstance pleaded in M de Valorsays favorhis fortune or at least the fortune he was supposed to possess
Why should such a rich man stoop to cheat
asked his defenders
To put money into ones pocket in this way is even worse than to cheat at cards
Besides its impossible
Valorsay is above such contemptible charges
He is a perfect gentleman
Perhaps so replied the skeptical bystanders
But people said exactly the same of Croisenois of the Duc de H and Baron P who were finally convicted of the same rascality that Valorsay is accused of
Its an infamous slander
If he had been inclined to cheat he could have easily diverted suspicion
He would have let Domingo come in second not third
If he were not guilty and afraid of detection he wouldnt pay forfeit today nor sell his horses
He only retires from the turf because hes going to marry Nonsense
Thats no reason whatever
Like all gamblers the frequenters of the turf are distrustful and inclined to be quarrelsome
No one is above their suspicions when they lose nor above their wrath when they are duped
And this Domingo affair united all the losers against Valorsay they formed a little battalion of enemies who were no doubt powerless for the time being but who were ready to take a startling revenge whenever a good opportunity presented itself
Naturally enough M Wilkie sided with the marquis whom he had heard his friend M de Coralth speak of on several occasions
Accuse the dear marquis
he exclaimed
Its contemptible outrageous
Why only last evening he said to me My good friend Domingos defeat cost me two thousand louis
M de Valorsay had said nothing of the kind for the very good reason that he did not even know Wilkie by sight still no one paid much heed to the assertion whereat Wilkie felt vexed and resolved to turn his attention to his jockey
The latter was a lazy worthless fellow who had been dismissed from every stable he had previously served in and who swindled and robbed the young gentlemen who employed him without either limit or shame
Although he made them pay him a very high salary something like eight thousand francs a yearon the plea that it was most repugnant to his feelings to act as a groom trainer and jockey at the same time he regularly every month presented them with fabulous bills from the grain merchant the veterinary surgeon and the harnessmaker
In addition he regularly sold Pompiers oats in order to obtain liquor and in fact the poor animal was so nearly starved that he could scarcely stand on his legs
The jockey ascribed the horses extreme thinness to a system of rigorous training and the owners did not question the statement in the least
He had made them believe and they in turn had made many others believe that Pompier de Nanterre would certainly win such and such a race and trusting in this fallacious promise they risked their money on the poor animal and lost it
In point of fact this jockey would have been the happiest mortal in the world if such things as steeplechases had never existed
In the first place he judged with no little reason that it was dangerous to leap hurdles on such an animal as Pompier and secondly nothing irritated him so much as to be obliged to promenade with his three employers in turn
But how could he refuse since he knew that if these young men hired him it was chiefly or only in view of displaying themselves in his company
It afforded them untold satisfaction to walk to and fro along the course in front of the grand stand with their jockey in his orange jacket with green sleeves
They were firmly convinced that he reflected enormous credit upon them and their hearts swelled with joy at the thought of the envy they no doubt inspired
This conviction gave rise indeed to terrible quarrels in which each of the three owners was wont to accuse the others of monopolizing the jockey
On this occasion M Wilkiebeing fortunate enough to arrive the firstimmediately repaired to Pompier de Nanterres stall
Never had circumstances been more favorable for a display of the animals speed
The day was magnificent the stands were crowded and thousands of eager spectators were pushing and jostling one another beyond the ropes which limited the course
M Wilkie seemed to be everywhere he showed himself in a dozen different places at once always followed by his jockey whom he ordered about in a loud voice with many excited gesticulations
And how great his delight was when as he passed through the crowd he heard people exclaim That gentleman has a racing stable
His horses are going to compete
What bliss thrilled his heart when he overheard the admiring exclamation of some worthy shopkeeper who was greatly impressed by the gay silk jacket and the top boots
But unfortunately this happiness could not last forever
His partners arrived and claimed the jockey in their turn
So M Wilkie left the course and strolled about among the carriages until at last he found an equipage which was occupied by the young ladies who had accepted his invitation to supper the evening before and who were now making a profuse display of the very yellowest hair they possessed
This afforded him another opportunity of attracting public attention and to giving proofs of his form for he had not filled the box of his carriage with champagne for nothing
At last the decisive moment came and he made himself conspicuous by shouting
Now
Now
Here he is
Look
Bravo Pompier
One hundred on Pompier
But alas
poor Pompier de Nanterre fell exhausted before half the distance was accomplished and that evening Wilkie described his defeat with a profusion of technical terms that inspired the uninitiated with the deepest awe
What a disaster my friends he exclaimed
Pompier de Nanterre an incomparable steeplechaser to break down in such a fashion
And beaten by whom
My Mustapha an outsider without any record whatever
The ring was intensely excitedand I was simply crazed
However his defeat did not affect him very deeply
It was forgotten at thought of the inheritance which his friend Coralth had spoken to him about
And tomorrow M de Coralth would tell him the secret
He had only twenty hours longer to wait
To morrow
tomorrow
he said to himself again and again with a thrill of mingled joy and impatience
And what bright visions of future glory haunted him
He saw himself the possessor of a magnificent stud of sufficient wealth to gratify every fancy he would splash mud upon all the passersby and especially upon his former acquaintances as he dashed past them in his superb equipage the best tailor should invent astonishing garments for him he would make himself conspicuous at all the first performances in a stagebox with the most notorious women in Paris his fetes would be described in the papers he would be the continual subject of comment he would be credited with splendid perfect form
It is true that M de Coralth had promised him all this without a word of explanation but what did that matter
Should he doubt his friends word
Never
The viscount was not merely his model but his oracle as well
By the way in which he spoke of him it might have been supposed that they had been friends from their childhood or at least that they had known each other for years
Such was not the case however
Their acquaintance dated only seven or eight months back and their first meeting had apparently been the result of chance though it is needless to say perhaps that this chance had been carefully prepared by M de Coralth
Having discovered Madame Lia dArgeless secret the viscount watched Wilkie ascertained where he spent his evenings contrived a way of introducing himself into his society and on their third meeting was skilful enough to render him a servicein other words to lend him some money
From that moment the conquest was assured for M de Coralth possessed in an eminent degree all the attributes that were likely to dazzle and charm the gifted owner of Pompier de Nanterre
First of all there was his title then his impudent assurance and his apparent wealth and last but by no means least his numerous and fashionable acquaintances
He was not long in discovering his advantage and in profiting by it
And without giving M Wilkie an inkling of the truth he succeeded in obtaining from him as accurate a knowledge of his past career as the young fellow himself possessed
M Wilkie did not know much concerning his origin or his early life and his history so far as he was acquainted with it could be told in a few words
His earliest recollection was of the ocean
He was sure perfectly sure that he had made a very long sea voyage when only a little child and he looked upon America as his birthplace
The French language was certainly not the first he had learned for he still remembered a limited number of English phrases
The English word father was among those that lingered in his memory and now after a lapse of twenty years he pronounced it without the least foreign accent
But while he remembered the word perfectly well no recollection remained to him of the person he had called by that name
His first sensations were those of hunger weariness and cold
He recollected and very distinctly too how on one long winter night a woman had dragged him after her through the streets of Paris in an icy rain
He could still see himself as he wandered on crying with weariness and begging for something to eat
And then the poor woman who held him by the hand lifted him in her arms and carried him onon until her own strength failed and she was obliged to set him on the ground again
A vague portrait of this woman who was most probably his mother still lingered in his memory
According to his description she was extremely handsome tall and very fair
He had been particularly impressed with the pale tint and profusion of her beautiful hair
Their poverty had not lasted long
He remembered being installed with his mother in a very handsome suite of rooms
A man who was still young and whom he called Monsieur Jacques came every day and brought him sweetmeats and playthings
He thought he must have been about four years old at that time
However he had enjoyed this comfortable state of things scarcely a month when one morning a stranger presented himself
The visitor held a long conference with his mother or at least with the person whom he called by that name
He did not understand what they were talking about but he was none the less very uneasy
The result of the interview must have justified his instinctive fear for his mother took him on her lap and embraced him with convulsive tenderness
She sobbed violently and repeated again and again in a faltering voice Poor child
my beloved Wilkie
I shall never kiss you againnever never
Alas
It must be so
Give me courage my God
Those were the exact words Wilkie was sure on that point
It seemed to him he could still hear that despairing farewell
For it was indeed a farewell
The stranger took him in his arms and carried him away in spite of his cries and struggles to escape
This person to whose care he was confined was the master of a small boardingschool and his wife was the kindest and most patient of women
However this did not prevent Wilkie from crying and begging for his mother at first but gradually he forgot her
He was not unhappy for he was petted and indulged more than any of the other pupils and he spent most of his time playing on the terrace or wandering about the garden
But this charming life could not last for ever
According to his calculation he was just ten years old when one Sunday toward the end of October a gravelooking redwhiskered gentleman clad in solemn black with a white necktie presented himself at the school and declared that he had been instructed by Wilkies relatives to place him in a college to continue his education
Young Wilkies lamentations were long and loud but they did not prevent M Pattersonfor that was the gentlemans namefrom taking him to the college of LouistheGreat where he was entered as a boarder
As he did not study and as he was only endowed with a small amount of intelligence he learned scarcely anything during the years he remained there
Every Sunday and every fete day M Patterson made his appearance at ten oclock precisely took Wilkie for a walk in Paris or the environs gave him his breakfast and dinner at some of the best restaurants bought everything he expressed a desire to have and at nine oclock precisely took him back to the college again
During the holidays M Patterson kept the boy with him refusing him nothing in the way of pleasure granting all his wishes but never losing sight of him for a moment
And if Wilkie complained of this constant watchfulness M Patterson always replied I must obey orders and this answer invariably put an end to the discussion
So things went on until it became time for Wilkie to take his degree
He presented himself for examination and of course he failed
Fortunately however M Patterson was not at a loss for an expedient
He placed his charge in a private school and the following year at a cost of five thousand francs he beguiled a poor devil into running the risk of three years imprisonment by assuming M Wilkies name and passing the examination in his place
In possession of the precious diploma which opens the door of every career M Wilkie now hoped that his pockets would be filled and that he would then be set at liberty
But the hope was vain
M Patterson placed him in the hands of an old tutor who had been engaged to travel with him through Europe and as this tutor held the pursestrings Wilkie was obliged to follow him through Germany England and Italy
When he returned to Paris he was just twenty years old and the very next day M Patterson conducted him to the suite of rooms which he still occupied in the Rue du Helder
You are now in your own home M Wilkie said M Patterson in his most impressive manner
You are now old enough to be responsible for your own actions and I hope you will conduct yourself like an honest man
From this moment you are your own master
Those who gave you your education desire you to study law
If I were in your place I should obey them
If you wish to be somebody and to acquire a fortune work for you have no property nor anything to expect from any one
The allowance which is granted you a far too liberal one in my opinion may be cut off at any moment
I dont think it right to conceal this fact from you
But at all events until then
I am instructed to pay you five thousand francs quarterly
Here is the amount for the first quarter and in three months time I shall send you a similar amount
I say shall SEND because my business compels me to return to England and take up my abode there
Here is my London address and if any serious trouble befalls you write to me
Now my duty being fulfilled farewell
Go to the devil you old preacher
growled Wilkie as he saw the door close on the retreating figure of M Patterson who had acted as his guardian for ten years
None of M Pattersons wise advice lingered in the young fellows mind
To use a familiar expression It went in through one ear and came out through the other
Only two facts had made an impression upon him that he was to be his own master henceforth and that he had a fortune at his command
There it lay upon the table five thousand francs in glittering gold
If M Wilkie had taken the trouble to attentively examine the rooms which had suddenly become his own he would perhaps have recognized the fact that a loving hand had prepared them for his reception
Countless details revealed the delicate taste of a woman and the thoughtful tenderness of a mother
None of those little superfluities which delight a young man had been forgotten
There was a box of choice cigars upon the table and a jar of tobacco on the mantelshelf
But Wilkie did not take time to discover this
He hastily slipped five hundred francs into his pocket locked the rest of his money in a drawer and went out with as lofty an air as if all Paris belonged to him or as if he had enough money to purchase it
He had resolved to give a fete in honor of his deliverance and so he hurried off in search of some of his old college chums
He found two of them and although it was very wounding to his self love M Wilkie was obliged to confess to them that this was his first taste of liberty and that he scarcely knew what to do with himself
Of course his friends assured him that they could quickly make him acquainted with the only life that it was worth while living and to prove it they accepted the invitation to dinner which he immediately offered them
It was a remarkable repast
Other acquaintances dropped in the wine flowed in rivers and after dinner they danced
And at daybreak having served his apprenticeship at baccarat M Wilkie found himself without a penny in his pocket and face to face with a bill of four hundred francs for which amount he was obliged to go to his rooms under the escort of one of the waiters
This first experiment ought to have disgusted him or at least have made him reflect
But no
He felt quite in his element in the society of dissipated young men and enamelled women
He swore that he would win a place in their midst and an influential place too
But it was easier to form this plan than to carry it into execution as he discovered when at the end of the month he counted his money to see what remained of the five thousand francs that had been given him for his quarterly allowance
He had just three hundred francs left
Twenty thousand francs a year is what one chooses to make it wealth or poverty
Twenty thousand francs a year represents about sixty francs a day but what are sixty francs to a high liver who breakfasts and dines at the best restaurants whose clothes are designed by an illustrious tailor who declines to make a pair of trousers for less than a hundred francs
What are three louis a day to a man who hires a box for first performances at the opera to a man who gambles and gives expensive suppers to a man who drives out with yellowhaired demoiselles and who owns a race horse
Measuring his purse and his ambition M Wilkie discovered that he should never succeed in making both ends meet
How do other people manage
he wondered
A puzzling question
Every evening a thousand gorgeously apparelled gentlemen with a cigar in their mouth and a flower in their buttonhole may be seen promenading between the Chaussee dAntin and the Faubourg Montmartre
Everybody knows them and they know everybody but how they exist is a problem which it is impossible to solve
How do they live and what do they live on
Everybody knows that they have no property they do nothing and yet they are reckless in their expenditures and rail at work and jeer at economy
What source do they derive their money from
What vile business are they engaged in
However M Wilkie did not devote much time to solving this question
My relatives must wish me to starve he said to himself
Not IIm not that sort of a person as Ill soon let them know
And thereupon he wrote to M Patterson
By return of post that gentleman sent him a cheque for one thousand francsa mere drop in the bucket
M Wilkie felt indignant and so he wrote again
This time he was obliged to wait for a reply
Still at last it came
M Patterson sent him two thousand francs and an interminable epistle full of reproaches
The interesting young man threw the letter into the fire and went out to hire a carriage by the month and a servant
From that day forward his life was spent in demanding money and waiting for it
He employed in quick succession every pretext that could soften the hearts of obdurate relatives or find the way to the most closely guarded cashbox
He was illhe had contracted a debt of honorhe had imprudently lent money to an unscrupulous friendhe was about to be arrested for debt
And in accordance with the favorable or unfavorable character of the replies his manner became humble or impertinent so that his friends soon learned to judge very accurately of the condition of his purse by the way he wore his mustaches
He became wise with experience however and on adding all the sums he had received together he decided that his family must be very rich to allow him so much money
And this thought made him anxious to fathom the mystery of his birth and his infancy
He finally persuaded himself that he was the son of a great English noblemana member of the House of Lords who was twenty times a millionaire
And he more than half believed it when he told his creditors that his lordship his father would some day or other come to Paris and pay all his debts
Unfortunately it was not M Wilkies noble father that arrived but a letter from M Patterson which was couched as follows MY DEAR SIR a considerable sum was placed in my hands to meet your unexpected requirements and in compliance with your repeated appeals I have remitted the entire amount to you
Not a penny remains in my possessionso that my instructions have been fulfilled
Spare yourself the trouble of making any fresh demands they will meet with no reply
In future you will not receive a penny above your allowance which in my opinion is already too large a one for a young man of your age
This letter proved a terrible blow to Wilkie
What should he do
He felt that M Patterson would not revoke his decision and indeed he wrote him several imploring letters in vain
Yet never had his need of money been so urgent
His creditors were becoming uneasy bills actually rained in upon his concierge his next quarterly allowance was not due for some time to come and it was only through the pawnbroker that he could obtain money for his more pressing requirements
He had begun to consider himself ruined
He saw himself reduced to dismissing his carriage to selling his third share of Pompier de Nanterre and losing the esteem of all his witty friends
He was in the depths of despair when one morning his servant woke him up with the announcement that the Viscount de Coralth was in the sittingroom and wished to speak with him on very important business
It was not usually an easy task to entice M Wilkie from his bed but the name his servant mentioned seemed to have a prodigious effect upon him
He bounded on to the floor and as he hastily dressed himself he muttered The viscount here at this hour
Its astonishing
What if hes going to fight a duel and wishes me to be his second
That would be a piece of grand good luck and no mistake
It would assure my position at once
Certainly something must have happened
This last remark was by no means a proof of any remarkable perspicuity on M Wilkies part
As M de Coralth never went to bed until two or three oclock in the morning he was by no means an early riser and only some very powerful reason could explain the presence of his bluelined brougham in the street before nine oclock AM And the influence that had made him rise betimes in the present case had indeed been extremely powerful
Although the brilliant viscount had discovered Madame dArgeless secret several months previously he had so far disclosed it to no one
It was certainly not from any delicacy of feeling that he had held his peace but only because it had not been for his interest to speak
Now however the sudden death of the Count de Chalusse changed the situation
He heard of the catastrophe at his club on the evening after the counts death and his emotion was so great that he actually declined to take part in a game of baccarat that was just beginning
The devil
he exclaimed
Let me think a moment
Madame dArgeles is the heiress of all these millions will she come forward and claim them
From what I know of her I am inclined to think that she wont
Will she ever go to Wilkie and confess that she Lia dArgeles is a Chalusse and that he is her illegitimate son
Never
She would rather relinquish her millions both for herself and for him than take such a step
She is so ridiculously antiquated in her notions
And then he began to study what advantages he might derive from his knowledge of the situation
M de Coralth like all persons whose present is more or less uncertain had great misgivings concerning his future
Just now he was cunning enough to find a means of procuring the thirty or forty thousand francs a year that were indispensable to his comfort but he had not a farthing laid by and the vein of silver he was now working might fail him at any moment
The slightest indiscretion the least blunder might hurl him from his splendor into the mire
The perspiration started out on his forehead when he thought of his peril
He passionately longed for a more assured positionfor a little capital that would insure him his bread until the end of his days and rid him of the grim phantom of poverty forever
And it was this desire which inspired him with the same plan that M Fortunat had formed
Why shouldnt I inform Wilkie
he said to himself
If I present him with a fortune the simpleton ought certainly to give me some reward
But to carry this plan into execution it would be necessary to brave Madame dArgeless anger and that was attended by no little danger
If he knew something about her she on her side knew everything connected with his past life
She had only to speak to ruin him forever
Still after weighing all the advantages and all the dangers he decided to act convinced that Madame dArgeles might be kept ignorant of his treason providing he only played his cards skilfully
And his matutinal visit to M Wilkie was caused by a fear that he might not be the only person knowing the truth and that some one else might forestall him
You here at sunrise my friend
exclaimed Wilkie as he entered the room where the viscount was seated
What has happened
To menothing replied the viscount
It was solely on your account that I deviated from my usual habits
What is it
You frighten me
Oh
dont be alarmed
I have only some good news to communicate and in a careless tone which cleverly concealed his anxiety the viscount added I have come my dear Wilkie to ask you what you would be willing to give the man who put you in possession of a fortune of several millions
M Wilkies face turned from white to purple at least three times in ten seconds and it was in a strangely altered voice that he replied Ah
thats goodvery goodexcellent
He tried his best to laugh but he was completely overcome and in fact he had cherished so many extravagant hopes that nothing seemed impossible to him
Never in all my life have I spoken more seriously insisted the viscount
His companion at first made no reply
It was easy to divine the conflict that was raging in his mind between the hope that the news was true and the fear of being made the victim of a practical joke
Come my friend he said at last do you want to poke fun at me
That wouldnt be polite
A debtor is always sacred and I owe you twentyfive louis
This is scarcely the time to talk of millions
My relatives have cut off my supplies and my creditors are overwhelming me with their bills But M de Coralth checked him saying gravely Upon my honor I am not jesting
What would you give a man who I would give him half of the fortune he gave me
Thats too much
No no
He was in earnest certainly
What wouldnt a man promise in all sincerity of soul to a fellow mortal who gave him money when he had nonewhen he needed it urgently and must have it to save himself from ruin
At such a moment no commission however large seems exorbitant
It is afterward when the day of settlement comes that people begin to find fault with the rate of interest
If I tell you that onehalf is too much it is because such is really the case
And I am the best judge of the matter since I am the man who can put you in possession of this enormous fortune
M Wilkie started back in speechless amazement
This astonishes you
said the viscount and why pray
Is it because I ask for a commission
Oh
not at all
It is not perhaps a very gentlemanly proceeding but it is a sensible one
Business is business
In the afternoon when I am in a restaurant at the club or in a ladys boudoir I am merely the viscount and the grand seigneur
All money questions sicken me
I am careless liberal and obliging to a fault
But in the morning I am simply Coralth a man of the middle classes who doesnt pay his bills without examining them and who watches his money because he doesnt wish to be ruined and end his brilliant career as a common soldier in some foreign legion
M Wilkie did not allow him to continue
He believed and his joy was wilddelirious
Enough enough
he interrupted
A difficulty between us
Never
I am yours without reserve
Do you understand me
How much must you have
Do you wish for it all
But the viscount was unmoved
It is not fitting that I should fix upon the indemnity which is due to me
I will consult a man of business and I will decide upon this point on the day after tomorrow when I shall explain everything to you
On the day after tomorrow
You wont leave me in suspense for fortyeight hours
It is unavoidable
I have still some important information to procure
I lost no time in coming to you so that I might put you on your guard
If any scoundrel comes to you with proposals be extremely careful
Some agents when they obtain a hold on an estate leave nothing for the rightful owner
So dont treat with any one
Oh no
You may rest assured I wont
I should be quieter in mind if I had your promise in writing
Without a word Wilkie darted to a table and wrote a short contract by which he bound himself to give M Ferdinand de Coralth onehalf of the inheritance which the aforesaid Coralth might prove him to be entitled to
The viscount read the document placed it in his pocket and then said as he took up his hat Very well
I will see you again on Monday
But M Wilkies doubts were beginning to return
Monday so be it
said he but swear that you are not deceiving me
What do you still doubt me
M Wilkie reflected for a moment and suddenly a brilliant inspiration darted through his brain
If you are speaking the truth I shall soon be rich said he
But in the meantime life is hard
I havent a penny and it isnt a pleasant situation
I have a horse entered for the race tomorrow Pompier de Nanterre
You know the animal very well
The chances are enormously in his favor
So if it wouldnt inconvenience you to lend me fifty louis  Certainly interrupted the viscount cordially
Certainly with the greatest pleasure
And drawing a beautiful little notebook from his pocket he took from it not one but two banknotes of a thousand francs and handed them to M Wilkie saying Monsieur believes me now does he not
As will be readily believed it was not for his own pleasure that M de Coralth postponed his confidential disclosures for a couple of days
He knew Wilkie perfectly well and felt that it was dangerous to let him roam about Paris with half of an important secret
Postponement generally furnishes fate with weapons against oneself
But it was impossible for the viscount to act otherwise
He had not seen the Marquis de Valorsay since the Count de Chalusses death and he dared not conclude the contract with Wilkie before he had conferred with him for he was completely in the marquiss power
At the least suspicion of treason M de Valorsay would close his hand and he Coralth would be crushed like an eggshell
It was to the house of his formidable associate that he repaired on leaving M Wilkie and in a single breath he told the marquis all that he knew and the plans that he had formed
M de Valorsays astonishment must have been intense when he heard that Lia dArgeles was a Chalusse but he knew how to maintain his composure
He listened quietly and when the viscount had completed his story he asked Why did you wait so long before telling me all this
I didnt see how it could interest you in the least
The marquis looked at him keenly and then calmly said In other words you were waiting to see whether it would be most advantageous to you to be with me or against me
How can you think I dont think Im sure of it
As long as I was strong support for you you were devoted to me
But now I am tottering and you are ready to betray me
Excuse me
The step I am about to take What havent you taken it already
interrupted the marquis quickly
And shrugging his shoulders he added Observe that I dont reproach you in the least
Only remember this we survive or we perish together
By the angry gleam in M de Coralths eyes the marquis must have realized that his companion was disposed to rebel still this knowledge did not seem to disquiet him for it was in the same icy tone that he continued Besides your plans far from conflicting with mine will be of service to me
Yes Madame dArgeles must lay claim to the counts estate
If she hesitates her son will compel her to urge her claims will he not
Oh you may rest assured of that
And when he becomes rich will you be able to retain your influence over him
Rich or poor I can mould him like wax
Very good
Marguerite was escaping me but I shall soon have her in my power
I have a plan
The Fondeges think they can outwit me but we shall soon see about that
The viscount was watching his companion stealthily as the latter perceived and so in a tone of brusque cordiality he resumed Excuse me for not keeping you to breakfast but I must go out immediatelyBaron Trigault is waiting for me at his house
Let us part friendsau revoirand above all keep me well posted about matters in general
M de Coralths temper was already somewhat ruffled when he entered Valorsays house and he was in a furious passion when he left it
So we are to survive or perish together he growled
Thanks for the preference you display for my society
Is it my fault that the fool has squandered his fortune
I fancy Ive had enough of his threats and airs
Still his wrath was not so violent as to make him forget his own interests
He at once went to inquire if the agreement which M Wilkie had just signed would be binding
The lawyer whom he consulted replied that at all events a reasonable compensation would most probably be granted by the courts in case of any difficulty and he suggested a little plan which was a chef doeuvre in its way at the same time advising his client to strike the iron while it was hot
It was not yet noon and the viscount determined to act upon the suggestion at once he now bitterly regretted the delay he had specified
I must find Wilkie at once he said to himself
But he did not succeed in meeting him until the evening when he found him at the Cafe Richeand in what a condition too
The two bottles of wine which the young fool had drank at dinner had gone to his head and he was enumerating in a loud voice the desires he meant to gratify as soon as he came into possession of his millions
What a brute
thought the enraged viscount
If I leave him to himself no one knows what foolish thing he may do or say
I must remain with him until he becomes sober again
So he followed him to the theatre and thence to Brebants where he was sitting feeling terribly bored when M Wilkie conceived the unfortunate idea of inviting Victor Chupin to come up and take some refreshment
The scene which followed greatly alarmed the viscount
Who could this young man be
He did not remember having ever seen him before and yet the young scamp was evidently well acquainted with his past life for he had cast the name of Paul in his face as a deadly insult
Surely this was enough to make the viscount shudder
How did it happen that this young man had been just on the spot ready to pick up Wilkies hat
Was it mere chance
Certainly not
He could not believe it
Then why was the fellow there
Evidently to watch somebody
And whom
Why him Coralthundoubtedly
In going through life as he had done a man makes enemies at every step and he had an imposing number of foes whom he only held in check by his unbounded impudence and his renown as a duellist
Thus it was not strange if some one had set a snare for him it was rather a miracle that he had not fallen into one before
The dangers that threatened him were so formidable that he was almost tempted to relinquish his attack on Madame dArgeles
Was it prudent to incur the risk of making this woman an enemy
All Sunday he hesitated
It would be very easy to get out of the scrape
He could concoct some story for Wilkies benefit and that would be the end of it
But on the other hand there was the prospect of netting at least five hundred thousand francsa fortunea competency and the idea was too tempting to be relinquished
So on Monday morning at about ten oclock he presented himself at Wilkies house looking pale with anxiety and far more solemn in manner than usual
Let us say but little and that to the point he remarked on entering
The secret I am about to reveal to you will make you rich but it might ruin me if it were known that you obtained this information through me
You will therefore swear upon your honor as a gentleman never to betray me under any circumstances or for any reason
M Wilkie extended his hand and solemnly exclaimed I swear
Very well then
Now my mind is at rest
It is scarcely necessary for me to add that if you break your faith you are a dead man
You know me
You know how I handle a sword and dont forget it
His manner was so threatening that Wilkie shuddered
You will certainly be questioned continued M de Coralth but you must reply that you received the information through one of Mr Pattersons friends
Now let us sign our formal contract in lieu of the temporary one you gave me the other day
It is needless to say that Wilkie signed it eagerly
Not so the viscount he read the document through carefully before appending his signature and then exclaimed The estate that belongs to you is that of the Count de Chalusse your uncle
He leaves I am informed at least eight or ten millions of property
By M Wilkies excited gestures by the glitter in his eyes it might have been supposed that this wonderful good fortune was too much for him and that he was going mad
I knew that I belonged to a noble family he began
The Count de Chalusse my uncle
I shall have a coronet on the corner of my visiting cards
But with a gesture M de Coralth silenced him
Wait a little before you rejoice said he
Yes your mother is the sister of the Count de Chalusse and it is through her that you are an heir to the estate
Butdont grieve too muchthere are similar misfortunes in many of our most distinguished families circumstancesthe obstinacy of parentsa love more powerful than reason The viscount paused certainly he had no prejudices but at the moment of telling this interesting young man who his mother really was he hesitated
Go on insisted M Wilkie
Wellwhen your mother was a young girl about twenty she fled from her paternal home with a man she loved
Forsaken afterward she found herself in the depths of poverty
She was obliged to live
You were starving
So she changed her name and now she is known as Lia dArgeles
M Wilkie sprang to his feet
Lia dArgeles
he exclaimed
Then with a burst of laughter he added Nevertheless I think it a piece of grand good luck
VI
This man carries away your secret you are lost
A sinister voice whispered these words in Madame Lia dArgeless heart when M Isidore Fortunat after being rudely dismissed closed the door of her drawingroom behind him
This man had addressed her by the ancient and illustrious name of Chalusse which she had not heard for twenty years and which she had forbidden her own lips to pronounce
This man knew that she Lia dArgeles was really a Durtal de Chalusse
This frightful certainty overwhelmed her
It is true this man Fortunat had declared that his visit was entirely disinterested
He had pretended that his regard for the Chalusse family and the compassion aroused in his heart by the unfortunate plight of Mademoiselle Marguerite were the only motives that has influenced him in taking this step
However Madame dArgeless experience in life had left her but limited faith in apparent or pretended disinterestedness
This is a practical age chivalrous sentiments are expensiveas she had learned conclusively
If the man came here she murmured it was only because he thought he might derive some benefit from the prosecution of my claim to my poor brothers estate
In refusing to listen to his entreaties I have deprived him of this expected profit and so I have made him my enemy
Ah
I was foolish to send him away like that
I ought to have pretended to listenI ought to have bound him by all sorts of promises
She suddenly paused
It occurred to her that M Fortunat could not have gone very far so that if she sent for him to come back she might perhaps be able to repair her blunder
Without losing a second she rushed downstairs and ordered her concierge and a servant to run after the gentleman who had just left the house and ask him to return to tell him that she had reflected and wished to speak to him again
They rushed out in pursuit and she remained in the courtyard her heart heavy with anxiety
Too late
About a quarter of an hour afterward her emissaries returned
They had made all possible haste in contrary directions but they had seen no one in the street who at all resembled the person they were looking for
They had questioned the shopkeepers but no one had seen him pass
It doesnt matter faltered Madame dArgeles in a tone that belied her words
And anxious to escape the evident curiosity of her servants she hastened back to the little boudoir where she usually spent her mornings
M Fortunat had left his cardthat is to say his addressand it would have been an easy matter to send a servant to his house
She was strongly tempted to do so but she ultimately decided that it would be better to waitthat an hour more or less would make but little difference
She had sent her trusty servant Job for Baron Trigault he would probably return with the baron at any moment and the baron would advise her
He would know at once what was the best course for her to pursue
And so she waited for his coming in breathless anxiety and the more she reflected the more imminent her peril seemed for she realized that M Fortunat must be a very dangerous and cunning man
He had set a trap for her and she had allowed herself to be caught
Perhaps he had only suspected the truth when he presented himself at the house
He had suddenly announced the death of the Count de Chalusse she had betrayed herself and any doubts he might have entertained were dispelled
If I had only had sufficient presence of mind to deny it she murmured
If I had only been courageous enough to reply that I knew absolutely nothing about the person he spoke of
Ah
then he would have gone away convinced that he was mistaken
But would the smoothspoken visitor have declared that he knew everything if he had not really penetrated the mystery of her life
It was scarcely probable
He had implored her to accept the property if not for her own sake at least for the sake of another
And when she asked him whom he meant he had answered Mademoiselle Marguerite but he was undoubtedly thinking of Wilkie
So this man this Isidore Fortunat knew that she had a son
Perhaps he was even acquainted with him personally
In his anger he would very likely hasten to Wilkies rooms and tell him everything
This thought filled the wretched womans heart with despair
What
Had she not yet expiated her fault
Must she suffer again
For the first time a terrible doubt came over her
What she had formerly regarded as a most sublime effort of maternal love was perhaps even a greater crime than the first she had committed
She had given her honor as the price of her sons happiness and prosperity
Had she a right to do so
Did not the money she had lavished upon him contain every germ of corruption misfortune and shame
How terrible Wilkies grief and rage would be if he chanced to hear the truth
Alas
he would certainly pay no heed to the extenuating circumstances he would close his ears to all attempts at justification
He would be pitiless
He would have naught but hatred and scorn to bestow upon a mother who had fallen from the highest rank in society down to everlasting infamy
She fancied she heard him saying in an indignant voice It would have been better to have allowed me to die of starvation than to have given me bread purchased at such a price
Why have you dishonored me by your illgotten wealth
Fallen you might have raised yourself by honest toil
You ought to have made me a laborer and not a spoiled idler incapable of earning an honest livelihood
As the son of a poor betrayed and deserted woman with whom I could have shared my scanty earnings I might have looked the world proudly in the face
But where can the son of Lia dArgeles hide his disgrace after playing the gentleman for twenty years with Lia dArgeless money
Yes Wilkie would certainly say this if he ever learned the truth and he would learn itshe felt sure of it
How could she hope to keep a secret which was known to Baron Trigault M Patterson the Viscount de Coralth and M Fortunat four persons
She had confidence in the first two she believed she had a hold on the third but the fourthFortunat
The hours went by and still Job did not return
What was the meaning of this delay
Had he failed to find the baron
At last the sound of carriagewheels in the courtyard made her start
Thats Job
she said to herself
He brings the baron
Alas
no
Job returned alone
And yet the honest fellow had spared neither pains nor horseflesh
He had visited every place where there was the least probability of finding the baron and he was everywhere told that Baron Trigault had not been seen for several days
In that case you ought to have gone to his house
Perhaps he is there remarked Madame dArgeles
Madame knows that the baron is never at home
I did go there however but in vain
This chanced to be one of three consecutive days which Baron Trigault had spent with KamiBey the Turkish ambassador
It had been agreed between them that they should play until one or the other had lost five hundred thousand francs and in order to prevent any waste of precious time as the baron was wont to remark they neither of them stirred from the Grand Hotel where KamiBey had a suite of rooms
They ate and slept there
By some strange chance Madame dArgeles had not heard of this duel with banknotes although nothing else was talked of at the clubs indeed the Figaro had already published a minute description of the apartment where the contest was going on and every evening it gave the results
According to the latest accounts the baron had the advantage he had won about two hundred and eighty thousand francs
I only returned to inform madame that I had so far been unsuccessful said Job
But I will recommence the search at once
That is unnecessary replied Madame dArgeles
The baron will undoubtedly drop in this evening after dinner as usual
She said this and tried her best to believe it but in her secret heart she felt that she could no longer depend upon the barons assistance
I wounded him this morning she thought
He went away more angry than I had ever seen him before
He is incensed with me and who knows how long it will be before he comes again
Still she waited with feverish anxiety listening breathlessly to every sound in the street and trembling each time she heard or fancied she heard a carriage stop at the door
However at two oclock in the morning the baron had not made his appearance
It is too latehe wont come
she murmured
But now her sufferings were less intolerable for excess of wretchedness had deadened her sensibility
Utter prostration paralyzed her energies and benumbed her mind
Ruin seemed so inevitable that she no longer thought of avoiding it she awaited it with that blind resignation displayed by Spanish women who when they hear the roll of thunder fall upon their knees convinced that lightning is about to strike their defenceless heads
She tottered to her room flung herself on the bed and instantly fell asleep
Yes she slept the heavy leaden slumber which always follows a great mental crisis and which falls like Gods blessing upon a tortured mind
On waking up her first act was to ring for her maid in order to send a message to Job to go out again in search of the baron
But the faithful servant had divined his mistresss wishes and had already started off of his own accord
It was past midday when he returned but his face was radiant and it was in a triumphant voice that he announced Monsieur le Baron Trigault
Madame dArgeles sprang up and greeted the baron with a joyful exclamation
Ah
how kind of you to come
she exclaimed
You are most welcome
If you knew how anxiously I have been waiting for you
He made no reply
If you knew continued Madame dArgeles if you only knew  But she paused for in spite of her own agitation she was suddenly struck by the peculiar expression on her visitors face
He was standing silent and motionless in the centre of the room and his eyes were fixed upon her with a strange persistent stare in which she could read all the contradictory feelings which were battling for mastery in his mindanger hatred pity and forgiveness
Madame dArgeles shuddered
So her cup of sorrow was not yet full
A new misfortune was about to fall upon her
She had hoped that the baron would be able to alleviate her wretchedness but it seemed as if he were fated to increase it
Why do you look at me like that
she asked anxiously
What have I done
You my poor Lianothing
Thenwhat is it
Oh my God
you frighten me
What is it
Well I am going to tell you he said as he stepped forward and took her hand in his own
You know that I have been infamously duped and deceived that the happiness of my life has been destroyed by a scoundrel who tempted the wife I so fondly loved to forget her duty and trample her honor under foot
You have heard my vows of vengeance if I ever succeeded in discovering him
Ah well Lia I have discovered him
The man who stole my share of earthly happiness was the Count de Chalusse your brother
With a sudden gesture Madame dArgeles freed her hand from the barons grasp and recoiled as terrified as if she had seen a spectre rise up before her
Then with her hands extended as if to ward off the horrible apparition she exclaimed O my God
A bitter smile curved the barons lips
What do you fear
he asked
Isnt your brother dead
He has defrauded me alike of happiness and vengeance
If her sons life had depended on a single word Madame dArgeles could not have uttered it
She knew what mental agony had urged the baron to a sort of moral suicide and led him to contract the vice in which he wasted his life and squandered or at least risk his millions
Nor is this all he continued
Listen
As I have often told you I was sure that my wife became a mother in my absence
I sought the child for years hoping that through the offspring I might discover the father
Ah well
Ive found what I sought at last
The child is now a beautiful young girl
She lives at the Hotel de Chalusse as your brothers daughter
She is known as Mademoiselle Marguerite
Madame dArgeles listened leaning against the wall for support and trembling like a leaf
Her reason was shaken by so many repeated blows and her son her brother Marguerite Pascal Ferailleur Coralth Valorsayall those whom she loved or feared or hatedrose like spectres before her troubled brain
The horror of the truth exceeded her most frightful apprehensions
The strangeness of the reality surpassed every flight of fancy
And moreover the barons calmness increased her stupor
She so often had heard him give vent to his rage and despair in terrible threats that she could not believe he would be thus resigned
But was his calmness real
Was it not a mask would not his fury suddenly break forth
However he continued It is thus that destiny makes us its sportit is thus that it laughs at our plans
Do you remember Lia the day when I met you wandering through the streets of Pariswith your child in your armspale and half dead with fatigue faint for want of food homeless and penniless
You saw no refuge but in death as you have since told me
How could I imagine when I rescued you that I was saving my greatest enemys sister from suicidethe sister of the man whom I was vainly pursuing
And yet this might not be the end if I chose to have it otherwise
The count is dead but I can still return him disgrace for disgrace
He dishonored me
What prevents me from casting ineffaceable opprobrium upon the great name of Chalusse of which he was so proud
He seduced my wife
Today I can tell all Paris what his sister has been and what she is today
Ah
it was thisyes it was this that Madame dArgeles had dreaded
She fell upon her knees and with clasped hands she entreated Pityoh
have pityforgive me
Have mercy
Have I not always been a faithful and devoted friend to you
Think of the past you have just invoked
Who helped you then to bear your intolerable sufferings
Dont you remember the day when you yourself had determined to die by your own hand
There was a woman who persuaded you to abandon the thought of suicide
It was I
He looked at her for a moment with a softer expression tears came to his eyes and rolled down his cheeks
Then suddenly he raised her and placed her in an armchair exclaiming Ah
you know very well that I shall not do what I said
Dont you know me better than that
Are you not sure of my affection are you not aware that you are sacred in my eyes
He was evidently striving hard to master his emotion
Besides he added I had already pardoned before coming here
It was foolish on my part perhaps and for nothing in the world would I confess it to my acquaintances but it is none the less true
I shall have my revenge in a certain fashion however
I need only hold my peace and the daughter of M de Chalusse and Madame Trigault would become a lost woman
Is this not so
Very well I shall offer her my assistance
It may or may not be another absurd and ridiculous fancy added to the many I have been guilty of
But no matter
I have promised
And why indeed should this poor girl be held responsible for the sins of her parents
II declare myself on her side against the world
Madame dArgeles rose her face radiant with joy and hope
Then perhaps we are saved
she exclaimed
Ah
I knew when I sent for you that I should not appeal to your heart in vain
She took hold of his hand as if to raise it to her lips but he gently withdrew it and inquired with an air of astonishment What do you mean
That I have been cruelly punished for not wishing you to assist that unfortunate man who was dishonored here the other evening
Pascal Ferailleur
Yes he is innocent
The Viscount de Coralth is a scoundrel
It was he who slipped the cards which made M Ferailleur win into the pack and he did it at the Marquis de Valorsays instigation
The baron looked at Madame dArgeles with profound amazement
What
said he you knew this and you allowed it
You were cruel enough to remain silent when that innocent man entreated you to testify on his behalf
You allowed this atrocious crime to be executed under your own roof and under your very eyes
I was then ignorant of Mademoiselle Marguerites existence
I did not know that the young man was beloved by my brothers daughterI did not know The baron interrupted her and exclaimed indignantly Ah
what does that matter
It was none the less an abominable action
She hung her head and in a scarcely audible voice replied I was not free
I submitted to a will that was stronger than my own
If you had heard M de Coralths threats you would not censure me so severely
He has discovered my secret he knows WilkieI am in his power
Dont frownI make no attempt to excuse myselfI am only explaining the position in which I was placed
My peril is imminent I have only confidence in youyou alone can aid me listen
Thereupon she hastily explained M de Coralths position respecting herself what she had been able to ascertain concerning the Marquis de Valorsays plans the alarming visit she had received from M Fortunat his advice and insinuations the dangers she apprehended and her firm determination to deliver Mademoiselle Marguerite from the machinations of her enemies
Madame dArgeless disclosures formed as it were a sequel to the confidential revelations of Pascal Ferailleur and the involuntary confession of the Marquis de Valorsay and the baron could no longer doubt the existence of the shameful intrigue which had been planned in view of obtaining possession of the counts millions
And if he did not at first understand the motives he at least began to discern what means had been employed
He now understood why Valorsay persisted in his plan of marrying Mademoiselle Marguerite even without a fortune
The wretch knows through Coralth that Madame dArgeles is a Chalusse he said to himself and when Mademoiselle Marguerite has become his wife he intends to oblige Madame dArgeles to accept her brothers estate and share it with him
At that same moment Madame dArgeles finished her narrative
And now what shall I do
she added
The baron was stroking his chin as was his usual habit when his mind was deeply exercised
The first thing to be done he replied is to show Coralth in his real colors and prove M Ferailleurs innocence
It will probably cost me a hundred thousand francs to do so but I shall not grudge the money
I should probably spend as much or even more in play next summer and the amount had better be spent in a good cause than in swelling the dividends of my friend Blanc at Baden
But M de Coralth will speak out as soon as he finds that I have revealed his shameful past
Let him speak
Madame dArgeles shuddered
Then the name of Chalusse will be disgraced said she and Wilkie will know who his mother is
No
But Ah
allow me to finish my dear friend
I have my plan and it is as plain as daylight
This evening you will write to your London correspondent
Request M Patterson to summon your son to England under any pretext whatever let him pretend that he wishes to give him some money for instance
He will go there of course and then we will keep him there
Coralth certainly wont run after him and we shall have nothing more to fear on that score
Great heavens
murmured Madame dArgeles why did this idea never occur to me
The baron had now completely recovered his composure
As regards yourself said he the plan you ought to adopt is still more simple
What is your furniture worth
About a hundred thousand francs isnt it
Very well then
You will sign me notes dated some time back to the amount of a hundred thousand francs
On the day these notes fall due on Monday for instance they will be presented for payment
You will refuse to pay them
A writ will be served and an attachment placed upon your furniture but you will offer no resistance
I dont know if I explain my meaning very clearly
Oh very clearly
So your property is seized
You make no opposition and next week we shall have flaming posters on all the walls telling Paris that the furniture wardrobe cashmeres laces and diamonds of Madame Lia dArgeles will be sold without reserve at public auction in the Rue Drouot with the view of satisfying the claims of her creditors
You can imagine the sensation this announcement will create
I can see your friends and the frequenters of your drawingroom meeting one another in the street and saying Ah well
whats this about poor dArgeles
Pshawno doubt its a voluntary sale
Not at all shes really ruined
Everything is mortgaged above its value
Indeed Im very sorry to hear it
She was a good creature
Oh excellent a deal of amusement could be found at her houseonly between you and me Well
Well she was no longer young
Thats true
However I shall attend the sale and I think I shall bid
And in fact your acquaintances wont fail to repair to the Hotel Drouot and maybe your most intimate friends will yield to their generous impulses sufficiently to offer twenty sous for one of the dainty trifles on your etageres
Overcome with shame Madame dArgeles hung her head
She had never before so keenly felt the disgrace of her situation
She had never so clearly realized what a deep abyss she had fallen into
And this crushing humiliation came from whom
From the only friend she possessedfrom the man who was her only hope Baron Trigault
And what made it all the more frightful was that he did not seem to be in the least degree conscious of the cruelty of his words
Indeed he continued in a tone of bitter irony Of course you will have an exhibition before the sale and you will see all the dolls that hairdressers milliners and fools call great ladies come running to the show
They will come to see how a notorious woman lives and to ascertain if there are any good bargains to be had
This is the right form
These great ladies would be delighted to display diamonds purchased at the sale of a woman of the demi monde
Oh
dont fearyour exhibition will be visited by my wife and daughter by the Viscountess de Bois dArdon by Madame de Rochecote her five daughters and a great many more
Then the papers will take up the refrain they will give an account of your financial difficulties and tell the public what you paid for your pictures
It was with a sort of terrorstricken curiosity that Madame dArgeles watched the baron
It had been many years since she had seen him in such a frame of mindsince she had heard him talk in such a cynical fashion
I am ready to follow your advice said she but afterward
What dont you understand the object I have in view
Afterward you will disappear
I know five or six journalists and it would be very strange if I could not convince one of them that you had died upon an hospital pallet
It will furnish the subject of a touching and what is better a moral article
The papers will say Another star has disappeared
This is the miserable end of all the poor wretches whose passing luxury scandalizes honest women
And what will become of me
A respected woman Lia
You will go to England install yourself in some pretty cottage near London and create a new identity for yourself
The proceeds of your sale will supply your wants and Wilkies for more than a year
Before that time has elapsed you will have succeeded in accumulating the necessary proofs of your identity and then you can assert your claims and take possession of your brothers estate
Madame dArgeles sprang to her feet
Never never
she exclaimed vehemently
The baron evidently thought he must have misunderstood her
What
he stammered you will relinquish the millions that are legally yours to the government
YesI am resolvedit must be so
Will you sacrifice your sons future in this style
No it isnt in my power to do that but Wilkie will do so later on Im sure of it
But this is simply folly
A feverish agitation had now succeeded Madame dArgeless torpor there was an expression of scorn and anger on her rigid features and her eyes usually so dull and lifeless fairly blazed
It is not folly she exclaimed but vengeance
And as the astonished baron opened his lips to question her Let me finish she said imperiously and then you shall judge me
I have told you with perfect frankness everything concerning my past life save this thisthat I am married Monsieur le Baron legally married
I am bound by a chain that nothing can break and my husband is a scoundrel
You would be frightened if you knew half the extent of his villainy
Oh
do not shake your head
I ought not to be suspected of exaggeration when I speak in this style of a man whom I once loved so devotedly
For I loved him alaseven to madnessloved him so much that I forgot self family honor and all the most sacred duties
I loved him so madly that I was willing to follow him while his hands were still wet with my brothers blood
Ah
chastisement could not fail to come and it was terrible like the sin
This man for whom I had abandoned everythingwhom I had made my idoldo you know what he said to me the third day after my flight from home
You must be more stupid than an owl to have forgotten to take your jewels
Yes those were the very words he said to me with a furious air
And then I could measure the depths of the abyss into which I had plunged
This man with whom I had been so infatuated did not love me at all he had never loved me
It had only been cold calculation on his part
He had devoted months to the task of winning my heart just as he would have devoted them to some business transaction
He only saw in me the fortune that I was to inherit
Oh
he didnt conceal it from me
If your parents are not monsters he was always saying they will finally become reconciled to our marriage
They will give you a handsome fortune and we will divide it
I will give you back your liberty and then we can each of us be happy in our own way
It was for this reason that he wished to marry me
I consented on account of my unborn child
My father and mother had died and he hoped to prevail upon me to claim my share of the paternal fortune
As for claiming it himself he dared not
He was a coward and he was afraid of my brother
But I took a solemn oath that he should never have a farthing of the wealth he coveted and neither threats nor BLOWS could compel me to assert my claim
God only knows how much I had suffered from his brutality when I at last succeeded in making my escape with Wilkie
He has sought us everywhere for fifteen years but he has not yet succeeded in finding a trace of us
Still he has not ceased to watch my brother
I am sure of that my presentiments never deceive me
So if I followed your adviceif I claimed possession of my brothers fortunemy husband would instantly appear with our marriage contract in his hands and demand everything
Shall I enrich him
No never never
I would rather die of want
I would rather see Wilkie die of starvation before my very eyes
Madame dArgeles spoke in that tone of concentrated rage which betrays years of repressed passion and unflinching resolution
One could scarcely hope to modify her views even by the wisest and most practical advice
The baron did not even think of attempting to do so
He had known Madame dArgeles for years he had seen so many proofs of her invincible energy and determination
She possessed the distinguishing characteristic of her family in a remarkable degreethat proverbial Chalusse obstinacy which Madame Vantrasson had alluded to in her conversation with M Fortunat
She was silent for a moment and then in a firm tone she said Still I will follow your advice in part baron
This evening I will write to M Patterson and request him to send for Wilkie
In less than a fortnight I shall have sold my furniture and disappeared
I shall remain poor
My fortune is not so large as people suppose
No matter
My son is a man he must learn to earn his own living
My banking account is always at your disposal Lia
Thanks my friend thanks a thousand times but it will not be necessary for me to accept your kind offer
When Wilkie was a child I did not refuse
But now I would dig the ground with my own hands rather than give him a louis that came from you
You think me full of contradictions
Perhaps I am
It is certain that I am no longer what I was yesterday
This trouble has torn away the bandage that covered my eyes
I can see my conduct clearly now and I condemn it
I sinned for my sons sake more than for my own
But I might have rehabilitated myself through him and now he will perhaps be dishonored through me
Her breathing came short and hard and it was in a choked voice that she continued Wilkie shall work for me and for himself
If he is strong he will save us
If he is weakah well
we shall perish
But there has been cowardice and shame enough
It shall never be said that I sacrificed the honor of a noble name and the happiness of my brothers child to my son
I see what my duty is and I shall do it
The baron nodded approvingly
Thats no doubt right said he
Only allow me to tell you that all is not lost yet
The code has a weapon for every just cause
Perhaps there will be a way for you to obtain and hold your fortune independent of your husband
Alas
I made inquiries on the subject years ago and I was told that it would be impossible
Still you might investigate the matter
I have confidence in you
I know that you would not advise me rashlybut dont delay
The worst misfortune would be less intolerable than this suspense
I will lose no time
M Ferailleur is a very clever lawyer I am told
I will consult him
And what shall I do about this man Fortunat who called upon me
The baron reflected for a moment
The safest thing would be to take no action whatever at present he replied
If he has any evil designs a visit or a letter from you would only hasten them
By the way Madame dArgeles shook her head it was easy to see that she had very little hope
All this will end badly she murmured
The baron shared her opinion but he did not think it wise or kind to discourage her
Nonsense
he said lightly luck is going to change it is always changing
Then as he heard the clock strike he sprang from his armchair in dismay
Two oclock he exclaimed and KamiBey is waiting for me
I certainly havent been wasting time here but I ought to have been at the Grand Hotel at noon
Kami is quite capable of suspecting a man of any knavery
These Turks are strange creatures
Its true that I am now a winner to the tune of two hundred and eighty thousand francs
He settled his hat firmly on his head and opening the door he added Goodby my dear madame I will soon see you again and in the meantime dont deviate in the least from your usual habits
Our success depends in a great measure upon the fancied security of our enemies
Madame dArgeles considered this advice so sensible that half an hour later she went out for her daily drive in the Bois little suspecting that M Fortunats spy Victor Chupin was dogging her carriage
It was most imprudent on her part to have gone to Wilkies house on her return
She incurred such a risk of awakening suspicion by wandering about near her sons home that she seldom allowed herself that pleasure but sometimes her anxiety overpowered her reason
So on this occasion she ordered the coachman to stop near the Rue du Helder and she reached the street just in time to betray her secret to Victor Chupin and receive a foul insult from M Wilkie
The latters cruel words stabbed her to the heart and yet she tried to construe them as mere proofs of her sons honesty of feelingas proof of his scorn for the depraved creatures who haunt the boulevards each evening
But though her energy was indomitable her physical strength was not equal to her will
On returning home she felt so ill that she was obliged to go to bed
She shivered with cold and yet the blood that flowed in her veins seemed to her like molten lead
The physician who was summoned declared that her illness was a mere trifle but prescribed rest and quiet
And as he was a very discerning man he added not without a malicious smile that any excess is injuriousexcess of pleasure as well as any other
As it was Sunday Madame dArgeles was able to obey the physician and so she closed her doors against every one the baron excepted
Still fearing that this seclusion might seem a little strange she ordered her concierge to tell any visitors that she had gone into the country and would not return until her usual reception day
She would then be compelled to open her doors as usual
For what would the habitues of the house who had played there every Monday for years say if they found the doors closed
She was less her own mistress than an actressshe had no right to weep or suffer in solitude
So at about seven oclock on Monday evening although still grievously suffering both in mind and body she arranged herself to receive her guests
From among all her dresses she chose the same dark robe she had worn on the night when Pascal Ferailleur was ruined at her house and as she was even paler than usual she tried to conceal the fact by a prodigal use of rouge
At ten oclock when the first arrivals entered the brilliantly lighted rooms they found her seated as usual on the sofa near the fire with the same eternal unchangeable smile upon her lips
There were at least forty persons in the room and the gambling had become quite animated when the baron entered
Madame dArgeles read in his eyes that he was the bearer of good news
Everything is going on well he whispered as he shook hands with her
I have seen M FerailleurI wouldnt give ten sous for Valorsays and Coralths chances
This intelligence revived Madame dArgeless drooping spirits and she received M de Coralth with perfect composure when he came to pay his respects to her soon afterward
For he had the impudence to come in order to dispel any suspicions that might have been aroused anent his complicity in the cardcheating affair
The hostesss calmness amazed him
Was she still ignorant of her brothers death and the complications arising from it or was she only acting a part
He was so anxious and undecided that instead of mingling with the groups of talkers he at once took a seat at the cardtable whence he could watch the poor womans every movement
Both rooms were full and almost everybody was engaged in play when shortly after midnight a servant entered the room whispered a few words in his mistresss ear and handed her a card
She took it glanced at it and uttered so harsh so terrible so heartbroken a cry that several of the guests sprang to their feet
What is it
What is it
they asked
She tried to reply but could not
Her lips parted she opened her mouth but no sound came forth
She turned ghastly white under her rouge and a wild unnatural light gleamed in her eyes
One curious guest without a thought of harm tried to take the card which she still held in her clinched hand but she repulsed him with such an imperious gesture that he recoiled in terror
What is it
What is the matter with her
was the astonished query on every side
At last with a terrible effort she managed to reply Nothing
And then after clinging for a moment to the mantelshelf in order to steady herself she tottered out of the room
VII
It was not enough to tell M Wilkie the secret of his birth
He must be taught how to utilize the knowledge
The Viscount de Coralth devoted himself to this task and burdened Wilkie with such a host of injunctions that it was quite evident he had but a poor opinion of his pupils sagacity
That woman dArgeles he thought is as sharp as steel
She will deceive this young idiot completely if I dont warn him
So he did warn him and Wilkie was instructed exactly what to do and say how to answer any questions and what position to take up according to circumstances
Moreover he was especially enjoined to distrust tears and not to let himself be put out of countenance by haughty airs
The Viscount spent at least an hour in giving explanations and advice to the great disgust of M Wilkie who feeling that he was being treated like a child somewhat testily declared that he was no fool and that he knew how to take care of himself as well as any one else
Still this did not prevent M de Coralth from persisting in his instructions until he was persuaded that he had prepared his pupil for all possible emergencies
He then rose to depart
Thats all I think he remarked with a shade of uneasiness
Ive traced the planyou must execute it and keep cool or the games lost
His companion rose proudly
If it fails it wont be from any fault of mine he answered with unmistakable petulance
Lose no time
Theres no danger of that
And understand that whatever happens my name is not to be mentioned
Yes yes
If there should be any new revelations I will inform you
At the club
Yes but dont be uneasy the affair is as good as concluded
I hope so indeed
Wilkie gave a sigh of relief as he saw his visitor depart
He wished to be alone so as to brood over the delights that the future had in store for him
He was no longer to be limited to a paltry allowance of twenty thousand francs
No more debts no more ungratified longings
He would have millions at his disposal
He seemed to see them to hold them to feel them gliding in golden waves between his fingers
What horses he would have
what carriages
what mistresses
And a gleam of envy that he had detected in M de Coralths eyes put the finishing touch to his bliss
To be envied by this brilliant viscount his model and his ideal what happiness it was
The reputation that Madame dArgeles bore had at first cast a shadow over his joy but this shadow had soon vanished
He was troubled by no foolish prejudices and personally he cared little or nothing for his mothers reputation
The prejudices of society must of course be considered
But nonsense
society has no prejudices nowadays when millionaires are concerned and asks no questions respecting their parents
Society only requires passports of the indigent
Besides no matter what Madame dArgeles might have done she was none the less a Chalusse the descendant of one of the most aristocratic families in France
Such were Wilkies meditations while he was engaged in dressing himself with more than usual care
He had been quite shocked by the suggestion that Madame dArgeles might try to deny him and he wished to appear before her in the most advantageous light
His toilette was consequently a lengthy operation
However shortly after twelve oclock he was ready
He cast a last admiring glance at himself in the mirror twirled his mustaches and departed on his mission
He even went on foot which was a concession to what he considered M de Coralths absurd ideas
The aspect of the Hotel dArgeles in the Rue de Berry impressed him favorably but at the same time it somewhat disturbed his superb assurance
Everything is very stylish here he muttered
A couple of servantsthe concierge and Jobwere standing at the door engaged in conversation
M Wilkie approached them and in his most imposing manner but not without a slight tremble in his voice requested to see Madame dArgeles
Madame is in the country replied the concierge she will not return before this evening
If monsieur will leave his card  Oh
thats quite unnecessary
I shall be passing again
This too was in obedience to the instructions of M de Coralth who had advised him not to send in his name but to gain admission into Madame dArgeless presence as speedily as possible without giving her time to prepare herself for the interview and Wilkie had ultimately decided that these precautions might not prove as superfluous as he had at first supposed
But this first mishap annoyed him extremely
What should he do
how should he kill time till the evening
A cab was passing
He hired it for a drive to the Bois whence he returned to the boulevards played a game of billiards with one of the coproprietors of Pompier de Nanterre and finally dined at the Cafe Riche devoting as much time as possible to the operation
He was finishing his coffee when the clock struck eight
He caught up his hat drew on his gloves and hastened to the Hotel dArgeles again
Madame has not yet returned said the concierge who knew that his mistress had only just risen from her bed but I dont think it will be long
And if monsieur wishes No replied M Wilkie brusquely and he was going off in a furious passion when on crossing the street he chanced to turn his head and notice that the reception rooms were brilliantly lighted up
Ah
I think that a very shabby trick
grumbled the intelligent youth
They wont succeed in playing that game on me again
Why shes there now
It occurred to him that Madame dArgeles had perhaps described him to her servants and had given them strict orders not to admit him
Ill find out if that is the case even if I have to wait here until tomorrow morning he thought angrily
However he had not been on guard very long when he saw a brougham stop in front of the mansion whereupon the gate opened as if by enchantment
The vehicle entered the courtyard deposited its occupants and drove away
A second carriage soon appeared then a third and then five or six in quick succession
And does she think Ill wear out my shoeleather here while everybody else is allowed to enter
he grumbled
NeverIve an idea
And without giving himself time for further deliberation he returned to his rooms arrayed himself in eveningdress and sent for his carriage
You will drive to Noin the Rue de Berry he said
There is a soiree there and you can drive directly into the courtyard
The coachman obeyed and M Wilkie realized that his idea was really an excellent one
As soon as he alighted the doors were thrown open and he ascended a handsome staircase heavily carpeted and adorned with flowers
Two liveried footmen were standing at the door of the drawingroom and one of them advanced to relieve Wilkie of his overcoat but his services were declined
I dont wish to go in said the young man roughly
I wish to speak with Madame dArgeles in private
She is expecting meinform her
Here is my card
The servant was hesitating when Job suspecting some mystery perhaps approached
Take in the gentlemans card he said with an air of authority and opening the door of a small room on the lefthand side of the staircase he invited Wilkie to enter saying If monsieur will be kind enough to take a seat I will summon madame at once
M Wilkie sank into an armchair considerably overcome
The air of luxury that pervaded the entire establishment the liveried servants the lights and flowers all impressed him much more deeply than he would have been willing to confess
And in spite of his affected arrogance he felt that the superb assurance which was the dominant trait in his character was deserting him
In his breast moreover in the place where physiologists locate the heart he felt certain extraordinary movements which strongly resembled palpitations
For the first time it occurred to him that this woman whose peace he had come to destroy was not only the heiress of the Count de Chalusses millions but also his mother that is to say the good fairy whose protection had followed him everywhere since he entered the world
The thought that he was about to commit an atrocious act entered his mind but he drove it away
It was too late now to draw back or even to reflect
Suddenly a door opposite the one by which he had entered opened and Madame dArgeles appeared on the threshold
She was no longer the woman whose anguish and terror had alarmed her guests
During the brief moment of respite which fate had granted her she had summoned all her energy and courage and had mastered her despair
She felt that her salvation depended upon her calmness and she had succeeded in appearing calm haughty and disdainfulas impassive as if she had been a statue
Was it you sir who sent me this card
she inquired
Greatly disconcerted M Wilkie could only bow and stammer out an almost unintelligible answer
Excuse me
I am much grieved upon my word
I disturb you perhaps You are Monsieur Wilkie
interrupted Madame dArgeles in a tone of mingled irony and disdain
Yes he replied drawling out the name affectedly I am M
Wilkie
Did you desire to speak with me
inquired Madame dArgeles dryly
In factyes
I should like Very well
I will listen to you although your visit is most inopportune for I have eighty guests or more in my drawingroom
Still speak
It was very easy to say speak but unfortunately for M Wilkie he could not articulate a syllable
His tongue was as stiff and as dry as if it had been paralyzed
He nervously passed and repassed his fingers between his neck and his collar but although this gave full play to his cravat his words did not leave his throat any more readily
For he had imagined that Madame dArgeles would be like other women he had known but not at all
He found her to be an extremely proud and aweinspiring creature who to use his own vocabulary SQUELCHED him completely
I wished to say to you he repeated I wished to say to you But the words he was seeking would not come and so at last angry with himself he exclaimed Ah
you know as well as I why I have come
Do you dare to pretend that you dont know
She looked at him with admirably feigned astonishment glanced despairingly at the ceiling shrugged her shoulders and replied Most certainly I dont knowunless indeed it be a wager
A wager
M Wilkie wondered if he were not the victim of some practical joke and if there were not a crowd of listeners hidden somewhere who after enjoying his discomfiture would suddenly make their appearance holding their sides
This fear restored his presence of mind
Well then he replied huskily this is my reason
I know nothing respecting my parents
This morning a man with whom you are well acquainted assured me that I wasyour son
I was completely stunned at first but after a while I recovered sufficiently to call here and found that you had gone out
He was interrupted by a nervous laugh from Madame dArgeles
For she was heroic enough to laugh although death was in her heart and although the nails of her clinched hands were embedded deep in her quivering flesh
And you believed him monsieur
she exclaimed
Really this is too absurd
Iyour mother
Why look at me He was doing nothing else he was watching her with all the powers of penetration he possessed
Madame dArgeless laugh had an unnatural ring that awakened his suspicions
All Coralths recommendations buzzed confusedly in his ears and he judged that the moment had come to do the sentimental as he would have expressed it
So he lowered his head and in an aggrieved tone exclaimed Ah
you think it very amusing I dont
Do you realize how wretched it makes one to live as utterly alone as a leper without a soul to love or care for you
Other young men have a mother sisters relatives
I have no one
Ah
if But I only have friends while my money lasts
He wiped his eyes dry as they were with his handkerchief and in a still more pathetic tone resumed Not that I want for anything I receive a very handsome allowance
But when my relatives have given me the wherewithal to keep me from starving they imagine their duty is fulfilled
I think this very hard
I didnt come into the world at my own request did I
I didnt ask to be born
If I was such an annoyance to them when I came into existence why didnt they throw me into the river
Then they would have been well rid of me and I should be out of my misery
He stopped short struck dumb with amazement for Madame dArgeles had thrown herself on her knees at his feet
Have mercy
she faltered Wilkie my son forgive me
Alas
the unfortunate woman had failed in playing a part which was too difficult for a mothers heart
You have suffered cruelly my son she continued but IIAh
you cant conceive the frightful agony it costs a mother to separate from her child
But you were not deserted Wilkie dont say that
Have you not felt my love in the air around you
YOU forgotten
Know then that for years and years I have seen you every day and that all my thoughts and all my hopes are centered in you alone
Wilkie
She dragged herself toward him with her hands clasped in an agony of supplication while he recoiled frightened by this outburst of passion and utterly amazed by his easily won victory
The poor woman misunderstood this movement
Great God
she exclaimed he spurns me he loathes me
Ah
I knew it would be so
Oh
why did you come
What infamous wretch sent you here
Name him Wilkie
Do you understand now why I concealed myself from you
I dreaded the day when I should blush before you before my own son
And yet it was for your sake
Death would have been a rest a welcome release for me
But your breath was ebbing away your poor little arms no longer had strength to clasp me round the neck
And then I cried Perish my soul and body if only my child can be saved
I believed such a sacrifice permissible in a mother
I am punished for it as if it were a crime
I thought you would be happy my Wilkie
I said to myself that you my pride and joy would move freely and proudly far above me and my shame
I accepted ignominy so that your honor might be preserved intact
I knew the horrors of abject poverty and I wished to save my son from it
I would have licked up the very mire in your pathway to save you from a stain
I renounced all hope for myself and I consecrated all that was noble and generous in my nature to you
Oh
I will discover the vile coward who sent you here who betrayed my secret
I will discover him and I will have my revenge
You were never to know this Wilkie
In parting from you I took a solemn oath never to see you again and to die without the supreme consolation of feeling your lips upon my forehead
She could not continue sobs choked her utterance
And for more than a minute the silence was so profound that one could hear the sound of low conversation in the hall outside the exclamations of the players as they greeted each unexpected turn of luck and occasionally a cry of Banco
or I stake one hundred louis
Standing silent and motionless near the window Wilkie gazed with consternation at Madame dArgeles his mother who was crouching in the middle of the room with her face hidden in her hands and sobbing as if her heart would break
He would willingly have given his third share in Pompier de Nanterre to have made his escape
The strangeness of the scene appalled him
It was not emotion that he felt but an instinctive fear mingled with commiseration
And he was not only ill at ease but he was angry with himself for what he secretly styled his weakness
Women are incomprehensible he thought
It would be so easy to explain things quietly and properly but they must always cry and have a sort of melodrama
Suddenly the sound of footsteps near the door roused him from his stupor
He shuddered at the thought that some one might come in
He hated the very idea of ridicule
So summoning all his courage he went toward Madame dArgeles and raising her from the floor he exclaimed Dont cry so
You grieve me upon my word
Pray get up
Some one is coming
Do you hear me
Some one is coming
Thereupon as she offered no resistance he half led half carried her to an armchair into which she sank heavily
Now she is going to faint
thought Wilkie in despair
What should he do
Call for help
He dared not
However necessity inspired him
He knelt at Madame dArgeless feet and gently said Come come be reasonable
Why do you give way like this
I dont reproach you
Slowly with an air of humility which was indescribably touching she took her hands from her face and for the first time raised her tearstained eyes to her sons
Wilkie she murmured
Madame
She heaved a deep sigh and in a halfstifled voice MADAME
she repeated
Will you not call me mother
Yes of coursecertainly
Butonly you know it will take me some time to acquire the habit
I shall do so of course but I shall have to get used to it you know
True very truebut tell me it is not mere pity that leads you to make this promise
If you should hate meif you should curse mehow should I bear it
Ah
when a woman reaches the years of understanding one should never cease repeating to her Take care
Your son will be twenty some day and you will have to meet his searching gaze
You will have to render an account of your honor to him
My God
If women thought of this they would never sin
To be reduced to such a state of abject misery that one dares not lift ones head before ones own son
Alas
Wilkie I know only too well that you cannot help despising me
No indeed
Not at all
What an idea
Tell me that you forgive me
I do upon my word I do
Poor woman her face brightened
She so longed to believe him
And her son was beside her so near that she felt his breath upon her cheek
It was he indeed
Had they ever been separated
She almost doubted it she had lived so near him in thought
It was with a sort of ecstasy that she looked at him
There was a world of entreaty in her eyes they seemed to be begging a caress she raised her quivering lips to his but he did not observe it
For a long time she hesitated fearing he might spurn her but at last yielding to a supreme impulse she threw her arms around his neck drew him toward her and pressed him to her heart in a close embrace
My son
my son
she repeated to have you with me again after all these years
Unfortunately no whirlwind of passion was capable of carrying M Wilkie beyond himself
His emotion was now spent and his mind had regained its usual indifference
He flattered himself that he was a man of mettleand he remained as cold as ice beneath his mothers kisses
Indeed he barely tolerated them and if he did allow her to embrace him it was only because he did not know how to refuse
Will she never have done
he thought
This is a pretty state of things
I must be very attractive
How Costard and Serpillon would laugh if they saw me now
Costard and Serpillon were his intimate friends the coproprietors of the famous steeplechaser
In her rapture however Madame dArgeles did not observe the peculiar expression on her sons face
She had compelled him to take a chair opposite her and with nervous volubility she continued If I dont deny myself the happiness of embracing you again it is because I have not broken the vow I took never to make myself known to you
When I entered this room I was firmly resolved to convince you no matter how that you had been deceived
God knows that it was not my fault if I did not succeed
There are some sacrifices that are above human strength
M Wilkie deigned to smile
Oh
yes I saw your little game he said with a knowing air
But I had been well posted and besides it is not very easy to fool me
Madame dArgeles did not even hear him
Perhaps destiny is weary of afflicting us she continued perhaps a new life is about to begin
Through you Wilkie
I can again be happy
I who for years have lived without even hope
But will you have courage to forget
What
She hung her head and in an almost inaudible voice replied The past Wilkie
But with an air of the greatest indifference he snapped his fingers and exclaimed Nonsense
What is past is past
Such things are soon forgotten
Paris has known many such cases
You are my mother I care very little for public opinion
I begin by pleasing myself and I consult other people afterward and when they are dissatisfied I tell them to mind their own business
The poor woman listened to these words with a joy bordering on rapture
One might have supposed that the strangeness of her sons expressions would have surprised herhave enlightened her in regard to his true characterbut no
She only saw and understood one thingthat he had no intention of casting her off but was indeed ready to devote himself to her
My God
she faltered is this really true
Will you allow me to remain with you
Oh dont reply rashly
Consider well before you promise to make such a sacrifice
Think how much sorrow and pain it will cost you
I have considered
It is decidedmother
She sprang up wild with hope and enthusiasm
Then we are saved
she cried
Blessed be he who betrayed my secret
And I doubted your courage my Wilkie
At last I can escape from this hell
This very night we will fly from this house without one backward glance
I will never set foot in these rooms againthe detested gamblers who are sitting here shall never see me again
From this moment Lia dArgeles is dead
M Wilkie positively felt like a man who had just fallen from the clouds
What fly
he stammered
Where shall we go then
To a country where we are unknown Wilkieto a land where you will not have to blush for your mother
But Trust yourself to me my son
I know a pleasant village near London where we can find a refuge
My connections in England are such that you need not fear the obstacles one generally meets with among foreigners
M Patterson who manages a large manufacturing establishment will I know be happy to be of service to usbut we shall not be indebted to any one for long now that you have resolved to work
On hearing these words M Wilkie sprang up in dismay
Excuse me he said I dont understand you
You propose to set me to work in M Pattersons factory
Well to tell the truth that doesnt suit me at all
It was impossible to mistake M Wilkies manner his tone or gesture
They revealed him in his true character
Madame dArgeles saw her terrible mistake at once
The bandage fell from her eyes
She had taken her dreams for realities and the desires of her own heart for those of her son
She rose trembling with sorrow and with indignation
Wilkie
she exclaimed Wilkie wretched boy
what did you dare to hope
And without giving him time to reply she continued Then it was only idle curiosity that brought you here
You wished to know the source of the money which you spend like water
Very well you may see for yourself
This is a gambling house one of those establishments frequented by distinguished personages which the police ignore or which they cannot suppress
The hubbub you hear is made by the players
Men are ruined here
Some poor wretches have blown their brains out on leaving the house others have parted with the last vestige of honor here
And the business pays me well
One louis out of every hundred that change hands falls to my share
This is the source of your wealth my son
This anger which succeeded such deep griefthis outburst of disdain following such abject humilityconsiderably astonished M Wilkie
Allow me to ask he began
But he was not allowed a hearing
Fool
continued Madame dArgeles did nothing warn you that in coming here you would deprive yourself forever of the income you received
Did no inward voice tell you that all would be changed when you compelled me Lia dArgeles to say Well yes it is true you are my son 
So long as you did not know who and what I was I had a mothers right to watch over you
I could help you without disgracing you without despising you
But now that you know me and know what I am I can do nothing more for younothing
I would rather let you starve than succor you for I would rather see you dead than dishonored by my money
But What
would you still consent to receive the allowance I have made you even if I consented to continue it
Had a viper raised its head in M Wilkies path he would not have recoiled more quickly
Never
he exclaimed
Ah no
What do you take me for
This repugnance was sincere there could be no doubt of that and it seemed to give Madame dArgeles a ray of hope
I have misjudged him she thought
Poor Wilkie
Evil advice has led him astray but he is not bad at heart
In that case my poor child she said aloud you must see that a new life is about to commence for you
What do you intend to do
How will you gain a livelihood
People must have food and clothes and a roof to shelter them
These things cost money
And where will you obtain ityou who rebel at the very word work
Ah
if I had only listened to M Patterson
He was not blind like myself
He was always telling me that I was spoiling you and ruining your future by giving you so much money
Do you know that you have spent more than fifty thousand francs during the past two years
How have you squandered them
Have you been to the lawschool a dozen times
No
But you can be seen at the races at the opera in the fashionable restaurants and at every place of amusement where a young man can squander money
And who are your associates
Dissipated and heartless idlers grooms gamblers and abandoned women
A sneer from M Wilkie interrupted her
To think that any one should dare to attack his friends his tastes and his pleasures
Such a thing was not to be tolerated
This is astonishing astonishing upon my word
said he
You moralizing
thats really too good
I should like a few minutes to laugh it is too ridiculous
Was he really conscious of the cruelty of his ironical words
The blow was so terrible that Madame dArgeles staggered beneath it
She was prepared for anything and everything except this insult from her son
Still she accepted it without rebellion although it was in a tone of heartbroken anguish that she replied Perhaps I have no right to tell you the truth
I hope the future will prove that I am wrong
However you are without resources and you have no profession
Pray Heaven that you may never know what it is to be hungry and to have no bread
For some time already the ingenious young man had shown unmistakable signs of impatience
This gloomy prediction irritated him beyond endurance
All this is empty talk he interrupted
I dont mean to work for its not at all in my line
Still I dont expect to want for anything
Thats plain enough I hope
Madame dArgeles did not wince
What do you mean to do then
she asked coldly
I dont understand you
He shrugged his shoulders impatiently
Are we to keep up this farce for ever
he petulantly exclaimed
It doesnt take with me
You know what I mean as well as I do
Why do you talk to me about dying of starvation
What about the fortune
What fortune
Eh
why my uncles of course
Your brothers the Count de Chalusse
Now M Wilkies visit manner assurance wheedling and contradictions were all explained
That maternal confidence which is so strong in the hearts of mothers vanished from Madame dArgeless for ever
The depths of selfishness and cunning she discerned in Wilkies mind appalled her
She now understood why he had declared himself ready to brave public opinionwhy he had proved willing to accept his share of the past ignominy
It was not his mothers but the Count de Chalusses estate that he claimed
Ah
so youve heard of that she said in a tone of bitter irony
And then remembering M Isidore Fortunat she asked Some one has sold you this valuable secret
How much have you promised to pay him in case of success
Although Wilkie prided himself on being very clever he did not pretend to be a diplomatist and indeed he was greatly disconcerted by this question still recovering himself he replied It doesnt matter how I obtained the information whether I paid for it or whether it cost me nothingbut I know that you are a Chalusse and that you are the heiress of the counts property which is valued at eight or ten millions of francs
Do you deny it
Madame dArgeles sadly shook her head
I deny nothing she replied but I am about to tell you something which will destroy all your plans and extinguish your hopes
I am resolved understand and my resolution is irrevocable never to assert my rights
To receive this fortune I should be obliged to confess that Lia dArgeles is a Chalusseand that is a confession which no consideration whatever will wring from me
She imagined that this declaration would silence and discomfit Wilkie but she was mistaken
If he had been obliged to depend upon himself he would perhaps have been conquered by it but he was armed with weapons which had been furnished by the cunning viscount
So he shrugged his shoulders and coolly replied In that case we should remain poor and the government would take possession of our millions
One moment
I have something to say in this matter
You may renounce your claim but I shall not renounce mine
I am your son and I shall claim the property
Even if I entreated you on my knees not to do so
Yes
Madame dArgeless eyes flashed
Very well
I will show you that this estate can never be yours
By what right will you lay claim to it
Because you are my son
But I will deny that you are
I will declare upon oath that you are nothing to me and that I dont even know you
But even this did not daunt Wilkie
He drew from his pocket a scrap of paper and flourishing it triumphantly he exclaimed It would be extremely cruel on your part to deny me but I foresaw such a contingency and here is my answer copied from the civil code Article 341
Inquiry as to maternity allowed etc etc
What the exact bearing of Wilkies threat might be Madame dArgeles did not know
But she felt that this Article 341 would no doubt destroy her last hope for the person who had chosen this weapon from the code to place it in Wilkies hand must have chosen it carefully
She understood the situation perfectly
With her experience of life she could not fail to understand the despicable part Wilkie was playing
And though it was not her son who had conceived this odious plot it was more than enough to know that he had consented to carry it into execution
Should she try to persuade Wilkie to abandon this shameful scheme
She might have done so if she had not been so horrified by the utter want of principle which she had discovered in his character
But under the circumstances she realized that any effort in this direction would prove unavailing
So it was purely from a sense of duty and to prevent her conscience from reproaching her that she exclaimed So you will apply to the courts in order to constrain me to acknowledge you as my son
If you are not reasonable That is to say you care nothing for the scandal that will be created by such a course
In order to prove yourself a member of the Chalusse family you will begin by disgracing the name and dragging it through the mire
Wilkie had no wish to prolong this discussion
So much talk about an affair which in his opinion at least was an extremely simple one seemed to him utterly ridiculous and irritated him beyond endurance
It strikes me this is much ado about nothing he remarked
One would suppose to hear you talk that you were the greatest criminal in the world
Goodness is all very well in its way but there is such a thing as having too much of it
Break loose from this life tomorrow assume your rightful name install yourself at the Hotel de Chalusse and in a week from now no one will remember that you were once known as Lia dArgeles
I wager one hundred louis on it
Why if people attempted to rake up the past life of their acquaintances they should have far too much to do
Folks do not trouble themselves as to whether a person has done this or that the essential thing is to have plenty of money
And if any fool speaks slightingly of you you can reply I have an income of five hundred thousand francs and hell say no more
Madame dArgeles listened speechless with horror and disgust
Was it really her son who was speaking in this style and to her of all people in the world
M Wilkie misunderstood her silence
He had an excellent opinion of himself but he was rather surprised at the effect of his eloquence
Besides Im tired of vegetating and having only one name he continued
I want to be on the move
Even with the small allowance Ive had I have gained a very good position in society and if I had plenty of money I should be the most stylish man in Paris
The counts estate belongs to me and so I must have itin fact I will have it
So believe me when I tell you that it will be much better for you if you acknowledge me without any fuss
Now will you do so
No
Once twice three times
Is it still no
Very well then to morrow then you may expect an official notice
I wish you good evening
He bowed he was really going for his hand was already on the doorknob
But Madame dArgeles detained him with a gesture
One word more she said in a voice hoarse with emotion
He scarcely deigned to come back and he made no attempt to conceal his impatience
Well what is it
he asked hastily
I wish to give you a bit of parting advice
The court will undoubtedly decide in your favor I shall be placed in possession of my brothers estate but neither you nor I will have the disposal of these millions
Why
Because though this fortune belongs to me the control of it belongs to your father
M Wilkie was thunderstruck
To my father
he exclaimed
Impossible
It is so however and you would not have been ignorant of the fact if your greed for money had not made you forget to question me
You believe yourself an illegitimate child
Wilkie you are mistaken
You are my legitimate child
I am a married woman Bah
And my husbandyour fatheris not dead
If he is not here now threatening our safety it is because I have succeeded in eluding him
He lost all trace of us eighteen years ago
Since then he has been constantly striving to discover us but in vain
He is still watching you may be sure of that and as soon as there is any talk of a lawsuit respecting the Chalusse property you will see him appear armed with his rights
He is the head of the familyyour master and mine
Ah
this seems to disturb you
You will find him full of insatiable greed for wealth a greed which has been whetted by twenty years waiting
You may yet see the day when you will regret the paltry twenty thousand francs a year formerly given you by your poor mother
Wilkies face was whiter than his shirt
You are deceiving me he stammered
Tomorrow I will show you my marriage certificate
Why not this evening
Because it is locked up in a room which is now full of people
And what was my fathers name
Arthur Gordonhe is an American
Then my name is Wilkie Gordon
Yes
Andis my father rich
he inquired
No
What does he do
Everything that a man can do when he has a taste for luxury and a horror for work
This reply was so explicit in its brevity and implied so many terrible accusations that Wilkie was dismayed
The devil
he exclaimed and where does he live
He lives at Baden or Homburg in the summer in Paris or at Monaco in the winter
Oh
oh
oh
ejaculated Wilkie in three different tones
He knew what he had to expect from such a father as that
Anger now followed stuporone of those terrible white rages which stir the bile and not the blood
He saw his hopes and his cherished visions fade
Luxury and notoriety highstepping horses yellow haired mistresses all vanished
He pictured himself reduced to a mere pittance and held in check and domineered over by a brutal father
Ah
I understand your game he hissed through his set teeth
If you would only quietly assert your rights everything could be arranged privately and I should have time to put the property out of my fathers reach before he could claim it
Instead of doing thatas you hate meyou compel me to make the affair public so that my father will hear of it and defraud me of everything
But you wont play this trick on me
You are going to write at once and make known your claim to your brothers estate
No
Ah
you wont
You refuse He approached threateningly and caught hold of her arm
Take care
he vociferated take care
Do not infuriate me beyond endurance As cold and rigid as marble Madame dArgeles faced him with the undaunted glance of a martyr whose spirit no violence can subdue
You will obtain nothing from me she said firmly nothing nothing nothing
Maddened with rage and disappointment M Wilkie dared to lift his hand as if about to strike her
But at this moment the door was flung open and a man sprang upon him
It was Baron Trigault
Like the other guests the baron had seen the terrible effect produced upon Madame dArgeles by a simple visiting card
But he had this advantage over the others he thought he could divine and explain the reason of this sudden seemingly incomprehensible terror
The poor woman has been betrayed he thought her son is here
Still while the other players crowded around their hostess he did not leave the cardtable
He was sitting opposite M de Coralth and he had seen the dashing viscount start and change color
His suspicions were instantly aroused and he wished to verify them
He therefore pretended to be more than ever absorbed in the cards and swore lustily at the deserters who had broken up the game
Come back gentleman come back he cried angrily
We are wasting precious time
While you have been trifling there I might have gainedor losta hundred louis
He was nevertheless greatly alarmed and the prolonged absence of Madame dArgeles increased his fears each moment
At the end of an hour he could restrain himself no longer
So taking advantage of a heavy loss he rose from the table swearing that the beastly turmoil of a few moments before had changed the luck
Then passing into the adjoining drawingroom he managed to make his escape unobserved
Where is madame
he inquired of the first servant he met
In the little sittingroom
Alone
No a young gentleman is with her
The baron no longer doubted the correctness of his conjectures and his disquietude increased
Quickly and as if he had been in his own house he hastened to the door of the little sittingroom and listened
At that moment rage was imparting a truly frightful intonation to M Wilkies voice
The baron really felt alarmed
He stooped applied his eye to the keyhole and seeing M Wilkie with his hand uplifted he burst open the door and went in
He arrived only just in time to fell Wilkie to the floor and save Madame dArgeles from that most terrible of humiliations the degradation of being struck by her own son
Ah you rascal
cried the worthy baron transported with indignation you beggarly rascal
you brigand
Is this the way you treat an unfortunate woman who has sacrificed herself for youyour mother
You try to strike your mother when you ought to kiss her very footprints
As livid as if his blood had been suddenly turned to gallwith quivering lips and eyes starting from their socketsM Wilkie rose with difficulty to his feet at the same time rubbing his left elbow which had struck against the corner of a piece of furniture in his fall
Scoundrel
You brutal scoundrel
he growled ferociously
And then retreating a step Who gave you permission to come in here
he added
Who are you
By what right do you meddle with my affairs
By the right that every honest man possesses to chastise a cowardly rascal
M Wilkie shook his fist at the baron
You are a coward yourself he retorted
You had better learn who you are talking to
You must mend your manners a little you old The word he uttered was so vile that no man could fail to resent it much less the baron who was already frantic with passion
His faced turned as purple as if he were stricken with apoplexy and such furious rage gleamed in his eyes that Madame dArgeles was frightened
She feared she should see her son butchered before her very eyes and she extended her arms as if to protect him
Jacques she said beseechingly Jacques
This was the name which was indelibly impressed upon Wilkies memorythe name he had heard when he was but a child
Jacques that was the name of the man who had brought him cakes and toys in the comfortable rooms where he had remained only a few days
He understood or at least he thought he understood everything
Ah ha
he exclaimed with a laugh that was at once both ferocious and idiotic
This is very finemonsieur is the lover
He has the say herehe He did not have time to finish his sentence for quick as thought the baron caught him by the collar lifted him from the ground with irresistible strength and flung him on his knees at Madame dArgeless feet exclaiming Ask her pardon you vile wretch
Ask her pardon or Or meant the barons clinched fist descending like a sledgehammer on M Wilkies head
The worthy youth was frightenedso terribly frightened that his teeth chattered
Pardon
he faltered
Louderspeak up better than that
Your mother must answer you
Alas
the poor woman could no longer hear
She had endured so much during the past hour that her strength was exhausted and she had fallen back in her armchair in a deep swoon
The baron waited for a moment and seeing that her eyes remained obstinately closed he exclaimed This is your work wretch
And lifting him again as easily as if he had been a child he set him on his feet saying in a calmer tone but in one that admitted of no reply Arrange your clothes and go
This advice was not unnecessary
Baron Trigault had a powerful hand and M Wilkies attire was decidedly the worse for the encounter
He had lost his cravat his shirtfront was crumpled and torn and his waistcoatone of those that open to the waist and are fastened by a single buttonhung down in the most dejected manner
He obeyed the barons order without a word but not without considerable difficulty for his hands trembled like a leaf
When he had finished the baron exclaimed Now be off and never set foot here againunderstand menever set foot here again never
M Wilkie made no reply until he reached the door leading into the hall
But when he had opened it he suddenly regained his powers of speech
Im not afraid of you he cried with frantic violence
You have taken advantage of your superior strength you are a coward
But this shall not end here
Noyou shall answer for it
I shall find your address and tomorrow you will receive a visit from my friends M Costard and M Serpillon
I am the insulted partyand I choose swords
A frightful oath from the baron somewhat hastened M Wilkies exit
He went out into the hall and holding the door open in a way that would enable him to close it at the shortest notice he shouted back so as to be heard by all the servants Yes I will have satisfaction
I will not stand such treatment
Is it any fault of mine that Madame dArgeles is a Chalusse and that she wishes to defraud me of my fortune
Tomorrow I call you all to witness there will be a lawyer here
You dont frighten me
Here is my card
And actually before he closed the door he threw one of his cards into the middle of the room
The baron did not trouble himself to pick it up his attention was devoted to Madame dArgeles
She was lying back in her armchair white motionless and rigid to all appearance dead
What should the baron do
He did not wish to call the servants they had heard too much alreadybut he had almost decided to do so when his eyes fell upon a tiny aquarium in a corner of the room
He dipped his handkerchief in it and alternately bathed Madame dArgeless temples and chafed her hands
It was not long before the cold water revived her
She trembled a convulsive shudder shook her from head to foot and at last she opened her eyes murmuring Wilkie
I have sent him away replied the baron
Poor woman
with returning life came the consciousness of the terrible reality
He is my son
she moaned my son my Wilkie
Then with a despairing gesture she pressed her hands to her forehead as if to calm its throbbings
And I believed that my sin was expiated she pursued
I thought I had been sufficiently punished
Fool that I was
This is my chastisement Jacques
Ah
women like me have no right to be mothers
A burning tear coursed down the barons cheek but he concealed his emotion as well as he could and said in a tone of assumed gayety Nonsense
Wilkie is younghe will mend his ways
We were all ridiculous when we were twenty
We have all caused our mothers many anxious nights
Time will set everything to rights and put some ballast in this young madcaps brains
Besides your friend Patterson doesnt seem to me quite free from blame
In knowledge of books he may have been unequalled but as a guardian for youth he must have been the worst of fools
After keeping your son on a short allowance for years he suddenly gorges him with oatsor I should say moneylets him loose and then seems surprised because the boy is guilty of acts of folly
It would be a miracle if he were not
So take courage and hope for the best my dear Lia
She shook her head despondingly
Do you suppose that my heart hasnt pleaded for him
she said
I am his mother I can never cease to love him whatever he may do
Even now I am ready to give a drop of blood for each tear I can save him
But I am not blind I have read his nature
Wilkie has no heart
Ah
my dear friend how do you know what shameful advice he may have received before coming to you
Madame dArgeles half rose and said in an agitated voice What
you try to make me believe that
Advice
Then he must have found a man who said to him Go to the house of this unfortunate woman who gave you birth and order her to publish her dishonor and yours
If she refuses insult and beat her
You know even better than I baron that this is impossible
In the vilest natures and when every other honorable feeling has been lost love for ones mother survives
Even convicts deprive themselves of their wine and sell their rations in order to send a trifle now and then to their motherswhile he She paused not because she shrunk from what she was about to say but because she was exhausted and out of breath
She rested for a moment and then resumed in a calmer tone Besides the person who sent him here had counselled coolness and prudence
I discovered this at once
It was only toward the close of the interview and after an unexpected revelation from me that he lost all control over himself
The thought that he would lose my brothers millions crazed him
Oh
that fatal and accursed money
Wilkies adviser wished him to employ legal means to obtain an acknowledgment of his parentage and he had copied from the Code a clause which is applicable to this case
By this one circumstance I am convinced that his adviser is a man of experience in such mattersin other words the business agent What business agent
inquired the baron
The person who called here the other day M Isidore Fortunat
Ah
why didnt I not bribe him to hold his peace
The baron had entirely forgotten the existence of Victor Chupins honorable employer
You are mistaken Lia he replied
M Fortunat has had no hand in this
Then who could have betrayed my secret
Why your former ally the rascal for whose sake you allowed Pascal Ferailleur to be sacrificedthe Viscount de Coralth
The bare supposition of such treachery on the viscounts part brought a flush of indignant anger to Madame dArgeless cheek
Ah
if I thought that
she exclaimed
And then remembering what reasons the baron had for hating M de Coralth she murmured No
Your animosity misleads youhe wouldnt dare
The baron read her thoughts
So you are persuaded that it is personal vengeance that I am pursuing
said he
You think that fear of ridicule and public odium prevents me from striking M de Coralth in my own name and that I am endeavoring to find some other excuse to crush him
This might have been so once but it is not the case now
When I promised M Ferailleur to do all in my power to save the young girl he loves Mademoiselle Marguerite my wifes daughter I renounced all thought of self all my former plans
And why should you doubt Coralths treachery
You yourself promised me to unmask HIM
If he has betrayed YOU my poor Lia he has only been a little in advance of you
She hung her head and made no reply
She had forgotten this
Besides continued the baron you ought to know that when I make such a statement I have some better foundation for it than mere conjecture
It was to some purpose that I watched M de Coralth during your absence
When the servant handed you that card he turned extremely pale
Why
Because he knew whose card it was
After you left the room his hands trembled like leaves and his mind was no longer occupied with the game
Hewho is usually such a cautious playerrisked his money recklessly
When the cards came to him he did still worse and though luck favored him he made the strangest blunders and lost
His agitation and preoccupation were so marked as to attract attention and one acquaintance laughingly inquired if he were ill while another jestingly remarked that he had dined and wined a little too much
The traitor was evidently on coals of fire
I could see the perspiration on his forehead and each time the door opened or shut he changed color as if he expected to see you and Wilkie enter
A dozen times I surprised him listening eagerly as if by dint of attention or by the magnetic force of his will he hoped to hear what you and your son were saying
With a single word I could have wrung a confession from him
This explanation was so plausible that Madame dArgeles felt half convinced
Ah
if you had only spoken that word
she murmured
The baron smiled a crafty and malicious smile which would have chilled M de Coralths very blood if he had chanced to see it
I am not so stupid
he replied
We mustnt frighten the fish till we are quite ready
Our net is the Chalusse estate and Coralth and Valorsay will enter it of their own accord
It is not my plan but M Ferailleurs
Theres a man for you
and if Mademoiselle Marguerite is worthy of him they will make a noble pair
Without suspecting it your son has perhaps rendered us an important service this evening Alas
faltered Madame dArgeles I am none the less ruinedthe name of Chalusse is none the less dishonored
She wanted to return to the drawingroom but she was compelled to relinquish this idea
The expression of her face betrayed too plainly the terrible ordeal she had passed through
The servants had heard M Wilkies parting words and news of this sort flies about with the rapidity of lightning
That very night indeed it was currently reported at the clubs that there would be no more cardplaying at the dArgeles establishment as that lady was a Chalusse and consequently the aunt of the beautiful young girl whom M and Madame de Fondege had taken under their protection
VIII
Unusual strength of character unbounded confidence in ones own energy with thorough contempt of danger and an invincible determination to triumph or perish are all required of the person who like Mademoiselle Marguerite intrusts herself to the care of strangersworse yet to the care of actual enemies
It is no small matter to place yourself in the power of smoothtongued hypocrites and impostors who are anxious for your ruin and whom you know to be capable of anything
And the task is a mighty one to brave unknown dangers perilous seductions perfidious counsels and perhaps even violence at the same time retaining a calm eye and smiling lips
Yet such was the heroism that Marguerite although scarcely twenty displayed when she left the Hotel de Chalusse to accept the hospitality of the Fondege family
And to crown all she took Madame Leon with herMadame Leon whom she knew to be the Marquis de Valorsays spy
But brave as she was when the moment of departure came her heart almost failed her
There was despair in the parting glance she cast upon the princely mansion and the familiar faces of the servants
And there was no one to encourage or sustain her
Ah yes
standing at a window on the second floor with his forehead pressed close against the pane of glass she saw the only friend she had in the worldthe old magistrate who had defended encouraged and sustained herthe man who had promised her his assistance and advice and prophesied ultimate success
Shall I be a coward
she thought shall I be unworthy of Pascal
And she resolutely entered the carriage mentally exclaiming The die is cast
The General insisted that she should take a place beside Madame de Fondege on the back seat while he found a place next to Madame Leon on the seat facing them
The drive was a silent and tedious one
The night was coming on it was a time when all Paris was on the move and the carriage was delayed at each street corner by a crowd of passing vehicles
The conversation was solely kept alive by the exertions of Madame de Fondege whose shrill voice rose above the rumble of the wheels as she chronicled the virtues of the late Count de Chalusse and congratulated Mademoiselle Marguerite on the wisdom of her decision
Her remarks were of a commonplace description and yet each word she uttered evinced intense satisfaction almost delight as if she had won some unexpected victory
Occasionally the General leaned from the carriage window to see if the vehicle laden with Mademoiselle Marguerites trunks was following them but he said nothing
At last they reached his residence in the Rue Pigalle
He alighted first offered his hand successively to his wife Mademoiselle Marguerite and Madame Leon and motioned the coachman to drive away
But the man did not stir
Pardonexcuse me monsieur he said but my employers baderequested me What
To ask youyou know for the farethirtyfive francsnot counting the little gratuity
Very wellI will pay you tomorrow
Excuse me monsieur but if it is all the same to you would you do so this evening
My employer said that the bill had been standing a long time already
What scoundrel
But Madame de Fondege who was on the point of entering the house suddenly stepped back and drawing out her pocketbook exclaimed Thats enough
Here are thirtyfive francs
The man went to his carriage lamp to count the money and seeing that he had the exact amountAnd my gratuity
he asked
I give none to insolent people replied the General
You should take a cab if you havent money enough to pay for coaches replied the driver with an oath
Ill be even with you yet
Marguerite heard no more for Madame de Fondege caught her by the arm and hurried her up the staircase saying Quick
we must make haste
Your baggage is here already and we must see if the rooms I intended for youfor you and your companionsuit you
When Marguerite reached the second floor Madame de Fondege hunted in her pocket for her latchkey
Not finding it she rang
A tall manservant of impudent appearance and arrayed in a glaring livery opened the door carrying an old battered iron candlestick in which a tiny scrap of candle was glaring and flickering
What
exclaimed Madame de Fondege the receptionroom not lighted yet
This is scandalous
What have you been doing in my absence
Come make haste
Light the lamp
Tell the cook that I have some guests to dine with me
Call my maid
See that M Gustaves room is in order
Go down and see if the General doesnt need your assistance about the baggage
Finding it difficult to choose between so many contradictory orders the servant did not choose at all
He placed his rusty candlestick on one of the sidetables in the receptionroom and gravely without saying a single word went out into the passage leading to the kitchen
Evariste
cried Madame de Fondege crimson with anger Evariste you insolent fellow
As he deigned no reply she rushed out in pursuit of him
And soon the sound of a violent altercation arose the servant lavishing insults upon his mistress and she unable to find any response save I dismiss you you are an insolent scampI dismiss you
Madame Leon who was standing near Mademoiselle Marguerite in the receptionroom seemed greatly amused
This is a strange household said she
A fine beginning upon my word
But the worthy housekeeper was the last person on earth to whom Mademoiselle Marguerite wished to reveal her thoughts
Hush Leon she replied
We are the cause of all this disturbance and I am very sorry for it
The retort that rose to the housekeepers lips was checked by the return of Madame de Fondege followed by a servantgirl with a turnup nose a pert manner and who carried a lighted candle in her hand
How can I apologize madame began Mademoiselle Marguerite for all the trouble I am giving you
Ah
my dear child Ive never been so happy
Come come and see your room
And while they crossed several scantilyfurnished apartments Madame de Fondege continued It is I who ought to apologize to you
I fear you will pine for the splendors of the Hotel de Chalusse
We are not millionaires like your poor father
We have only a modest competence no more
But here we are
The maid had opened a door and Mademoiselle Marguerite entered a goodsized room lighted by two windows hung with soiled wall paper and adorned with chintz curtains from which the sun had extracted most of the coloring
Everything was in disorder here and in fact the whole room was extremely dirty
The bed was not made the washstand was dirty some woollen stockings were hanging over the side of the rumpled bed and on the mantelshelf stood an ancient clock an empty beer bottle and some glasses
On the floor on the furniture in the corners everywhere in fact stumps of cigars were scattered in profusion as if they had positively rained down
What
gasped Madame de Fondege you havent put this room in order Justine
Indeed madame I havent had time
But its more than a month since M Gustave slept here
I know it but madame must remember that I have been very much hurried this last month having to do all the washing and ironing since the laundress Thats sufficient interrupted Madame de Fondege
And turning to Marguerite she said You will I am sure excuse this disorder my dear child
By this time tomorrow the room shall be transformed into one of those dainty nests of muslin and flowers which young girls delight in
Connected with this apartment which was known to the household as the lieutenants room there was a much smaller chamber lighted only by a single window and originally intended for a dressing room
It had two doors one of them communicating with Marguerites room and the other with the passage and it was now offered to Madame Leon who on comparing these quarters with the spacious suite of rooms she had occupied at the Hotel de Chalusse had considerable difficulty in repressing a grimace
Still she did not hesitate nor even murmur
M de Valorsays orders bound her to Marguerite and she deemed it fortunate that she was allowed to follow her
And whether the marquis succeeded or not he had promised her a sufficiently liberal reward to compensate for all personal discomfort
So in the sweetest of voices and with a feigned humility of manner she declared this little room to be even much too good for a poor widow whose misfortunes had compelled her to abdicate her position in society
The attentions which M and Madame de Fondege showed her contributed not a little to her resignation
Without knowing exactly what the General and his wife expected from Mademoiselle Marguerite she was shrewd enough to divine that they hoped to gain some important advantage
Now her dear child had declared her to be a trusted friend who was indispensable to her existence and comfort
So these people will pay assiduous court to me she thought
And being quite ready to play a double part as the spy of the Marquis de Valorsay and the Fondege family and quite willing to espouse the latters cause should that prove to be the more remunerative course she saw a long series of polite attentions and gifts before her
That very evening her prophecies were realized and she received a proof of consideration which positively delighted her
It was decided that she should take her meals at the family table a thing which had never happened at the Hotel de Chalusse
Mademoiselle Marguerite raised a few objections which Madame Leon answered with a venomous look but Madame de Fondege insisted upon the arrangement not understanding she said graciously why they need deprive themselves of the society of such an agreeable and distinguished person
Madame Leon in no wise doubted but this favor was due to her merit alone but Mademoiselle Marguerite who was more discerning saw that their hostess was really furious at the idea but was compelled to submit to it by the imperious necessity of preventing Madame Leon from coming in contact with the servants who might make some decidedly compromising disclosures
For there were evidently many little mysteries and makeshifts to be concealed in this household
For instance while the servants were carrying the luggage upstairs Marguerite discovered Madame de Fondege and her maid in close consultation whispering with that volubility which betrays an unexpected and pressing perplexity
What were they talking about
She listened without any compunctions of conscience and the words a pair of sheets repeated again and again furnished her with abundant food for reflection
Is it possible she thought that they have no sheets to give us
It did not take her long to discover the maids opinion of the establishment in which she served for while she brandished her broom and duster this girl exasperated undoubtedly by the increase of work she saw in store for her growled and cursed the old barrack where one was worked to death where one never had enough to eat and where the wages were always in arrears
Mademoiselle Marguerite was doing her best to aid the maid who was greatly surprised to find this handsome queenly young lady so obliging when Evariste the same who had received warning an hour before made his appearance and announced in an insolent tone that Madame la Comtesse was served
For Madame de Fondege exacted this title
She had improvised it as her husband had improvised his title of General and without much more difficulty
By a search in the family archives she had discoveredso she declared to her intimate friendsthat she was the descendant of a noble family and that one of her ancestors had held a most important position at the court of Francis I or of Louis XII
Indeed she sometimes confounded them
However people who had not known her father the wood merchant saw nothing impossible in the statements
Evariste was dressed as a butler should be dressed when he announces dinner to a person of rank
In the daytime when he discharged the duties of footman he was gorgeous in gold lace but in the evening he arrayed himself in severe black such as is appropriate to the butler of an aristocratic household
Immediately after his announcement everybody repaired to the sumptuous diningroom which with its huge sideboards loaded with silver and rare china looked not unlike a museum
Such was the display indeed that when Mademoiselle Marguerite took a seat at the table between the General and his wife and opposite Madame Leon she asked herself if she had not been the victim of that dangerous optical delusion known as prejudice
She noticed that the supply of knives and forks was rather scanty but many economical housewives keep most of their silver under lock and key besides the china was very handsome and marked with the Generals monogram surmounted by his wifes coronet
However the dinner was badly cooked and poorly served
One might have supposed it to be a scullery maids first attempt
Still the General devoured it with delight
He partook ravenously of every dish a flush rose to his cheeks and an expression of profound satisfaction was visible upon his countenance
From this thought Mademoiselle Marguerite I must infer that he usually goes hungry and that this seems a positive feast to him
In fact he seemed bubbling over with contentment
He twirled his mustaches a la Victor Emmanuel and rolled his r as he said Sacrrrrre bleu
even more ferociously than usual
It was only by a powerful effort that he restrained himself from indulging in various witticisms which would have been most unseemly in the presence of a poor girl who had just lost her father and all her hopes of fortune
But he did forget himself so much as to say that the drive to the cemetery had whetted his appetite and to address his wife as Madame Rangeabord a title which had been bestowed upon her by a sailor brother
Crimson with anger to the very roots of her coarse sandy hair amazed to see her husband deport himself in this style and almost suffocated by the necessity of restraining her wrath Madame de Fondege was heroic enough to smile though her eyes flashed ominously
But the General was not at all dismayed
On the contrary he cared so little for his wifes displeasure that when the dessert was served he turned to the servant and with a wink that Mademoiselle Marguerite noticed Evariste he ordered go to the winecellar and bring me a bottle of old Bordeaux
The valet who had just received a weeks notice was only too glad of an opportunity for revenge
So with a malicious smile and in a drawling tone he replied Then monsieur must give me the money
Monsieur knows very well that neither the grocer nor the winemerchant will trust him any longer
M de Fondege rose from the table looking very pale but before he had time to utter a word his wife came to the rescue
You know my dear that I dont trust the key of my cellar to this lad
Evariste call Justine
The pertlooking chambermaid appeared and her mistress told her where she would find the key of the famous cellar
About a quarter of an hour afterward one of those bottles which grocers and winemerchants prepare for the benefit of credulous customers was brought ina bottle duly covered with dust and mould to give it a venerable appearance and festooned with cobwebs such as the urchins of Paris collect and sell at from fifteen sous to two francs a pound according to quality
But the Bordeaux did not restore the Generals equanimity
He was silent and subdued and his relief was evident when after the coffee had been served his wife exclaimed We wont keep you from your club my dear
I want a chat with our dear child
Since she dismissed the General so unceremoniously Madame de Fondege evidently wished for a teteatete with Mademoiselle Marguerite
At least Madame Leon thought so or feigned to think so and addressing the young girl she said I shall be obliged to leave you for a couple of hours my dear young lady
My relatives would never forgive me if I did not inform them of my change of residence
This was the first time since she had been engaged by the Count de Chalusse that the estimable companion had ever made any direct allusion to her relatives and what is more to relatives residing in Paris
She had previously only spoken of them in general terms giving people to understand that her relatives had not been unfortunate like herselfthat they still retained their exalted rank though she had fallen and that she found it difficult to decline the favors they longed to heap upon her
However Mademoiselle Marguerite evinced no surprise
Go at once and inform your relatives my dear Leon she said without a shade of sarcasm in her manner
I hope they wont be offended by your devotion to me
But in her secret heart she thought This hypocrite is going to report to the Marquis de Valorsay and these relatives of hers will furnish her with excuses for future visits to him
The General went off the servants began to clear the table and Mademoiselle Marguerite followed her hostess to the drawingroom
It was a lofty and spacious apartment lighted by three windows and even more sumptuous in its appointments than the diningroom
Furniture carpets and hangings were all in rather poor taste perhaps but costly very costly
As the evening was a cold one Madame de Fondege ordered the fire to be lighted
She seated herself on a sofa near the mantelpiece and when Mademoiselle Marguerite had taken a chair opposite her she began Now my dear child let us have a quiet talk
Mademoiselle Marguerite expected some important communication so that she was not a little surprised when Madame de Fondege resumed Have you thought about your mourning
About my mourning madame
Yes
I mean have you decided what dresses you will purchase
It is an important matter my dearmore important than you suppose
They are making costumes entirely of crepe now puffed and plaited and extremely stylish
I saw one that would suit you well
You may think that a costume for deep mourning made with puffs would be a trifle LOUD but that depends upon tastes
The Duchess de Veljo wore one only eleven days after her husbands death and she allowed some of her hair which is superb to fall over her shoulders a la pleureuse and the effect was extremely touching
Was Madame de Fondege speaking sincerely
There could be no doubt of it
Her features which had been distorted with anger when the General took it into his head to order the bottle of Bordeaux had regained their usual placidity of expression and had even brightened a little
I am entirely at your service my dear if you wish any shopping done she continued
And if you are not quite pleased with your dressmaker I will take you to mine who works like an angel
But how absurd I am
You will of course employ Van Klopen
I go to him occasionally myself but only on great occasions
Between you and me I think him a trifle too high in his charges
Mademoiselle Marguerite could scarcely repress a smile
I must confess madame that from my infancy I have been in the habit of making almost all my dresses myself
The Generals wife raised her eyes to Heaven in real or feigned astonishment
Yourself
she repeated four or five times as if to make sure that she had heard aright
Yourself
That is incomprehensible
You the daughter of a man who possessed an income of five or six hundred thousand francs a year
Still I know that poor M de Chalusse though unquestionably a very worthy and excellent man was peculiar in some of his ideas
Excuse me madame
What I did I did for my own pleasure
But this assertion exceeded Madame de Fondeges powers of comprehension
Impossible
she murmured impossible
But my poor child what did you do for fashionsfor patterns
The immense importance she attached to the matter was so manifest that Marguerite could not refrain from smiling
I was probably not a very close follower of the fashions she replied
The dress that I am wearing now
Is very pretty my child and it becomes you extremely thats the truth
Only to be frank I must confess that this style is no longer wornnonot at all
You must have your new dresses made in quite a different way
But I already have more dresses than I need madame
What
black dresses
I seldom wear anything but black
Evidently her hostess had never heard anything like this before
Oh
all right said she these dresses will doubtless do very well for your first months of mourningbut afterward
Do you suppose my poor dear that Im going to allow you to shut yourself up as you did at the Hotel de Chalusse
Good heavens
how dull it must have been for you alone in that big house without society or friends
A tear fell from Marguerites long lashes
I was very happy there madame she murmured
You think so but you will change your mind
When one has never tasted real pleasure one cannot realize how gloomy ones life really is
No doubt you were very unhappy alone with M de Chalusse
Oh
madame Tut
tut
my dear I know what I am talking about
Wait until you have been introduced into society before you boast of the charms of solitude
Poor dear
I doubt if you have ever attended a ball in your whole life
No
I was sure of it and you are twenty
Fortunately I am here
I will take your mothers place and we will make up for lost time
Beautiful as you are my child for you are divinely beautifulyou will reign as a queen wherever you appear
Doesnt that thought make that cold little heart of yours throb more quickly
Ah
fetes and music wonderful toilettes and the flashing of diamonds the admiration of gentlemen the envy of rivals the consciousness of ones own beauty are these delights not enough to fill any womans life
It is intoxication perhaps but an intoxication which is happiness
Was she sincere or did she hope to dazzle this lonely girl and then rule her through the tastes she might succeed in giving her
As is not unfrequently the case with callous natures Madame de Fondege was a compound of frankness and cunning
What she was saying now she really meant and as it was to her interest to say it she urged her opinions boldly and even eloquently
Twenty four hours earlier proud and truthful Marguerite would have silenced her at once
She would have told her that such pleasures could never have any charm for her and that she felt only scorn and disgust for such worthless aims and sordid desires
But having resolved to appear a dupe she concealed her real feelings under an air of surprise and was astonished and even ashamed to find that she could dissemble so well
Besides continued Madame de Fondege a marriageable young girl should never shut herself up like a nun
She will never find a husband if she remains at homeand she must marry
Indeed marriage is a sensible womans only object in life since it is her emancipation
Was Madame de Fondege going to plead her sons cause
Mademoiselle Marguerite almost believed itbut the lady was too shrewd for that
She took good care not to mention as much as Lieutenant Gustaves name
The season will certainly be unusually brilliant she said and it will begin very early
On the fifth of November the Countess de Commarin will give a superb fete all Paris will be there
On the seventh there will be a ball at the house of the Viscountess de Bois dArdon
On the eleventh there will be a concert followed by a ball at the superb mansion of the Baroness Trigaultyou knowthe wife of that strange man who spends all his time in playing cards
This is the first time I ever heard the name mentioned
Really
and you have been living in Paris for years
It seems incomprehensible
You must know then my dear little ignoramus that the Baroness Trigault is one of the most distinguished ladies in Paris and certainly the best dressed
I am sure her bill at Van Klopens is not less than a hundred thousand francs a year and that is saying enough is it not
And with genuine pride she added The baroness is my friend
I will introduce you to her
Having once started on this theme Madame de Fondege was not easily silenced
It was evidently her ambition to be considered a woman of the world and to be acquainted with all the leaders of fashionable society and in fact if one listened to her conversation for an hour one could learn all the gossip of the day
Though she was unable to interest herself in this tittle tattle Marguerite was pretending to listen to it with profound attention when the drawingroom door suddenly opened and Evariste appeared with an impudent smile on his face
Madame Landoire the milliner is here and desires to speak with Madame la Comtesse he said
On hearing this name Madame de Fondege started as if she had been stung by a viper
Let her wait she said quickly
I will see her in a moment
The order was useless for the visitor was already on the threshold
She was a tall darkhaired illmannered woman
Ah
Ive found you at last she said rudely and Im not sorry
This is the fourth time Ive come here with my bill
Madame de Fondege pointed to Mademoiselle Marguerite and exclaimed Wait at least until I am alone before you speak to me on business
Madame Landoire shrugged her shoulders
As if you were ever alone she growled
I wish to put an end to this
Step into my room then and we will put an end to it and at once
This opportunity to escape from Madame de Fondege must not be allowed to pass so Marguerite asked permission to withdraw declaring what was really the truth that she felt completely tired out
After receiving a maternal kiss from her hostess accompanied by a sleep well my dear child she retired to her own room
Thanks to Madame Leons absence she found herself alone and drawing a blottingpad from one of her trunks she hastily wrote a note to M Isidore Fortunat telling him that she would call upon him on the following Tuesday
I must be very awkward she thought if tomorrow on going to mass I cant find an opportunity to throw this note into a letterbox without being observed
It was fortunate that she had lost no time for her writingcase was scarcely in its place again before Madame Leon entered evidently out of sorts
Well asked Marguerite did you see your friends
Dont speak of it my dear young lady they were all of them away from homethey had gone to the play
Ah
So I shall go again early tomorrow morning you must realize how important it is
Yes I understand
But Madame Leon who was usually so loquacious did not seem to be in a talkative mood that evening and after kissing her dear young lady she went into her own room
She did not succeed in finding the Marquis de Valorsay thought Marguerite and being in doubt as to the part she is to play she feels furious
The young girl tried to sum up the impressions of the evening and to decide upon a plan of conduct but she felt sad and very weary
She said to herself that rest would be more beneficial than anything else and that her mind would be clearer on the morrow so after a fervent prayer in which Pascal Ferailleurs name was mentioned several times she prepared for bed
But before she fell asleep she was able to collect another bit of evidence
The sheets on her bed were new
If Marguerite had been born in the Hotel de Chalusse if she had known a fathers and a mothers tender care from her infancy if she had always been protected by a large fortune from the stern realities of life there would have been no hope for her now that she was left poor and alonefor how can a girl avoid dangers she is ignorant of
But from her earliest childhood Marguerite had studied the difficult science of real life under the best of teachersmisfortune
Cast upon her own resources at the age of thirteen she had learned to look upon everybody and everything with distrust and by relying only on herself she had become strangely cautious and clearsighted
She knew how to watch and how to listen how to deliberate and how to act
Two men the Marquis de Valorsay and M de Fondeges son coveted her hand and one of the two the marquis so she believed was capable of any crime
Still she felt no fears
She had been in danger once before when she was little more than a child when the brother of her employer insulted her with his attentions but she had escaped unharmed
Deceit was certainly most repugnant to her truthloving nature but it was the only weapon of defence she possessed
And so on the following day she carefully studied the abode of her entertainers
And certainly the study was instructive
The Generals household was truly Parisian in character or at least it was what a Parisian household inevitably becomes when its inmates fall a prey to the constantly increasing passion for luxury and display to the furore for aping the habits and expenditure of millionaires and to the noble and elevated desire of humiliating and outshining their neighbors
Ease health and comfort had been unscrupulously sacrificed to show
The dining room was magnificent the drawingroom superb but these were the only comfortably furnished apartments in the establishment
The other rooms were bare and desolate
It is true that Madame de Fondege had a handsome wardrobe with glass doors in her own room but this was an article which the friend of the fashionable Baroness Trigault could not possibly dispense with
On the other hand her bed had no curtains
The aspect of the place fittingly explained the habits and manners of the inmates
What sinister fears must have haunted them
for how could this extreme destitution in one part of the establishment be reconciled with the luxury noticeable in the other except by the fact that a desperate struggle to keep up appearances was constantly going on
And this constant anxiety made outdoor noise excitement and gayety a necessity of their existence and caused them to welcome anything that took them from the home where they had barely sufficient to deceive society and not enough to impose upon their creditors
And they keep three servants thought Mademoiselle Margueritethree enemies who spend their time in ridiculing them and torturing their vanity
Thus on the very first day after her arrival she realized the real situation of the General and his wife
They were certainly on the verge of ruin when Mademoiselle Marguerite accepted their hospitality
Everything went to prove this the coachmans insolent demand the servants impudence the grocers refusal to furnish a single bottle of wine on credit the milliners persistence and lastly the new sheets on the visitors beds
Yes thought Mademoiselle Marguerite to herself the Fondeges were ruined when I came here
They would never have sunk so low if they had not been utterly destitute of resources
So if they rise again if money and credit come back again then the old magistrate is rightthey have obtained possession of the Chalusse millions
IX On this side at least Mademoiselle Marguerite had no very wide field of investigation to explore
Her common sense told her that her task would merely consist in carefully watching the behavior of the General and his wife in noting their expenditure and so on
It was a matter of close attention and of infinitesimal trifles
Nor was she much encouraged by her first success
It was perhaps important and yet it might be nothing
For she felt that the real difficulties would not begin until she became morally certain that the General had stolen the millions that were missing from the counts escritoire
Even then it would remain for her to discover how he had obtained possession of this money
And when she had succeeded in doing this would her task be ended
Certainly not
She must obtain sufficient evidence to give her the right of accusing the General openly and in the face of every one
She must have material and indisputable proofs before she could say A robbery has been committed
I was accused of it
I was innocent
Here is the culprit
What a long journey must be made before this goal was reached
No matter
Now that she had a positive and fixed point of departure she felt that she possessed enough energy to sustain her in her endeavors for years if need be
What troubled her most was that she could not logically explain the conduct of her enemies from the time M de Fondege had asked her hand for his son up to the present moment
And first why had they been so audacious or so imprudent as to bring her to their own home if they had really stolen one of those immense amounts that are sure to betray their possessors
They are mad she thought or else they must deem me blind deaf and more stupid than mortal ever was
Secondly why should they be so anxious to marry her to their son Lieutenant Gustave
This also was a puzzling question
However she was fully decided on one point the suspicions of the Fondege family must not be aroused
If they were on their guard it would be the easiest thing in the world for them to pay their debts quietly and increase their expenditure so imperceptibly that she would not be able to prove a sudden acquisition of wealth
But the events of the next few days dispelled these apprehensions
That very afternoon although it was Sunday it became evident that a shower of gold had fallen on the Generals abode
The doorbell rang incessantly for several hours and an interminable procession of tradesmen entered
It looked very much as if M de Fondege had called a meeting of his creditors
They came in haughty and arrogant with their hats upon their heads and surly of speech like people who have made up their minds to accept their loss but who intend to pay themselves in rudeness
They were ushered into the drawingroom where the General was holding his levee they remained there from five to ten minutes and then bowing low with hat in hand they retired with radiant countenances and an obsequious smile on their lips
So they had been paid
And as if to prove to Mademoiselle Marguerite that her suspicions were correct she chanced to be present when the livery stablekeeper presented his bill
Madame de Fondege received him very haughtily
Ah
here you are
she exclaimed rudely as soon as he appeared
So you are the man who teaches his drivers to insult his customers
That is an excellent way to gain patronage
What
I hire a onehorse carriage from you by the month and because I happen to wish for a twohorse vehicle for a single day you make me pay the difference
You should demand payment in advance if you are so suspicious
The stablekeeper who had a bill for nearly four thousand francs in his pocket stood listening with the air of a man who is meditating some crushing reply but she did not give him time to deliver it
When I have cause to complain of the people I employ I dismiss them and replace them by others
Insolence is one of those things that I never forgive
Give me your bill
The man in whose face doubt fear and hope had succeeded each other in swift succession thereupon drew an interminable bill from his pocket
And when he saw the banknotes when he saw the bill paid without dispute or even examination he was seized with a wondering respect and his voice became sweeter than honey
They say the payment of a bad debt delights a merchant a thousand times more than the settlement of fifty good ones
The truth of this assertion became apparent in the present case
Mademoiselle Marguerite thought the man was going to beg Madame la Comtesse to do him the favor to withhold a portion of the small amount
For the Parisian tradesman is so constituted that very frequently it is not necessary to pay him money but only to show it
However this creditors abnegation did not extend so far still he did entreat Madame la Comtesse not to leave him on account of a blunderfor it was a blunderhe swore it on his childrens heads
His coachman was only a fool and a drunkard who had misunderstood him entirely and whom he should ignominiously dismiss on returning to his establishment
But Madame la Comtesse was inflexible
She sent the man about his business saying I never place myself in a position to be treated with disrespect a second time
This probably accounted for the fact that Evariste the footman who had been so wanting in respect the previous evening had been sent away that very morning
Mademoiselle Marguerite did not see him again
Dinner was served by a new servant who had been sent by an Employment Office and engaged without a question no doubt because Evaristes livery fitted him like a glove
Had the cook also been replaced
Mademoiselle Marguerite thought so though she had no means of convincing herself on this point
It was certain however that the Sunday dinner was utterly unlike that of the evening before
Quality had replaced quantity and care profusion
It was not necessary to send to the cellar for a bottle of ChateauLaroze it made its appearance at the proper moment warmed to the precise degree of temperature and seemed quite to the taste of excellent Madame Leon
In twentyfour hours the Fondege family had been raised to such affluence that they must have asked themselves if it were possible they had ever known the agonies of that life of false appearances and sham luxury which is a thousand times worse than an existence of abject poverty
Is it possible that I am deceived
Marguerite said to herself on retiring to her room that evening
For it surprised her that a keensighted person like Madame Leon should not have remarked this revolution but the worthy companion merely declared the General and his wife to be charming people and did not cease to congratulate her dear young lady upon having accepted their hospitality
I feel quite at home here said she and though my room is a trifle small I shall have nothing to wish for when it has been refurnished
Mademoiselle Marguerite spent a restless and uncomfortable night
In spite of her reason in spite of the convincing proofs she had seen the most disturbing doubts returned
Might she not have judged the situation with a prejudiced mind
Had the Fondeges really been as reduced in circumstances as she supposed
Like every one who has been unfortunate she feared illusions and was extremely distrustful of everything that seemed to favor her hopes and wishes
The only thing that really encouraged her was the thought that she could consult the old magistrate and that M de Chalusses former agent might succeed in finding Pascal Ferailleur
M Fortunat must have received her letter by this time he would undoubtedly expect her on Tuesday and it only remained for her to invent some excuse which would give her a couple of hours liberty without awakening suspicion
She rose early the next morning and had almost completed her toilette when she heard some one in the passage outside rapping at the door of Madame Leons room
Whos there
inquired that worthy lady
It was Justine Madame de Fondeges maid who answered in a pert voice Here is a letter madame which has just been sent up by the concierge
It is addressed to Madame Leon
That is your name is it not
Marguerite staggered as if she had received a heavy blow
My God
a letter from the Marquis de Valorsay
she thought
It was evident that the estimable lady was expecting this missive by the eagerness with which she sprang out of bed and opened the door
And Marguerite heard her say to the servant in her sweetest voice A thousand thanks my child
Ah
this is a great relief I have heard from my brotherinlaw at last
I recognize his hand writing
And then the door closed again
Standing silent and motionless in the middle of her room Marguerite listened with that feverish anxiety that excites the perceptive faculties to the utmost degree
An inward voice stronger than reason told her that this letter threatened her happiness her future perhaps her life
But how could she convince herself of the truth of this presentiment
If she had followed her first impulse she would have rushed into Madame Leons room and have snatched the letter from her hands
But if she did this she would betray herself and prove that she was not the dupe they supposed her to be and this supposition on the part of her enemies constituted her only chance of salvation
If she could only watch Madame Leon as she read the letter and gain some information from the expression of her face but this seemed impossible for the keyhole was blocked up by the key which had been left in the lock on the other side
Suddenly a crack in the partition attracted her attention and finding that it extended through the wall she realized she might watch what was passing in the adjoining room
So she approached the spot on tiptoe and with bated breath stooped and looked in
In her impatience to learn the contents of her letter Madame Leon had not gone back to bed
She had broken the seal and was reading the missive standing barefooted in her nightdress directly opposite the little crevice
She read line after line and word after word and her knitted brows and compressed lips suggested deep concentration of thought mingled with discontent
At last she shrugged her shoulders muttered a few inaudible words and laid the open letter upon the rickety chest of drawers which with two chairs and a bed constituted the entire furniture of her apartment
My God
exclaimed Marguerite with bated breath if she would only forget it
But she did not forget it
She began to dress and when she had finished she read the letter again and then placed it carefully in one of the drawers which she locked putting the key in her pocket
I shall never know then thought Marguerite no I shall never know
But I must knowand I will
she added vehemently
From that moment a firm determination to obtain that letter took possession of her mind and so deeply was she occupied in seeking for some means to surmount the difficulties which stood in her way that she did not say a dozen words during breakfast
I must be a fool if I cant find some way of gaining possession of that letter she said to herself again and again
Im sure I could find in it the explanation of the abominable intrigue which Pascal and I are the victims of
Happily her preoccupation was not remarked
Each person present was too deeply engrossed in his or her own concerns to notice the behavior of the others
Madame Leons mind was occupied with the news she had just received and besides her attention was considerably attracted by some partridges garnished with truffles and a bottle of ChateauLaroze
For she was rather fond of good living the dear lady as she confessed herself adding that no one is perfect
The General talked of nothing but a certain pair of horses which he was to look at that afternoon and which he thought of buyingbeing quite disgusted with jobmasters so he declared
Besides he expected to get the animals at a bargain as they were the property of a young gentleman who had been led to commit certain misdemeanors by his love of gambling and his passion for a notorious woman who was addicted with an insatiable desire for jewelry
As for Madame de Fondege her head seemed to have been completely turned by the prospect of the approaching fete at the Countess de Commarins
She had only a fortnight left to make her preparations
All the evening before through part of the night and ever since she had been awake that morning she had been racking her brain to arrive at an effective combination of colors and materials
And at the cost of a terrible headache she had at last conceived one of those toilettes which are sure to make a sensation and which the newspaper reporters will mention as noticeable for its chic
Picture to yourself she said all ablaze with enthusiasm picture to yourself a robe of teaflower silk trimmed with bands of heavy hollandtinted satin thickly embroidered with flowers
A wide flounce of Valenciennes at the bottom of the skirt
Over this I shall wear a tunic of pearl gray crepe edged with a fringe of the various shades in the dress and forming a panier behind
But how much trouble time and labor must be expended before such an elaborate chefdoeuvre could be completed
How many conferences with the dressmaker with the florist and the embroiderer
How many doubts how many inevitable mistakes
Ah
there was not a moment to lose
Madame de Fondege who was dressed to go out and who had already sent for a carriage insisted that Mademoiselle Marguerite should accompany her
And certainly the Generals wife deemed the proposal a seductive one
It is a very fashionable amusement to run from one shop to another even when one cannot or will not buy
It is a custom which some noble ladies have imported from America to the despair of the poor shopkeepers
And thus every fine afternoon the swell shops are filled to overflowing with richlyattired dames and damsels who ask to see all the new goods
It is far more amusing than remaining at home
And when they return to dinner in the evening after inspecting hundreds of yards of silk and satin they are very well pleased with themselves for they have not lost the day
Nor do the shrewdest always return from these expeditions empty handed
A dozen gloves or a piece of lace can be hidden so easily in the folds of a mantle
And yet to Madame de Fondeges great surprise Marguerite declined the invitation
I have so many things to put in order she added feeling that an excuse was indispensable
But Madame Leon who had not the same reasons as her dear child for wishing to remain at home kindly offered her services
She was acquainted with several of the best shops she declared particularly with the establishment of a dealer in laces in the Rue de Mulhouse and thanks to an introduction from her Madame de Fondege could not fail to conclude a very advantageous bargain there
Very well replied Madame de Fondege I will take you with me then but make haste and dress while I put on my bonnet
They left the breakfastroom at the same time closely followed by Mademoiselle Marguerite who was disturbed by a hope which she scarcely dared confess to herself
With her forehead resting against the wall and her eye peering through the tiny crack she watched her governess change her dress throw a shawl over her shoulders put on her best bonnet and after a glance at the lookingglass rush from the room exclaiming Here I am my dear countess
Im ready
And a few moments afterward they left the house together
As the outer door closed after them Marguerites brain whirled
If she were not deceived Madame Leon had left the key of the drawers in the pocket of the dress she had just taken off
So it was with a wildly throbbing heart that she opened the communicating door and entered her companions room
She hastily approached the bed on which the dress was lying and with a trembling hand she began to search for the pocket
Fortune favored her
The key was there
The letter was within her reach
But she was about to do a deed against which her whole nature revolted
To steal a key to force an article of furniture open and violate the secret of a private correspondence these were actions so repugnant to her sense of honor and her pride that for some time she stood irresolute
At last the instinct of self preservation overpowered her scruples
Was not her honor and Pascals honor also at stakeas well as their mutual love and happiness
It would be folly to hesitate
she murmured
And with a firm hand she placed the key in the lock
The latter was out of order and the drawer was only opened with difficulty
But there on some clothes which Madame Leon had not yet found time to arrange Marguerite saw the letter
She eagerly snatched it up unfolded it and read Dear Madame Leon Dear me she muttered here is the name in full
This is an indiscretion which will render denial difficult
And she resumed her perusal Your letter which I have just received confirms what my servants had already told me that twice during my absenceon Saturday evening and Sunday morningyou called at my house to see me
So Mademoiselle Marguerites penetration had served her well
All this talk about anxious relatives had only been an excuse invented by Madame Leon to enable her to absent herself whenever occasion required
I regret continued the letter that you did not find me at home for I have instructions of the greatest importance to give you
We are approaching the decisive moment
I have formed a plan which will completely and forever efface all remembrance of that cursed P F in case any one condescended to think of him after the disgrace we fastened upon him the other evening at the house of Madame dArgeles
P Fthese initials of course meant Pascal Ferailleur
Then he was innocent and she held an undeniable irrefutable proof of his innocence in her hands
How coolly and impudently Valorsay confessed his atrocious crime
A bold stroke is in contemplation which if no unfortunate and wellnigh impossible accident occur will throw the girl into my arms
Marguerite shuddered
The girl referred to her of course
Thanks to the assistance of one of my friends added the letter I can place this proud damsel in a perilous terribly perilous position from which she cannot possibly extricate herself unaided
But just as she gives herself up for lost I shall interpose
I shall save her and it will be strange if gratitude does not work the necessary miracle in my favor
The plan is certain to succeed
Still it will be all the better if the physician who attended M de C in his last moments and whom you spoke to me about Dr Jodon if I remember rightly will consent to lend us a helping hand
What kind of a man is he
If he is accessible to the seductive influence of a few thousand francs I shall consider the business as good as concluded
Your conduct up to the present time has been a chefdoeuvre for which you shall be amply compensated
You have cause to know that I am not ungrateful
Let the Fs continue their intrigues and even pretend to favor them
I am not afraid of these people
I understand their game perfectly and know why they wish my little one to marry their son
But when they become troublesome I shall crush them like glass
In spite of these explanations which I have just given you for your guidance it is very necessary that I should see you
I shall look for you on Tuesday afternoon between three and four oclock
Above all dont fail to bring me the desired information respecting Dr Jodon
I am my dear madame devotedly yoursV Below ran a postscript which read as follows When you come on Tuesday bring this letter with you
We will burn it together
Dont imagine that I distrust youbut there is nothing so dangerous as letters
For some time Marguerite stood stunned and appalled by the Marquis de Valorsays audacity and by the language of this letter which was at once so obscure and so clear every line of it threatening her future
The reality surpassed her worst apprehensions but realizing the gravity of the situation she shook off the torpor stealing over her
She felt that every second was precious and that she must act and act at once
But what should she do
Simply return the letter to its place and continue to act the role of a dupe as if nothing had happened
No that must not be
It would be madness not to seize this flagrant proof of the Marquis de Valorsays infamy
But on the other hand if she kept the letter Madame Leon would immediately discover its loss and an explanation would be unavoidable
M de Valorsay would be worsted but not annihilated and the plans which made the physicians intervention a necessity would never be revealed
She thought of hastening to her friend the old magistrate but he lived a long way off and time was pressing
Besides she might not find him at home
Then she thought of going to a notary to a judge
She would show them the letter and they could take a copy of it
But nothis would do no goodthe marquis could still deny it
She was becoming desperate and was accusing herself of stupidity when a sudden inspiration illumined her mind turning night into day as it were
Oh Pascal we are saved
she exclaimed
And without pausing to deliberate any longer she threw a mantle over her shoulders hastily tied on her bonnet and hurried from the house without saying a word to any one
Unfortunately she was not acquainted with this part of Paris and on reaching the Rue Pigalle she was at a loss for her way
Unwilling to waste any more time she hastily entered a grocers shop at the corner of the Rue Pigalle and the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette and anxiously inquired Do you know any photographer in this neighborhood monsieur
Her agitation made this question seem so singular that the grocer looked at her closely for a moment as if to make sure that she was not jesting
You have only to go down the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette he replied and on the lefthand side at the foot of the hill you will find the photographer Carjat
Thank you
The grocer stepped to the door to watch her
That girls certainly lightheaded he thought
Her demeanor was really so extraordinary that it attracted the attention of the passersby
She saw this and slackening her pace tried to become more composed
At the spot the grocer had indicated she perceived several show frames filled with photographs hanging on either side of a broad open gateway above which ran the name E
Carjat
She went in and seeing a man standing at the door of an elegant pavilion on the righthand side of a large courtyard she approached him and asked for his employer
He is here replied the man
Does madame come for a photograph
Yes
Then will madame be so kind as to pass in
She will not be obliged to wait long
There are only four or five persons before her
Four or five persons
How long would she be obliged to waithalf an hourtwo hours
She had not the slightest idea
But she DID know that she had not a second to lose that Madame Leon might return at any moment and find the letter missing and to crown all she remembered now that she had not even locked the drawer again
I cannot wait she said imperiously
I must speak to M Carjat at once
But At once I tell you
Go and tell him that he must come
Her tone was so commanding and there was so much authority in her glance that the servant hesitated no longer
He ushered her into a little sittingroom and said If madame will take a seat I will call monsieur
She sank on to a chair for her limbs were failing her
She was beginning to realize the strangeness of the step she had takento fear the result it might lead toand to be astonished at her own boldness
But she had no time to prepare what she wished to say for a man of fiveandthirty wearing a mustache and imperial and clad in a velvet coat entered the room and bowing with an air of surprise exclaimed You desire to speak with me madame
I have a great favor to ask of you monsieur
Of me
She drew M de Valorsays letter from her pocket and showing it to the photographer she said I have come to you monsieur to ask you to photograph this letterbut at oncebefore meand quicklyvery quickly
The honor of two persons is imperilled by each moment I lose here
Mademoiselle Marguerites embarrassment was extreme
Her cheeks were crimson and she trembled like a leaf
Still her attitude was proud generous enthusiasm glowed in her dark eyes and her tone of voice revealed the serenity of a lofty soul ready to dare anything for a just and noble cause
This striking contrastthis struggle between girlish timidity and a lovers virgil energy endowed her with a strange and powerful charm which the photographer made no attempt to resist
Unusual as was the request he did not hesitate
I am ready to do what you desire madame he replied bowing again
Oh
monsieur how can I ever thank you
He did not stop to listen to her thanks
Not wishing to return to the receptionroom where five or six clients were impatiently awaiting their turn he called one of his subordinates and ordered him to bring the necessary apparatus at once
While he was speaking Mademoiselle Marguerite paused but as soon as his instructions were concluded she remarked Perhaps you are too hasty sir
You have not allowed me to explain and perhaps what I desire is impossible
I came on the impulse of the moment without any knowledge on the subject
Before you set to work I must know if what you can do will answer my purpose
Speak madame
Will the copy you obtain be precisely like the original in every particular
In every particular
The writing will be the sameexactly the same
Absolutely the same
So like that if one of your photographs should be presented to the person who wrote this letter He could no more deny his handwriting than he could if some one handed him the letter itself
And the operation will leave no trace on the original
None
A smile of triumph played upon Mademoiselle Marguerites lips
It was as she had thought the defensive plan which she had suddenly conceived was a good one
One more question sir she resumed
I am only a poor ignorant girl excuse me and give me the benefit of your knowledge
This letter will be returned to its author tomorrow and he will burn it
But afterward in case of any difficultyin case of a lawsuitor in case it should be necessary for me to prove certain things which one might establish by means of this letter would one of your photographs be admitted as evidence
The photographer did not answer for a moment
Now he understood Mademoiselle Marguerites motive and the importance she attached to a facsimile
But this imparted an unexpected gravity to the service he was called upon to perform
He therefore wished some time for reflection and he scrutinized Mademoiselle Marguerite as if he were trying to read her very soul
Was it possible that this young girl with such a pure and noble brow and with such frank honest eyes could be meditating any cowardly dishonorable act
No he could not believe it
In whom or in what could he trust if such a countenance deceived him
My facsimile would certainly be admitted as evidence he replied at last and this would not be the first time that the decision of a court has depended on proofs which have been photographed by me
Meanwhile his assistant had returned bringing the necessary apparatus with him
When all was ready the photographer asked her Will you give me the letter madame
She hesitated for a secondonly for a second
The mans honest kindly face told her that he would not betray her that he would rather give her assistance
So she handed him the Marquis de Valorsays letter saying with melancholy dignity It is my happiness and my future that I place in your handsand I have no fears
He read her thoughts and understood that she either dared not ask for a pledge of secrecy or else that she thought it unnecessary
He took pity on her and his last doubt fled
I shall read this letter madame said he but I am the only person who will read it
I give you my word on that
No one but myself will see the proofs
Greatly moved she offered him her hand and simply said Thanks I am more than repaid
To obtain an absolutely perfect facsimile of a letter is a delicate and sometimes lengthy operation
However at the end of about twenty minutes the photographer possessed two negatives that promised him perfect proofs
He looked at them with a satisfied air and then returning the letter to Mademoiselle Marguerite he said In less than three days the facsimiles will be ready madame and if you will tell me to what address I ought to send them She trembled on hearing these words and quickly answered Dont send them sirkeep them carefully
Great heavens
all would be lost if it came to the knowledge of any one
I will send for them or come myself
And feeling the extent of her obligation she added But I will not go without introducing myselfI am Mademoiselle Marguerite de Chalusse
And thereupon she went off leaving the photographer surprised at the adventure and dazzled by his strange visitors beauty
Rather more than an hour had elapsed since Marguerite left M de Fondeges house
How time flies
she murmured quickening her pace as much as she could without exciting remarkhow time flies
But hurried as she was she stopped and spent five minutes at a shop in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette where she purchased some black ribbon and a few other trifles
How else could she explain and justify her absence if the servants who had probably discovered she had gone out chanced to speak of it
But her heart throbbed as if it would burst as she ascended the Generals staircase and anxiety checked her breathing as she rang the bell
What if Madame de Fondege and Madame Leon had returned and the abstraction of the letter been discovered
Fortunately Madame de Fondege required more than an hour to purchase the materials for the elaborate toilette she had dreamt of
The ladies were still out and Mademoiselle Marguerite found everything in the same condition as she had left it
She carefully placed the letter in the drawer again locked it and put the key in the pocket of Madame Leons dress
Then she breathed freely once more and for the first time in six days she felt something very like joy in her heart
Now she had no fear of the Marquis de Valorsay
She had him in her power
He would destroy his letter the next day and think that he was annihilating all proofs of his infamy
Not so
At the decisive moment at the very moment of his triumph she would produce the photograph of this letter and crush him
And sheonly a young girlhad outwitted this consummate scoundrel
I have not been unworthy of Pascal she said to herself with a flash of pride
However her nature was not one of those weak ones which are become intoxicated by the first symptom of success and then relax in their efforts
When her excitement had abated a little she was inclined to disparage rather than to exaggerate the advantage she had gained
What she desired was a complete startling incontestable victory
It was not enough to prove Valorsays GUILTshe was resolved to penetrate his designs to discover why he pursued her so desperately
And though she felt that she possessed a formidable weapon of defence she could not drive away her gloomy forebodings when she thought of the threats contained in the marquiss letter
Thanks to the assistance of one of my friends he wrote I can place this proud girl in a perilous terribly perilous position from which she cannot possibly extricate herself unaided
These words persistently lingered in Mademoiselle Marguerites mind
What was the danger hanging over her
whence would it come
and in what form
What abominable machination might she not expect from the villain who had deliberately dishonored Pascal
How would he attack her
Would he strive to ruin her reputation or did he intend to forcibly abduct her
Would he attempt to decoy her into a trap where she would be subjected to the insults of the vilest wretches
A thousand frightful memories of the time when she was an apprentice drove her nearly frantic
I will never go out unarmed she thought and woe to the man who raises his hand against me
The vagueness of the threat increased her fears
No one is courageous enough to confront an unknown mysterious and always imminent danger without sometimes faltering
Nor was this all
The marquis was not her only enemy
She had the Fondege family to dreadthese dangerous hypocrites who had taken her to their home so that they might ruin her the more surely
M de Valorsay wrote that he had no fears of the Fondegesthat he understood their little game
What was their little game
No doubt they were resolved that she should become their sons wife even if they were obliged to use force to win her consent
At this thought a sudden terror seized her soul so full of peace and hope an instant before
When she was attacked would she have time to produce and use the facsimile of Valorsays letter
I must reveal my secret to a friendto a trusty friendwho will avenge me
she muttered
Fortunately she had a friend in whom she could safely confidethe old magistrate who had given her such proofs of sympathy
She felt that she needed the advice of a riper experience than her own and the thought of consulting him at once occurred to her
She was alone she had no spy to fear and it would be folly not to profit by the few moments of liberty that remained
So she drew her writingcase from her trunk and after barricading her door to prevent a surprise she wrote her friend an account of the events which had taken place since their last interview
She told him everything with rare precision and accuracy of detail sending him a copy of Valorsays letter and informing him that in case any misfortune befell her he could obtain the facsimiles from Carjat
She finished her letter but did not seal it
If anything should happen before I have an opportunity to post it I will add a postscript she said to herself
She had made all possible haste fearing that Madame de Fondege and Madame Leon might return at any moment
But this was truly a chimerical apprehension
It was nearly six oclock when the two shoppers made their appearance wearied with the labors of the day but in fine spirits
Besides purchasing every requisite for that wonderful costume of hers the Generals wife had found some laces of rare beauty which she had secured for the mere trifle of four thousand francs
It was one of those opportunities one ought always to profit by she said as she displayed her purchase
Besides it is the same with lace as with diamonds you should purchase them when you canthen you have them
It isnt an outlayits an investment
Subtle reasoning that has cost many a husband dear
On her side Madame Leon proudly showed her dear young lady a very pretty present which Madame de Fondege had given her
So money is no longer lacking in this household thought Mademoiselle Marguerite all the more confirmed in her suspicions
The General came in a little later accompanied by a friend and Marguerite soon discovered that the worthy man had spent the day as profitably as his wife
He too was quite tired out and he had reason to be fatigued
First he had purchased the horses belonging to the ruined spendthrift and he had paid five thousand francs for them a mere trifle for such animals
Less than an hour after the purchase he had refused almost double that amount from a celebrated connoisseur in horseflesh M de Breulh Faverlay
This excellent speculation had put him in such good humor that he had been unable to resist the temptation of purchasing a beautiful saddlehorse which they let him have for a hundred louis
He had not been foolish for he was sure that he could sell the animal again at an advance of a thousand francs whenever he wished to do so
So remarked his friend if you bought such a horse every day you would make three hundred and sixtyfive thousand francs a year
Was this only a jestone of those witticisms which people who boast of wonderful bargains must expect to parry or had the remark a more serious meaning
Marguerite could not determine
One thing is certain the General did not lose his temper but gayly continued his account of the way in which he had spent his time
Having purchased the horses his next task was to find a carriage and he had heard of a barouche which a Russian prince had ordered but didnt take so that the builder was willing to sell it at less than cost price and to recoup this worthy man the General had purchased a brougham as well
He had moreover hired stabling in the Rue Pigalle only a few steps from the house and he expected a coachman and a groom the following morning
And all this will cost us less than the miserable vehicle we have been hiring by the year observed Madame de Fondege gravely
Oh I know what I say
Ive counted the cost
What with gratuities and extras it costs us now fully a thousand francs a month and three horses and a coachman wont cost you more
And what a difference
I shall no longer be obliged to blush for the skinny horses the stablekeeper sends me nor to endure the insolence of his men
The first outlay frightened me a little but that is made now and I am delighted
We will save it in something else
In laces no doubt thought Mademoiselle Marguerite
She was intensely exasperated and on regaining her chamber she said to herself for the tenth time What do they take me for
Do they think me an idiot to flaunt the millions they have stolen from my fatherthat they have stolen from mebefore my eyes in this fashion
A common thief would take care not to excite suspicion by a foolish expenditure of the fruits of his knavery but theythey have lost their senses
Madame Leon was already in bed and when Mademoiselle Marguerite was satisfied that she was asleep she took her letter from her trunk and added this postscript P SIt is impossible to retain the shadow of a doubt M and Madame de Fondege have spent certainly twenty thousand francs today
This audacity must arise from a conviction that no proofs of the crime they have committed exist
Still they continue to talk to me about their son Lieutenant Gustave
He will be presented to me tomorrow
To morrow also between three and four I shall be at the house of a man who can perhaps discover Pascals hidingplace for methe house of M Isidore Fortunat
I hope to make my escape easily enough for at that same hour Madame Leon has an appointment with the Marquis de Valorsay
X
The old legend of Achilless heel will be eternally true
A man may be humble or powerful feeble or strong but there are none of us without some weak spot in our armor a spot vulnerable beyond all others a certain place where wounds prove most dangerous and painful
M Isidore Fortunats weak place was his cashbox
To attack him there was to endanger his lifeto wound him at a point where all his sensibility centred
For it was in this cashbox and not in his breast that his heart really throbbed
His safe made him happy or dejected
Happy when it was filled to overflowing by some brilliant operation and dejected when he saw it become empty as some imprudent transaction failed
This then explains his frenzy on that illfated Sunday when after being brutally dismissed by M Wilkie he returned to his rooms in the company of his clerk Victor Chupin
This explains too the intensity of the hatred he now felt for the Marquis de Valorsay and the Viscount de Coralth
The former the marquis had defrauded him of forty thousand francs in glittering gold
The other the viscount had suddenly sprung up out of the ground and carried off from under his very nose that magnificent prize the Chalusse inheritance which he had considered as good as won
And he had not only been defrauded and swindledsuch were his own expressionsbut he had been tricked deceived duped and outwitted and by whom
By people who did not make it their profession to be shrewd like he did himself
Just fancy his business was to outwit others and a couple of mere amateurs had outgeneraled him
He had not only suffered in pocket he had been humiliated as well and so he indulged in threats of such terrible import
However at the very moment when he was dreaming of wreaking vengeance on the Marquis de Valorsay and the Viscount de Coralth his housekeeper austere Madame Dodelin handed him Mademoiselle Marguerites letter
He read it with intense astonishment rubbing his eyes as if to assure himself that he were really awake
Tuesday he repeated the day after tomorrowat your housebetween three and four oclockI must speak with you
His manner was so strange and his usually impassive face so disturbed by conflicting feelings that Madame Dodelins curiosity overcame her prudence and she remained standing in front of him with open mouth staring with all her eyes and listening with all her ears
He perceived this and angrily exclaimed What are you doing here
You are watching me I do believe
Get back to your kitchen or She fled in alarm and he then entered his private office
His heart was leaping with joy and he laughed wickedly at the hope of a speedy revenge
Shes on the scent he muttered and she has luck in her favor
She has chanced to apply to me on the very day that I had resolved to defend and rehabilitate her lover the honest fool who allowed himself to be dishonored by those unscrupulous blackguards
Just as I was thinking of going in search of her she comes to me
As I was about to write to her she writes to me
Who can deny the existence of Providence after this
Like many other people M Fortunat piously believed in Providence when things went to his liking but it is sad to add that in the contrary case he denied its existence
If she has any courage he resumed and she seems to have plenty of it Valorsay and Coralth will be in a tight place soon
And if it takes ten thousand francs to put them there and if neither Mademoiselle Marguerite nor M Ferailleur has the amountah well
Ill advancewell at least five thousandwithout charging them any commission
Ill even pay the expenses out of my own pocket if necessary
Ah my fine fellows youve laughed too soon
In a weeks time well see who laughs last
He paused for Victor Chupin who had lingered behind to pay the driver had just entered the room
You gave me twenty francs msieur he remarked to his employer
I paid the driver four francs and five sous heres the change
Keep it yourself Victor said M Fortunat
What
keep fifteen francs and fifteen sous
Under any other circumstances such unusual generosity would have drawn a grimace of satisfaction from young Chupin
But today he did not even smile he slipped the money carelessly into his pocket and scarcely deigned to say thanks in the coldest possible tone
Absorbed in thought M Fortunat did not remark this little circumstance
We have them Victor he resumed
I told you that Valorsay and Coralth should pay me for their treason
Vengeance is near
Read this letter
Victor read it slowly and as soon as he had finished his employer ejaculated Well
But Chupin was not a person to give advice lightly
Excuse me msieur said he but in order to answer you I must have some knowledge of the affair
I only know what youve told mewhich is little enoughand what Ive guessed
In fact I know nothing at all
M Fortunat reflected for a moment
You are right Victor he said at last
So far the explanation I gave you was all that was necessary but now that I expect more important services from you I ought to tell you the whole truth or at least all I know about the affair
This will prove my great confidence in you
Whereupon he acquainted Chupin with everything he knew concerning the history of M de Chalusse the Marquis de Valorsay and Mademoiselle Marguerite
However if he expected these disclosures to elevate him in his subordinates estimation he was greatly mistaken
Chupin had sufficient experience and common sense to read his masters character and discern his motives
He saw plainly enough that this honest impulse on M Fortunats part came from disappointed avarice and wounded vanity and that the agent would have allowed the Marquis de Valorsay to carry out his infamous scheme without any compunctions of conscience providing he himself had not been injured by it
Still the young fellow did not allow his real feelings to appear on his face
First it was not his business to tell M Fortunat his opinion of him and in the second place he did not deem it an opportune moment for a declaration of his sentiments
So when his employer paused he exclaimed Well we must outwit these scoundrelsfor Ill join you msieur and I flatter myself that I can be very useful to you
Do you want the particulars of the viscounts past life
If so I can furnish them
I know the brigand
Hes married as I told you before and Ill find his wife for you in a few days
I dont know exactly where she lives but she keeps a tobacco store somewhere and thats enough
Shell tell you how much hes a viscount
Ha
ha
Viscount just as much as I amand no more
I can tell you the scrapes he has been in
No doubt but the most important thing is to know how hes living now and on what
Not by honest work I can tell you
But give me a little time and Ill find out for sure
As soon as I can go home change my clothes and disguise myself Ill start after him and may I be hung if I dont return with a complete report before Tuesday
A smile of satisfaction appeared on M Fortunats face
Good Victor
he said approvingly very good
I see that you will serve me with your usual zeal and intelligence
Rest assured that you will be rewarded as you have never been rewarded before
As long as you are engaged in this affair you shall have ten francs a day and Ill pay your board your cabhire and all your expenses
This was a most liberal offer and yet far from seeming delighted Chupin gravely shook his head
You know how I value money msieur he began
Too much Victor my boy too much Excuse me its because I have responsibilities msieur
You know my establishmenthe spoke this word with a grandiloquent airyou have seen my good mothermy expenses are heavy In short you dont think I offer you enough
On the contrary sirbut you dont allow me to finish
I love money dont I
But no matter I dont want to be paid for this business
I dont want either my board or my expenses not a pennynothing
Ill serve you but for my own sake for my own pleasuregratis
M Fortunat could not restrain an exclamation of astonishment
Chupin who was as eager for gain as an old usurerChupin as grasping as avarice itself refuse money
This was something which he had never seen before and which he would no doubt never see again
Victor had become very much excited his usually pale cheeks were crimson and in a harsh voice he continued Its a fancy of minethats all
I have eight hundred francs hidden in my room the fruit of years of work
Ill spend the last penny of it if need be and if I can see Coralth in the mire I shall say My money has been well expended
Id rather see that day dawn than be the possessor of a hundred thousand francs
If a horrible vision haunted you every night and prevented you from sleeping wouldnt you give something to get rid of it
Very well
that brigands my nightmare
There must be an end to it
M de Coralth who was a man of wide experience would certainly have felt alarmed if he had seen his unknown enemy at the present moment for Victors eyes usually a pale and undecided blue were glittering like steel and his hands were clinched most threateningly
For he was the cause of all my trouble he continued gloomily
Ive told you sir that I was guilty of an infamous deed once upon a time
If it hadnt been for a miracle I should have killed a manthe king of men
Ah well
if Monsieur Andre had broken his back by falling from a fifthfloor window my Coralth would be the Duc de Champdoce today
And shall he be allowed to ride about in his carriage and deceive and ruin honest people
Nothere are too many such villains at large for public safety
Wait a little CoralthI owe you something and I always pay my debts
When M Andre saved me though I richly deserved to have my throat cut he made no conditions
He only said If you are not irredeemably bad you will be honest after this
And he said these words as he was lying there as pale as death with his shoulder broken and his body mangled from his fall
Great heavens
I felt smaller thanthan nothing before him
But I swore that I would do honor to his teachingsand when evil thoughts enter my mind and when I feel a thirst for liquor I say to myself Wait a bit andand M Andre will take a glass with you
And that quenches my thirst instantly
I have his portrait at home and every night before going to bed I tell him the history of the dayand sometimes I fancy that he smiles at me
All this is very absurd perhaps but Im not ashamed of it
M Andre and my good mother they are my supports my crutches and with them Im not afraid of making a false step
Schebel the German philosopher who has written a treatise on Volition in four volumes was no greater a man than Chupin
So you may keep your money sir he resumed
Im an honest fellow and honest men ought to ask no reward for the performance of a duty
Coralth mustnt be allowed to triumph over the innocent chap he ruined
What did you call him
Ferailleur
Its an odd name
Never mind well get him out of this scrape he shall marry his sweetheart after all and Ill dance at the wedding
As he finished speaking he laughed a shrill dangerous laugh which revealed his sharp teethbut such invincible determination was apparent on his face that M Fortunat felt no misgivings
He was sure that this volunteer would be of more service than the highestpriced hireling
So I can count on you Victor
he inquired
As upon yourself
And you hope to have some positive information by Tuesday
Before then I hope if nothing goes amiss
Very well I will devote my attention to Ferailleur then
As to Valorsays affairs I am better acquainted with them than he is himself
We must be prepared to enter upon the campaign when Mademoiselle Marguerite comes and we will act in accordance with her instructions
Chupin had already caught up his hat but just as he was leaving the room he paused abruptly
How stupid
he exclaimed
I had forgotten the principal thing
Where does Coralth live
Unfortunately I dont know
According to his habit when things did not go to his liking Chupin began to scratch his head furiously
Thats bad growled he
Viscounts of his stamp dont parade their addresses in the directory
Still I shall find him
However although he expressed this conviction he went off decidedly out of temper
I shall lose the entire evening hunting up the rascals address he grumbled as he hastened homeward
And whom shall I ask for itMadame dArgeless concierge
Would he know itM Wilkies servant
That would be dangerous
He thought of roaming sound about M de Valorsays residence and of bribing one of the valets but while crossing the boulevard the sight of Brebants Restaurant put a new idea into his head
I have it
he muttered my mans caught
And he darted into the nearest cafe where he ordered some beer and writing materials
Under other circumstances he would have hesitated to employ so hazardous an expedient as the one he was about to resort to but the character of his adversaries justified any course besides time was passing and he had no choice of resources
As soon as the waiter served him he drained his glass of beer to give himself an inspiration and then in his finest hand he wrote MY DEAR VISCOUNTHeres the amountone hundred francsthat I lost to you last evening at piquet
When shall I have my revenge
Your friend VALORSAY
When he had finished this letter he read it over three or four times asking himself if this were the style of composition that very fashionable folks employ in repaying their debts
To tell the truth he doubted it
In the rough draft which he penned at first he had written bezique but in the copy he wrote piquet which he deemed a more aristocratic game
However said he no one will examine it closely
Then as soon as the ink was dry he folded the letter and slipped it into an envelope with a hundred francnote which he drew from an old pocketbook
He next addressed the envelope as follows Monsieur le Vicomte de Coralth En Ville and having completed his preparations he paid his score and hastened to Brebants
Two waiters were standing at the doorway and showing them the letter he politely asked Do you happen to know this name
A gentleman dropped this letter on leaving your place last evening
I ran after him to return it but I couldnt overtake him
The waiters examined the address
Coralth
they replied
We scarcely know him
He isnt a regular customer but he comes here occasionally
And where does he live
Why do you wish to know
So as to take him this letter to be sure
The waiters shrugged their shoulders
Let the letter go it is not worth while to trouble yourself
Chupin had foreseen this objection and was prepared for it
But theres money in the letter he remonstrated
And opening the envelope he showed the banknote which he had taken from his own pocketbook
This changed the matter entirely
That is quite a different thing remarked one of the waiters
If you find money you are of course responsible for it
But just leave it here at the desk and the next time the viscount comes in the cashier will give it to him
A cold chill crept over Chupin at the thought of losing his bank note in this way
Ah
I dont fancy that idea
he exclaimed
Leave it here
Never in life
Whod get the reward
A viscount is always generous it is quite likely he would give me twenty francs as a reward for my honesty
And thats why I want his address
The argument was of a nature to touch the waiters they thought the young man quite right but they did not know M de Coralths address and they saw no way of procuring it
Unless perhaps the porter knows observed one of them
The porter on being called remembered that he had once been sent to M de Coralths house for an overcoat
Ive forgotten his number he declared but he lives in the Rue dAnjou near the corner of the Rue de la Ville lEveque
This direction was not remarkable for its precision but it was more than sufficient for a pureblooded Parisian like Victor Chupin
Many thanks for your kindness he said to the porter
A blind man perhaps might not be able to go straight to M de Coralths house from your directions but I have eyes and a tongue as well
And believe me if theres any reward you shall see that I know how to repay a good turn
And if you dont find the viscount added the waiters bring the money here and it will be returned to him
Naturally
replied Chupin
And he strode hurriedly away
Return
he muttered not I
I thought for a moment they had their hands on my precious banknote
But he had already recovered from his fright and as he turned his steps homeward he congratulated himself on the success of his stratagem
For my viscount is caught he said to himself
The Rue dAnjou Saint Honore hasnt a hundred numbers in it and even if Im compelled to go from door to door my task will soon be accomplished
On reaching home he found his mother engaged in knitting as usual
This was the only avocation that her almost complete blindness allowed her to pursue and she followed it constantly
Ah
here you are Toto she exclaimed joyously
I didnt expect you so soon
Dont you scent a savory smell
As you must be greatly tired after being up all night Im making you a stew
As customary when he returned Chupin embraced the good woman with the respectful tenderness which had so surprised M Fortunat
You are always kind said he but unfortunately I cant remain to dine with you
But you promised me
Thats true mamma but business you seebusiness
The worthy woman shook her head
Always business
she exclaimed
Yeswhen a fellow hasnt ten thousand francs a year
You have become a worker Toto and that makes me very happy but you are too eager for money and that frightens me
Thats to say you fear I shall do something dishonest
Ah
mother
do you think I can forget you and Monsieur Andre
His mother said no more and he entered the tiny nook which he so pompously styled his chamber and quickly changed the clothes he was wearing his Sunday toggery for an old pair of checked trousers a black blouse and a glazed cap
And when he had finished and given a peculiar turn to his hair no one would have recognized him
In place of M Fortunats respectable clerk there appeared one of those vagabonds who hang about cafes and theatres from six in the evening till midnight and spend the rest of their time playing cards in the low drinking dens near the barrieres
It was the old Chupin come to life once moreToto Chupin as he had appeared before his conversion
And as he took a last look in the little glass hanging over the table he was himself astonished at the transformation
Ah
he muttered I was a sorry looking devil in those days
Although he had cautiously avoided making any noise in dressing his mother with the wonderfully acute hearing of the blind had followed each of his movements as surely as if she had been standing near watching him
You have changed your clothes Toto she remarked
Yes mother
But why have you put on your blouse my son
Although accustomed to his mothers remarkable quickness of perception he was amazed
Still he did not think of denying it
She would only have to extend her hand to prove that he was telling a falsehood
The blind womans usually placid face had become stern
So it is necessary to disguise yourself she said gravely
But mother Hush my son
When a man doesnt wish to be recognized hes evidently doing something hes ashamed of
Ever since your employer came here you have been concealing something from me
Take care Toto
Since I heard that mans voice Im sure that he is quite as capable of urging you to commit a crime as others were in days gone by
The blind woman was preaching to a convert for during the past three days M Fortunat had shown himself in such a light that Chupin had secretly resolved to change his employer
I promise you Ill leave him mother he declared so you may be quite easy in mind
Very well but now at this moment where are you going
There was only one way of completely reassuring the good woman and that was to tell her all
Chupin did so with absolute frankness
Ah well
she said when the narrative was finished
You see now how easy it is to lead you astray
How could you be induced to play the part of a spy when you know so well what it leads to
Its only Gods protecting care that has saved you again from an act which you would have reproached yourself for all your life
Your employers intentions are good now but they WERE criminal when he ordered you to follow Madame dArgeles
Poor woman
She had sacrificed herself for her son she had concealed herself from him and you were working to betray her
Poor creature
how she must have suffered and how much I pity her
To be what she is and to see herself denounced by her own son
I who am only a poor plebeian should die of shame under such circumstances
Chupin blew his nose so loudly that the windowpanes rattled this was his way of repressing his emotion whenever it threatened to overcome him
You speak like the good mother that you are he exclaimed at last and Im prouder of you than if you were the handsomest and richest lady in Paris for youre certainly the most honest and virtuous and I should be a thorough scoundrel if I caused you a moments sorrow
And if ever I set my foot in such a mess again I hope some one will cut it off
But for this once For this once you may go Toto I give my consent
He went off with a lighter heart and on reaching the Rue dAnjou he immediately began his investigations
They were not successful at first
At every house where he made inquiries nobody had any knowledge of the Viscount de Coralth
He had visited half the buildings in the street when he reached one of the handsomest houses in front of which stood a cart laden with plants and flowers
An old man who seemed to be the concierge and a valet in a red waistcoat were removing the plants from the vehicle and arranging them in a line under the porte cochere
As soon as the cart was emptied it drove away whereupon Chupin stepped forward and addressing the concierge asked Does the Viscount de Coralth live here
Yes
What do you want with him
Having foreseen this question Chupin had prepared a reply
I certainly dont come to call on him he answered
My reason for inquiring is this just now as I passed near the Madeleine a very elegant lady called me and said M
de Coralth lives in the Rue dAnjou but Ive forgotten the number
I cant go about from door to door making inquiries so if youll go there and ascertain his address for me Ill give you five francs for yourself so my moneys made
Profiting by his old Parisian experience Chupin had chosen such a clever excuse that both his listeners heartily laughed
Well Father Moulinet cried the servant in the red waistcoat what do you say to that
Are there any elegant ladies who give five francs for YOUR address
Is there any lady whos likely to send such flowers as these to YOU
was the response
Chupin was about to retire with a bow when the concierge stopped him
You accomplish your errands so well that perhaps youd be willing to take these flowerpots up to the second floor if we gave you a glass of wine
No proposal could have suited Chupin better
Although he was prone to exaggerate his own powers and the fecundity of his resources he had not flattered himself with the hope that he should succeed in crossing the threshold of M de Coralths rooms
For without any great mental effort he had realized that the servant arrayed in the red waistcoat was in the viscounts employ and these flowers were to be carried to his apartments
However any signs of satisfaction would have seemed singular under the circumstances and so he sulkily replied A glass of wine
you had better say two
Well Ill say a whole bottleful
my boy if that suits you any better replied the servant with the charming goodnature so often displayed by people who are giving other folks property away
Then Im at your service
exclaimed Chupin
And loading himself with a host of flowerpots as skilfully as if he had been accustomed to handling them all his life he added Now lead the way
The valet and the concierge preceded him with empty hands of course and on reaching the second floor they opened a door and said This is the place
Come in
Chupin had expected to find that M de Coralths apartments were handsomer than his own in the Faubourg Saint Denis but he had scarcely imagined such luxury as pervaded this establishment
The chandeliers seemed marvels in his eyes and the sumptuous chairs and couches eclipsed M Fortunats wonderful sofa completely
So he no longer amuses himself with petty rascalities thought Chupin as he surveyed the rooms
Monsieurs working on a grand scale now
Decidedly this mustnt be allowed to continue
Thereupon he busied himself placing the flowers in the numerous jardinieres scattered about the rooms as well as in a tiny conservatory cleverly contrived on the balcony and adjoining a little apartment with silk hangings that was used as a smoking room
Under the surveillance of the concierge and the valet he was allowed to visit the whole apartments
He admired the drawingroom filled to overflowing with costly trifles the diningroom furnished in old oak the luxurious bedroom with its bed mounted upon a platform as if it were a throne and the library filled with richly bound volumes
Everything was beautiful sumptuous and magnificent and Chupin admired though he did not envy this luxury
He said to himself that if ever he became rich his establishment should be quite different
He would have preferred rather more simplicity a trifle less satin velvet hangings mirrors and gilding
Still this did not prevent him from going into ecstasies over each room he entered and he expressed his admiration so artlessly that the valet feeling as much flattered as if he were the owner of the place took a sort of pride in exhibiting everything
He showed Chupin the target which the viscount practised at with pistols for an hour every morning for Monsieur le Vicomte was a capital marksman and could lodge eight balls out of ten in the neck of a bottle at a distance of twenty paces
He also displayed his masters swords for Monsieur le Vicomte handled side arms as adroitly as pistols
He took a lesson every day from one of the best fencingmasters in Paris and his duels had always terminated fortunately
He also showed the viscounts blue velvet dressing gown his furtrimmed slippers and even his elaborately embroidered nightshirts
But it was the dressingroom that most astonished and stupefied Chupin
He stood gazing in openmouthed wonder at the immense white marble table with its water spigots and its basins its sponges and boxes its pots and vials and cups and he counted the brushes by the dozenbrushes hard and soft brushes for the hair for the beard for the hands and the application of cosmetic to the mustaches and eyebrows
Never had he seen in one collection such a variety of steel and silver instruments knives pincers scissors and files
One might think oneself in a chiropodists or a dentists establishment remarked Chupin to the servant
Does your master use all these every day
Certainly or rather twice a daymorning and eveningat his toilette
Chupin expressed his feelings with a grimace and an exclamation of mocking wonder
Ah well
he must have a clean skin he said
His listeners laughed heartily and the concierge after exchanging a significant glance with the valet said sotto voce Zounds
its his business to be a handsome fellow
The mystery was solved
While Chupin changed the contents of the jardinieres and remained upstairs in the intervals between the nine or ten journeys he made to the portecochere for more flowers he listened attentively to the conversation between the concierge and the valet and heard snatches of sentences that enlightened him wonderfully
Moreover whenever a question arose as to placing a plant in one place rather than another the valet stated as a conclusive argument that the baroness liked it in such or such a place or that she would be better pleased with this or that arrangement or that he must comply with the instructions she had given him
Chupin was therefore obliged to conclude that the flowers had been sent here by a baroness who possessed certain rights in the establishment
But who was she
He was manoeuvering cleverly in the hope of ascertaining this point when a carriage was heard driving into the courtyard below
Monsieur must have returned
exclaimed the valet darting to the window
Chupin also ran to look out and saw a very elegant bluelined brougham drawn by a superb horse but he did not perceive the viscount
In point of fact M de Coralth was already climbing the stairs four at a time and a moment later he entered the room angrily exclaiming Florent what does this mean
Why have you left all the doors open
Florent was the servant in the red waistcoat
He slightly shrugged his shoulders like a servant who knows too many of his masters secrets to have anything to fear and in the calmest possible tone replied If the doors are open it is only because the baroness has just sent some flowers
On Sunday too what a funny idea
And I have been treating Father Moulinet and this worthy fellow pointing to Chupin to a glass of wine to acknowledge their kindness in assisting me
Fearing recognition Chupin hid his face as much as possible but M de Coralth did not pay the slightest attention to him
There was a dark frown on his handsome usually smiling countenance and his hair was in great disorder
Evidently enough something had greatly annoyed him
I am going out again he remarked to his valet but first of all I must write two letters which you must deliver immediately
He passed into the drawingroom as he spoke and Florent scarcely waited till the door was closed before uttering an oath
May the devil take him
he exclaimed
Here he sets me on the go again
It is five oclock too and I have an appointment in half an hour
A sudden hope quickened the throbbings of Chupins heart
He touched the valets arm and in his most persuasive tone remarked Ive nothing to do and as your wine was so good Ill do your errands for you if youll pay me for the wear and tear of shoe leather
Chupins appearance must have inspired confidence for the servant repliedWellI dont refusebut well see
The viscount did not spend much time in writing he speedily reappeared holding two letters which he flung upon the table saying One of these is for the baroness
You must deliver it into HER hands or into the hands of her maidthere will be no answer
You will afterward take the other to the person it is addressed to and you must wait for an answer which you will place on my writingtableand make haste
So saying the viscount went off as he had enteredon the runand a moment later his brougham was heard rolling out of the courtyard
Florent was crimson with rage
There said he addressing Chupin rather than the concierge what did I tell you
A letter to be placed in madames own hands or in the hands of her maid and to be concealed from the baron who is on the watch of course
Naturally no one can execute that commission but myself
Thats true
replied Chupin but how about the other
The valet had not yet examined the second letter
He now took it from the table and glanced at the address
Ah said he I can confide this one to you my good fellow and its very fortunate for it is to be taken to a place on the other side of the river
Upon my word
masters are strange creatures
You manage your work so as to have a little leisure and the moment you think yourself free poufthey send you anywhere in creation without even asking if it suits your convenience
If it hadnt been for you I should have missed a dinner with some very charming ladies
But above all dont loiter on the way
I dont mind paying your omnibus fare if you like
And you heard him say there would be an answer
You can give it to Moulinet and in exchange hell give you fifteen sous for your trouble and six sous for your omnibus fare
Besides if you can extract anything from the party the letters intended for you are quite welcome to it
Agreed sir
Grant me time enough to give an answer to the lady who is waiting at the Madeleine and Im on my way
Give me the letter
Here it is said the valet handing it to Chupin
But as the latter glanced at the address he turned deadly pale and his eyes almost started from their sockets
For this is what he read Madame Paul
Dealer in Tobacco
Quai de la Seine
Great as was his selfcontrol his emotion was too evident to escape notice
Whats the matter with you
asked the concierge and the valet in the same breath
What has happened to you
A powerful effort of will restored this young fellows coolness and ready in an instant with an excuse for his blunder he replied I have changed my mind
What
youd only give me fifteen sous to measure such a distance as that
Why it isnt a walkits a journey
His explanation was accepted without demur
His listeners thought he was only taking advantage of the need they had of his services as was perfectly natural under the circumstances
What
So you are dissatisfied
cried the valet
Very well
you shall have thirty sousbut be off
So I will at once replied Chupin
And imitating the whistle of a locomotive with wonderful perfection he darted away at a pace which augured a speedy return
However when he was some twenty yards from the house he stopped short glanced around him and espying a dark corner slipped into it
That fool in the red waistcoat will be coming out to take the letter to that famous baroness he thought
Im here and Ill watch him and see where he goes
I should like to find out the name of the kind and charitable lady who watches over his brigand of a master with such tender care
The day and the hour were in his favor
Night was coming on hastened by a thick fog the street lamps were not yet lighted and as it was Sunday most of the shops were closed
It grew dark so rapidly that Chupin was scarcely able to recognize Florent when he at last emerged from the house
It is true that he looked altogether unlike the servant in the red waistcoat
As he had the key to the wardrobe containing his masters clothes he did not hesitate to use them whenever an opportunity offered
On this occasion he had appropriated a pair of those delicately tinted trousers which were M de Coralths specialty with a handsome overcoat a trifle too small for him and a very elegant hat
Fine doings indeed
growled Chupin as he started in pursuit
My servants shant serve me in that way if I ever have any
But he paused in his soliloquy and prudently hid himself under a neighboring gateway
The gorgeous Florent was ringing at the door of one of the most magnificent mansions in the Rue de la Ville lEveque
The door was opened and he went in
Ah
ah
thought Chupin he hadnt far to go
The viscount and the baroness are shrewd
When you have flowers to send to anybody its convenient to be neighbors
He glanced round and seeing an old man smoking his pipe on the threshold of a shop he approached him and asked politely Can you tell me whom that big house belongs to
To Baron Trigault replied the man without releasing his hold on his pipe
Thank you monsieur replied Chupin gravely
I inquired because I think of buying a house And repeating the name of Trigault several times to impress it upon his memory he darted off on his errand
It might be supposed that his unexpected success had delighted him but on the contrary it rendered him even more exacting
The letter he carried burned his pocket like a redhot iron
Madame Paul he muttered that must be the rascals wife
First Paul is his Christian name secondly Ive been told that his wife keeps a tobacco shopso the case is plain
But the strangest thing about it is that this husband and wife should write to each other when I fancied them at daggers ends
Chupin would have given a pint of his own blood to know the contents of the missive
The idea of opening it occurred to him and it must be confessed that it was not a feeling of delicacy that prevented him
He was deterred by a large seal which had been carefully affixed and which would plainly furnish evidence if the letter were tampered with
Thus Chupin was punished for Florents faults for this seal was the viscounts invariable precaution against his servants prying curiosity
So our enterprising youth could only read and reread the superscription and smell the paper which was strongly scented with verbena
He fancied that there was some mysterious connection between this letter intended for M de Coralths wife and the missive sent to the baroness
And why should it not be so
Had they not both been written under the influence of anger
Still he failed to perceive any possible connection between the rich baroness and the poor tobacco dealer and his cogitations only made him more perplexed than ever
However his efforts to solve the mystery did not interfere with the free use of his limbs and he soon found himself on the Quai de la Seine
Here I am he muttered
Ive come more quickly than an omnibus
The Quai de la Seine is a broad road connecting the Rue de Flandres with the canal de lOurcq
On the lefthand side it is bordered with miserable shanties interspersed with some tiny shops and several huge coal depots
On the righthand sidethat next to the canalthere are also a few provision stores
In the daytime there is no noisier nor livelier place than this same Quai but nothing could be more gloomy at nighttime when the shops are closed when the few gaslamps only increase the grimness of the shadows and when the only sound that breaks the silence is the rippling of the water as its smooth surface is ruffled by some boatman propelling his skiff through the canal
The Viscount must certainly have made a mistake thought Chupin there is no such shop on the Quai
He was wrong however for after passing the Rue de Soissons he espied the red lantern of a tobaccoshop glimmering through the fog
XI
Having almost reached the goal Chupin slackened his pace
He approached the shop very cautiously and peered inside deeming it prudent to reconnoitre a little before he went in
And certainly there was nothing to prevent a prolonged scrutiny
The night was very dark the quay deserted
No one was to be seen not a sound broke the stillness
The darkness the surroundings and the silence were sinister enough to make even Chupin shudder though he was usually as thoroughly at home in the loneliest and most dangerous byways of Paris as an honest man of the middle classes would be in the different apartments of his modest household
That scoundrels wife must have less than a hundred thousand a year if she takes up her abode here
thought Chupin
And in fact nothing could be more repulsive than the tenement in which Madame Paul had installed herself
It was but one story high and built of clay and it had fallen to ruin to such an extent that it had been found necessary to prop it up with timber and to nail some old boards over the yawning fissures in the walls
If I lived here I certainly shouldnt feel quite at ease on a windy day continued Chupin sotto voce
The shop itself was of a fair size but most wretched in its appointments and disgustingly dirty
The floor was covered with that black and glutinous coaldust which forms the soil of the Quai de la Seine
An auctioneer would have sold the entire stock and fixtures for a few shillings
Four stone jars and a couple of pairs of scales a few odd tumblers filled with pipes and packets of cigarettes some wineglasses and three or four labelled bottles five or six boxes of cigars and as many packages of musty tobacco constituted the entire stock in trade
As Chupin compared this vile den with the viscounts luxurious abode his blood fairly boiled in his veins
He ought to be shot for this if for nothing else he muttered through his set teeth
To let his wife die of starvation here
For it was M de Coralths wife who kept this shop
Chupin who had seen her years before recognized her now as she sat behind her counter although she was cruelly changed
Thats her he murmured
Thats certainly Mademoiselle Flavie
He had used her maiden name in speaking of her
Poor woman
She was undoubtedly still youngbut sorrow regret and privations days spent in hard work to earn a miserable subsistence and nights spent in weeping had made her old haggard and wrinkled before her time
Of her once remarkable beauty naught remained but her hair which was still magnificent though it was in wild disorder and looked as if it had not been touched by a comb for weeks and her big black eyes which gleamed with the phosphorescent and destructive brilliancy of fever
Everything about her person bespoke terrible reverses borne without dignity
Even if she had struggled at first it was easy to see that she struggled no longer
Her attireher torn and soiled silk dress and her dirty caprevealed thorough indolence and that morbid indifference which at times follows great misfortunes with weak natures
Such is life thought Chupin philosophically
Heres a girl who was brought up like a queen and allowed to have her own way in everything
If any one had predicted this in those days how she would have sneered
I can see her now as she looked that day when I met her driving her gray ponies
If people didnt clear the road it was so much the worse for them
In those times Paris was like some great shop where she could select whatever she chose
She said I want this and she got it
She saw a handsome young fellow and wanted him for her husband her father who could refuse her nothing consented and now behold the result
He had lingered longer at the window than he had meant to do perhaps because he could see that the young woman was talking with some person in a back room the door of which stood open
Chupin tried to find out who this person was but he did not succeed and he was about to go in when suddenly he saw Madame Paul rise from her seat and say a few words with an air of displeasure
And this time her eyes instead of turning to the open door were fixed on a part of the shop directly opposite her
Is there some one there as well then
Chupin wondered
He changed his post of observation and by standing on tiptoe he succeeded in distinguishing a puny little boy some three or four years old and clad in rags who was playing with the remnants of a toyhorse
The sight of this child increased Chupins indignation
So theres a child
he growled
The rascal not only deserts his wife but he leaves his child to starve
We may as well make a note of that and when we settle up our accounts he shall pay dearly for his villainy
With this threat he brusquely entered the shop
What do you wish sir
asked the woman
Nothing I bring you a letter madame
A letter for me
You must be mistaken
Excuse me arent you Madame Paul
Yes
Then this is for you
And he handed her the missive which Florent had confided to his care
Madame Paul took hold of it with some hesitation eying the messenger suspiciously meanwhile but on seeing the handwriting she uttered a cry of surprise
And turning toward the open door she called M Mouchon
M Mouchon
Its from himits from my husband from Paul
Come come
A baldheaded corpulent man who looked some fifty years of age now timidly emerged from the room behind the shop with a cap in his hand
Ah well
my dear child he said in an oily voice what was I telling you just now
Everything comes to those who know how to wait
However she had already broken the seal and she was now reading the letter eagerly clapping her hands with delight as she finished its perusal
He consents
she exclaimed
Hes frightenedhe begs me to wait a littlelookread
But M Mouchon could not read without his spectacles and he lost at least two minutes in searching his pockets before he found them
And when they were adjusted the light was so dim that it took him at least three minutes more to decipher the missive
Chupin had spent this time in scrutinizingin appraising the man as it were
What is this venerable gentleman doing here
he thought
Hes a middle class man thats evident from his linen
Hes marriedtheres a weddingring on his finger he has a daughter for the ends of his necktie are embroidered
He lives in the neighborhood for well dressed as he is he wears a cap
But what was he doing there in that back room in the dark
Meanwhile M Mouchon had finished reading the letter
What did I tell you
he said complacently
Yes you were right
answered Madame Paul as she took up the letter and read it again with her eyes sparkling with joy
And now what shall I do
she asked
Wait shall I not
No no
exclaimed the elderly gentleman in evident dismay
You must strike the iron while its hot
But he promises me To promise and to keep ones promises are two different things
He wants a reply
Tell him But he stopped short calling her attention with a gesture to the messenger whose eyes were glittering with intense curiosity
She understood
So filling a glass with some liquor she placed it before Chupin and offered him a cigar saying Take a seat heres something to keep you from feeling impatient while you wait here
Thereupon she followed the old gentleman into the adjoining room and closed the door
Even if Chupin had not possessed the precocious penetration he owed to his life of adventure the young woman and the old gentleman had said enough to enable him to form a correct estimate of the situation
He was certain now that he knew the contents of the letter as perfectly as if he had read it
M de Coralths anger and his order to make haste were both explained
Moreover Chupin distinctly saw what connection there was between the letter to the baroness and the letter to Madame Paul
He understood that one was the natural consequence of the other
Deserted by her husband Madame Paul had at last become weary of poverty and privations
She had instituted a search for her husband and having found him she had written to him in this style I consent to abstain from interfering with you but only on conditions that you provide means of subsistence for me your lawfully wedded wife and for your child
If you refuse I shall urge my claims and ruin you
The scandal wont be of much use to me its true but at least I shall no longer be obliged to endure the torture of knowing that you are surrounded by every luxury while I am dying of starvation
Yes she had evidently written that
It might not be the precise text but no doubt it was the purport of her letter
On receiving it Coralth had become alarmed
He knew only too well that if his wife made herself known and revealed his past it would be all over with him
But he had no money
Charming young men like the Viscount de Coralth never have any money on hand
So in this emergency the dashing young fellow had written to his wife imploring her to have patience and to the baroness entreating or rather commanding her to advance him a certain sum at once
This was no doubt the case and yet there was one circumstance which puzzled Chupin exceedingly
In former years he had heard it asserted that Mademoiselle Flavie was the very personification of pride and that she adored her husband even to madness
Had this great love vanished
Had poverty and sorrow broken her spirit to such a degree that she was willing to stoop to such shameful concessions
If she were acquainted with her husbands present life how did it happen that she did not prefer starvation or the almshouse and a paupers grave to his assistance
Chupin could understand how in a moment of passion she might be driven to denounce her husband in the presence of his fashionable acquaintances how she might be impelled to ruin him so as to avenge herself but he could not possibly understand how she could consent to profit by the ignominy of the man she loved
The plan isnt hers said Chupin to himself after a moments reflection
Its probably the work of that stout old gentleman
There was a means of verifying his suspicions for on returning into the adjoining room Madame Paul had not taken her son with her
He was still sitting on the muddy floor of the shop playing with his dilapidated horse
Chupin called him
Come here my little fellow said he
The child rose and timidly approached his eyes dilating with distrust and astonishment
The poor boys repulsive uncleanliness was a terrible charge against the mother
Did she no longer love her own offspring
The untidiness of sorrow and poverty has its bounds
A long time must have passed since the childs face and hands had been washed and his soiled clothes were literally falling to rags
Still he was a handsome little fellow and seemed fairly intelligent in spite of his bashfulness
He was very lighthaired and in features he was extremely like M de Coralth
Chupin took him on his knees and after looking to see if the door communicating with the inner room were securely closed he asked Whats your name little chap
Paul
Do you know your father
No
Doesnt your mother ever talk to you about him
Oh yes
And what does she say
That hes richvery rich
And what else
The child did not reply perhaps his mother had forbidden him to say anything on the subjectperhaps that instinct which precedes intelligence just as the dawn precedes daylight warned him to be prudent with a stranger
Doesnt your papa ever come to see you
insisted Chupin
Never
Why
Mamma is very poor
And wouldnt you like to go and see him
I dont know
But hell come some day and take us away with him to a large house
We shall be all right then and he will give us a deal of money and pretty dresses and I shall have plenty of toys
Satisfied on this point Chupin pushed his investigations farther
And do you know this old gentleman who is with your mamma in the other room
Oh yesthats Mouchon
And whos Mouchon
Hes the gentleman who owns that beautiful garden at the corner of the Rue Riquet where there are such splendid grapes
Im going with him to get some
Does he often come to see you
Every evening
He always has goodies in his pocket for mamma and me
Why does he sit in that back room without any light
Oh he says that the customers mustnt see him
It would have been an abominable act to continue this examination and make this child the innocent accuser of his own mother
Chupin felt consciencesmitten even now
So he kissed the cleanest spot he could find on the boys face and set him on the floor again saying Go and play
The child had revealed his mothers character with cruel precision
What had she told him about his father
That he was rich and that in case he returned he would give them plenty of money and fine clothes
The womans nature stood revealed in all its deformity
Chupin had good cause to feel proud of his discernmentall his suppositions had been confirmed
He had read Mouchons character at a glance
He had recognized him as one of those wily evilminded men who employ their leisure to the profit of their depravityone of those patient coldblooded hypocrites who make poverty their purveyor and whose passion is prodigal only in advice
So hes paying his court to Madame Paul thought Chupin
Isnt it shameful
The old villain
he might at least give her enough to eat
So far his preoccupation had made him forget his wine and his cigar
He emptied the glass at a single draught but it proved far more difficult to light the cigar
Zounds
this is a non combustible he growled
When I arrive at smoking ten sous cigars I shant come here to buy them
However with the help of several matches and a great deal of drawing he had almost succeeded when the door opened and Madame Paul reappeared with a letter in her hand
She seemed greatly agitated her anxiety was unmistakable
I cant decide she was saying to Mouchon whose figure Chupin could only dimly distinguish in the darkness
No I cant
If I send this letter I must forever renounce all hope of my husbands return
Whatever happens he will never forgive me
He cant treat you worse than he does now at all events replied the old gentleman
Besides a gloved cat has never caught a mouse yet
Hell hate me
The man who wants his dog to love him beats it and besides when the wine is drawn one must drink it
This singular logic seemed to decide her
She handed the letter to Chupin and drawing a franc from her pocket she offered it to him
This is for your trouble she said
He involuntarily held out his hand to take the money but quickly withdrew it exclaiming No thank you keep it
Ive been paid already
And thereupon he left the shop
Chupins motherhis poor good mother as he called herwould certainly have felt proud and delighted at her sons disinterestedness
That very morning he had refused the ten francs a day that M Fortunat had offered him and this evening he declined the twenty sous proffered him by Madame Paul
This was apparently a trifle and yet in reality it was something marvellous unprecedented on the part of this poor lad who having neither trade nor profession was obliged to earn his daily bread through the medium of those chance opportunities which the lower classes of Paris are continually seeking
As he returned to the Rue de Flandres he muttered Take twenty sous from that poor creature who hasnt had enough to satisfy her hunger for heaven knows how long
That would be altogether unworthy of a man
It is only just to say that money had never given him a feeling of satisfaction at all comparable with that which he now experienced
He was impressed too with a sense of vastlyincreased importance on thinking that all the faculties and all the energy he had once employed in the service of evil were now consecrated to the service of good
By becoming the instrument of Pascal Ferailleurs salvation he would in some measure atone for the crime he had committed years before
Chupins mind was so busily occupied with these thoughts that he reached the Rue dAnjou and M de Coralths house almost before he was aware of it
To his great surprise the concierge and his wife were not alone
Florent was there taking coffee with them
The valet had divested himself of his borrowed finery and had donned his red waistcoat again
He seemed to be in a savage humor and his anger was not at all strange under the circumstances
There was but a step from M de Coralths house to the baronesss residence but fatalities may attend even a step
The baroness on receiving the letter from her maid had sent a message to Florent requesting him to wait as she desired to speak with him
and she had been so inconsiderate as to keep him waiting for more than an hour so that he had missed his appointment with the charming ladies he had spoken of
In his despair he had returned home to seek consolation in the society of his friend the concierge
Have you the answer
he asked
Yes here it is replied Chupin and Florent had just slipped the letter into his pocket and was engaged in counting out the thirty sous which he had promised his messenger when the familiar cry Open please was heard outside
M de Coralth had returned
He sprang to the ground as soon as the carriage entered the courtyard and on perceiving his servant he exclaimed Have you executed my commissions
They have been executed monsieur
Did you see the baroness
She made me wait two hours to tell me that the viscount need not be worried in the least that she would certainly be able to comply with his request tomorrow
M de Coralth seemed to breathe more freely
And the other party
he inquired
Gave me this for monsieur
The viscount seized the missive with an eager hand tore it open read it at one glance and flew into such a paroxysm of passion that he quite forgot those around him and began to tear the letter and utter a string of oaths which would have astonished a cabdriver
But suddenly realizing his imprudence he mastered his rage and exclaimed with a forced laugh Ah
these women
they are enough to drive one mad
And deeming this a sufficient explanation he added addressing Florent
Come and undress me I must be up early tomorrow morning
This remark was not lost upon Chupin and at seven oclock the next morning he mounted guard at M de Coralths door
All through the day he followed the viscount about first to the Marquis de Valorsays then to the office of a business agent then to M Wilkies then in the afternoon to Baroness Trigaults and finally in the evening to the house of Madame dArgeles
Here by making himself useful to the servants by his zeal in opening and shutting the doors of the carriages that left the house he succeeded in gathering some information concerning the frightful scene which had taken place between the mother and the son
He perceived M Wilkie leave the house with his clothes in disorder and subsequently he saw the viscount emerge
He followed him first to the house of the Marquis de Valorsay and afterward to M Wilkies rooms where he remained till nearly daybreak
Thus when Chupin presented himself in M Fortunats office at two oclock on the Tuesday afternoon he felt that he held every possible clue to the shameful intrigue which would ruin the viscount as soon as it was made public
M Fortunat knew that his agent was shrewd but he had not done justice to his abilities and it was indeed with something very like envy that he listened to Chupins clear and circumstantial report
I have not been as successful he remarked when Chupins story was ended
But he had not time to explain how or why for just as he was about to do so Madame Dodelin appeared and announced that the young lady he expected was there
Let her come in
exclaimed M Fortunat eagerlylet her come in
Mademoiselle Marguerite had not been compelled to resort to any subterfuge to make her escape from Madame de Fondeges house
The General had decamped early in the morning to try his horses and his carriages announcing moreover that he would breakfast at the club
And as soon as her breakfast was concluded Madame de Fondege had hurried off to her dressmakers warning the household that she would not return before dinnertime
A little while later Madame Leon had suddenly remembered that her noble relative would certainly be expecting a visit from her and so she dressed herself in haste and went off first to Dr Jodons and thence to the Marquis de Valorsays
Thus Mademoiselle Marguerite had been able to make her escape without attracting any ones attention and she would be able to remain away as many hours as she chose since the servants would not know how long she had been absent even if they saw her when she returned
An empty cab was passing as she left the house so she hailed it and got in
The step she was about to take cost her a terrible effort
It was a difficult task for her a girl naturally so reserved to confide in a stranger and open to him her maidenly heart filled with love for Pascal Ferailleur
Still she was much calmer than she had been on the previous evening when she called on the photographer for a facsimile of M de Valorsays letter
Several circumstances combined to reassure her
M Fortunat knew her already since he was the agent whom the Count de Chalusse had employed to carry on the investigations which had resulted in her discovery at the foundling asylum
A vague presentiment told her that this man was better acquainted with her past life than she was herself and that he could if he chose tell her her mothers namethe name of the woman whom the count so dreaded and who had so pitilessly deserted her
However her heart beat more quickly and she felt that she was turning pale when at Madame Dodelins invitation she at last entered M Fortunats private office
She took in the room and its occupants with a single glance
The handsome appointments of the office surprised her for she had expected to see a den
The agents polite manner and rather elegant appearance disconcerted her for she had expected to meet a coarse and illiterate boor and finally Victor Chupin who was standing twisting his cap near the fireplace attired in a blouse and a pair of ragged trousers fairly alarmed her
Still no sign of her agitation was perceptible on her countenance
Not a muscle of her beautiful proud face movedher glance remained clear and haughty and she exclaimed in a ringing voice I am the late Count de Chalusses ward Mademoiselle Marguerite
You have received my letter I suppose
M Fortunat bowed with all the grace of manner he was wont to display in the circles where he went wifehunting and with a somewhat pretentious gesture he advanced an armchair and asked his visitor to sit down
Your letter reached me mademoiselle he replied and I was expecting youflattered and honored beyond expression by your confidence
My door indeed was closed to any one but you
Marguerite took the proffered seat and there was a moments silence
M Fortunat found it difficult to believe that this beautiful imposing young girl could be the poor little apprentice whom he had seen in the bookbindery years before clad in a coarse serge frock with dishevelled hair covered with scraps of paper
In the meantime Marguerite was regretting the necessity of confiding in this man for the more she looked at him the more she was convinced that he was not an honest straightforward person and she would infinitely have preferred a cynical scoundrel to this plausible and polite gentleman whom she strongly suspected of being a hypocrite
She remained silent waiting for M Fortunat to dismiss the young man in the blouse whose presence she could not explain and who stood in a sort of mute ecstasy staring at her with eyes expressive of the most intense surprise and the liveliest admiration
But weary at last of this fruitless delay she exclaimed I have come monsieur to confer with you respecting certain matters which require the most profound secrecy
Chupin understood her for he blushed to the tips of his ears and started as if to leave the room
But his employer detained him with a gesture
Remain Victor he said kindly and turning to Mademoiselle Marguerite he added You have no indiscretion to fear from this worthy fellow mademoiselle
He knows everything and he has already been actively at workand with the best resulton your behalf
I dont understand you sir replied the girl
M Fortunat smiled sweetly
I have already taken your business in hand mademoiselle said he
An hour after the receipt of your letter I began the campaign
But I had not told you What you wished of methats true
But I allowed myself to suspect Ah
I fancied I might conclude that you wished the help of my experience and poor ability in clearing an innocent man who has been vilely slandered M Pascal Ferailleur
Marguerite sprang to her feet at once agitated and alarmed
How did you know this
she exclaimed
M Fortunat had left his armchair and was now leaning against the mantelshelf in what he considered a most becoming and awe inspiring attitude with his thumb in the armhole of his waistcoat
Ah
nothing could be more simple he answered in much the same tone as a conqueror might assume to explain his feat
It is part of my profession to penetrate the intentions of persons who deign to honor me with their confidence
So my surmises are correct at least you have not said the contrary
She had said nothing
When her first surprise was over she vainly endeavored to find a plausible explanation of M Fortunats acquaintance with her affairs for she was not at all deceived by his pretended perspicacity
Meanwhile delighted by the supposed effect he had produced he recklessly continued Reserve your amazement for what I am about to disclose for I have made several important discoveries
It must have been your good angel who inspired you with the idea of coming to me
You would have shuddered if you had realized the dangers that threatened you
But now you have nothing to fear I am watching
I am here and I hold in my hand all the threads of the abominable intrigue for ruining you
For it is you your person and your fortune that are imperilled
It was solely on your account that M Ferailleur was attacked
And I can tell you the names of the scoundrels who ruined him
The crime originated with the person who had the most powerful interest in the matterthe Marquis de Valorsay
His agent was a scoundrel who is generally known as the Viscount de Coralth but Chupin here can tell you his real name and his shameful past
You preferred M Ferailleur hence it was necessary to put him out of the way
M de Chalusse had promised your hand to the Marquis de Valorsay
This marriage was Valorsays only resourcethe plank that might save the drowning man
People fancy he is rich but he is ruined
Yes ruined completely irretrievably
He was in such desperate straits that he had almost determined to blow his brains out before the hope of marrying you entered his mind
Ah
thought Chupin my employer is well under way
This was indeed the case
The name of Valorsay was quite sufficient to set all M Fortunats bile in motion
All thought of his exclient irritated him beyond endurance
Unfortunately for him however his anger in the present instance had ruined his plans
He had intended to take Mademoiselle Marguerite by surprise to work upon her imagination to make her talk without saying anything himself and to remain master of the situation
But on the contrary he had revealed everything and he did not discover this until it was too late to retrieve his blunder
How the Marquis de Valorsay has kept his head above water is a wonder to me he continued
His creditors have been threatening to sue him for more than six months
How he has been able to keep them quiet since M de Chalusses death I cannot understand
However this much is certain mademoiselle the marquis has not renounced his intention of becoming your husband and to attain that object he wont hesitate to employ any means that may promise to prove effectual
Completely mistress of herself Mademoiselle Marguerite listened with an impassive face
I know all this she replied in a frigid tone
What
you know Yes but there is one thing that baffles my powers of comprehension
My dowry was the only temptation to M de Valorsay was it not
Why does he still wish to marry me now that I have no fortune
M Fortunat had gradually lost all his advantage
I have asked myself the same question he replied and I think I have found an answer
I believe that the marquis has in his possession a letter or a will or a document of some sort written by M de Chalussein fact an instrument in which the count acknowledges you as his daughter and which consequently establishes your right to his property
And the marquis could urge this claim if he became my husband
Certainly he could
M Fortunat explained M de Valorsays conduct exactly as the old magistrate had done
However Mademoiselle Marguerite discreetly refrained from committing herself
The great interest that M Fortunat seemed to take in her affairs aroused her distrust and she decided to do what he had attempted in vainthat is allow him to do all the talking and to conceal all that she knew herself
Perhaps you are right she remarked but it is necessary to prove the truth of your assertion
I can prove that Valorsay hasnt a shilling and that he has lived for a year by expedients which render him liable to arrest and prosecution at any time
I can prove that he deceived M de Chalusse as to his financial position
I can prove that he conspired with M de Coralth to ruin your lover
Wouldnt this be something
She smiled in a way that was exceedingly irritating to his vanity and in a tone of goodnatured incredulity she remarked It is easy to SAY these things
And to do them rejoined M Fortunat quickly
I never promise what I cannot perform
A man should never touch a pen when he is meditating any evil act
Of course no one is fool enough to write down his infamy in detail
But a man cannot always be on the qui vive
There will be a word in one letter a sentence in another an allusion in a third
And by combining these words phrases and allusions one may finally discover the truth
He suddenly checked himself warned of his fresh imprudence by the expression on Mademoiselle Marguerites face
She drew back and looking him full in the eyes she exclaimed Then you have been in M de Valorsays confidence sir
Would you be willing to swear that you never helped him in his designs
A silent and ignored witness of this scene Victor Chupin was secretly delighted
Hit
he thoughthit just in the bulls eye
Zounds
theres a woman for you
She has beaten the guvnor on every point
M Fortunat was so taken by surprise that he made no attempt to deny his guilt
I confess that I acted as M de Valorsays adviser for some time he replied and he frequently spoke to me of his intention of marrying a rich wife in order to retrieve his shattered fortunes
Upon my word I see nothing so very bad about that
It is not a strictly honest proceeding perhaps but it is done every day
What is marriage in this age
Merely a business transaction is it not
Perhaps it would be more correct to say that it is a transaction in which one person tries to cheat the other
The fathersinlaw are deceived or the husband or the wife and sometimes all of them together
But when I discovered this scheme for mining M Ferailleur I cried halt
My conscience revolted at that
Dishonor an innocent man
It was base cowardly outrageous
And not being able to prevent this infamous act I swore that I would avenge it
Would Mademoiselle Marguerite accept this explanation
Chupin feared so and accordingly turning quickly to his employer he remarked To say nothing of the fact that this fine gentleman has swindled you outrageously shrewd as you arecheating you out of the forty thousand francs you lent him and which he was to pay you eighty thousand for
M Fortunat cast a withering look at his clerk but the mischief was done denial was useless
He seemed fated to blunder in this affair
Well yes he declared its true
Valorsay HAS defrauded me and I have sworn to have my revenge
I wont rest until I see him ruined
Mademoiselle Marguerite was partially reassured for she understood his zeal now
Her scorn for the man was only increased but she was convinced that he would serve her faithfully
I like this much better said she
It is better to have no concealment
You desire M de Valorsays ruin
I desire the rehabilitation of M Ferailleur
So our interests are in common
But before acting in this matter we must know M Ferailleurs wishes
They cannot be considered
And why
Because no one knows what has become of him
When the desire for revenge first took possession of me I at once thought of him
I procured his address and went to the Rue dUlm
But he had gone away
The very day after his misfortune M Ferailleur sold his furniture and went away with his mother
I am aware of that and I have come to ask you to search for him
To discover his hidingplace will be only childs play to you
Do you suppose I havent thought of this
replied M Fortunat
Why I spent all day yesterday searching for him
By questioning the people in the neighborhood I finally succeeded in ascertaining that Madame Ferailleur left her home in a cab several hours after her son and took a very large quantity of baggage with her
Well do you know where she drove
To the Western railway station
I am sure of this and I know she told a porter there that her destination was London
M Ferailleur is now en route for America and we shall never hear of him again
Mademoiselle Marguerite shook her head
You are mistaken sir said she
There can be no mistake about what I have just told you
I dont question the result of your investigations but appearances are deceitful
I thoroughly understand M Ferailleurs character and he is not the man to be crushed by an infamous calumny
He may seem to fly he may disappear he may conceal himself for a time but it is only to make his vengeance more certain
What
Pascal who is energy itself who possesses an iron will and invincible determination would he renounce his honor his future and the woman he loves without a struggle
If he had felt that his case was hopeless he would have destroyed himself and as he has not done so he is not without hope
He has not left Paris I am sure of it
M Fortunat was not convinced
In his opinion this was only sentiment and rubbish
Still there was one person present who was deeply impressed by the confidence of this young girl who was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen and whose devotion and energy filled his heart with admiration and this person was Chupin
He stepped forward with his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm and in a feeling voice he exclaimed I understand your idea
Yes M Ferailleur is in Paris
And I shall be unworthy of the name of Chupin if I dont find him for you in less than a fortnight
XII
Mademoiselle Marguerite knew Pascal Ferailleur
Suddenly struck down in the full sunlight of happiness by a terrible misfortune he of course experienced moments of frenzy and terrible depression but he was incapable of the cowardice which M Fortunat had accused him of
Mademoiselle Marguerite only did him justice when she said that the sole condition on which he could consent to live was that of consecrating his life and all his strength intelligence and will to confounding this infamous calumny
And still she did not know the extent of Pascals misfortune
How could she suppose that he believed himself deserted by her
How could she know the doubts and fears and the anguish that had been roused in his heart by the note which Madame Leon had given him at the garden gate
What did she know of the poignant suspicions that had rent his mind after listening to Madame Vantrassons disparaging insinuations
It must be admitted that he was indebted to his mother alone for his escape from suicidethat grim madness that seizes hold of so many desperate despairing men
And it was still to his mother the incomparable guardian of his honorthat he owed his resolution on the morning he applied to Baron Trigault
And his courage met with its first reward
He was no longer the same man when he left the princely mansion which he had entered with his heart so full of anguish
He was still somewhat bewildered with the strange scenes which he had involuntarily witnessed the secrets he had overheard and the revelations which had been made to him but a light gleamed on the horizona fitful and uncertain light it is true but nevertheless a hopeful gleam
At least he would no longer have to struggle alone
An honest and experienced man powerful by reason of his reputation his connections and his fortune had promised him his help
Thanks to this man whom misfortune had made a truer friend than years could have done he would have access to the wretch who had deprived him both of his honor and of the woman he loved
He knew the weak spot in the marquiss armor now he knew where and how to strike and he felt sure that he should succeed in winning Valorsays confidence and in obtaining irrefutable proofs of his villainy
Pascal was eager to inform his mother of the fortunate result of his visit but certain arrangements which were needful for the success of his plans required his attention and it was nearly five oclock when he reached the Route de la Revolte
Madame Ferailleur was just returning home when he arrived which surprised him considerably for he had not known that she had intended going out
The cab she had used was still standing before the door and she had not had time to take off her shawl and bonnet when he entered the house
She uttered a joyful cry on perceiving her son
She was so accustomed to read his secret thoughts on his face that it was unnecessary for him to say a word before he had even opened his lips she cried So you have succeeded
Yes mother beyond my hopes
I was not deceived then in the worthy man who came to offer us his assistance
No certainly not
Do what I may I can never repay him for his generosity and selfdenial
If you knew my dear mother if you only knew What
He kissed her as if he wished to apologize for what he was about to say and then he quickly replied Marguerite is the daughter of Baroness Trigault
Madame Ferailleur started back as if she had seen a reptile spring up in her pathway
The daughter of the baroness
she faltered
Great Heavens
It is the truth mother listen to me
And in a voice that trembled with emotion he rapidly related all he had learned by his visit to the baron softening the truth as much as he could without concealing it
But prevarication was useless
Madame Ferailleurs indignation and disgust were none the less evident
That woman is a shameless creature she said coldly when her sons narrative was concluded
Pascal made no reply
He knew only too well that his mother was right and yet it wounded him cruelly to hear her speak in this style
For the baroness was Marguerites mother after all
So continued Madame Ferailleur with increasing indignation creatures do exist who are destitute even of the maternal instincts of animals
I am an honest woman myself I dont say it in selfglorification its no credit to me my mother was a saint and I loved my husband what some people call duty was my happiness so I may be allowed to speak on this subject
I dont excuse infidelity but I can understand how such a thing is possible
Yes I can understand how a beautiful young woman who is left alone in a city like Paris may lose her senses and forget the worthy man who has exiled himself for her sake and who is braving a thousand dangers to win a fortune for her
The husband who exposes his honor and happiness to such terrible risk is an imprudent man
But when this woman has erred when she has given birth to a child how she can abandon it how she can cast it off as if it were a dog I cannot comprehend
I could imagine infanticide more easily
No such a woman has no heart no bowels of compassion
There is nothing human in her
For how could she live how could she sleep with the thought that somewhere in the world her own child the flesh of her flesh was exposed to all the temptations of poverty and the horrors of shame and vice
And she the possessor of millions she the inmate of a palace thinking only of dress and pleasure
How was it that she didnt ask herself every minute Where is my daughter now and what is she doing
What is she living on
Has she shelter clothes and food
To what depths of degradation she may have sunk
Perhaps she has so far lived by honest toil and perhaps at this very moment this support fails her and she is abandoning herself to a life of infamy
Great God
how does this woman dare to step out of doors
On seeing the poor wretches who have been driven to vice by want how can she fail to say to herself That perhaps is my daughter
Pascal turned pale moved to the depths of his soul by his mothers extraordinary vehemence
He trembled lest she should say And you my son would you marry the child of such a mother
For he knew his mothers prejudices and the great importance she attached to a spotless reputation transmitted from parent to child from generation to generation
The baroness knew that her husband adored her and hearing of his return she became terrified she lost her senses he ventured to say in extenuation
Would you try to defend her
exclaimed Madame Ferailleur
Do you really think one can atone for a fault by a crime
No certainly not but Perhaps you would censure the baroness more severely if you knew what her daughter has sufferedif you knew the perils and miseries she has been exposed to from the moment her mother left her on a doorstep near the central markets till the day when her father found her
It is a miracle that she did not perish
Where had Madame Ferailleur learned these particulars
Pascal asked himself this question without being able to answer it
I dont understand you mother he faltered
Then you know nothing of Mademoiselle Marguerites past life
Is it possible she never told you anything about it
I only know that she has been very unhappy
Has she never alluded to the time when she was an apprentice
She has only told me that she earned her living with her own hands at one time of her life
Well I am better informed on the subject
Pascals amazement was changed to terror
You mother you
Yes II have been to the asylum where she was received and educated
I have had a conversation with two Sisters of Charity who remember her and it is scarcely an hour since I left the people to whom she was formerly bound as an apprentice
Standing opposite his mother with one hand convulsively clutching the back of the chair he was leaning on Pascal tried to nerve himself for some terrible blow
For was not his life at stake
Did not his whole future depend upon the revelations Madame Ferailleur was about to make
So this was your object in going out mother
he faltered
Yes
And you went without warning me
Was it necessary
What
you love a young girl you swear in my presence that she shall be your wife and you think it strange that I should try to ascertain whether she is worthy of you or not
It would be very strange if I did not do so
This idea occurred to you so suddenly
Madame Ferailleur gave an almost imperceptible shrug of the shoulders as if she were astonished to have to answer such puerile objections
Have you already forgotten the disparaging remarks made by our new servant Madame Vantrasson
Good Heavens
I understood her base insinuations as well as you did and after your departure I questioned her or rather I allowed her to tell her story and I ascertained that Mademoiselle Marguerite had once been an apprentice of Vantrassons brotherinlaw a man named Greloux who was formerly a bookbinder in the Rue SaintDenis but who has now retired from business
It was there that Vantrasson met Mademoiselle Marguerite and this is why he was so greatly surprised to see her doing the mistress at the Hotel de Chalusse
It seemed to Pascal that the throbbing of his heart stopped his breath
By a little tact I obtained the Grelouxs address from Madame Vantrasson resumed his mother
Then I sent for a cab and drove there at once
And you saw them
Yes thanks to a falsehood which doesnt trouble my conscience much I succeeded in effecting an entrance and had an hours conversation with them
His mothers icy tones frightened Pascal
Her slowness tortured him and still he dared not press her
The Greloux family she continued seem to be what are called worthy people that is incapable of committing any crime that is punishable by the code and very proud of their income of seven thousand francs a year
They must have been very much attached to Mademoiselle Marguerite for they were lavish in their protestations of affection when I mentioned her name
The husband in particular seemed to regard her with a feeling of something like gratitude
Ah
you see mother you see
As for the wife it was easy to see that she had sincerely regretted the loss of the best apprentice the most honest servant and the best worker she had ever seen in her life
And yet from her own story I should be willing to swear that she had abused the poor child and had made a slave of her
Tears glittered in Pascals eyes but he breathed freely once more
As for Vantrasson resumed Madame Ferailleur it is certain that he took a violent fancy to his sisters apprentice
This man who has since become an infamous scoundrel was then only a rake an unprincipled drunkard and libertine
He fancied the poor little apprenticeshe was then but thirteen years oldwould be only too glad to become the mistress of her employers brother but she scornfully repulsed him and his vanity was so deeply wounded that he persecuted the poor girl to such an extent that she was obliged to complain first to Madame Greloux whoto her shame be it saidtreated these insults as mere nonsense and afterward to Greloux himself who was probably delighted to have an opportunity of ridding himself of his indolent brotherinlaw for he turned him out of the house
The thought that so vile a rascal as this man Vantrasson should have dared to insult Marguerite made Pascal frantic with indignation
The wretch
he exclaimed the wretch
But without seeming to notice her sons anger Madame Ferailleur continued They pretended they had not seen their former apprentice since she had been living in grandeur as they expressed it
But in this they lied to me
For they saw her at least once and that was on the day she brought them twenty thousand francs which proved the nucleus of their fortune
They did not mention this fact however
Dear Marguerite
murmured Pascal dear Marguerite
And then aloud But where did you learn these last details mother
he inquired
At the asylum where Mademoiselle Marguerite was brought up and there too I only heard words of praise
Never said the superior have I had a more gifted sweetertempered or more attractive charge
They had reproached her sometimes for being too reserved and her selfrespect had often been mistaken for inordinate pride but she had not forgotten the asylum any more than she had forgotten her former patrons
On one occasion the superior received from her the sum of twentyfive thousand francs and a year ago she presented the institution with one hundred thousand francs the yearly income of which is to constitute the marriage dowry of some deserving orphan
Pascal was greatly elated
Well mother
he exclaimed well is it strange that I love her
Madame Ferailleur made no reply and a sorrowful apprehension seized hold of him
You are silent said he and why
When the blessed day that will allow me to wed Marguerite arrives you surely wont oppose our marriage
No my son nothing that I have learned gives me the right to do so
The right
Ah you are unjust mother
Unjust
Havent I faithfully reported all that was told me although I knew it would only increase your passion
Thats true but Madame Ferailleur sadly shook her head
Do you think she interrupted that I can without sorrow see you choose a girl of no family a girl who is outside the pale of social recognition
Dont you understand my disquietude when I think that the girl that you will marry is the daughter of such a woman as Baroness Trigault an unfortunate girl whom her mother cannot even recognize since her mother is a married woman Ah
mother is that Marguerites fault
Did I say it was her fault
NoI only pray God that you may never have to repent of choosing a wife whose past life must ever remain an impenetrable mystery
Pascal had become very pale
Mother
he said in a quivering voice mother
I mean that you will only know so much of Mademoiselle Marguerites past life as she may choose to tell you continued the obdurate old lady
You heard Madame Vantrassons ignoble allegations
It has been said that she was the mistress not the daughter of the Count de Chalusse
Who knows what vile accusations you may be forced to meet
And what is your refuge if doubts should ever assail you
Mademoiselle Marguerites word
Will this be sufficient
It is now perhaps but will it suffice in years to come
I would have my sons wife above suspicion and shewhy there is not a single episode in her life that does not expose her to the most atrocious calumny
What does calumny matter
it will never shake my faith in her
The misfortunes which you reproach Marguerite for sanctify her in my eyes
Pascal
What
Am I to scorn her because she has been unfortunate
Am I to regard her birth as a crime
Am I to despise her because her MOTHER is a despicable woman
NoGod be praised
the day when illegitimate children the innocent victims of their mothers faults were branded as outcasts is past
But Madame Ferailleurs prejudices were too deeply rooted to be shaken by these arguments
I wont discuss this question my son she interrupted but take care
By declaring children irresponsible for their mothers faults you will break the strongest tie that binds a woman to duty
If the son of a pure and virtuous wife and the son of an adulterous woman meet upon equal ground those who are held in check only by the thought of their children will finally say to themselves what does it matter
It was the first time that a cloud had ever arisen between mother and son
On hearing his dearest hopes thus attacked Pascal was tempted to rebel and a flood of bitter words rose to his lips
However he had strength enough to control himself
Marguerite alone can triumph over these implacable prejudices he thought when my mother knows her she will feel how unjust they are
And as he found it difficult to remain master of himself he stammered some excuse and abruptly retired to his own room where he threw himself on his bed
He felt that it was not his place to reproach his mother or censure her for her opinions
What mother had ever been so devoted as she had been
And who knowsit was perhaps from these same rigid prejudices that this simpleminded and heroic woman had derived her energy her enthusiastic love of God her hatred of evil and that virility of spirit which misfortune had been powerless to daunt
Besides had she not promised to offer no opposition to his marriage
And was not this a great concession a sacrifice which must have cost her a severe struggle
And where can one find the mother who does not count as one of the sublime joys of maternity the task of seeking a wife for her son of choosing from among all others the young girl who will be the companion of his life the angel of his dark and of his prosperous days
His mind was occupied with these thoughts when his door suddenly opened and he sprang up exclaiming Who is it
It was Madame Vantrasson who came to announce that dinner was readya dinner which she had herself prepared for on going out Madame Ferailleur had left her in charge of the household
On seeing this woman Pascal was overcome with rage and indignation and felt a wild desire to annihilate her
He knew that she was only a vile slanderer but she might meet other beings as vile as herself who would be only too glad to believe her falsehoods
And to think that he was powerless to punish her
He now realized the suffering his mother had spoken ofthe most atrocious suffering which the lover can endurepowerlessness to protect the object of his affections when she is assailed
Engrossed in these gloomy thoughts Pascal preserved a sullen silence during the repast
He ate because his mother filled his plate but if he had been questioned he could scarcely have told what he was eating
And yet the modest dinner was excellent
Madame Vantrasson was really a good cook and in this first effort in her new situation she had surpassed herself
Her vanity as a cordonbleu was piqued because she did not receive the compliments she expected and which she felt she deserved
Four or five times she asked impatiently Isnt that good
and as the only reply was a scarcely enthusiastic Very good she vowed she would never again waste so much care and talent upon such unappreciative people
Madame Ferailleur was as silent as her son and seemed equally anxious to finish with the repast
She evidently wanted to get rid of Madame Vantrasson and in fact as soon as the simple dessert had been placed on the table she turned to her and said You may go home now
I will attend to the rest
Irritated by the taciturnity of these strange folks the landlady of the Model Lodging House withdrew and they soon heard the street door close behind her with a loud bang as she left the house
Pascal drew a long breath as if relieved of a heavy weight
While Madame Vantrasson had been in the room he had scarcely dared to raise his eyes so great was his dread of encountering the gaze of this woman whose malignity was but poorly veiled by her smoothtongued hypocrisy
He really feared he should not be able to resist his desire to strangle her
However Madame Ferailleur must have understood her sons agitation for as soon as they were alone she said So you have not forgiven me for my plain speaking
How can I be angry with you mother when I know that you are thinking only of my happiness
But how sorry I shall be if your prejudices Madame Ferailleur checked him with a gesture
Let us say no more on the subject she remarked
Mademoiselle Marguerite will be the innocent cause of one of the greatest disappointments of my life but I have no reason to hate herand I have always been able to show justice even to the persons I loved the least
I have done so in this instance and I am going perhaps to give you a convincing proof of it
A proof
Yes
She reflected for a moment and then she asked Did you not tell me my son that Mademoiselle Marguerites education has not suffered on account of her neglected childhood
And its quite true mother
She worked diligently you said so as to improve herself
Marguerite knows all that an unusually talented girl can learn in four years when she finds herself very unhappy and study proves her only refuge and consolation
If she wrote you a note would it be written grammatically and be free from any mistakes in spelling
Oh certainly
exclaimed Pascal and a sudden inspiration made him pause abruptly
He darted to his own room and a minute later he returned with a package of letters which he laid on the table saying Here mother read and see for yourself
Madame Ferailleur drew her spectacles from their case and after adjusting them she began to read
With his elbows on the table and his head resting upon his hands Pascal eagerly watched his mother anxious to read her impressions on her face
She was evidently astonished
She had not expected these letters would express such nobility of sentiment an energy no whit inferior to her own and even an echo of her own prejudices
For this strange young girl shared Madame Ferailleurs rather bigoted opinions
Again and again she asked herself if her birth and past had not created an impassable abyss between Pascal and herself
And she had not felt satisfied on this point until the day when the grayhaired magistrate after hearing her story said If I had a son I should be proud to have him beloved by you
It soon became apparent that Madame Ferailleur was deeply moved and once she even raised her glasses to wipe away a furtive tear which made Pascals heart leap with very joy
These letters are admirable she said at last and no young girl reared by a virtuous mother could have given better expression to nobler sentiments but She paused not wishing to wound her sons feelings and as he insisted she added But these letters have the irreparable fault of being addressed to you Pascal
This however was the expiring cry of her intractable obstinacy
Now she resumed wait before you censure your mother
So saying she rose opened a drawer and taking from it a torn and crumpled scrap of paper she handed it to her son exclaiming Read this attentively
This proved to be the note in pencil which Madame Leon had given to Pascal and which he had divined rather than read by the light of the streetlamp he had handed it to his mother on his return and she had kept it
He had scarcely been in his right mind the evening he received it but now he was enjoying the free exercise of all his faculties
He no sooner glanced at the note than he sprang up and in an excited voice exclaimed Marguerite never wrote this
The strange discovery seemed to stupefy him
I was mad raving mad
he muttered
The fraud is palpable unmistakable
How could I have failed to discover it
And as if he felt the need of convincing himself that he was not deceived he continued speaking to himself rather than to his mother The handwriting is not unlike Marguerites its true but its only a clever counterfeit
And who doesnt know that all writings in pencil resemble each other more or less
Besides its certain that Marguerite who is simplicity itself would not have made use of such pretentious melodramatic phrases
How could I have been so stupid as to believe that she ever thought or wrote this One cannot break a promise made to the dying I shall keep mine even though my heart break
And again Forget therefore the girl who has loved you so much she is now the betrothed of another and honor requires she should forget even your name
He read these passages with an extravagant emphasis which heightened their absurdity
And what shall I say of these mistakes in spelling
he resumed
You noticed them of course mother command is written with a single m and supplicate with one p
These are certainly not mistakes that we can attribute to haste
Ignorance is proved since the blunder is always the same
The forger is evidently in the habit of omitting one of the double letters
Madame Ferailleur listened with an impassive face
And these mistakes are all the more inexcusable since this letter is only a copy she observed quietly
What
Yes a verbatim copy
Yesterday evening while I was examining it for the twentieth time it occurred to me that I had read some portions of it before
Where and under what circumstances
It was a puzzle which kept me awake most of the night
But this morning I suddenly remembered a book which I had seen in the hands of the workmen at the factory and which I had often laughed over
So while I was out this morning I entered a bookshop and purchased the volume
Thats it there on the corner of the mantelshelf
Take it and see
Pascal obeyed and noticed with surprise that the work was entitled The Indispensable and Complete Letterwriter for Both Sexes in Every Condition of Life
Now turn to the page I have marked said Madame Ferailleur
He did so and read Model 198
Letter from a young lady who has promised her dying father to renounce the man she loves and to bestow her hand upon another
Doubt was no longer possible
Line for line and word for word the mistakes in spelling excepted the note was an exact copy of the stilted prose of the Indispensable Letterwriter
It seemed to Pascal as if the scales had suddenly fallen from his eyes and that he could now understand the whole intrigue which had been planned to separate him from Marguerite
His enemies had dishonored him in the hope that she would reject and scorn him and disappointed in their expectations they had planned this pretended rupture of the engagement to prevent him from making any attempt at selfjustification
So in spite of some shortlived doubts his love had been more clearsighted than reason and stronger than appearances
He had been quite right then in saying to his mother I can never believe that Marguerite deserts me at a moment when I am so wretchedthat she condemns me unheard and has no greater confidence in me than in my accusers
Appearances may indicate the contrary but I am right
Certain circumstances which had previously seemed contradictory now strengthened this belief
How is it he said to himself that Marguerite writes to me that her father on his deathbed made her promise to renounce me while Valorsay declares the Count de Chalusse died so suddenly that he had not even time to acknowledge his daughter or to bequeath her his immense fortune
One of these stories must be false and which of them
The one in this note most probably
As for the letter itself it must have been the work of Madame Leon
If he had not already possessed irrefutable proofs of this the Indispensable Letterwriter would have shown it
The housekeepers perturbation when she met him at the garden gate was now explained
She was shuddering at the thought that she might be followed and watched and that Marguerite might appear at any moment and discover everything
I think it would be a good plan to let this poor young girl know that her companion is Valorsays spy remarked Madame Ferailleur
Pascal was about to approve this suggestion when a sudden thought deterred him
They must be watching Marguerite very closely he replied and if I attempt to see her if I even venture to write to her our enemies would undoubtedly discover it
And then farewell to the success of my plans
Then you prefer to leave her exposed to these dangers
Yes even admitting there is danger which is by no means certain
Owing to her past life Marguerites experience is far in advance of her years and if some one told me that she had fathomed Madame Leons character I should not be at all surprised
It was necessary to ascertain what had become of Marguerite and Pascal was puzzling his brain to discover how this might be done when suddenly he exclaimed Madame Vantrasson
We have her let us make use of her
It will be easy to find some excuse for sending her to the Hotel de Chalusse she will gossip with the servants there and in that way we can discover the changes that have taken place
This was a heroic resolution on Pascals part and one which he would have recoiled from the evening before
But it is easy to be brave when one is hopeful and he saw his chances of success increase so rapidly that he no longer feared the obstacles that had once seemed almost insurmountable
Even his mothers opposition had ceased to alarm him
For why should he fear after the surprising proof she had given him of her love of justice proving that the pretended letter from Mademoiselle Marguerite was really a forgery
He slept but little that night and did not stir from the house on the following day
He was busily engaged in perfecting his plan of attack against the marquis
His advantages were considerable thanks to Baron Trigault who had placed a hundred thousand francs at his disposal but the essential point was to use this amount in such a way as to win Valorsays confidence and induce him to betray himself
Pascals hours of meditation were not spent in vain and when it became time for him to repair to his enemys house he said to his mother Ive found a plan and if the baron will let me follow it out Valorsay is mine
XIII
It was pure childishness on Pascals part to doubt Baron Trigaults willingness to agree even with closed eyes to any measures he might propose
He ought to have recollected that their interests were identical that they hated the same men with equal hatred and that they were equally resolved upon vengeance
And certainly the events which had occurred since their last interview had not been of a nature to modify the barons intentions
However misfortune had rendered Pascal timid and suspicious and it was not until he reached the barons house that his fears vanished
The manner in which the servants received him proved that the baron greatly esteemed him for the man must be stupid indeed who does not know that the greeting of the servants is ever in harmony with the feelings of the master of the house
Will you be kind enough to follow me
said the servant to whom he handed his card
The baron is very busy but that doesnt matter
He gave orders that monsieur should be shown up as soon as he arrived
Pascal followed without a word
The elegance of this princely abode never varied
The same careless prodigal regal luxury was apparent everywhere
The servantswhose name was legionwere always passing noiselessly to and fro
A pair of horses worth at least a thousand louis and harnessed to the baronesss brougham were stamping and neighing in the courtyard and the hall was as usual fragrant with the perfume of rare flowers renewed every morning
On his first visit Pascal had only seen the apartments on the ground floor
This time his guide remarked that he would take him upstairs to the barons private room
He was slowly ascending the broad marble staircase and admiring the bronze balustrade the rich carpet the magnificent frescoes and the costly statuary when a rustle of silk resounded near him
He had only time to step aside and a lady passed him rapidly without turning her head or even deigning to look at him
She did not appear more than forty and she was still very beautiful with her golden hair dressed high on the back of her head
Her costume brilliant enough in hue to frighten a cab horse was extremely eccentric in cut but it certainly set off her peculiar style of beauty to admirable advantage
Thats the baroness whispered the servant after she had passed
Pascal did not need to be told this
He had seen her but once and then only for a second but it had been under such circumstances that he should never forget her so long as he lived
And now he understood the strange and terrible impression which had been produced upon him when he saw her first
Mademoiselle Marguerite was the living prototype of this lady save as regards the color of her hair
And there would have been no difference in this respect had the baroness allowed her locks to retain their natural tint
Her hair had been black like Marguerites and black it had remained until she was thirtyfive when she bleached it to the fashionable color of the time
And every fourth day even now her hairdresser came to apply a certain compound to her head after which she remained in the bright sunlight for several hours so as to impart a livelier shade of gold to her dyed locks
Pascal had scarcely regained his composure when the servant opened the door of an immense apartment as large as a handsome suite of rooms and magnificently furnished
Here sat the baron surrounded by several clerks who were busily engaged in putting a pile of papers and documents in order
But as soon as Pascal entered the baron rose and cordially holding out his hand exclaimed Ah
here you are at last Monsieur Maumejan
So he had not forgotten the name which Pascal had assumed
This was a favorable omen
I called monsieur began the young man
YesI knowI know
interrupted the baron
Come we must have a talk
And taking Pascals arm he led him into his private sanctum separated from the large apartment by foldingdoors which had been removed and replaced by hangings
Once there he indicated by a gesture that they could be heard in the adjoining room and that it was necessary to speak in a low tone
You have no doubt come said he for the money I promised that dear Marquis de ValorsayI have it all ready for you here it is
So saying he opened an escritoire and took out a large roll of banknotes which he handed to Pascal
Here count it he added and see if the amount is correct
But Pascal whose face had suddenly become as red as fire did not utter a word in reply
On receiving this money a new but quite natural thought had entered his mind for the first time
What is the matter
inquired the baron surprised by this sudden embarrassment
What has happened to you
Nothing monsieur nothing
Only I was asking myselfif I ought if I can accept this money
Bah
and why not
Because if you lend it to M de Valorsay it is perhaps lost
PERHAPS
You are polite Yes monsieur you are right
I ought to have said that it is sure to be lost and hence my embarrassment
Is it not solely on my account that you sacrifice a sum which would be a fortune to many men
Yes
Very well then
I am asking myself if it is right for me to accept such a sacrifice when it is by no means certain that I shall ever be able to requite it
Shall I ever have a hundred thousand francs to repay you
But isnt this money absolutely necessary to enable you to win Valorsays confidence
Yes and if it belonged to me I should not hesitate
Though the baron had formed a high estimate of Pascals character he was astonished and deeply touched by these scruples and this excessive delicacy of feeling
Like most opulent men he knew few poor people who wore their poverty with grace and dignity and who did not snatch at a twentyfranc piece wherever they chanced to find it
Ah well my dear Ferailleur he said kindly dont trouble yourself on this score
Its not at your request nor solely on your account that I make this sacrifice
Oh
No I give you my word of honor it isnt
Leaving you quite out of the question I should still have lent Valorsay this money and if you do not wish to take it to him I shall send it by some one else
After that Pascal could not demur any further
He took the barons proffered hand and pressed it warmly uttering only this one word made more eloquent than any protestations by the fervor with which it was spoken Thanks
The baron shrugged his shoulders goodnaturedly like a man who fails to see that he has done anything at all meritorious or even worthy of the slightest acknowledgment
And you must understand my dear sir he resumed that you can employ this sum as you choose in advancing your interests which are identical with mine
You can give the money to Valorsay at such a time and under such conditions as will best serve your plans
Give it to him in an hour or in a month all at once or in fifty different instalments as you please
Only use it like the rope one ties round a dogs neck before drowning him
The keenest penetration was concealed beneath the barons careless goodnature
Pascal knew this and feeling that his protector understood him he said You overpower me with kindness
Nonsense
You offer me just what I came to ask for
So much the better
But you will allow me to explain my intentions
It is quite unnecessary my dear sir
Excuse me if I follow my present plan I shall be obliged to ascribe certain sentiments words and even acts to you which you might perhaps disavow and With a careless toss of the head accompanied by a disdainful snap of the fingers the baron interrupted him
Set to work and dont give yourself the slightest uneasiness about that
You may do whatever you like if you only succeed in unmasking this dear marquis and Coralth his worthy acolyte
Show me up in whatever light you choose
Who will you be in Valorsays eyes
Why Maumejan one of my business agents and I can always throw the blame on you
And as if to prove that he had divined even the details of the scheme devised by his young friend he added Besides every one knows that a millionaires business agent is anything but a pleasant person to deal with
A millionaire who is not a fool must always smile and no matter how absurd the demands upon him may be he must always answer Yes certainly certainlyI should be only too happy
But then he adds You must arrange the matter with my agent
Confer with him
And it is the unlucky agent who must object declare that his employer has no money at his disposal just now and finally say No
Pascal was still disposed to insist but the baron was obdurate
Oh
enough enough
he exclaimed
Dont waste precious time in idle discussion
The days are only twentyfour hours long and as you see Im very busy so busy that Ive not touched a card since the day before yesterday
I am preparing a delightful surprise for Madame Trigault my daughter and my soninlaw
It has been rather a delicate operation but I flatter myself that I have succeeded finely
And he laughed a laugh that was not pleasant to hear
You see Ive had enough of paying several hundred thousand francs a year for the privilege of being sneered at by my wife scorned by my daughter swindled by my soninlaw and vilified and anathematized by all three of them
I am still willing to go on paying but only on conditions that they give me in return for my money if not the reality at least a show of love affection and respect
Im determined to have the semblance of these things Im quite resolved on that
Yes I will have myself treated with deference
Ill be petted and coddled and made much of or else Ill suspend payment
It was one of my old friends a parvenu like myselfa man whose domestic happiness I have envied for many yearswho gave me this receipt At home said he with my wife my daughters and my sonsin law Im like a peer of England at an hotel
I order firstclass happiness at so much a month
If I get it I pay for it if I dont get it I cut off the supplies
When I get extras I pay for them cheerfully without haggling
Follow my example my old friend and youll have a comfortable life
And I shall follow his advice M Ferailleur for I am convinced that his theory is sound and practicable
I have led this life long enough
Ill spend my last days in peace or as God hears me Ill let my family die of starvation
His face was purple and the veins on his forehead stood out like whipcords but not so much from anger as from the constraint he imposed upon himself by speaking in a whisper
He drew a long breath and then in a calmer tone resumed But you must make haste and succeed M Ferailleur if you dont want the young girl you love to be deprived of her rightful heritage
You do not know into what unworthy hands the Chalusse property is about to fall
He was on the point of telling Pascal the story of Madame dArgeles and M Wilkie when he was interrupted by the sound of a lively controversy in the hall
Whos taking such liberty in my house
the baron began
But the next instant he heard some one fling open the door of the large room adjoining and then a coarse guttural voice called out What
he isnt here
This is too much
The baron made an angry gesture
Thats KamiBey said he the Turk whom I am playing that great game of cards with
The devil take him
He will be sure to force his way in hereso we may as well join him M
Ferailleur
On reentering the adjoining apartment Pascal beheld a very corpulent man with a very red face a straggling beard a flat nose small beadlike eyes and sensual lips
He was clad in a black frockcoat buttoned tight to the throat and he wore a fez
This costume gave him the appearance of a chunky bottle sealed with red wax
Such indeed was KamiBey a specimen of those semibarbarians loaded with gold who are not attracted to Paris by its splendors and glories but rather by its corruptionpeople who come there persuaded that money will purchase anything and everything and who often return home with the same conviction
Kami was no doubt more impudent more cynical and more arrogant than others of his class
As he was more wealthy he had more followers he had been more toadied and flattered and victimized to a greater extent by the host of female intriguers who look upon every foreigner as their rightful prey
He spoke French passably well but with an abominable accent
Here you are at last
he exclaimed as the baron entered the room
I was becoming very anxious
About what prince
Why KamiBey was called prince no one knew not even the man himself
Perhaps it was because the lackey who opened his carriage door on his arrival at the Grand Hotel had addressed him by that title
About what
he repeated
You have won more than three hundred thousand francs from me and I was wondering if you intended to give me the slip
The baron frowned and this time he omitted the title of prince altogether
It seems to me sir that according to our agreement we were to play until one of us had won five hundred thousand francs he said haughtily
Thats truebut we ought to play every day
Possibly but Im very busy just now
I wrote to you explaining this did I not
If you are at all uneasy tear up the book in which the results of our games are noted and that shall be the end of it
You will gain considerably by the operation
KamiBey felt that the baron would not tolerate his arrogance and so with more moderation he exclaimed It isnt strange that Ive become suspicious
Im so victimized on every side
Because Im a foreigner and immensely rich everybody fancies he has a right to plunder me
Men women hotelkeepers and merchants all unite in defrauding me
If I buy pictures they sell me vile daubs at fabulous prices
They ask ridiculous amounts for horses and then give me worthless wornout animals
Everybody borrows money from meand Im never repaid
I shall be ruined if this sort of thing goes on much longer
He had taken a seat and the baron saw that he was not likely to get rid of his guest very soon so approaching Pascal he whispered You had better go off or you may miss Valorsay
And be careful mind for he is exceedingly shrewd
Courage and good luck
Courage
It was not necessary to recommend that to Pascal
He who had triumphed over his despair in the terrible hours when he had reason to suppose that Marguerite believed him guilty and had abandoned him could scarcely lack courage
While he was condemned to inaction his mind had no doubt been assailed by countless doubts and fears but now that he knew whom he was to attacknow that the decisive moment had come he was endowed with indomitable energy he had turned to bronze and he felt sure that nothing could disconcert or even trouble him in future
The weapons he had to use were not at all to his taste but he had not been allowed a choice in the matter and since his enemies had decided on a warfare of duplicity he was resolved to surpass them in cunning and vanquish them by deception
So while hastening to the Marquis de Valorsays residence he took stock of his chances and recapitulated his resources striving to foresee and remember everything
Thus if he failed for he admitted the possibility of defeat without believing in ithe would have no cause to reproach himself
Only fools find consolation in saying Who could have foreseen that
Great minds do foresee
And Pascal felt almost certain that he was fully prepared for any emergency
That morning before leaving home he had dressed with extreme care realizing that the shabby clothes he had worn on his first visit to the Trigault mansion would not be appropriate on such an occasion as this
The barons agent could scarcely have a povertystricken appearance for contact with millionaires is supposed to procure wealth as surely as proximity to fire insures warmth
So he arrayed himself in a suit of black which was neither too elegant nor too much worn and donned a broad white necktie
He could see only one immediate decisive chance against him
M de Valorsay might possibly recognize him
He thought not but he was not sure and anxious on this account he at first decided to disguise himself
However on reflection he concluded not to do so
An imperfect disguise would attract attention and awaken suspicion and could he really disguise his physiognomy
He was certain he could not
Very few men are capable of doing so successfully even after long experience
Only two or three detectives and half a dozen actors possess the art of really changing their lineaments
Thus after weighing the pros and cons Pascal determined to present himself as he was at the marquiss house
On approaching M de Valorsays residence in the Avenue des Champs Elysees he slackened his pace
The mansion which stood between a courtyard and a garden was very large and handsome
The stables and carriagehousereally elegant structuresstood on either side of the courtyard near the halfopen gate of which five or six servants were amusing themselves by teasing a large dog
Pascal was just saying to himself that the coast was clear and that he should incur no danger by going in when he saw the servants step aside the gate swing back and M de Coralth emerged accompanied by a young fairhaired man whose mustaches were waxed and turned up in the most audacious fashion
They were arm in arm and turned in the direction of the Arc de Triomphe
Pascals heart thrilled with joy
Fate favors me
he said to himself
If it hadnt been for KamiBey who detained me a full quarter of an hour at Baron Trigaults I should have found myself face to face with that miserable viscount and then all would have been lost
But now Im safe
It was with this encouraging thought that he approached the house
The marquis is very busy this morning said the servant to whom Pascal addressed himself at the gate
I doubt if he can see you
But when Pascal handed him one of his visiting cards bearing the name of Maumejan with this addition in pencil Who calls as the representative of Baron Trigault the valets face changed as if by enchantment
Oh
said he thats quite a different matter
If you come from Baron Trigault you will be received with all the respect due to the Messiah
Come in
I will announce you myself
Everything in M de Valorsays house as at the barons residence indicated great wealth and yet a close observer would have detected a difference
The luxury of the Rue de la VillelEveque was of a real and substantial character which one did not find in the Avenue des Champs Elysees
Everything in the marquiss abode bore marks of the haste which mars the merest trifle produced at the present age
Take a seat here and I will see where the marquis is said the servant as he ushered Pascal into a large drawingroom
The apartment was elegantly furnished but had somewhat lost its freshness the carpet which had once been a marvel of beauty was stained in several places and as the servants had not always been careful to keep the shutters closed the sunlight had perceptibly faded the curtains
The attention of visitors was at once attracted by the number of gold and silver cups vases and statuettes scattered about on sidetables and cheffoniers
Each of these objects bore an inscription setting forth that it had been won at such a race in such a year by such a horse belonging to the Marquis de Valorsay
These were indeed the marquiss chief claims to glory and had cost him at least half of the immense fortune he had inherited
However Pascal did not take much interest in these trophies so the time of waiting seemed long
Valorsay is playing the diplomat he thought
He doesnt wish to appear to be anxious
Unfortunately his servant has betrayed him
At last the valet returned
The marquis will see you now monsieur said he
This summons affected Pascals heart like the first roll of a drum beating the charge
But his coolness did not desert him
Now is the decisive moment he thought
Heaven grant that he may not recognize me
And with a firm step he followed the valet
M de Valorsay was seated in the apartment he usually occupied when he remained at homea little smokingroom connected with his bedroom
He was to all intents busily engaged in examining some sporting journals
A bottle of Madeira and a partially filled glass stood near him
As the servant announced Monsieur Maumejan
he looked up and his eyes met Pascals
But his glance did not waver not a muscle of his face moved his countenance retained its usually cold and disdainful expression
Evidently he had not the slightest suspicion that the man he had tried to ruin his mortal enemywas standing there before him
M Maumejan said he Baron Trigaults agent
Yes monsieur Pray be seated
I am just finishing here I shall be at leisure in a moment
Pascal took a chair
He had feared that he might not be able to retain his selfcontrol when he found himself in the presence of the scoundrel who after destroying his happiness ruining his future and depriving him of his honordearer than life itself was at that moment endeavoring by the most infamous manoeuvres to rob him of the woman he loved
If my blood mounted to my brain he had thought I should spring upon him and strangle him
But no
His arteries did not throb more quickly it was with perfect calmnessthe calmness of a strong naturethat he stealthily watched M de Valorsay
If he had seen him a week before he would have been startled by the change which the past few days had wrought in this brilliant noblemans appearance
He was little more than a shadow of his former self
And seen at this hour before placing himself in his valets hands before his premature decrepitude had been concealed by the artifices of the toilet he was really frightful
His face was haggard and his red and swollen eyelids betrayed a longcontinued want of sleep
The fact is he had suffered terribly during the past week
A man may be a scapegrace and a spendthrift and may boast of it he may have no principle and no conscience he may be immoral he may defy God and the devil but it is nevertheless true that he suffers fearful anguish of mind when he is guilty for the first time of a positive crime forbidden by the laws and punishable with the galleys
And who can say how many crimes the Marquis de Valorsay had committed since the day he provided his accomplice the Viscount de Coralth with those fatal cards
And apart from this there was something extremely appalling in the position of this ruined millionaire who was contending desperately against his creditors for the vain appearance of splendor with the despairing energy of a shipwrecked mariner struggling for the possession of a floating spar
Had he not confessed to M Fortunat that he had suffered the tortures of the damned in his struggle to maintain a show of wealth while he was often without a penny in his pocket and was ever subject to the pitiless surveillance of thirty servants
His agony when he thought of his precarious condition could only be compared to that of a miner who while ascending from the bowels of the earth finds that the rope upon which his life depends is slowly parting strand by strand and who asks himself in terror if the few threads that still remain unsevered will be strong enough to raise him to the mouth of the pit
However the moment which M de Valorsay had asked for had lengthened into a quarter of an hour and he had not yet finished his work
What the devil is he doing
wondered Pascal who was following his enemys slightest movement with eager curiosity
Countless sporting newspapers were strewn over the table the chairs and the floor around the marquis who took them up one after another glanced rapidly through their columns and threw them on the floor again
or placed them on a pile before him first marking certain passages with a red pencil
At last probably fearing that Pascal was growing impatient he looked up and said I am really very sorry to keep you waiting so long but some one is waiting for this work to be completed
Oh
pray continue Monsieur le Marquis interrupted Pascal
Strange to say I have a little leisure at my command just now
The marquis seemed to feel that it was necessary to make some remark in acknowledgment of this courtesy on his visitors part and so as he continued his work he condescended to explain its purpose
I am playing the part of a commentator he remarked
I sold seven of my horses a few days ago and the purchaser before paying the stipulated price naturally required an exact and authentic statement of each animals performances
However even this does not seem to have satisfied the gentleman for he has now taken it into his head to ask for such copies of the sporting journals as record the victories or defeats of the animals he has purchased
A gentleman is not so exacting generally
It is true however that I have a foreigner to deal withone of those halfcivilized nabobs who come here every year to astonish the Parisians with their wealth and display and who by their idiotic prodigality have so increased the price of everything that life has become wellnigh an impossibility to such of us as dont care to squander an entire fortune in a couple of years
These folks are the curse of Paris for with but few exceptions they only use their millions to enrich notorious women scoundrels hotelkeepers and jockeys
Pascal at once thought of the foreigner KamiBey whom he had met at Baron Trigaults half an hour before and who had complained so bitterly of having had worthless scrubs palmed off upon him when he fancied he had purchased valuable animals
KamiBey must be this exacting purchaser thought Pascal and its probable that the marquis desperately straitened as he is has committed one of those frauds which lead their perpetrator to prison
The surmise was by no means farfetched for in sporting matters at least there was cause to suspect Valorsay of great elasticity of conscience
Had he not already been accused of defrauding Domingos champions by a conspiracy
At last the marquis heaved a sigh of relief
Ive finished he muttered as he tied up the bundle of papers he had laid aside and after ringing the bell he said to the servant who answered the summons Here take this package to Prince Kami at the Grand Hotel
Pascals presentiments had not deceived him and he said to himself This is a good thing to know
Before this evening I shall look into this affair a little
A storm was decidedly gathering over the Marquis de Valorsays head
Did he know it
Certainly he must have expected it
Still he had sworn to stand fast until the end
Besides he would not concede that all was lost and like most great gamblers he told himself that since he had so much at stake he might reasonably hope to succeed
He rose stretched himself as a man is apt to do after the conclusion of a tiresome task and then leaning against the mantelshelf he exclaimed Now Monsieur Maumejan let us speak of the business that brings you here
His negligent attitude and his careless tone were admirably assumed but a shrewd observer would not have been deceived by them or by the indifferent manner in which he added You bring me some money from Baron Trigault
Pascal shook his head as he replied I regret to say that I dont Monsieur le Marquis
This response had the same effect as a heavy rock falling upon M de Valorsays bald pate
He turned whiter than his linen and even tottered as if his lame leg which was so much affected by sudden changes in the weather had utterly refused all service
What
You haventthis is undoubtedly a joke
It is only too serious
But I had the barons word
Oh
his word
I had his solemn promise
It is sometimes impossible to keep ones promises sir
The consequences of this disappointment must have been terrible for the marquis could not maintain his selfcontrol
Still he strove valiantly to conceal his emotion
He thought to himself that if he allowed this man to see what a terrible blow this really was he would virtually confess his absolute ruin and have to renounce the struggle and own himself vanquished and lost
So summoning all his energy he mastered his emotion in some degree and instead of appearing desperate succeeded in looking only irritated and annoyed
In short he resumed angrily you have brought no money
I counted on a hundred thousand francs this morning
Nothing
This is kind on the barons part
But probably he doesnt understand the embarrassing position in which he places me
Excuse me Monsieur le Marquis he understands it so well that instead of informing you by a simple note
he sent me to acquaint you with his sincere regret
When I left him an hour ago he was really disconsolate
He was particularly anxious I should tell you that it was not his fault
He counted upon the payment of two very large amounts and both of these have failed him
The marquis had now recovered a little from the shock though he was still very pale
He looked at Pascal with evident distrust for he knew with what sweet excuses wellbred people envelope their refusals
So the baron is disconsolate he remarked in a tone of perceptible irony
He is indeed
Poor baron
Ah
I pity himpity him deeply
As cold and as unmoved as a statue Pascal seemed quite unconscious of the effect of the message he had broughtquite unconscious of Valorsays sufferings and selfconstraint
You think I am jesting monsieur he said quietly but I assure you that the baron is very short of money just now
Nonsense
a man worth seven or eight millions of francs
I should say ten millions at least
Then the excuse is all the more absurd
Pascal shrugged his shoulders disdainfully
It astonishes me Monsieur le Marquis to hear YOU speak in this way
It is not the magnitude of a mans income that constitutes affluence but rather the way in which that income is spent
In this foolish age almost all rich people are in arrears
What income does the baron derive from his ten millions of francs
Not more than five hundred thousand
A very handsome fortune no doubt and I should be more than content with it
But the baron gambles and the baroness is the most elegantin other words the most extravagantwoman in Paris
They both of them love luxury and their establishment is kept up in princely style
What are five hundred thousand francs under such circumstances as those
Their situation must be something like that of several millionaires of my acquaintance who are obliged to take their silver to the pawnbrokers while waiting for their rents to fall due
This excuse might not be true but it was certainly a very plausible one
Had not a recent lawsuit revealed the fact that certain rich folks who had an income of more than a hundred thousand francs a year had kept a thieving coachman for six months simply because in all that time they were not able to raise the eight hundred francs they owed him and which must be paid before he was dismissed
M de Valorsay knew this but a terrible disquietude seized him
Had people begun to suspect HIS embarrassment
Had any rumor of it reached Baron Trigaults ears
This was what he wished to ascertain
Let us understand each other Monsieur Maumejan said he the baron was unable to procure this money he had promised me todaybut when will he let me have it
Pascal opened his eyes in pretended astonishment and it was with an air of the utmost simplicity that he replied I concluded the baron would take no further action in the matter
I judged so from his parting words It consoles me a little he said to think that the Marquis de Valorsay is very rich and very well known and that he has a dozen friends who will be delighted to do him this trifling service
Until now M de Valorsay had cherished a hope that the loan was only delayed and the certainty that the decision was final crushed him
My ruins known he thought and feeling that his strength was deserting him he poured out a brimming glass of Madeira which he emptied at a single draught
The wine lent him fictitious energy
Fury mounted to his brain he lost all control over himself and springing up with his face purple with rage he exclaimed Its a shame
an infamous shame
and Trigault deserves to be severely punished
He has no business to keep a man in hot water for three days about such a trifle
If he had said No in the first place I should have made other arrangements and I shouldnt now find myself in a dilemma from which I see no possible way of escape
No gentleman would have been guilty of such a contemptible actno one but a shopkeeper or a thief would have stooped to such meanness
This is the result of admitting these ridiculous parvenus into society just because they happen to have money
It certainly hurt Pascal to hear these insults heaped upon the baron and it hurt him all the more since they were entirely due to the course he had personally adopted
However a gesture even a frown might endanger the success of his undertaking so he preserved an impassive countenance
I must say that I dont understand your indignation Monsieur le Marquis he said coldly
I can see why you might feel annoyed but why you should fly into a passion Ah
you dont know began M de Valorsay but he stopped short
It was time
The truth had almost escaped his lips
Know what
inquired Pascal
But the marquis was again upon his guard
I have a debt that must be paid this evening at all hazardsa sacred obligationin short a debt of honor
A debt of one hundred thousand francs
No it is only twentyfive thousand
Is it possible that a rich man like you can be troubled about such a trifling sum which any one would lend you
M de Valorsay interrupted him with a contemptuous sneer
Didnt you just tell me that we were living in an age when no one has any money except those who are in business
The richest of my friends have only enough for themselves even if they have enough
The time of old stockings stuffed full of savings is past
Shall I apply to a banker
He would ask two days for reflection and he would require the names of two or three of my friends on the note
If I go to my notary there will be endless forms to be gone through and remonstrances without number
For a moment or more already Pascal had been moving about uneasily on his chair like a man who is waiting for an opportunity to make a suggestion and as soon as M de Valorsay paused to take breath he exclaimed Upon my word
if I dared Well
I would offer to obtain you these twentyfive thousand francs
You
Yes I
Before six oclock this evening
Certainly
A glass of icewater presented to a parched traveller while journeying over the desert sands of Sahara could not impart greater relief and delight than the marquis experienced on hearing Pascals offer
He literally felt that he was restored to life
For ruin was inevitable if he did not succeed in obtaining twenty five thousand francs that day
If he could procure that amount he might obtain a momentary respite and to gain time was the main thing
Moreover the offer was a sufficient proof that his financial difficulties were not known
Ah
I have had a fortunate escape he thought
What if I had revealed the truth
But he was careful to conceal the secret joy that filled his heart
He feared lest he might say Yes too quickly so betray his secret and place himself at the mercy of the barons envoy
I would willingly accept your offer he exclaimed if If what
Would it be proper for me after the baron has treated me in such a contemptible manner to have any dealings with one of his subordinates
Pascal protested vigorously
Allow me to say he exclaimed that I am not any ones subordinate
Trigault is my client like thirty or forty othersnothing more
He employs me in certain difficult and delicate negotiations which I conduct to the best of my ability
He pays me and we are each of us perfectly independent of the other
From the look which Valorsay gave Pascal one would have sworn that he suspected who his visitor really was
But such was not the case
It was simply this a strange but by no means impossible idea had flashed through the marquiss mindOh
thought he this unknown party with whom Maumejan offers to negotiate the loan is probably none other than the baron himself
That worthy gambler has invented this ingenious method of obliging me so as to extort a rate of interest which he would not dare to demand openly
And why not
There have been plenty of such instances
Isnt it a wellknown fact that the N Brothers the most rigidly honest financiers in the world have never under any circumstances directly obliged one of their friends
If their own father of whom they always speak with the greatest veneration asked them to lend him fifty francs for a month they would say to him as they do to every one else We are rather cramped just now but see that rascal B
And that rascal B who is the most pliable tool in existence will providing father N offers unquestionable security lend the old gentleman his sons money at from twelve to fifteen per cent
interest plus a small commission
These ideas and recollections were of considerable assistance in restoring Valorsays composure
Enough said then he answered lightly
I accept with pleasure
But Ah
so there is a but
There is always one
I must warn you that it will be difficult for me to repay this loan in less than two months
This then was the time he thought necessary for the accomplishment of his designs
That does not matter replied Pascal and even if you desire a longer delay  That will be unnecessary thank you
But there is one thing more
What is that
What will this negotiation cost me
Pascal had expected this question and he had prepared a reply which was in perfect keeping with the spirit of the role he had assumed
I shall charge you the ordinary rates he answered six per cent
interest plus oneandahalf per cent
commission
Bah
Plus the remuneration for my trouble and services
And what remuneration will satisfy you
One thousand francs
Is it too much
If the marquis had retained the shadow of a doubt it vanished now
Ah
he sneered that strikes me as a very liberal compensation for your services
But he would gladly have recalled the sneer when he saw how the agent received it
Pascal drew up his head with a deeply injured air and remarked in the chilling tone of a person who is strongly tempted to retract his word Then there is nothing more to be said M le Marquis and since you find the conditions onerous I did not say so interrupted M de Valorsay quicklyI did not even think it
This gave Pascal an opportunity to present his programme and he availed himself of it
Others may pretend to oblige people merely from motives of friendship he remarked
But I am more honest
If I do anything in the way of business I expect to be paid for it and I vary my terms according to my clients need
It would be impossible to have a fixed price for services like mine
When on two different occasions I saved a gentleman of your acquaintance from bankruptcy I asked ten thousand francs the first time and fifteen thousand the second
Was that an exaggerated estimate of my services
I might boast with truth that I once assured the marriage of a brilliant viscount by keeping his creditors quiet while his courtship was in progress
The day after the wedding he paid me twenty thousand francs
Didnt he owe them to me
If instead of being a trifle short of money you happened to be ruined I should not ask you merely for a thousand francs
I should study your position and fix my terms according to the magnitude of the peril from which I rescued you
There was not a sentence not a word of this cynical explanation which had not been carefully studied beforehand
There was not an expression which was not a tempting bait to the marquiss evil instincts
But M de Valorsay made no sign
I see that you are a shrewd man Monsieur Maumejan said he and if I am ever in difficulty I shall apply to you
Pascal bowed with an air of assumed modesty but he was inwardly jubilant for he felt that his enemy would certainly fall into the trap which had been set for him
And now when shall I have this money
inquired the marquis
By four oclock
And I need fear no disappointment as in the barons case
Certainly not
What interest would M Trigault have in lending you a hundred thousand francs
None whatever
With me it is quite a different thing
The profit Im to realize is your security
In business matters distrust your friends
Apply to usurers rather than to them
Question people who are in difficulties and ninetyfive out of a hundred will tell you that their worst troubles have been caused by those who called themselves their best friends
He had risen to take leave when the door of the smokingroom opened and a servant appeared and said in an undertone Madame Leon is in the drawingroom with Dr Jodon
They wish to see you monsieur
Though Pascal had armed himself well against any unexpected mischance he changed color on hearing the name of the worthy housekeeper
All is lost if this creature sees and recognizes me
he thought
Fortunately the Marquis was too much engrossed in his own affairs to note the momentary agitation of Baron Trigaults envoy
It is strange that I cant have five minutes peace and quietness he said
I told you that I was at home to no one
But Enough
Let the lady and gentleman wait
The servant withdrew
The thought of passing out through the drawingroom filled Pascal with consternation
How could he hope to escape Madame Leons keen eyes
Fortunately M de Valorsay came to his relief for as Pascal was about to open the same door by which he had entered the marquis exclaimed Not that way
Pass out herethis is the shortest way
And leading him through his bedroom the marquis conducted him to the staircase where he even feigned to offer him his hand saying A speedy return dear M
Maumejan
It is not at the moment of peril that people endure the worst agony it is afterward when they have escaped it
As he went down the staircase Pascal wiped the cold sweat from his forehead
Ah
it was a narrow escape
he exclaimed under his breath
He felt proud of the manner in which he had sustained a part so repugnant to his nature
He was amazed to find that he could utter falsehoods with such a calm unblushing facehe was astonished at his own audacity
And what a success he had achieved
He felt certain that he had just slipped round M de Valorsays neck the noose which would strangle him later on
Still he was considerably disturbed by Madame Leons visit to the marquis
What is she doing here with this physician
he asked himself again and again
Who is this man
What new piece of infamy are they plotting to require his services
One of those presentiments which are prompted by the logic of events told him that this physician had been or would be one of the actors in the vile conspiracy of which he and Mademoiselle Marguerite were the victims
But he had no leisure to devote to the solution of this enigma
Time was flying and before returning to the marquiss house he must find out what had aroused the suspicions of the purchaser of those horses the biographies of which had been so rigidly exacted
Through the baron he might hope to obtain an interview with KamiBeyand so it was to the barons house that Pascal directed his steps
After the more than cordial reception which the baron had granted him that morning it was quite natural that the servants should receive him as a friend of the household
They would scarcely allow him to explain what he desired
It was the pompous head valet in person who ushered him into one of the small reception rooms exclaiming The barons engaged but Im sure he would be annoyed if he failed to see you and I will inform him at once
A moment later the baron entered quite breathless from his hurried descent of the staircase
Ah
you have been successful he exclaimed on seeing Pascals face
Everything is progressing as favorably as I could wish Monsieur le Baron but I must speak with that foreigner whom I met here this morning
KamiBey
Yes
And in a few words Pascal explained the situation
Providence is certainly on our side said the baron thoughtfully
Kami is still here
Is it possible
Its a fact
Did you think it would be easy to get rid of this confounded Turk
He invited himself to breakfast without the slightest ceremony and would give me no peace until I promised to play with him for two hours
I was closeted with him cards in hand when they told me you were here
Come well go and question him
They found the interesting foreigner in a savage mood
He had been winning when the servant came for the baron and he feared that an interruption would change the luck
What the devil took you away
he exclaimed with that coarseness of manner which was habitual with him and which the flatterers around him styled form
A man should no more be disturbed when hes playing than when hes eating
Come come prince said the baron goodnaturedly dont be angry and Ill give you three hours instead of two
But I have a favor to ask of you
The foreigner at once thrust his hand into his pocket with such a natural gesture that neither the baron nor Pascal could repress a smile and he himself understanding the cause of their merriment broke into a hearty laugh
Its purely from force of habit said he
Ah
since Ive been in Paris But what do you wish
The baron sat down and gravely replied You told us scarcely an hour ago that you had been cheated in the purchase of some horses
Cheated
it was worse than highway robbery
Would it be indiscreet to ask you by whom you have been defrauded
KamiBeys purple cheeks became a trifle pale
Hum
said he in an altered tone of voice that is a delicate question
My defrauder appears to be a dangerous fellowa duellistand if I disclose his knavery he is quite capable of picking a quarrel with menot that I am afraid of him I assure you but my principles dont allow me to fight
When a man has an income of a million he doesnt care to expose himself to the dangers of a duel
But prince in France folks dont do a scoundrel the honor to cross swords with him
Thats just what my steward who is a Frenchman told me but no matter
Besides I am not sufficiently sure of the mans guilt to noise it abroad
I have no positive proofs as yet
He was evidently terribly frightened and the first thing to be done was to reassure him
Come insisted the baron tell us the mans name
This gentleman herepointing to Pascalis one of my most esteemed friends
I will answer for him as I would for myself and we will swear upon our honor not to reveal the secret we ask you for without your permission
Truly
You have our word of honor replied both the baron and Pascal in a breath
After casting a halffrightened glance around him the worthy Turk seemed to gather courage
But no
He deliberated some time and then rejoined Really Im not sufficiently convinced of the accuracy of my suspicions to incur the risk of accusing a man who belongs in the very best society a man who is very rich and very highly respected and who would tolerate no imputations upon his character
It was plain that he would not speak
The baron shrugged his shoulders but Pascal stepped bravely forward
Then I will tell you prince he said the name that you are determined to hide from us
Oh
But you must allow me to remark that the baron and myself retract the promise we made you just now
Naturally
Then your defrauder is the Marquis de Valorsay
If KamiBey had seen an emissary of his sovereign enter the room carrying the fatal bowstring he would not have seemed more terrorstricken
He sprang nervously on to his short fat legs his eyes wildly dilating and his hands fluttering despairingly
Dont speak so loud
dont speak so loud
he exclaimed imploringly
As he did not even attempt to deny it the truth of the assertion might be taken for granted
But Pascal was not content with this
Now that we know the fact I hope Prince that you will be sufficiently obliging to tell us how it all happened he remarked
Poor Kami
He was in despair
Alas
he replied reluctantly nothing could be more simple
I wanted to set up a racing stable
Not that I care much for sport
I can scarcely distinguish a horse from a mulebut morning and evening everybody says to me Prince a man like you ought to make your name celebrated on the turf
Besides I never open a paper without reading Such a man ought to be a patron of the noblest of sports
At last I said to myself Yes they are right
I ought to take part in racing
So I began to look about for some horses
I had purchased several when the Marquis de Valorsay proposed to sell me some of his some that were very well known and that hadso he assured mewon at least ten times the amount they had cost him
I accepted his offer and visited his stables where I selected seven of his best horses and paid for them and I paid a good round price I assure you
Now comes the knavery
He has not given me the horses I purchased
The real animals the valuable oneshave been sold in England under false names and although the horses sent to me may be like the others in appearance they are really only common animals wanting both in blood and speed
Pascal and the baron exchanged astonished glances
It must be confessed that frauds of every description are common enough in the racing world and a great deal of dishonest manoeuvring results from greed for gain united with the fever of gambling
But never before had any one been accused of such an audacious and impudent piece of rascality as that which KamiBey imputed to Valorsay
How did you fail to discover this at the outset prince
inquired Pascal in an incredulous tone
Because my time was so much occupied
But your servants
Ah
thats another thing
I shouldnt be at all surprised if it were proved that the man who has charge of my stables had been bribed by the marquis
Then how were your suspicions aroused
It was only by the merest chance
A jockey whom I thought of employing had often ridden one of the animals which I fancied myself the owner of
Naturally I showed him the horse but he had no sooner set eyes on it than he exclaimed That the horse
Never
Youve been cheated prince
Then we examined the others and the fraud became apparent
Knowing Kamis character better than Pascal the baron had good reason to distrust the accuracy of these statements
For the Turkish millionaires superb contempt of money was only affected
Vanity alone unloosed his pursestrings
He was quite capable of presenting Jenny Fancy with a necklace costing fiveandtwenty thousand francs for the sake of seeing his generosity recorded in the Gaulois or the Figaro the next day but he would refuse to give a trifle to the mother of a starving family
Besides it was his ambition to be regarded as the most swindled man in Europe
But though he was shamefully imposed upon it was not voluntarily for there was a strong dose of Arabian avarice and distrust in his composition
Frankly prince said the baron your story sounds like one of the wild legends of your native land
Valorsay is certainly no fool
How is it possible that he could have been guilty of so gross a frauda fraud which might be which could not fail to be discovered in twentyfour hoursand which once proven would dishonor him forever
Before perpetrating such a piece of deception upon any one else he would have thought twice but upon me its different
Isnt it an established fact that a person incurs no risk in robbing Kami Bey
Had I been in your place I should have quietly instituted an investigation
What good would that have done
Besides the sale was only conditional and took place under the seal of secrecy
The marquis reserved the right to take his horses back on payment of a stipulated sum and the time he was to have for consideration only expired on the day before yesterday
Eh
why didnt you tell us that at first
cried the baron
The marquiss rascality was now easily explained
Finding himself in a desperate strait and feeling that his salvation was certain if he could only gain a little time he had yielded to temptation saying to himself like unfaithful cashiers when they first appropriate their employers money I will pay it back and no one will ever know it
However when the day of settlement came he had found himself in as deplorable a plight as on the day of the robbery and he had been compelled to yield to the force of circumstances
And what do you intend to do prince
asked Pascal
Ah
I am still in doubt
I have compelled the marquis to give me the papers in which the exploits of these horses are recorded
These statements will be of service in case of a lawsuit
But shall I or shall I not enter a complaint against him
If it were a mere question of money I should let the matter drop but he has defrauded and deceived me so outrageously that it annoys me
On the other hand to confess that he has cheated me in this fashion would cover me with ridicule
Besides the man is a dangerous enemy
And what would become of me if I happened to side against him
I should be compelled to leave Paris
Ah
Id give ten thousand francs to any one whod settle this cursed affair for me
His perplexity was so great and his anger so intense for that once he tore off his eternal fez and flung it on to the table swearing like a drayman
However controlling himself at last he exclaimed in a tone of assumed indifference No matter theres been enough said on this subject for one dayIm here to playso let us begin baron
For we are wasting precious time as you so often remark
Pascal had nothing more to learn so he shook hands with the baron made an appointment with him for the same evening and went away
It was only halfpast two a good hour and a half remained at his disposal
I will profit by this opportunity to eat something he thought a sudden faintness reminding him that he had taken nothing but a cup of chocolate that day
Thereupon perceiving a cafe near by he entered it ordered breakfast and lingered there until it was time to return to the Marquis de Valorsays
He would have gone there before the appointed time if he had merely listened to the promptings of his impatience so thoroughly was he persuaded that this second interview would be decisive
But prudence advised him not to expose himself to the danger of an encounter with Madame Leon and Dr Jodon
Well
Monsieur Maumejan cried the marquis as soon as Pascal made his appearance
He had been counting the seconds with intense anxiety as his tone of voice unmistakably revealed
In reply Pascal gravely drew from his pocket twentyfour bank notes of a thousand francs each and he placed them upon the table saying Here is the amount Monsieur le Marquis
I have of course deducted my commission
Now if you will write and sign a note for twentyfive thousand francs payable to my order two months hence our business for today will be concluded
M de Valorsays hand trembled nervously as he penned the desired note for until the very last moment he had doubted the promises of this unknown agent who had made his appearance so opportunely Then when the document was signed he carelessly slipped the money into a drawer and exclaimed So heres the needful to pay my debt of honor but my embarrassment is none the less great
These twentyfour thousand francs wont take the place of the hundred thousand which Baron Trigault promised me
And as Pascal made no reply the marquis began a desultory tramp up and down the smokingroom
He was very pale his brows were knit he looked like a man who was meditating a decisive step and who was calculating the consequences
But having no time to waste in hesitation he soon paused in front of Pascal and exclaimed Since you have just lent me twentyfour thousand francs why wont you lend me the rest
But Pascal shook his head
One risks nothing by advancing twentyfive thousand francs to a person in your position Monsieur le Marquis
Whatever happens such a sum as that can always be gathered from the wreck
But double or triple the amount
The deuce
that requires reflection and I must understand the situation thoroughly
And if I told you that I amalmost ruined what would you reply
I shouldnt be so very much surprised
M de Valorsay had now gone too far to draw back
Ah well
he resumed the truth is thismy affairs are terribly involved
The devil
You should have told me that sooner
Wait I am about to retrieve my fortuneto make it even larger than it has ever been
I am on the point of contracting a marriage which will make me one of the richest men in Paris but I must have a little time to bring the affair to a successful termination and I need moneyand my creditors are pressing me unmercifully
You told me this morning that you once assisted a man who was in a similar position
Will you help me
You can set your own price on your services
More easily overcome by joy than by sorrow Pascal almost betrayed himself
He had attained his object
Still he succeeded in conquering his emotion and it was in a perfectly calm voice that he replied I can promise nothing until I understand the situation Monsieur le Marquis
Will you explain it to me
I am listening
XIV
It was nearly midnight when M Wilkie left the Hotel dArgeles after the terrible scene in which he had revealed his true character
On seeing him pass out with haggard eyes colorless lips and disordered clothing the servants gathered in the vestibule took him at first for another of those ruined gamblers who not unfrequently left the house with despair in their hearts
Another fellow whos had bad luck
they remarked sneeringly to one another
No doubt about that
He is pretty effectually used up judging from appearances one of them remarked
It was not until some moments later that they learned a portion of the truth through the servants who had been on duty upstairs and who now ran down in great terror crying that Madame dArgeles was dying and that a physician must be summoned at once
M Wilkie was already far away hastening up the boulevard with an agile step
Any one else would have been overcome with shame and sorrowwould have been frightened by the thought of what he had done and have striven to find some way to conceal his disgrace but he not in the least
In this frightful crisis he was only conscious of one factthat just as he raised his hand to strike Madame Lia dArgeles his mother a big burly individual had burst into the room like a bombshell caught him by the throat forced him upon his knees and compelled him to ask the ladys pardon
He Wilkie to be humiliated in this style
He would never endure that
This was an affront he could not swallow one of those insults that cry out for vengeance and for blood
Ah
the great brute shall pay for it he repeated again and again grinding his teeth
And if he hastened up the boulevard it was only because he hoped to meet his two chosen friends M Costard and the Viscount de Serpillon the coproprietors of Pompier de Nanterre
For he intended to place his outraged honor in their care
They should be his seconds and present his demand for satisfaction to the man who had insulted him
A duel was the only thing that could appease his furious anger and heal his wounded pride
And a great scandal which he would be the hero of was not without a certain charm for him
What a glorious chance to win notoriety at an epoch when newspapers have become public laundries in which every one washes his soiled linen and dries it in the glare of publicity
He saw his already remarkable reputation enhanced by the interest that always attaches to people who are talked about and he could hear in advance the flattering whisper which would greet his appearance everywhere You see that young manhe is the hero of that famous adventure etc
Moreover he was already twisting and turning the terms of the notice which his seconds must have inserted in the Figaro hesitating between two or three equally startling beginnings Another famous duel or Yesterday after a scandalous scene an encounter etc etc
Unfortunately he did not meet either M Costard or the Viscount de Serpillon
Strange to say they were not in any of the cafes where the flower of French chivalry usually congregates in the company of goldenhaired young women from nine in the evening until one oclock in the morning
This disappointment grieved M Wilkie sorely although he derived some benefit from it for his disordered attire attracted attention at each place he entered and acquaintances eagerly inquired Where have you come from and what has happened to you
Whereupon he replied with an air of profound secrecy Pray dont speak of it
A shocking affair
If it were noised abroad I should be inconsolable
At last the cafes began to close and promenaders became rare
M Wilkie much to his regret was obliged to go home
When he had locked his door and donned his dressinggown he sat down to think over the events of the day and collect his scattered wits
What most troubled and disquieted him was not the condition in which he had left Madame Lia dArgeles his mother who was perhaps dying through his fault
It was not the terrible sacrifice that this poor woman had made for him in a transport of maternal love
It was not the thought of the source from which the money he had squandered for so many years had been derived
No M Wilkie was quite above such paltry considerationsgood enough for commonplace and antiquated people
He was too clever for that
Ah
yes
He had a stronger stomach and was up with the times
If he were sorely vexed in spirit it was because he thought that the immense property which he had believed his own had slipped perhaps for ever from his grasp
For rising threateningly between the Chalusse millions and himself he pictured the form of his father this man whom he did not know but whose very name had made Madame dArgeles shudder
M Wilkie was seized with terror when he looked his actual situation in the face
What was to become of him
He was certain that Madame dArgeles would not give him another sou
She could nothe recognized that fact
His intelligence was equal to that
On the other hand if he ever obtained anything from the counts estate which was more than doubtful would he not be obliged to wait a long time for it
Yes in all probability such would be the case
Then how should he live how would he be able to obtain food in the meantime
His despair was so poignant that tears came to his eyes and he bitterly deplored the step he had taken
Yes he actually sighed for the past he longed to live over again the very years in which he had so often complained of his destiny
Then though not a millionaire by any means he at least wanted for nothing
Every quarterday a very considerable allowance was promptly paid him and in great emergencies he could apply to Mr Patterson who always sent a favorable answer if not drawn upon too heavily
Yes he sighed for that time
Ah
if he had only then realized how fortunate he was
Had he not been one of the most opulent members of the society in which he moved
Had he not been flattered and admired more than any of his companions
Had he not found the most exquisite happiness in his part ownership of Pompier de Nanterre
Now what remained
Nothing save anxiety concerning the future and all sorts of uncertainties and terrors
What a mistake
What a blunder he had made
Ah
if he could only begin again
He sincerely wished that the great adversary of mankind had the Viscount de Coralth in his clutches
For in his despair it was the once dear viscount that he blamed accused and cursed
He was in this ungrateful frame of mind when a loud almost savage ring came at his door
As his servant slept in an attic upstairs Wilkie was quite alone in his rooms so he took the lamp and went to open the door himself
At this hour of the night the visitor could only be M Costard or the Viscount de Serpillon or perhaps both of them
They have heard that I was looking for them and so they have hastened here he thought
But he was mistaken
The visitor was neither of these gentlemen but M Ferdinand de Coralth in person
Prudence had compelled the viscount to leave Madame dArgeless cardparty one of the last but as soon as he was out of the house he had rushed to the Marquis de Valorsays to hold a conference with him far from suspecting that he was followed and that an auxiliary of Pascal Ferailleur and Mademoiselle Marguerite was even then waiting for him belowan enemy as formidable as he was humbleVictor Chupin
At sight of the man who had so long been his modelthe friend who had advised what he styled his blunderWilkie was so surprised that he almost dropped his lamp
Then as his wrath kindled Ah
so its you
he exclaimed angrily
You come at a good time
But M de Coralth was too much exasperated to notice Wilkies strange greeting
Seizing him roughly by the arm and closing the door with a kick he dragged Wilkie back into the little drawing room
Yes its I he said curtly
Its Icome to inquire if you have gone mad
Viscount
I can find no other explanation of your conduct
What
You choose Madame dArgeless reception day and an hour when there are fifty guests in her drawingroom to present yourself
Ah well
it wasnt from choice
I had been there twice before and had the doors shut in my face
You ought to have gone back ten times a hundred times a thousand times rather than have accomplished such an idiotic prank as this
Excuse me
What did I recommend
Prudence calmness and moderation persuasive gentleness sentiments of the loftiest nature tenderness a shower of tears Possibly but But instead of that you fall upon this woman like a thunderbolt and set the whole household in the wildest commotion
What could you be thinking of to make such an absurd and frightful scene
For you howled and shrieked like a street hawker and we could hear you in the drawingroom
If all is not irretrievably lost there must be a special Providence for the benefit of fools
In his dismay Wilkie endeavored to falter some excuses but he was only able to begin a few sentences which died away uncompleted in his throat
The violence shown by M de Coralth who was usually as cold and as polished as marble quieted his own wrath
Still toward the last he felt disposed to rebel against the insults that were being heaped upon him
Do you know viscount that I begin to think this very strange he exclaimed
If any one else had led me into such a scrape I should have called him to account in doublequick time
M de Coralth shrugged his shoulders with an air of contempt and threateningly replied Understand once for all that you had better not attempt to bully me
Now tell me what passed between your mother and yourself
First I should like Dash it all
Do you suppose that I intend to remain here all night
Tell me what occurred and be quick about it
And try to speak the truth
It was one of M Wilkies greatest boasts that he had an indomitable willan iron nature
But the viscount exercised powerful influence over him and to tell the truth inspired him with a form of emotion which was nearly akin to fear
Moreover a glimmer of reason had at last penetrated his befogged brain he saw that M de Coralth was rightthat he had acted like a fool and that if he hoped to escape from the dangers that threatened him he must take the advice of more experienced men than himself
So ceasing his recriminations he began to describe what he styled his explanation with Madame dArgeles
All went well at first for he dared not misrepresent the facts
But when he came to the intervention of the man who had prevented him from striking his mother he turned crimson and rage again filled his heart
Im sorry I let myself get into such a mess
he exclaimed
You should have seen my condition
My shirt collar was torn and my cravat hung in tatters
He was much stronger than Ithe contemptible scoundrelah
if it hadnt been for that But I shall have my revenge
Yes he shall learn that he cant trample a man under foot with impunity
To morrow two of my friends will call upon him and if he refuses to apologize or to give me satisfaction Ill cane him
It was evident enough that M de Coralth had to exercise considerable constraint to listen to these fine projects
I must warn you that you ought to speak in other terms of an honorable and honored gentleman he interrupted at last
Eh
what
You know him then
Yes Madame dArgeless defender is Baron Trigault
M Wilkies heart bounded with joy as he heard this name
Ah
this is capital
he exclaimed
What
So it was Baron Trigault the noted gamblerwho owns such a magnificent house in the Rue de la Ville lEveque the husband of that extremely stylish lady that notorious cocotte The viscount sprang from his chair and interrupting M Wilkie I advise you for the sake of your own safety he said measuring his words to give them greater weight never to mention the Baroness Trigaults name except in terms of the most profound respect
There was no misunderstanding M de Coralths tone and his glance said plainly that he would not allow much time to pass before putting his threat into execution
Having always lived in a lower circle to that in which the baroness sparkled with such lively brilliancy M Wilkie was ignorant of the reasons that induced his distinguished friend to defend her so warmly but he DID understand that it would be highly imprudent to insist or even to discuss the matter
So in his most persuasive manner he resumed Let us say no more about the wife but give our attention to the husband
So it was the baron who insulted me
A duel with himwhat good luck
Well
he may sleep in peace to night but as soon as he is up in the morning he will find Costard and Serpillon on hand
Serpillon has not an equal as a second
First he knows the best places for a meeting then he lends the combatants weapons when they have none he procures a physician and he is on excellent terms with the journalists who publish reports of these encounters
The viscount had never had a very exalted opinion of Wilkies intelligence but now he was amazed to see how greatly he had overestimated it
Enough of such foolishness he interrupted curtly
This duel will never take place
I should like to know who will prevent it
I will if you persist in such an absurd idea
You ought to have sense enough to know that the baron would kick Serpillon out of the house and that you would only cover yourself with ridicule
So between your duel and my help make your choice and quickly
The prospect of sending his seconds to demand satisfaction from Baron Trigault was certainly a very attractive one
But on the other hand Wilkie could not afford to dispense with M de Coralths services
But the baron has insulted me he urged
Well you can demand satisfaction when you obtain possession of your property but the least scandal now would spoil your last chances
I will abandon the project then sighed Wilkie despondently but pray advise me
What do you think of my situation
M de Coralth seemed to consider a moment and then gravely replied I think that UNASSISTED you have no chance whatever
You have no standing no influential connections no positionyou are not even a Frenchman
Alas
that is precisely what I have said to myself
Still I am convinced that with some assistance you might overcome your mothers resistance and even your fathers pretentions
Yes but where could I find protectors
The viscounts gravity seemed to increase
Listen to me said he I will do for you what I would not do for any one else
I will endeavor to interest in your cause one of my friends who is all powerful by reason of his name his fortune and his connectionsthe Marquis de Valorsay in fact
The one who is so well known upon the turf
The same
And you will introduce me to him
Yes
Be ready tomorrow at eleven oclock and I will call for you and take you to his house
If he interests himself in your cause it is as good as gained
And as his companion overwhelmed him with thanks he rose and said I must go now
No more foolishness and be ready tomorrow at the appointed time
Thanks to the surprising mutability of temper which was the most striking characteristic of his nature M Wilkie was already consoled for his blunder
He had received M de Coralth as an enemy but he now escorted him to the door with every obsequious attentionin fact just as if he looked upon him as his preserver
A word which the viscount had dropped during the conversation had considerably helped to bring about this sudden revulsion of feelings
You cannot fail to understand that if the Marquis de Valorsay espouses your cause you will want for nothing
And if a lawsuit is unavoidable he will be perfectly willing to advance the necessary funds
How could M Wilkie lack confidence after that
The brightest hopes the most ecstatic visions had succeeded the gloomy forebodings of a few hours before
The mere thought of being presented to M de Valorsay a nobleman celebrated for his adventures his horses and his fortune more than sufficed to make him forget his troubles
What rapture to become that illustrious noblemans acquaintance perhaps his friend
To move in the same orbit as this star of the first magnitude which would inevitably cast some of its lustre upon him
Now he would be a somebody in the world
He felt that he had grown a head taller and Heaven only knows with what disdain poor Costard and Serpillon would have been received had they chanced to present themselves at that moment
It is needless to say that Wilkie dressed with infinite care on the following morning no doubt in the hope of making a conquest of the marquis at first sight
He tried his best to solve the problem of appearing at the same time most recherche but at ease excessively elegant and yet unostentatious and he devoted himself to the task so unreservedly that he lost all conception of the flight of time so that on seeing M de Coralth enter his rooms he exclaimed in unfeigned astonishment You here already
It seemed to him that barely five minutes had elapsed since he took his place before the lookingglass to study attitudes and gestures with a new and elegant mode of bowing and sitting down like an actor practising the effects which are to win him applause
Why do you say already
replied the viscount
I am a quarter of an hour behind time
Are you not ready
Yes certainly
Let us start at once then my brougham is outside
The drive was a silent one
M Ferdinand de Coralth whose smooth white skin would ordinarily have excited the envy of a young girl did not look like himself
His face was swollen and covered with blotches and there were dark blue circles round his eyes
He seemed moreover to be in a most savage humor
He hasnt had sleep enough thought M Wilkie with his usual discernment he hasnt a bronze constitution like myself
M Wilkie himself was insensible to fatigue and although he had not closed his eyes the previous night he only felt that nervous trepidation which invariably attacks debutants and makes the throat so marvellously dry
For the first and probably the last time in his life M Wilkie distrusted his own powers and feared that he was not quite up to the mark as he elegantly expressed it
The sight of the Marquis de Valorsays handsome mansion was not likely to restore his assurance
When he entered the courtyard where the masters mailphaeton stood in waiting when through the open doors of the handsome stables he espied the many valuable horses neighing in their stalls and the numerous carriages shrouded in linen covers when he counted the valets on duty in the vestibule and when he ascended the staircase behind a lackey attired in a black dresscoat and as serious in mien as a notary when he passed through the handsome drawingrooms filled to overflowing with pictures armor statuary and all the trophies gained by the marquiss horses upon the turf M Wilkie mentally acknowledged that he knew nothing of high life and that what he had considered luxury was scarcely the shadow of the reality
He felt actually ashamed of his own ignorance
This feeling of inferiority became so powerful that he was almost tempted to turn and fly when the man clothed in black opened the door and announced in a clear voice M le Vicomte de CoralthM
Wilkie
With a most gracious and dignified airthe air of a true GRAND seigneurthe only portion of his inheritance which he had preserved intact the marquis rose to his feet and offering his hand to M de Coralth exclaimed You are most welcome viscount
This gentleman is undoubtedly the young friend you spoke of in the note I received from you this morning
The same and really he stands greatly in need of your kindness
He finds himself in an extremely delicate position and knows no one who can lend him a helping hand
Ah well I will lend him one with pleasure since he is your friend
But I must know the circumstances before I can act
Sit down gentlemen and enlighten me
M Wilkie had prepared his story in advance a touching and witty narrative but when the moment came to begin it he found himself unable to speak
He opened his mouth but no sound issued from his lips and it seemed as if he had been stricken dumb
Accordingly it was M de Coralth who made a statement of the case and he did it well
The narrative thus gained considerably in clearness and precision and even M Wilkie noticed that his friend understood how to present the events in their most favorable light and how to omit them altogether when his heartless conduct would have appeared too odious
He also noticedand he considered it an excellent omenthat M de Valorsay was listening with the closest attention
Worthy marquis
if his own interests had been in jeopardy he could not have appeared more deeply concerned
When the viscount had concluded his story he gravely exclaimed Your young friend is indeed in a most critical position a position from which he cannot escape without being terribly victimized if hes left dependent on his own resources
But it is understood that you will help him is it not
M de Valorsay reflected for a little and then addressing M Wilkie replied Yes I consent to assist you monsieur
First because your cause seems to me just and also because you are M de Coralths friend
I promise you my aid on one conditionthat you will follow my advice implicitly
The interesting young man lifted his hand and by dint of a powerful effort he succeeded in articulating Anything you wishupon my sacred word
You must understand that when I engage in an enterprise it must not fail
The eye of the public is upon me and I have my PRESTIGE to maintain
I have given you a great mark of confidence for in lending you my influence I become in some measure at least your sponsor
But I cannot accept this great responsibility unless I am allowed absolute control of the affair
And I think that we ought to begin operations this very day
The main thing is to circumvent your father the terrible man with whom your mother has threatened you
Ah
but how
I shall dress at once and go to the Hotel de Chalusse in order to ascertain what has occurred there
You on your side must hasten to Madame dArgeles and request her politely but firmly to furnish you with the necessary proofs to assert your rights
If she consents well and good
If she refuses we will consult some lawyer as to the next step
In any case call here again at four oclock
But the thought of meeting Madame dArgeles again was anything but pleasing to Wilkie
I would willingly yield that undertaking to some one else said he
Cannot some one else go in my place
Fortunately M de Coralth knew how to encourage him
What
are you afraid
he asked
Afraid
henever
It was easy to see that by the way he settled his hat on his head and went off slamming the door noisily behind him
What an idiot
muttered M de Coralth
And to think that there are ten thousand in Paris built upon the very same plan
M de Valorsay gravely shook his head
Let us thank fortune that he is as he is
No youth who possessed either heart or intelligence would play the part that I intend for him and enable me to obtain proud Marguerite and her millions
But I fear he wont go to Madame dArgeless house
You noticed his repugnance
Oh you neednt trouble yourself in the least on that account hell go
He would go to the devil if the noble Marquis de Valorsay ordered him to do so
M de Coralth understood Wilkie perfectly
The fear of being considered a coward by a nobleman like the Marquis de Valorsay was more than sufficient not only to divest him of all his scruples but even to induce him to commit any act of folly or actually a crime
For if he had looked upon M de Coralth as an oracle he considered the marquis to be a perfect god
Accordingly as he hastened toward Madame dArgeless residence he said to himself Why shouldnt I go to her house
Ive done her no injury
Besides she wont eat me
And remembering that he should be obliged to render a report of this interview he resolved to assert his superiority and to remain cool and unmoved as he had seen M de Coralth do so often
However the unusual aspect of the house excited his surprise and puzzled him not a little
Three huge furniture vans heavily laden were standing outside the gate
In the courtyard there were two more vehicles of the same description which a dozen men or so were busily engaged in loading
Ah ha
muttered M Wilkie it was fortunate that I camevery fortunate so she was going to run away
Thereupon approaching a group of servants who were in close conference in the hall he demanded in his most imperious manner Madame dArgeles
The servants remembered the visitor perfectly they now knew who he really was and they could not understand how he could have the impudence and audacity to come there again so soon after the shameful scene of the previous evening
Madame is at home replied one of the men in anything but a polite tone and I will go and see if she will consent to see you
Wait here
He went off leaving M Wilkie in the vestibule to settle his collar and twirl his puny mustaches with affected indifference but in reality he was far from comfortable
For the servants did not hesitate to stare at him and it was quite impossible not to read their contempt in their glances
They even sneered audibly and pointed at him and he heard five or six epithets more expressive than elegant which could only have been meant for himself
The fools
thought he boiling with anger
The scoundrels
Ah
if I dared
If a gentleman like myself was allowed to notice such blackguards how Id chastise them
But the valet who had gone to warn Madame dArgeles soon reappeared and put an end to his sufferings
Madame will see you said the man impudently
Ah
if I were in her place Come make haste rejoined Wilkie indignantly and following the servant he was ushered into a room which had already been divested of its hangings curtains and furniture
He here found Madame dArgeles engaged in packing a large trunk with household linen and sundry articles of clothing
By a sort of miracle the unfortunate woman had survived the terrible shock which had at first threatened to have an immediately fatal effect
Still she had none the less received her deathblow
It was only necessary to look at her to be assured of that
She was so greatly changed that when M Wilkies eyes first fell on her he asked himself if this were really the same person whom he had met on the previous evening
Henceforth she would be an old woman
You would have taken her for over fifty so terrible had been the sufferings caused her by the shameful conduct of her son
In this sadeyed haggardfaced woman clad in black no one would have recognized the notorious Lia dArgeles who only the evening before had driven round the lake reclining on the cushions of her victoria and eclipsing all the women around her by the splendor of her toilette
Nothing now remained of the gay worldling but the golden hair which she was condemned to see always the same since its tint had been fixed by dyes as indelible as the stains upon her past
She rose with difficulty when M Wilkie entered and in the expressionless voice of those who are without hope she asked What do you wish of me
As usual when the time came to carry out his happiest conceptions his courage failed him
I came to talk about our affairs you know he replied and I find you moving
I am not moving
Nonsense
you cant make me believe that
Whats the meaning of these carts in the courtyard
They are here to convey all the furniture in the house to the auctionrooms
Wilkie was struck dumb for a moment but eventually recovering himself a little he exclaimed What
you are going to sell everything
Yes
Astonishing upon my honor
But afterward
I shall leave Paris
Bah
and where are you going
With a gesture of utter indifference she gently replied I dont know I shall go where no one will know me and where it will be possible for me to hide my shame
A terrible disquietude seized hold of Wilkie
This sudden change of residence this departure which so strongly resembled flight this cold greeting when he expected passionate reproaches seemed to indicate that Madame dArgeless resolution would successfully resist any amount of entreaty on his part
The devil he remarked I dont think this at all pleasant
What is to become of me
How am I to obtain possession of the Count de Chalusses estate
Thats what I am after
Its rightfully mine and Im determined to have it as I told you once before
And when Ive once taken anything into my head He paused for he could no longer face the scornful glances that Madame dArgeles was giving him
Dont be alarmed she replied bitterly I shall leave you the means of asserting your right to my parents estate
Ahso Your threats obliged me to decide contrary to my own wishes
I felt that no amount of slander or disgrace would daunt you
Of course not when so many millions are at stake
I reflected and I saw that nothing would arrest you upon your downward path except a large fortune
If you were poor and compelled to earn your daily breada task which you are probably incapable of performingwho can tell what depths of degradation you might descend to
With your instincts and your vices who knows what crime you wouldnt commit to obtain money
It wouldnt be long before you were in the dock and I should hear of you only through your disgrace
But on the other hand if you were rich you would probably lead an honest life like many others who wanting for nothing are not tempted to do wrong who in fact show virtue in which there is nothing worthy of praise
For real virtue implies temptationa struggle and victory
Although he did not understand these remarks very well M Wilkie evinced a desire to offer some objections but Madame dArgeles had already resumed So I went to my notary this morning
I told him everything and by this time my renunciation of my rights to the estate of the Count de Chalusse is already recorded
What
your renunciation
Oh
no
Allow me to finish since you dont understand me
As soon as I renounce the inheritance it becomes yours
Truly
I have no wish to deceive you
I only desire that the name of Lia dArgeles should not be mentioned
I will give you the necessary proofs to establish your identity my marriage contract and your certificate of birth
It was joy that made M Wilkie speechless now
And when will you give me these documents
he faltered after a short pause
You shall have them before you leave this house but first of all I must talk with you
XV
Agitated and excited though he was M Wilkie had not once ceased to think of M de Coralth and the Marquis de Valorsay
What would they do in such a position and how should he act to conform himself to the probable example of these models of deportment
Manifestly he ought to assume that stolid and insolent air of boredom which is considered a sure indication of birth and breeding
Convinced of this and seized with a laudable desire to emulate such distinguished examples he had perched himself upon a trunk where he still sat with his legs crossed
He now pretended to suppress a yawn as he growled What
some more long phrases and another melodramatic display
Absorbed in the memories she had invoked Madame dArgeles paid no heed to Wilkies impertinence
Yes I must talk with you she said and more for your sake than for my own
I must tell you who I am and through what strange vicissitudes I have passed
You know what family I belong to
I will tell you howeverfor you may be ignorant of the factthat our house is the equal of any in France in lineage splendor of alliance and fortune
When I was a child my parents lived at the Hotel de Chalusse in the Faubourg Saint Germain a perfect palace surrounded by one of those immense gardens which are no longer seen in Parisa real park shaded with centuryold trees
Certainly everything that money could procure or vanity desire was within my reach and yet my youth was wretchedly unhappy
I scarcely knew my father who was devoured by ambition and had thrown himself body and soul into the vortex of politics
Either my mother did not love me or thought it beneath her dignity to make any display of sensibility but at all events her reserve had raised a wall of ice between herself and me
As for my brother he was too much engrossed in pleasure to think of a mere child
So I lived quite alone too proud to accept the love and friendship of my inferiorsabandoned to the dangerous inspirations of solitude and with no other consolation than my booksbooks which had been chosen for me by my mothers confessor and which were calculated to fill my imagination with visionary and romantic fancies
The only conversation I heard dealt with the means of leaving all the family fortune to my brother so that he might uphold the splendor of the name and with the necessity of marrying me to some superannuated nobleman who would take me without a dowry or of compelling me to enter one of those aristocratic convents which are the refuge and often the prison of poor girls of noble birth
I do not pretend to justify my fault I am only explaining it
I thought myself the most unfortunate being in the worldand such I really was since I honestly believed itwhen I happened to meet Arthur Gordon your father
I saw him for the first time at a fete given at the house of the Comte de Commarin
How he a mere adventurer had succeeded in forcing his way into the most exclusive society in the world is a point which I have never been able to explain
But alas
it is only too true that when our glances met for the first time my heart was stirred to its inmost depths I felt that it was no longer minethat I was no longer free
Ah
why does not God allow a mans face to reflect at least something of his nature
This man who was a corrupt and audacious hypocrite had that air of apparent nobility and frankness which inspires you with unlimited confidence and the melancholy expression on his features seemed to indicate that he had known sorrow and had good cause to rail at destiny
In his whole appearance there was certainly a mysterious and fatal charm
I afterward learned that this was only a natural result of the wild life he had led
He was only twentysix and he had already been the commander of a slave ship and had fought in Mexico at the head of one of those guerilla bands which make politics an excuse for pillage and murder
He divined only too well the impression he had made upon my heart
I met him twice afterward in society
He did not speak to me he even pretended to avoid me but standing a little on one side he watched my every movement with burning eyes in which I fancied I could read a passion as absorbing as my own
At last he ventured to write to me
The moment a letter addressed to me in an unknown hand was covertly handed me by my maid I divined that it came from him
I was frightened and my first impulse was to take it not to my mother whom I regarded as my natural enemybut to my father
However he chanced to be absent I kept the letter I read it I answered itand he wrote again
Alas
from that moment my conduct was inexcusable
I knew that it was worse than a fault to continue this clandestine correspondence
I knew my parents would never give my hand in marriage to a man who was not of noble birth
I knew that I was risking my reputation the spotless honor of our house my happiness and life
Still I persistedI was possessed with a strange madness that made me ready to brave every danger
Besides he gave me no time to breathe or reflect
Everywhere constantly every instant he compelled me to think of him
By some miracle of address and audacity he had discovered a means of intruding upon my presence even in my fathers house
For instance every morning I found the vases in my room full of choice flowers though I was never able to discover what hands had placed them there
Ah
how can one help believing in an omnipresent passion which one inhales with the very air one breathes
How can one resist it
I only discovered Arthur Gordons object when it was too late
He had come to Paris with the fixed determination of trapping some rich heiress and forcing her family to give her to him with a large dowry after one of those disgraceful scandals which render a marriage inevitable
At the very same time he was pursuing two other rich young girls persuaded that one of the three would certainly become his victim
I was the first to yield
One of those unforeseen events which are the work of Providence was destined to decide my fate
Several times already in compliance with Arthurs urgent entreaties I had met him at night time in a little pavilion in our garden
This pavilion contained a billiardroom and a spacious gallery in which my brother practised fencing and pistol shooting with his masters and friends
There thanks to the liberty I enjoyed we thought ourselves perfectly secure from observation and we were imprudent enough to light the candles
One night when I had just joined Arthur in the pavilion I thought I heard the sound of hoarse heavy breathing behind me
I turned round in a fright and saw my brother standing on the threshold
Oh
then I realized how guilty I had been
I felt that one or the other of these two menmy lover or my brotherwould not leave that room alive
I tried to speak to throw myself between them but I found I could neither speak nor move it was as if I had been turned to stone
Nor did they exchange a word at first
But at last my brother drew two swords from their scabbards and throwing one at Arthurs feet exclaimed I have no wish to assassinate you
Defend yourself and save your life if you can
And as Arthur hesitated and seemed to be trying to gain time instead of picking up the weapon that was lying on the floor near him my brother struck him in the face with the flat side of his sword and cried Now will you fight you coward
In an instant it was all over
Arthur caught up the sword and springing upon my brother disarmed him and wounded him in the breast
I saw this
I saw the blood spurt out upon my lovers hands
I saw my brother stagger beat the air wildly with his hands and fall apparently lifeless to the floor
Then I too lost consciousness and fell
Any one who had seen Madame dArgeles as she stood there recoiling in horror with her features contracted and her eyes dilated would have realized that by strength of will she had dispelled the mists enshrouding the past and distinctly beheld the scene she was describing
She seemed to experience anew the same agony of terror she had felt twenty years before and this lent such poignant intensity to the interest of her narrative that if M Wilkies heart was not exactly touched he was as he afterward confessed at least rather interested
But Madame dArgeles seemed to have forgotten his existence
She wiped away the foam flecked blood which had risen to her lips and in the same mournful voice resumed her story
When I regained my senses it was morning and I was lying still dressed on a bed in a strange room
Arthur Gordon was standing at the foot of the bed anxiously watching my movements
He did not give me time to question him
You are in my house said he
Your brother is dead
Almighty God
I thought I should die as well
I hoped so
I prayed for death
But in spite of my sobs he pitilessly continued It is a terrible misfortune which I shall never cease to regret
And yet it was his own fault
You who witnessed the scene
know that it was so
You can still see on my face the mark of the blow he dealt me
I only defended myself and you
I was ignorant then of the accepted code of duelling
I did not know that by throwing himself upon my brother before he was on guard Arthur Gordon had virtually assassinated him
He relied upon my ignorance for the success of the sinister farce he was playing
When I saw your brother fall he continued I was wild with terror and not knowing what I did I caught you up in my arms and brought you here
But dont tremble I know that you are not in my house of your own free will
A carriage is below and awaits your orders to convey you to your parents home
It will be easy to find an explanation for last nights catastrophe
Slander will not venture to attack such a family as yours
He spoke in the constrained tone and with that air which a brave man condemned to death would assume in giving utterance to his last wishes
I felt as if I were going mad
And you
I exclaimed you
What will become of you
He shook his head and with a look of anguish replied Me
What does it matter about me
I am ruined undoubtedly
So much the better
Nothing matters now that I must live apart from you
Ah
he knew my heart
He knew his power
Swayed by an emotion which was madness rather than heroism I sprang toward him and clasped him in my arms Then I too am lost
I cried
Since fate united us nothing but death shall separate us
I love you
I am your accomplice
Let the curse fall upon both
A keen observer would certainly have detected a gleam of fiendish joy in his eyes
But he protested or pretended to protest
With feigned energy he refused to accept such a sacrifice
He could not link my destiny to his for misery had ever been his lot and now that this last and most terrible misfortune had overtaken him he was more than ever convinced that there was a curse hanging over him
He would not suffer me to bring misery upon myself and eternal remorse upon him
But the more he repulsed me the more obstinately I clung to him
The more forcibly he showed the horror of the sacrifice the more I was convinced that my honor compelled me to make it
So at last he yielded or seemed to yield with transports of gratitude and love
Well
yes I accept your sacrifice my darling
he exclaimed
I accept it and before the God who is looking down upon us I swear that I will do all that is in human power to repay such sublime and marvellous devotion
And bending over me he printed a kiss upon my forehead
But we must fly
he resumed quickly
I have my happiness to defend now
I will not suffer any one to discover us and separate us now
We must start at once without losing a moment and gain my native land America
There we shall be safe
For rest assured they will search for us
Who knows but even now the officers of the law are upon our track
Your family is allpowerfulI am a mere nobodywe should be crushed if they discover us
They would bury you in a gloomy cloister and I should be tried as a common thief or as a vile assassin
My only answer was Let us go
Let us go at once
It had been easy for him to foresee what the result of this interview would be
A vehicle was indeed waiting at the door but not for the purpose of conveying me to the Hotel de Chalusseas was proved conclusively by the fact that his trunks were already strapped upon it
Besides the coachman must have received his instructions in advance for he drove us straight to the Havre Railway station without a word
It was not until some months afterward that these trifles which entirely escaped my notice at the time opened my eyes to the truth
When we reached the station we found a train ready to start and we took our places in it
I tried to quiet my conscience with miserable sophistries
Remembering that God has said to woman To follow thy husband thou shalt abandon all else native land paternal home parents and friends I told myself that this was the husband whom my heart had instinctively chosen and that it was my duty to follow him and share his destiny
And thus I fled with him although I thought I left a corpse behind methe corpse of my only brother
M Wilkie was actually so much interested that he forgot his anxiety concerning his attitude and no longer thought of M de Coralth and the Marquis de Valorsay
He even sprang up and exclaimed Amazing
But Madame dArgeles had already resumed Such was my great inexcusable irreparable fault
I have told you the whole truth without trying either to conceal or justify anything
Listen to my chastisement
On our arrival at Le Havre the next day Arthur confessed that he was greatly embarrassed financially
Owing to our precipitate flight he had not had time to realize the property he possessedat least so he told mea banker on whom he had depended had moreover failed him and he had not sufficient money to pay our passage to New York
This amazed me
My education had been absurd like that of most young girls in my station
I knew nothing of real life of its requirements and difficulties
I knew of course that there were rich people and poor people that money was a necessity and that those who did not possess it would stoop to any meanness to obtain it
But all this was not very clear in my mind and I never suspected that a few francs more or less would be a matter of vital importance
So I was not in the least prepared for the request to which this confession served as preface and Arthur Gordon was obliged to ask me pointblank if I did not happen to have some money about me or some jewelry which could be converted into money
I gave him all I had my purse containing a few louis a ring and a necklace with a handsome diamond cross attached to it
However the total value was comparatively small and such was Arthurs disappointment that he made a remark which frightened me even then though I did not fully understand its shameful meaning until afterward A woman who repairs to a rendezvous should always have all the valuables she possesses about her
One never knows what may happen
Want of money was keeping us prisoners at Le Havre when Arthur Gordon chanced to meet an old acquaintance who was the captain of an American sailing vessel
He confided his embarrassment to his friend and the latter whose vessel was to sail at the end of the same week kindly offered us a free passage
The voyage was one long torture to me for it was then that I first served my apprenticeship in shame and disgrace
By the captains offensive gallantry the lower officers familiarity of manner and the sailors ironical glances whenever I appeared on deck I saw that my position was a secret for no one
Everybody knew that I was the mistress and not the wife of the man whom I called my husband and without being really conscious of it perhaps they made me cruelly expiate my fault
Moreover reason had regained its ascendency my eyes were gradually opening to the truth and I was beginning to learn the real character of the scoundrel for whom I had sacrificed all that makes life desirable
Not that he had wholly ceased to practise dissimulation
But after the evening meal he often lingered at table smoking and drinking with his friend the captain and when he joined me afterward heated with alcohol he shocked me by advocating theories which were both novel and repulsive to me
Once after drinking more than usual he entirely forgot his assumed part and revealed himself in his true character
He declared he bitterly regretted that our love affair had ended so disastrously
It was deplorable to think that so happily conceived and so skilfully conducted a scheme should have terminated in bloodshed
And the blow had fallen just as he fancied he had reached the goal just as he thought he would reap the reward of his labor
In a few weeks more time he would undoubtedly have gained sufficient influence over me to persuade me to elope with him
This would of course have caused a great scandal the next day there would have been a family conclave a compromise would have been effected and finally a marriage arranged with a large dowry to hush up the affair
And I should now be a rich man he added a very rich manI should be rolling through the streets of Paris in my carriage instead of being on board this cursed ship eating salt cod twice a day and living on charity
Ah
it was no longer possible to doubt
The truth was as clear as daylight
I had never been loved not even an hour not even a moment
The loving letters which had blinded me the protestations of affection which had deceived me had been addressed to my fathers millions not to myself
And not unfrequently I saw Arthur Gordons face darken as he talked with evident anxiety about what he could do to earn a living for himself and me in America
I have had trouble enough to get on alone he grumbled
What will it be now
To burden myself with a penniless wife
What egregious folly
And yet I couldnt have acted differentlyI was compelled to do it
Why had he been compelled to do it
why had he not acted differentlythat was what I vainly puzzled my brain to explain
However his gloomy fears of poverty were not realized
A delightful surprise awaited him at New York
A relative had recently died leaving him a legacy of fifty thousand dollarsa small fortune
I hoped that he would now cease his constant complaints but he seemed even more displeased than before
Such is the irony of fate he repeated again and again
With this money I might easily have married a wife worth a hundred thousand dollars and then I should be rich at last
After that I had good reason to expect that I should soon be forsakenbut no shortly after our arrival he married me
Had he done so out of respect for his word
I believed so
But alas
this marriage was the result of calculation like everything else he did
We were living in New York when one evening he came home looking very pale and agitated
He had a French newspaper in his hand
Read this he said handing it to me
I took the paper as he bade me and read that my brother had not been killed that he was improving and that his recovery was now certain
And as I fell on my knees bursting into tears and thanking God for freeing me from such terrible remorse he exclaimed We are in a nice fix
I advise you to congratulate yourself
From that time forward I noticed he displayed the feverish anxiety of a man who feels that he is constantly threatened with some great danger
A few days afterward he said to me I cannot endure this
Have our trunks ready tomorrow and we will start South
Instead of calling ourselves Gordon well travel under the name of Grant
I did not venture to question him
He had quite mastered me by his cruel tyranny and I was accustomed to obey him like a slave in terror of the lash
However during our long journey I learned the cause of our flight and change of name
Your brother dn him he said one day is hunting for me everywhere
He wants to kill me or to deliver me up to justice I dont know which
He pretends that I tried to murder him
It was strange but Arthur Gordon who was bravery personified and who exposed himself again and again to the most frightful dangers felt a wild unreasoning inconceivable fear of my brother
It was this dread that had decided him to burden himself with me
He feared that if he left me lying unconscious beside my brothers lifeless form I might on recovering my senses reveal the truth and unconsciously act as his accuser
You were born in Richmond Wilkie where we remained nearly a month during which time I saw but little of your father
He had formed the acquaintance of several rich planters and spent his time hunting and gambling with them
Unfortunately fifty thousand dollars could not last long at this rate and in spite of his skill as a gambler he returned home one morning ruined
A fortnight later when he had sold our effects and borrowed all the money he could we embarked again for France
It was not until we reached Paris that I discovered the reasons that had influenced him in returning to Europe
He had heard of my father and mothers death and intended to compel me to claim my share of the property
He dared not appear in person on account of my brother
At last the hour of my vengeance had arrived for I had taken a solemn oath that this scoundrel who had ruined me should never enjoy the fortune which had been his only object in seducing me
I had sworn to die inch by inch and by the most frightful tortures rather than give him one penny of the Chalusse millions
And I kept my word
When I told him that I was resolved not to assert my rights he seemed utterly confounded
He could not understand how the down trodden slave dared to revolt against him
And when he found that my decision was irrevocable I thought he would have an attack of apoplexy
It made him wild with rage to think that he was only separated from this immense fortunethe dream of his lifeby a single word of mine and to find that he had not the power to extort that word from me
Then began a struggle between us which became more and more frightful as the money he possessed gradually dwindled away
But it was in vain that he resorted to brutal treatment in vain that he struck me tortured me and dragged me about the floor by the hair of my head
The thought that I was avenged that his sufferings equalled mine increased my courage a hundredfold and made me almost insensible to physical pain
He would certainly have been the first to grow weary of the struggle if a fiendish plan had not occurred to him
He said to himself that if he could not conquer the wife he COULD conquer the mother and he threatened to turn his brutatity to you Wilkie
To save youfor I knew what he was capable ofI pretended to waver and I asked twentyfour hours for reflection
He granted them
But the next day I left him forever flying from him with you in my arms
M Wilkie turned white and a cold chill crept up his spine
However it was not pity for his mothers sufferings nor shame for his fathers infamy that agitated him but ever the same terrible fear of incurring the enmity of this dangerous coveter of the Chalusse millions
Would he be able to hold his father at bay even with the assistance of M de Coralth and the Marquis de Valorsay
A thousand questions rose to his lips for he was eager to hear the particulars of his mothers flight but Madame dArgeles hurried on with her story as if she feared her strength would fail before she reached the end
I was alone with you Wilkie in this great city she resumed
A hundred francs was all that I possessed
My first care was to find a place of shelter
For sixteen francs a month which I was compelled to pay in advance I found a small meagrely furnished room in the Faubourg Saint Martin
It was badly ventilated and miserably lighted but still it was shelter
I said to myself that we could live there together by my work Wilkie
I was a proficient in feminine accomplishments I was an excellent musician and I thought I should have no difficulty in earning the four or five francs a day which I considered absolutely necessary for our subsistence
Alas
I discovered only too soon what chimerical hopes I had cherished
To give music lessons it is necessary to obtain pupils
Where should I find them
I had no one to recommend me and I scarcely dared show myself in the streets so great was my fear that your father would discover our hidingplace
At last I decided to try to find some employment in needlework and timidly offered my services at several shops
Alas
it is only those who have gone about from door to door soliciting work who know the misery of the thing
To ask alms would be scarcely more humiliating
People sneered at me and replied when they deigned to reply at all that there was no business doing and they had all the help they wanted
My evident inexperience was probably the cause of many of these refusals as well as my attire for I still had the appearance of being a rich woman
Who knows what they took me for
Still the thought of you sustained me Wilkie and nothing daunted me
I finally succeeded in obtaining some bands of muslin to embroider and some pieces of tapestry work to fill in
Unremunerative employment no doubt especially to one ignorant of the art of working quickly rather than well
By rising with daylight and working until late at night I scarcely succeeded in earning twenty sous a day
And it was not long before even this scanty resource failed me
Winter came and the cold weather with it
One morning I changed my last fivefranc pieceit lasted us a week
Then I pawned and sold everything that was not absolutely indispensable until nothing was left me but my patched dress and a single skirt
And soon an evening came when the owner of our miserable den turned us into the street because I could no longer pay the rent
This was the final blow
I tottered away clinging to the walls for support too weak from lack of food to carry you
The rain was falling and chilled us to the bones
You were crying bitterly
And all that night and all the next day aimless and hopeless we wandered about the streets
I must either die of want or return to your father
I preferred death
Toward eveninginstinct having led me to the SeineI sat down on one of the stone benches of the PointNeuf holding you on my knees and watching the flow of the dark river below
There was a strange fascinationa promise of peace in its depthsthat impelled me almost irresistibly to plunge into the flood
If I had been alone in the world I should not have stopped to consider a second but on your account Wilkie I hesitated
Moved by the thought of the danger he had escaped M Wilkie shuddered
Brrr
he growled
You did well to hesitate
She did not even hear him but continued I at last decided that it was best to put an end to this misery and rising with difficulty I was approaching the parapet when a gruff voice beside us exclaimed What are you doing there
I turned thinking some police officer had spoken but I was mistaken
By the light of the street lamp I perceived a man who looked some thirty years of age and had a frank and rather genial face
Why this stranger instantly inspired me with unlimited confidence I dont know
Perhaps it was an unconscious horror of death that made me long for any token of human sympathy
However it may have been I told him my story but not without changing the names and omitting many particulars
He had taken a seat beside me on the bench and I saw big tears roll down his cheeks as I proceeded with my narrative
It is ever so
it is ever so
he muttered
To love is to incur the risk of martyrdom
It is to offer ones self as a victim to every perfidy to the basest treason and ingratitude
The man who spoke in this fashion was Baron Trigault
He did not allow me to finish my story
Enough
he suddenly exclaimed follow me
A cab was passing he made us get in and an hour later we were in a comfortable room beside a blazing fire with a generously spread table before us
The next day moreover we were installed in a pleasant home
Alas
why wasnt the baron generous to the last
You were saved Wilkie but at what a price
She paused for a moment her face redder than fire but soon mastering her agitation she resumed There was one great cause of dissension between the baron and myself
I wished you to be educated Wilkie like the son of a noble family while he desired you should receive the practical training suited to a youth who would have to make his own way in the world and win position fortune and even name for himself
Ah
he was a thousand times right as events have since proved only too well
But maternal love blinded me and after an angry discussion he went away declaring he would not see me again until I became more reasonable
He thought that reflection would cure me of my folly
Unfortunately he was not acquainted with the fatal obstinacy which is the distinguishing characteristic of the Chalusse family
While I was wondering how I could find the means of carrying the plans I had formed for you into execution two of the barons acquaintances presented themselves with the following proposal Aware of the enormous profits derived by clandestine gambling dens they had conceived the project of opening a public establishment on a large scale where any Parisian or foreigner if he seemed to be a gentleman and possessed of means would find no difficulty in obtaining admission
By taking certain precautions and by establishing this gambling den in a private drawingroom they believed the scheme practicable and came to suggest that I should keep the drawingroom in question and be their partner in the enterprise
Scarcely knowing what I pledged myself to I accepted their offer influencedI should rather say decidedby the exalted positions which both these gentlemen occupied by the public consideration they enjoyed and the honored names they bore
And that same week this house was rented and furnished and I was installed in it under the name of Lia dArgeles
But this was not all
There still remained the task of creating for myself one of those scandalous reputations that attract public attention
This proved an easy task thanks to the assistance of my silent partners and the innocent simplicity of several of their friends and certain journalists
As for myself I did my best to insure the success of the horrible farce which was to lend infamous notoriety to the name of Lia dArgeles
I had magnificent equipages and superb dresses and I made myself conspicuous at the theatres and all places of public resort
As is generally the case when one is acting contrary to conscience I called the most absurd sophistries to my assistance
I tried to convince myself that appearances are nothing that reality is everything and that it did not matter if I were known as a courtesan since rumor lied and my life WAS really chaste
When the baron hastened to me and tried to rescue me from the abyss into which I had flung myself
it was too late
I had discovered that the business would prove successful and for your sake I longed for money as passionately as madly as any miser
Last year my gamingroom yielded more than one hundred and fifty thousand francs clear profit and I received as my share the thirtyfive thousand francs which you squandered
Now you know me as I really am
My associates my partners the men whose secret I have faithfully kept walk the streets with their heads erect
They boast of their unsullied honor and they are respected by every one
Such is the truth and I have no reason to make their disgrace known
Besides if I proclaimed it from the housetops no one would believe me
But you are my son and I owe you the truth the whole truth
In any age but the present Madame dArgeless story would have seemed absolutely incredible
Nowadays however such episodes are by no means rare
Two mentwo men of exalted rank and highly respected to use a common expressionassociate in opening a gaminghouse under the very eyes of the police and in coining money out of a womans supposed disgrace
Tis after all but an everyday occurrence
The unhappy woman had told her story with apparent coldness and yet in her secret heart she perhaps hoped that by disclosing her terrible sacrifice and long martyrdom she would draw a burst of gratitude and tenderness from her son calculated to repay her for all her sufferings
But the hope was vain
It would have been easier to draw water from a solid rock than to extract a sympathetic tear from Wilkies eyes
He was only alive to the practical side of this narrative and what impressed him most was the impudent assurance of Madame dArgeless business associates
Not a bad idea not bad at all he exclaimed
And boiling over with curiosity he continued I would give something handsome to know those mens names
Really you ought to tell me
It would be worth ones while to know
Any other person than this interesting young man would have been crushed by the look his mother gave hima look embodying the deepest disappointment and contempt
I think you must be mad she remarked coldly
And as he sprang up astonished that any one should doubt his abundant supply of good sense Let us put an end to this she sternly added
Thereupon she hastily went into the adjoining room reappearing a moment later with a roll of papers in her hand
Here she remarked is my marriage certificate your certificate of birth and a copy of my renunciationa perfectly valid document since the court has authorized it owing to my husbands absence
All these proofs I am ready and willing to place at your disposal but on one condition
This last word fell like a cold showerbath upon Wilkies exultant joy
What is this condition
he anxiously inquired
It is that you should sign this deed which has been drawn up by my notarya deed by which you pledge yourself to hand me the sum of two million francs on the day you come into possession of the Chalusse property
Two millions
The immensity of the sum struck Wilkie dumb with consternation
Nor did he forget that he would be compelled to give the Viscount de Coralth the large reward he had promised him a reward promised in writing unfortunately
I shall have nothing left he began piteously
But with a disdainful gesture Madame dArgeles interrupted him
Set your mind at rest said she
You will still be immensely rich
All the estimates which have been made are far below the mark
When I was a girl I often heard my father say that his income amounted to more than eight hundred thousand francs a year
My brother inherited the whole property and I would be willing to swear that he never spent more than half of his income
Wilkies nerves had never been subjected to so severe a shock
He tottered and his brain whirled
Oh
oh
he stammered
This was all he could say
Only I must warn you of a more than probable deception pursued Madame dArgeles
As my brother was firmly resolved to deprive me even of my rightful portion of the estate he concealed his fortune in every possible way
It will undoubtedly require considerable time and trouble to gain possession of the whole
However I know a man formerly the Count de Chalusses confidential agent who might aid you in this task
And this mans name
Is Isidore Fortunat
I saved his card for you
Here it is
M Wilkie took it up placed it carefully in his pocket and then exclaimed That being the case I consent to sign but after this you need not complain
Two millions at five per cent
ought to greatly alleviate ones sufferings
Madame dArgeles did not deign to notice this delicate irony
I will tell you in advance to what purpose I intend to apply this sum she said
Ah
I intend one of these two millions to serve as the dowry of a young girl who would have been the Count de Chalusses sole legatee if his death had not been so sudden and so unexpected
And the other one
The other I intend to invest for you in such a way that you can only touch the interest of it so that you will not want for bread after you have squandered your inheritance even to the very last penny
This wise precaution could not fail to shock such a brilliant young man as M Wilkie
Do you take me for a fool
he exclaimed
I may appear very generous but I am shrewd enough never you fear
Sign interrupted Madame dArgeles coldly
But he attempted to prove that he was no fool by reading and rereading the contract before he would consent to append his name to it
At last however he did so and stowed away the proofs which insured him the muchcoveted property
Now said Madame dArgeles I have one request to make of you
Whenever your father makes his appearance and lays claim to this fortune I entreat you to avoid a lawsuit which would only make your mothers shame and the disgrace attached to the hitherto stainless name of Chalusse still more widely known
Compromise with him
You will be rich enough to satisfy his greed without feeling it
M Wilkie remained silent for a moment as if he were deliberating upon the course he ought to pursue
If my father is reasonable I will be the same he said at last
I will choose as an arbiter between us one of my friendsa man who acts on the square like myselfthe Marquis de Valorsay
My God
do you know him
He is one of my most intimate friends
Madame dArgeles had become very pale
Wretched boy
she exclaimed
You dont know that its the marquis She paused abruptly
One word more and she would have betrayed Pascal Ferailleurs secret plans with which she had been made acquainted by Baron Trigault
Had she a right to do this even to put her son on his guard against a man whom she considered the greatest villain in the world
Well
insisted M Wilkie in surprise
But Madame dArgeles had recovered her selfpossession
I only wished to warn you against too close a connection with the Marquis de Valorsay
He has an excellent position in society but yours will be far more brilliant
His star is on the wane yours is just rising
All that he is regretting you have a right to hope for
Perhaps even now he is jealous of you and wishes to persuade you to take some false step
Ah
you little know him
I have warned you
M Wilkie took up his hat but though he was longing to depart embarrassment kept him to the spot
He vaguely felt that he ought not to leave his mother in this style
I hope I shall soon have some good news to bring you he began
Before night I shall have left this house she answered
Of course
But you are going to give me your new address
No
WhatNo
She shook her head sadly and in a scarcely audible voice responded It is not likely that we shall meet again
And the two millions that I am to turn over to you
Mr Patterson will collect the money
As for me say to yourself that Im dead
You have broken the only link that bound me to life by proving the futility of the most terrible sacrifices
However I am a mother and I forgive you
Then as he did not move and as she felt that her strength was deserting her she dragged herself from the room murmuring Farewell
XVI
Stupefied with astonishment M Wilkie stood for a moment silent and motionless
Allow me he faltered at last Allow meI wish to explain
But Madame dArgeles did not even turn her head the door closed behind her and he was left alone
However strong a mans nature may be he always has certain moments of weakness
For instance at the present moment Wilkie was completely at a loss what to do
Not that he repented he was incapable of that but there are hours when the most hardened conscience is touched and when long dormant instincts at last assert their rights
If he had obeyed his first impulse he would have darted after his mother and thrown himself on his knees before her
But reflection remembrance of the Viscount de Coralth and the Marquis de Valorsay made him silent the noblest voice that had spoken in his soul for many a long day
So with his head proudly erect he went off twirling his mustaches and followed by the whispers of the servantswhispers which were ready to change into hisses at any moment
But what did he care for the opinion of these plebeians
Before he was a hundred paces from the house his emotion had vanished and he was thinking how he could most agreeably spend the time until the hour appointed for his second interview with M de Valorsay
He had not breakfasted but his stomach was out of sorts as he said to himself and it would really have been impossible for him to swallow a morsel
Thus not caring to return home he started in quest of one of his former intimates with the generous intention of overpowering him with the great news
Unfortunately he failed to find this friend and eager to vent the pride that was suffocating him in some way or other he entered the shop of an engraver whom he crushed by his importance and ordered some visiting cards bearing the inscription W de Gordon Chalusse with a counts coronet in one of the corners
Thus occupied time flew by so quickly that he was a trifle late in keeping his appointment with his dear friend the marquis
Wilkie found M de Valorsay as he had left himin his smoking room talking with the Viscount de Coralth
Not that the marquis had been idle but it had barely taken him an hour to set in motion the machinery which he had had in complete readiness since the evening before
Victory
cried Wilkie as he appeared on the threshold
It was a hard battle but I asserted my rights
I am the acknowledged heir
the millions are mine
And without giving his friends time to congratulate him he began to describe his interview with Madame dArgeles presenting his conduct in the most odious light possible pretending he had indulged in all sorts of harsh rejoinders and making himself out to be a man of bronze or a block of marble as he said
You are certainly more courageous than I fancied said M de Valorsay gravely when the narrative was ended
Is that really so
It is indeed
Now the world is before you
Let your story be noised abroadand it will be noised abroadand you will become a hero
Imagine the amazement of Paris when it learns that Lia dArgeles was a virtuous woman who sacrificed her reputation for the sake of her sona martyr whose disgrace was only a shameful falsehood invented by two men of rank to increase the attractions of their gamblingden
It will take the newspapers a month to digest this strange romance
And whom will all this notoriety fall upon
Upon you my dear sir and as your millions will lend an additional charm to the romance you will become the lion of the season
M Wilkie was really too much overwhelmed to feel elated
Upon my word you overpower me my dear marquisyou quite overpower me he stammered
I too have been at work resumed the marquis
And I have made numerous inquiries in accordance with my promise
I almost regret it for what I have discovered isvery singular to say the least
I was just saying so to Coralth when you came in
What I have learned makes it extremely unpleasant for me to find myself mixed up in the affair accordingly I have requested the persons who gave me this information to call here
You shall hear their story and then you must decide for yourself
So saying he rang the bell and as soon as a servant answered the summons he exclaimed Show M Casimir in
When the lackey had retired to carry out this order the marquis remarked Casimir was the deceased counts valet
He is a clever fellow honest intelligent and well up in his businesssuch a man as you will need in fact and I wont try to conceal the fact that the hope of entering your service has aided considerably in unloosening his tongue
M Casimir who was irreproachably clad in black with a white cambric tie round his neck entered the room at this very moment smiling and bowing obsequiously
This gentleman my good fellow said M de Valorsay pointing to Wilkie is your former masters only heir
A proof of devotion might induce him to keep you with him
What you told me a little while ago is of great importance to him see if you can repeat it now for his benefit
In his anxiety to secure a good situation M Casimir had ventured to apply to the Marquis de Valorsay he had talked a good deal and the marquis had conceived the plan of making him an unsuspecting accomplice
I never deny my words replied the valet and since monsieur is the heir to the property I wont hesitate to tell him that immense sums have been stolen from the late counts estate
M Wilkie bounded from his chair
Immense sums
he exclaimed
Is it possible
Monsieur shall judge
On the morning preceding his death the count had more than two millions in banknotes and bonds stowed away in his escritoire but when the justice of the peace came to take the inventory the money could not be found
We servants were terribly alarmed for we feared that suspicion would fall upon us
Ah
if Wilkie had only been alone he would have given vent to his true feelings
But here under the eyes of the marquis and M de Coralth he felt that he must maintain an air of stoical indifference
He ALMOST succeeded in doing so and in a tolerably firm voice he remarked This is not very pleasant news
Two millions
thats a good haul
Tell me my friend have you any clue to the thief
The valets troubled glance betrayed an uneasy conscience but he had gone too far to draw back
I shouldnt like to accuse an innocent person he replied but there was some one who constantly had access to that escritoire
And who was that
Mademoiselle Marguerite
I dont know the lady
Shes a young girl who isat least people saythe counts illegitimate daughter
Her word was law in the house
What has become of her
She has gone to live with General de Fondege one of the counts friends
She wouldnt take her jewels and diamonds away with her which seemed very strange for they are worth more than a hundred thousand francs
Even Bourigeau said to me Thats unnatural M
Casimir
Borigeau is the concierge of the house a very worthy man
Monsieur will not find his equal
Unfortunately this tribute to the merits of the valets friend was interrupted by the arrival of a footman who after tapping respectfully at the door entered the room and exclaimed The doctor is here and desires to speak with Monsieur le Marquis
Very well replied M de Valorsay ask him to wait
When I ring you can usher him in
Then addressing M Casimir he added You may retire for the present but dont leave the house
M Wilkie will acquaint you with his intentions by and by
The valet thereupon backed out of the room bowing profoundly
There is a story for you
exclaimed M Wilkie as soon as the door was closed
A robbery of two millions
The marquis shook his head and remarked gravely Thats a mere nothing
I suspect something far more terrible
What pray
Upon my word
you frighten me
Wait
I may be mistaken
Even the doctor may lie deceived
But you shall judge for yourself
As he spoke he pulled the bell rope and an instant after the servant announced Dr
Jodon
It was indeed the same physician who had annoyed Mademoiselle Marguerite by his persistent curiosity and impertinent questions at the Count de Chalusses bedside the same crafty and ambitious man constantly tormented by covetousness and ready to do anything to gratify itthe man of the period in short who sacrificed everything to the display by which he hoped to deceive other people and who was almost starving in the midst of his mock splendor
M Casimir was an innocent accomplice but the doctor knew what he was doing
Interviewed on behalf of the Marquis de Valorsay by Madame Leon he had fathomed the whole mystery at once
These two crafty natures had read and understood each other
No definite words had passed between themthey were both too shrewd for that and yet a compact had been concluded by which each had tacitly agreed to serve the other according to his need
As soon as the physician appeared M de Valorsay rose and shook hands with him then offering him an armchair he remarked I will not conceal from you doctor that I have in some measure prepared this gentlemandesignating M Wilkiefor your terrible revelation
By the doctors attitude a keen observer might have divined the secret trepidation that always precedes a bad action which has been conceived and decided upon in cold blood
To tell the truth he began speaking slowly and with some difficulty now that the moment for speaking has come I almost hesitate
Our profession has painful exigencies
Perhaps it is now too late
If there had been any of the counts relatives in the house or even an heir at the time I should have insisted upon an autopsy
But now On hearing the word autopsy M Wilkie looked round with startled eyes
He opened his lips to interrupt the speaker but the physician had already resumed his narrative
Besides I had only suspicions he said suspicions based it is true upon strange and alarming circumstances
I am a man that is to say I am liable to error
In the kingdom of science it would be unpardonable temerity on my part to affirm To affirm what
interrupted M Wilkie
The physician did not seem to hear him but continued in the same dogmatic tone
The count apparently died from an attack of apoplexy but certain poisons produce similar and even identical symptoms which are apt to deceive the most experienced medical men
The persistent efforts of the counts intellect his muscular rigidity alternating with utter relaxation the dilation of the pupils of his eyes and more than aught else the violence of his last convulsions have led me to ask myself if some criminal had not hastened his end
Whiter than his shirt and trembling like a leaf M Wilkie sprang from his chair
I understand
he exclaimed
The count was murderedpoisoned
But the physician replied with an energetic protest
Oh not so fast
said he
Dont mistake my conjectures for assertions
Still I ought not to conceal the circumstances which awakened my suspicions
On the morning preceding his attack the count took two spoonfuls of the contents of a vial which the people in charge could not or would not produce
When I asked what this vial contained the answer was A medicine to prevent apoplexy
I dont say that this is false but prove it
As for the motive that led to the crime it is apparent at once
The escritoire contained two millions of francs and the money has disappeared
Show me the vial find the money and I will admit that I am wrong
But until then I shall have my suspicions
He did not speak like a physician but like an examining magistrate and his alarming deductions found their way even to M Wilkies dull brain
Who could have committed the crime
he asked
It could only have been the person likely to profit by it and only one person besides the count knew that the money was in the house and had possession of the key of this escritoire
And this person
Is the counts illegitimate daughter who lived in the house with himMademoiselle Marguerite
M Wilkie sank into his chair again completely overwhelmed
The coincidence between the doctors deposition and M Casimirs testimony was too remarkable to pass unnoticed
Further doubt seemed impossible
Ah
this is most unfortunate
faltered Wilkie
What a pity
Such difficulties never assail any one but me
What am I to do
And in his distress he glanced from the doctor to the Marquis de Valorsay and then at M de Coralth as if seeking inspiration from each of them
My profession forbids my acting as an adviser in such cases replied the physician but these gentlemen have not the same reasons for keeping silent
Excuse me interrupted the marquis quickly but this is one of those cases in which a man must be left to his own inspirations
The most I can do is to say what course I should pursue if I were one of the deceased counts relatives or heirs
Pray tell me my dear marquis sighed Wilkie
You would render me an immense service by doing so
M de Valorsay seemed to reflect for a moment and then he solemnly exclaimed I should feel that my honor required me to investigate every circumstance connected with this mysterious affair
Before receiving a mans estate one must know the cause of his death so as to avenge him if he has been foully murdered
For M Wilkie the oracle had spoken
Such is my opinion exactly he declared
But what course would you pursue my dear marquis
How would you set about solving this mystery
I should appeal to the authorities
Ah
And this very day this very hour without losing a second I should address a communication to the public prosecutor informing him of the robbery which is patent to any one and referring to the possibility of foul play
Yes that would be an excellent idea but there is one slight drawbackI dont know how to draw up such a communication
I know no more about it than you do yourself but any lawyer or notary will give you the necessary information
Are you acquainted with any such person
Would you like me to give you the address of my business man
He is a very clever fellow who has almost all the members of my club as his clients
This last reason was more than sufficient to fix M Wilkies choice
Where can I find him
he inquired
At his househe is always there at this hour
Come
here is a scrap of paper and a pencil
You had better make a note of his address
Write Maumejan Route de la Revolte
Tell him that I sent you and he will treat you with the same consideration as he would show to me
He lives a long way off but my brougham is standing in the courtyard so take it and when your consultation is over come back and dine with me
Ah
you are too kind
exclaimed M Wilkie
You overpower me my dear marquis you do upon my word
I shall fly and be back in a moment
He went off looking radiant and a moment later the carriage which was to take him to M Maumejans was heard rolling out of the courtyard
The doctor had already taken up his hat and cane
You will excuse me for leaving you so abruptly Monsieur le Marquis said he but I have an engagement to discuss a business matter
Indeed
I am negotiating for the purchase of a dentists establishment
What you
Yes I
You may tell me that this is a downfall but I will answer It will give me a living
Medicine is becoming a more and more unremunerative profession
However hard a physician may work he can scarcely pay for the water he uses in washing his hands
I have an opportunity of purchasing the business of a wellestablished and wellknown dentist in an excellent neighborhood
Why not avail myself of it
Only one thing worries methe lack of funds
The marquis had expected the doctor would require remuneration for his services
Before compromising himself any further M Jodon wished to knew what compensation he was to receive
The marquis was so sure of this that he quickly exclaimed Ah my dear doctor if you have need of twenty thousand francs I shall be only too happy to offer them to you
Really
Upon my honor
And when can you let me have the money
In three or four days time
The bargain was concluded
The doctor was now ready to find traces of any poison whatsoever in the Count de Chalusses exhumed remains
He pressed the marquiss hand and then went off exclaiming Whatever happens you can count upon me
Left alone with the Viscount de Coralth and consequently freed from all restraint M de Valorsay rose with a longdrawn sigh of relief
What an interminable seance
he growled
And approaching his acolyte who was sitting silent and motionless in an armchair he slapped him on the shoulder exclaiming Are you ill that you sit there like that as still as a mummy
The viscount turned as if he had been suddenly aroused from slumber
Im well enough he answered somewhat roughly
I was only thinking
Your thoughts are not very pleasant to judge from the look on your face
No
I was thinking of the fate that you are preparing for us
Oh
A truce to disagreeable prophecies please
Besides its too late to draw back or to even think of retreat
The Rubicon is passed
Alas
that is the cause of my anxiety
If it hadnt been for my wretched past which you have threatened me with like a dagger I should long ago have left you to incur this danger alone
You were useful to me in times past I admit
You presented me to the Baroness Trigault to whose patronage I owe my present means but I am paying too dearly for your services in allowing myself to be made the instrument of your dangerous schemes
Who aided you in defrauding KamiBey
Who bet for you against your own horse Domingo
Who risked his life in slipping those cards in the pack which Pascal Ferailleur held
It was Coralth always Coralth
A gesture of anger escaped the marquis but resolving to restrain himself he made no rejoinder
It was not until after he had walked five or six times round the smokingroom and grown more calm that he returned to the viscounts side
Really I dont recognize you he began
Is it really you who have turned coward
And at what a moment pray
Why on the very eve of success
I wish I could believe you
Facts shall convince you
This morning I might have doubted but now thanks to that vain idiot who goes by the name of Wilkie I am sure perfectly mathematically sure of success
Maumejan who is entirely devoted to me and who is the greediest most avaricious scoundrel alive will draw up such a complaint that Marguerite will sleep in prison
Moreover other witnesses will be summoned
By what Casimir has said you can judge what the other servants will say
This testimony will be sufficient to convict her of the robbery
As for the poisoning you heard Dr Jodon
Can I depend upon him
Evidently if I pay without haggling
Very well I shall pay
But all this did not reassure M de Coralth
The accusation will fall to the ground said he as soon as the famous vial from which M de Chalusse took two spoonfuls is found
Excuse me it wont be found
But why
Because I know where it is my dear friend
It is in the counts escritoire but it wont be there any longer on the day after to morrow
Who will remove it
A skilful fellow whom Madame Leon has found for me
Everything has been carefully arranged
Tomorrow night at the latest Madame Leon will let this man into the Hotel de Chalusse by the garden gate which she has kept the key of
Vantrasson as the man is called knows the management of the house and he will break open the escritoire and take the vial away
You may say that there are seals upon the furniture placed there by the justice of the peace
Thats true but this man tells me that he can remove and replace them in such a way as to defy detection and as the lock has been forced once alreadythe day after the counts deatha second attempt to break the escritoire open will not be detected
The viscount remarked with an ironical air All that is perfect but the autopsy will reveal the falseness of the accusation
Naturallybut an autopsy will require time and that will suit my plans admirably
After eight or ten days solitary confinement and several rigid examinations Mademoiselle Marguerites energy and courage will flag
What do you think she will reply to the man who says to her I love you and for your sake I will attempt the impossible
Swear to become my wife and I will establish your innocence
I think she will say Save me and I will marry you
M de Valorsay clapped his hands
Bravo
he exclaimed you have spoken the truth
Remember now that your dark forebodings are only chimeras
Yes she will swear it and I know she is the woman to keep her vow even if she died of sorrow
And the very next day I will go to the examining magistrate and say to him Marguerite a thief
Ah what a frightful mistake
A robbery has been committed its true but I know the real culprita scoundrel who fancied that by destroying a single letter he would annihilate all traces of the breach of fidelity he had committed
Fortunately the Count de Chalusse distrusted this man and proof of his breach of trust is in existence
I have this proof in my hands
And I will show a letter establishing the truth of my assertion
No forebodings clouded the marquiss joy he saw no obstacles it seemed to him as if he had already triumphed
And the day following he resumed when Marguerite becomes my wife I shall take from a certain drawer a certain document given to me by M de Chalusse when I was on the point of becoming his soninlaw and in which he recognizes Marguerite as his daughter and makes her his sole legatee
And this document is perfectly en regle and unattackable
Maumejan who has examined it guarantees that the value of the counts estate cannot be less than ten millions
Five will go to Madame dArgeles or her son Wilkie as their share of the property
The remaining five will be mine
Come confess that the plan is admirable
Admirable undoubtedly but terribly complicated
When there are so many wheels within wheels one of them is always sure to get out of order
Nonsense
Besides you have I dont know how many accomplicesMaumejan the doctor Madame Leon and Vantrasson not counting myself
Will all these people perform their duties satisfactorily
Each of them is as much interested in my success as I am myself
But we have enemiesMadame dArgeles Fortunat Madame dArgeles is about to leave Paris
If Fortunat is troublesome I will purchase his silence Maumejan has promised me money
But M de Coralth had kept his strongest argument until the last
And Pascal Ferailleur
said he
You have forgotten him
No M de Valorsay had not forgotten him
You do not forget the man you have ruined and dishonored
Still it was in a careless tone that ill accorded with his state of mind that the marquis replied The poor devil must be en route for America by this time
The viscount shook his head
Thats what Ive in vain been trying to convince myself of said he
Do you know that Pascal was virtually expelled from the Palais de Justice and that his name has been struck off the list of advocates
If he hasnt blown his brains out it is only because he hopes to prove his innocence
Ah
if you knew him as well as I do you wouldnt be so tranquil in mind
He stopped short for the door had suddenly opened
The interruption made the marquis frown but anger gave way to anxiety when he perceived Madame Leon who entered the room out of breath and extremely red in the face
There wasnt a cab to be had
she groaned
Just my luck
I came on foot and ran the whole way
Im utterly exhausted and so saying she sank into an armchair
M de Valorsay had turned very pale
Defer your complaints until another time he said harshly
What has happened
Tell me
The estimable woman raised her hands to heaven as she plaintively replied There is so much to tell
First Mademoiselle Marguerite has written two letters but I have failed to discover to whom they were sent
Secondly she remained for more than an hour yesterday evening in the drawingroom with the Generals son Lieutenant Gustave and on parting they shook hands like a couple of friends and said It is agreed
And is that all
One moment and youll see
This morning Mademoiselle went out with Madame de Fondege to call on the Baroness Trigault
I do not know what took place there but there must have been a terrible scene for they brought Mademoiselle Marguerite back unconscious in one of the barons carriages
Do you hear that viscount
exclaimed M de Valorsay
Yes
You shall have the explanation tomorrow answered M de Coralth
And last but not least resumed Madame Leon on returning home this evening at about five oclock I fancied I saw Mademoiselle Marguerite leave the house and go up the Rue Pigalle
I had thought she was ill and in bed and I said to myself This is very strange
So I hastened after her
It was indeed she
Of course I followed her
And what did I see
Why Mademoiselle paused to talk with a vagabond clad in a blouse
They exchanged notes and Mademoiselle Marguerite returned home
And here I am
She must certainly suspect something
What is to be done
If M de Valorsay were frightened he did not show it
Many thanks for your zeal my dear lady he replied but all this is a mere nothing
Return home at once you will receive my instructions tomorrow
XVII
Mademoiselle Marguerite had been greatly surprised on the occasion of her visit to M Fortunat when she saw Victor Chupin suddenly step forward and eagerly exclaim I shall be unworthy of the name I bear if I do not find M Ferailleur for you in less than a fortnight
It is true that M Fortunats clerk did not appear to the best advantage on this occasion
In order to watch M de Coralth he had again arrayed himself in his castoff clothes and with his blouse and his wornout shoes his knockers and his glazed cap he looked the vagabond to perfection
Still strange as it may seem Mademoiselle Marguerite did not once doubt the devotion of this strange auxiliary
Without an instants hesitation she replied I accept your services monsieur
Chupin felt at least a head taller as he heard this beautiful young girl speak to him in a voice as clear and as sonorous as crystal
Ah
you are right to trust me he rejoined striking his chest with his clinched hand for I have a heartbut But what monsieur
I am wondering if you would consent to do what I wish
It would be a very good plan but if it displeases you we will say no more about it
And what do you wish
To see you every day so as to tell you what Ive done and to obtain such directions as I may require
Im well aware that I cant go to M de Fondeges door and ask to speak to you but there are other ways of seeing each other
For instance every evening at five oclock precisely I might pass along the Rue Pigalle and warn you of my presence by such a signal as this Piouit
So saying he gave vent to the peculiar call half whistle half ejaculation which is familiar to the Parisian workingclasses
Then he resumed you might come down and I would tell you the news besides I might often help you by doing errands
Mademoiselle Marguerite reflected for a moment and then bowing her head she replied What you suggest is quite practicable
On and after tomorrow evening I will watch for you and if I dont come down at the end of half an hour you will know that I am unavoidably detained
Chupin ought to have been satisfied
But no he had still another request to make and instinct supplying the lack of education told him that it was a delicate one
Indeed he dared not present his petition but his embarrassment was so evident and he twisted his poor cap so despairingly that at last the young girl gently asked him Is there anything more
He still hesitated but eventually mustering all his courage he replied Well yes mademoiselle
Ive never seen Monsieur Ferailleur
Is he tall or short light or dark stout or thin
I do not know
I might stand face to face with him without being able to say Its he
But it would be quite a different thing if I only had a photograph of him
A crimson flush spread over Mademoiselle Marguerites face
Still she answered unaffectedly I will give you M Ferailleurs photograph tomorrow monsieur
Then I shall be all right
exclaimed Chupin
Have no fears mademoiselle we shall outwit these scoundrels
So far a silent witness of this scene M Fortunat now felt it his duty to interfere
He was not particularly pleased by his clerks suddenly increased importance and yet it mattered little to him for his only object was to revenge himself on Valorsay
Victor is a capable and trustworthy young fellow mademoiselle he declared he has grown up under my training and I think you will find him a faithful servant
A have you finished you old liar
rose to Chupins lips but respect for Mademoiselle Marguerite prevented him from uttering the words
Then everything is decided she said pleasantly
And with a smile she offered her hand to Chupin as one does in concluding a bargain
If he had yielded to his first impulse he would have thrown himself on his knees and kissed this hand of hers the whitest and most beautiful he had ever seen
As it was he only ventured to touch it with his fingertips and yet he changed color two or three times
What a woman
he exclaimed when she had left them
A perfect queen
A man would willingly allow himself to be chopped in pieces for her sake and shes as good and as clever as shes handsome
Did you notice monsieur that she did not offer to pay me
She understood that I offered to work for her for my own pleasure for my own satisfaction and honor
Heavens
how I should have chafed if she had offered me money
How provoked I should have been
Chupin was so fascinated that he wished no reward for his toil
This was so astonishing that M Fortunat remained for a moment speechless with surprise
Have you gone mad Victor
he inquired at last
Mad
Inot at all Im only becoming He stopped short
He was going to add an honest man
But it is scarcely proper to talk about the rope in the hangmans house and there are certain words which should never be pronounced in the presence of certain people
Chupin knew this and so he quickly resumed When I become rich when Im a great banker and have a host of clerks who spend their time in counting my gold behind a grating I should like to have a wife of my own like that
But I must be off about my business now so till we meet again monsieur
The foregoing conversation will explain how it happened that Madame Leon chanced to surprise her dear young lady in close conversation with a vagabond clad in a blouse
Victor Chupin was not a person to make promises and then leave them unfulfilled
Though he was usually unimpressionable like all who lead a precarious existence still when his emotions were once aroused they did not spend themselves in empty protestations
It became his fixed determination to find Pascal Ferailleur and the difficulties of the task in no wise weakened his resolution
His starting point was that Pascal had lived in the Rue dUlm and had suddenly gone off with his mother with the apparent intention of sailing for America
This was all he knew positively and everything else was mere conjecture
Still Mademoiselle Marguerite had convinced him that instead of leaving Paris Pascal was really still there only waiting for an opportunity to establish his innocence and to wreak his vengeance upon M de Coralth and the Marquis de Valorsay
On the other hand with such a slight basis to depend upon was it not almost madness to hope to discover a man who had such strong reasons for concealing himself
Chupin did not think so in fact when he declared his determination to perform this feat his plan was already perfected
On leaving M Fortunats office he hastened straight to the Rue dUlm at the top of his speed
The concierge of the house where Pascal had formerly resided was by no means a polite individual
He was the very same man who had answered Mademoiselle Marguerites questions so rudely but Chupin had a way of conciliating even the most crabbish doorkeeper and of drawing from him such information as he desired
He learned that at nine oclock on the sixteenth of October Madame Ferailleur after seeing her trunks securely strapped on to a cab had entered the vehicle ordering the driver to take her to the Railway Station in the Place du Havre
Chupin wished to ascertain the number of the cab but the concierge could not give it
He mentioned however that this cab had been procured by Madame Ferailleurs servant woman who lived only a few steps from the house
A moment later Chupin was knocking at this womans door
She was a very worthy person and bitterly regretted the misfortunes which had befallen her former employers
She confirmed the doorkeepers story but unfortunately she too had quite forgotten the number of the vehicle
All she could say was that she had hired it at the cab stand in the Rue Soufflot and that the driver was a portly pleasantfaced man
Chupin repaired at once to the Rue Soufflot where he found the man in charge of the stand in the most savage mood imaginable
He began by asking Chupin what right he had to question him why he wished to do so and if he took him for a spy
He added that his duty only consisted in noting the arrivals and departures of the drivers and that he could give no information whatever
There was evidently nothing to be gained from this ferocious personage and yet Chupin bowed none the less politely as he left the little office
This is bad he growled as he walked away for he was really at a loss what to do next and if not discouraged he was at least extremely disconcerted and perplexed
Ah
if he had only had a card from the prefecture of police in his pocket or if he had been more imposing in appearance he would have encountered no obstacles he might then have tracked this cab through the streets of Paris as easily as he could have followed a man bearing a lighted lantern through the darkness
But poor and humble without letters of recommendation and with no other auxiliaries than his own shrewdness and experience he had a great deal to contend against
Pausing in his walk he had taken off his cap and was scratching his head furiously when suddenly he exclaimed What an ass I am
in so loud a tone that several passersby turned to see who was applying this unflattering epithet to himself
Chupin had just remembered one of M Isidore Fortunats debtors a man whom he often visited in the hope of extorting some trifling amount from him and who was employed in the Central office of the Paris Cab Company
If any one can help me out of this difficulty it must be that fellow he said to himself
I hope I shall find him at his desk
Come Victor my boy you must look alive
However he could not present himself at the office in the garb he then wore and so much against his will he went home and changed his clothes
Then he took a cab at his own expense and drove with all possible speed to the main office of the Cab Company in the Avenue de Segur
Nevertheless it was already ten oclock when he arrived there
He was more fortunate than he had dared to hope
The man he wanted had charge of a certain department and was compelled to return to the office every evening after dinner
He was there now
He was a poor devil who while receiving a salary of fifteen hundred francs a year spent a couple of thousand and utilized his wits in defending his meagre salary from his creditors
On perceiving Chupin he made a wrathful gesture and his first words were I havent got a penny
But Chupin smiled his most genial smile
What
said he do you fancy Ive come to collect money from you here and at this hour
You dont know me
I merely came to ask a favor of you
The clerks clouded face brightened
Since that is the case pray take a seat and tell me how I can serve you he replied
Very well
At nine oclock in the evening on the sixteenth of October a lady living in the Rue dUlm sent to the stand in the Rue Soufflot for a cab
Her baggage was placed upon it and she went away no one knows where
However this lady is a relative of my employer and he so much wishes to find her that he would willingly give a hundred francs over and above the amount you owe him to ascertain the number of the vehicle
He pretends that you can give him this number if you choose and it isnt an impossibility is it
On the contrary nothing could be easier replied the clerk glad of an opportunity to explain the ingenious mechanism of the office to an outsider
Have you ten minutes to spare
Ten days if necessary rejoined Chupin
Then you shall see
So saying the clerk rose and went into the adjoining room whence a moment later he returned carrying a large green box
This contains the October reports sent in every evening by the branch offices he remarked in explanation
He next opened the box glanced over the documents it contained and joyfully exclaimed Here we have it
This is the report sent in by the superintendent of the cabstand in the Rue Soumot on the 16th October
Here is a list of the vehicles that arrived or left from a quarter to nine oclock till a quarter past nine
Five cabs came in but we need not trouble ourselves about them
Three went out bearing the numbers 1781 3025 and 2140
One of these three must have taken your employers relative
Then I must question the three drivers
The clerk shrugged his shoulders
What is the use of doing that
he said disdainfully
Ah
you dont understand the way in which we manage our business
The drivers are artful but the company isnt a fool
By expending a hundred and fifty thousand francs on its detective force every year it knows what each cab is doing at each hour of the day
I will now look for the reports sent in respecting these three drivers
One of the three will give us the desired information
This time the search was a considerably longer one and Chupin was beginning to grow impatient when the clerk waved a soiled and crumpled sheet of paper triumphantly in the air and cried What did I tell you
This is the report concerning the driver of No
2140
Listen Friday at ten minutes past nine sent to the Rue dUlm What do you think of that
Its astonishing
But where can I find this driver
I cant say just at this moment hes on duty now
But as he belongs to this division he will be back sooner or later so you had better wait
I will wait then only as Ive had no dinner Ill go out and get a mouthful to eat
I can promise you that M Fortunat will send you back your note cancelled
Chupin was really very hungry and so he rushed off to a little eatinghouse which he had remarked on his way to the office
There for eighteen sous he dined or rather supped like a prince and as he subsequently treated himself to a cup of coffee and a glass of brandy as a reward for his toil some little time had elapsed when he returned to the office
However No
2140 had not returned in his absence so he stationed himself at the door to wait for it
His patience was severely tried for it was past midnight when Chupin saw the longlookedfor vehicle enter the courtyard
The driver slowly descended from his box and then went into the cashiers office to pay over his days earnings and hand in his report
Then he came out again evidently bound for home
As the servantwoman had said he was a stout jovialfaced man and he did not hesitate to accept a glass of no matter what in a wine shop that was still open
Whether he believed the story that Chupin told to excuse his questions or not at all events he answered them very readily
He perfectly remembered having been sent to the Rue dUlm and spoke of his fare as a respectable looking old lady enumerated the number of her trunks boxes and packages and even described their form
He had taken her to the railway station stopping at the entrance in the Rue dAmsterdam and when the porters inquired as usual Where is this baggage to go
the old lady had answered To London
Chupin felt decidedly crestfallen on hearing this
He had fancied that Madame Ferailleur had merely announced her intention of driving to the Havre railway station so as to set possible spies on the wrong track and he would have willingly wagered anything that after going a short distance she had given the cabman different instructions
Not so however he had taken her straight to the station
Was Mademoiselle Marguerite deceived then
Had Pascal really fled from his enemies without an attempt at resistance
Such a course seemed impossible on his part
Thinking over all this Chupin slept but little that night and the next morning before five oclock he was wandering about the Rue dAmsterdam peering into the wineshops in search of some railway porter
It did not take him long to find one and having done so he made him the best of friends in less than no time
Although this porter knew nothing about the matter himself he took Chupin to a comrade who remembered handling the baggage of an old lady bound for London on the evening of the sixteenth
However this baggage was not put into the train after all the old lady had left it in the cloakroom and the next day a fat woman of unprepossessing appearance had called for the things and had taken them away after paying the charges for storage
This circumstance had been impressed on the porters mind by the fact that the woman had not given him a farthing gratuity although he had been much more obliging than the regulations required
However when she went off she remarked in a honeyed voice but with an exceedingly impudent air Ill repay you for your kindness my lad
I keep a wineshop on the Route dAsnieres and if you ever happen to pass that way with one of your comrades come in and Ill reward you with a famous drink
What had exasperated the porter almost beyond endurance was the certainty he felt that she was mocking him
For she didnt give me her name or address the old witch
he growled
She had better look out if I ever get hold of her again
But Chupin had already gone off unmoved by his informants grievances
Now that he had discovered the stratagem which Madame Ferailleur had employed to elude her pursuers his conjectures were changed into certainties
This information proved that Pascal WAS concealed somewhere in Paris but where
If he could only find out this woman who had called for the trunks it would lead to the discovery of Madame Ferailleur and her son hut how was he to ascertain the womans whereabouts
She had said that she kept a wineshop on the Route dAsnieres
Was this true
Was it not more likely that this vague direction was only a fresh precaution
This much was certain Chupin who knew every wineshop on the Route dAsnieres did not remember any such powerful matron as the porter had described
He had not forgotten Madame Vantrasson
But to imagine any bond of interest between Pascal and such a woman as she was seemed absurd in the extreme
However as he found himself in such a plight and could not afford to let any chance escape he repaired merely for forms sake to the Vantrasson establishment
It had not changed in the least since the evening he visited it in company with M Fortunatbut seen in the full light of day it appeared even more dingy and dilapidated
Madame Vantrasson was not in her accustomed place behind the counter between her black cather latest idoland the bottles from which she prepared her ratafia now her supreme consolation here below
There was no one in the shop but the landlord
Seated at a table with a lighted candle near him he was engaged in an occupation which would have set Chupins mind working if he had noticed it
Vantrasson had taken some wax from a sealed bottle and after melting it at the flame of the candle he let it drop slowly on to the table
He then pressed a sou upon it and when the wax had become sufficiently cool and stiff he removed it from the table without destroying the impression by means of a thin bladed knife similar to those which glaziers use
However Chupin did not remark this singular employment
He was engaged in mentally ejaculating Good
the old woman isnt here
And as his plan of campaign was already prepared he entered without further hesitation
As Vantrasson heard the door turn upon its hinges he rose so awkwardly or rather so skilfully as to let all his implements wax knife and impressions fall on the floor behind the counter
What can I do to serve you
he asked in a husky voice
Nothing
I wished to speak with your wife
She has gone out
She works for a family in the morning
This was a gleam of light
Chupin had not thought of the only hypothesis that could explain what seemed inexplicable to him
However he knew how to conceal his satisfaction and so with an air of disappointment he remarked Thats too bad
I shall be obliged to call again
So you have a secret to tell my wife
Not at all
Wont I do as well then
Ill tell you how it is
Im employed in the baggage room of the western railway station and I wanted to know if your wife didnt call there a few days ago for some trunks
The landlords features betrayed the vague perturbation of a person who can count the days by his mistakes and it was with evident hesitation that he replied Yes my wife went to the Havre station for some baggage last Sunday
I thought so
Well this is my errand either the clerk forgot to ask her for her receipt or else he lost it
He cant find it anywhere
I came to ask your wife if she hadnt kept it
When she returns please deliver my message and if she has the receipt pray send it to me through the post
The ruse was not particularly clever but it was sufficiently so to deceive Vantrasson
To whom am I to send this receipt
he asked
To me Victor Chupin Faubourg Saint Denis was the reply
Imprudent youth
alas he little suspected what a liberty M Fortunat had taken with his name on the evening he visited the Vantrassons
But on his side the landlord of the Model Lodging House had not forgotten the name mentioned by the agent
He turned pale with anger on beholding his supposed creditor and quickly slipping between the visitor and the door he said So your name is Victor Chupin
Yes certainly
And you are in the employment of the Railway Company
As I just told you
That doesnt prevent you from acting as a collector does it
Chupin instinctively recoiled convinced that he had betrayed himself by some blunder but unable to discover in what he had erred
I did do something in that line formerly he faltered
Vantrasson doubted no longer
So you confess that you are a vile scoundrel
he exclaimed
You confess that you purchased an old promissory note of mine for fourpence and then sent a man here to seize my goods
Ah
youd like to trample the poor under foot would you
Very well
I have you now and Ill settle your account
Take that
And so saying he dealt his supposed creditor a terrible blow with his clinched fist that sent him reeling to the other end of the shop
Fortunately Chupin was very nimble
He did not lose his footing but sprung over a table and used it as a rampart to shield himself from his dangerous assailant
In the open field he could easily have protected himself but here in this narrow space and hemmed in a corner he felt that despite this barrier he was lost
What a devil of a mess
he thought as with wonderful agility he avoided Vantrassons fist a fist that would have felled an ox
He had an idea of calling for assistance
But would any one hear him
Would any one reply
And if help came would not the police be sure to hear of the broil
And if they did would there not be an investigation which would perhaps disturb Pascals plans
Fearing to injure those whom he wished to serve he resolved to let himself be hacked to pieces rather than allow a cry to escape him but he changed his tactics and instead of attempting to parry the blows as he had done before he now only thought of gaining the door inch by inch
He had almost reached it not without suffering considerable injury when it suddenly opened and a young man clad in black with a smooth shaven face entered the shop and sternly exclaimed Why
whats all this
The sight of the newcomer seemed to stupefy Vantrasson
Ah
it is you Monsieur Maumejan
he faltered with a crestfallen air
Its nothing we were only in fun
M Maumejan seemed perfectly satisfied with this explanation and in the indifferent tone of a man who is delivering a message the meaning of which he scarcely understood he said A person who knows that your wife is in my employ requested me to ask you if you would be ready to attend to that little matter she spoke of
Certainly
I was preparing for it a moment ago
Chupin heard no more
He had hurried out his clothes in disorder and himself not a little hurt but his delight made him lose all thought of his injuries
Thats M Ferailleur he muttered Im sure of it and Im going to prove it
So saying he hid himself in the doorway of a vacant house a few paces distant from the Vantrassons and waited
Then as soon as M Maumejan emerged from the Model Lodging House he followed him
The young man with the clean shaven face walked up the Route dAsnieres turned to the right into the Route de la Revolte and at last paused before a house of humble aspect
At that moment Chupin darted toward him and softly called Msieur Ferailleur
The young man turned instinctively
Then seeing his mistake and feeling that he had betrayed himself he sprang upon Chupin and caught him by the wrists Scoundrel
who are you
he exclaimed
Who has hired you to follow me
What do you want of me
Not so fast msieur
Dont be so rough
You hurt me
Im sent by Mademoiselle Marguerite
XVIII
O God
send Pascal to my aid prayed Mademoiselle Marguerite as she left M Fortunats house
Now she understood the intrigue she had been the victim of but instead of reassuring her the agent had frightened her by revealing the Marquis de Valorsays desperate plight
She realized what frenzied rage must fill this mans heart as he felt himself gradually slipping from the heights of opulence down into the depths of poverty and crime
What might he not dare in order to preserve even the semblance of grandeur for a year or a month or a day longer
Had they measured the extent of his villainy
Would he even hesitate at murder
And the poor girl asked herself with a shudder if Pascal were still living and a vision of his bleeding corpse lying lifeless in some deserted street rose before her
And who could tell what dangers threatened her personally
For though she knew the past she could not read the future
What did M de Valorsays letter mean
and what was the fate that he held in reserve for her and that made him so sanguine of success
The impression produced upon her mind was so terrible that for a moment she thought of hastening to the old justice of the peace to ask for his protection and a refuge
But this weakness did not last long
Should she lose her energy
Should her will fail her at the decisive moment
No a thousand times no
she said to herself again and again
I will die if needs be but I will die fighting
And the nearer she approached the Rue Pigalle the more energetically she drove away her apprehension and sought for an excuse calculated to satisfy any one who might have noticed her long absence
An unnecessary precaution
She found the house as when she left it abandoned to the mercy of the servantsthe strangers sent the evening before from the employment office
Important matters still kept the General and his wife from home
The husband had to show his horses and the wife was intent upon shopping
As for Madame Leon most of her time seemed to be taken up by the family of relatives she had so suddenly discovered
Alone free from all espionage and wishing to ward off despondency by occupation Mademoiselle Marguerite was just beginning a letter to her friend the old magistrate when a servant entered and announced that her dressmaker was there and wished to speak with her
Let her come in replied Marguerite with unusual vivacity
Let her come in at once
A lady who looked some forty years of age plainly dressed but of distinguished appearance was thereupon ushered into the room
Like any wellbred modiste she bowed respectfully while the servant was present but as soon as he had left the room she approached Mademoiselle Marguerite and took hold of her hands My dear young lady said she I am the sisterinlaw of your old friend the magistrate
Having an important message to send to you he was trying to find a person whom he could trust to play the part of a dressmaker as had been agreed upon between you when I offered my services thinking he could find no one more trusty than myself
Tears glittered in Mademoiselle Marguerites eyes
The slightest token of sympathy is so sweet to the heart of the lonely and unfortunate
How can I ever thank you madame
she faltered
By not attempting to thank me at all and by reading this letter as soon as possible
 The note she now produced ran as follows MY DEAR CHILDAt last I am on the track of the thieves
By conferring with the people from whom M de Chalusse received the money a couple of days before his death I have been fortunate enough to obtain from them some minute details respecting the missing bonds as well as the numbers of the banknotes which were deposited in the escritoire
With this information we cannot fail to prove the guilt of the culprits sooner or later
You write me word that the Fondeges are spending money lavishly try and find out the names of the people they deal with and communicate them to me
Once more I tell you that I am sure of success
Courage
Well
said the spurious dressmaker when she saw that Marguerite had finished reading the letter
What answer shall I take my brotherinlaw
Tell him that he shall certainly have the information he requires tomorrow
Today I can only give him the name of the carriage builder from whom M de Fondege has purchased his new carriages
Give it to me in writing it is much the safest way
Mademoiselle Marguerite did so and her visitor who as a woman was delighted to find herself mixed up in an intrigue then went off repeating the old magistrates advice Courage
But it was no longer necessary to encourage Mademoiselle Marguerite
The assurance of being so effectually helped had already increased her courage an hundredfold
The future that had seemed so gloomy only a moment before had now suddenly brightened
By means of the negative in the keeping of the photographer Carjat she had the Marquis de Valorsay in her power and the magistrate thanks to the numbers of the bank notes could soon prove the guilt of the Fondeges
The protection of Providence was made evident in an unmistakable manner
Thus it was with a placid and almost smiling face that she successively greeted Madame Leon who returned home quite played out then Madame de Fondege who made her appearance attended by two shop boys overladen with packages and finally the General who brought his son Lieutenant Gustave with him to dinner
The lieutenant was a goodlooking fellow of twentyseven or thereabouts with laughing eyes and a heavy mustache
He made a great clanking with his spurs and wore the somewhat theatrical uniform of the 13th Hussars rather ostentatiously
He bowed to Mademoiselle Marguerite with a smile that was too becoming to be displeasing and he offered her his arm with an air of triumph to lead her to the diningroom as soon as the servant came to announce that Madame la Comtesse was served
Seated opposite to him at table the young girl could not refrain from furtively watching the man whom they wished to compel her to marry
Never had she seen such intense selfcomplacency coupled with such utter mediocrity
It was evident that he was doing his best to produce a favorable impression but as the dinner progressed his conversation became rather venturesome
He gradually grew extremely animated and three or four adventures of garrison life which he persisted in relating despite his mothers frowns were calculated to convince his hearers that he was a great favorite with the fair sex
It was the good cheer that loosened his tongue
There could be no possible doubt on that score and indeed while drinking a glass of the Chateau Laroze to which Madame Leon had taken such a liking he was indiscreet enough to declare that if his mother had always kept house in this fashion he should have been inclined to ask for more frequent leaves of absence
However strange to say after the coffee was served the conversation languished till at last it died out almost entirely
Madame de Fondege was the first to disappear on the pretext that some domestic affairs required her attention
The General was the next to rise and go out in order to smoke a cigar and finally Madame Leon made her escape without saying a word
So Mademoiselle Marguerite was left quite alone with Lieutenant Gustave
It was evident enough to the young girl that this had been preconcerted and she asked herself what kind of an opinion M and Madame de Fondege could have of her delicacy
The proceeding made her so indignant that she was on the point of rising from the table and of retiring like the others when reason restrained her
She said to herself that perhaps she might gain some useful information from this young man and so she remained
His face was crimson and he seemed by far the more embarrassed of the two
He sat with one elbow resting on the table and with his gaze persistently fixed upon a tiny glass half full of brandy which he held in his hand as if he hoped to gain some sublime inspiration from it
At last after an interval of irksome silence he ventured to exclaim Mademoiselle should you like to be an officers wife
I dont know answered Marguerite
Really
But at least you understand my motive in asking this question
No
Any one but the complacent lieutenant would have been disconcerted by Mademoiselle Marguerites dry tone but he did not even notice it
The effort that he was making in his intense desire to be eloquent and persuasive absorbed the attention of all his faculties
Then permit me to explain mademoiselle he resumed
We meet this evening for the first time but our acquaintance is not the affair of a day
For I know not how long my father and mother have continually been chanting your praises
Mademoiselle Marguerite does this Mademoiselle Marguerite does that
They never cease talking of you declaring that heart wit talent beauty all womanly charms are united in your person
And they have never wearied of telling me that the man whom you honored with your preference would be the happiest of mortals
However so far I had no desire to marry and I distrusted them
In fact I had conceived a most violent prejudice against you
Yes upon my honor
I felt sure that I should dislike you but I have seen you and all is changed
As soon as my eyes fell upon you I experienced a powerful revulsion of feeling
I was never so smitten in my lifeand I said to myself Lieutenant it is all overyou are caught at last
Pale with anger astonished and humiliated beyond measure the young girl listened with her head lowered vainly trying to find words to express the feelings which disturbed her but M Gustave misunderstanding her silence and congratulating himself upon the effect he had produced grew bolder and with the tenderest and most impassioned inflection he could impart to his voice continued Who could fail to be impressed as I have been
How could one behold without rapturous admiration such beautiful eyes such glorious black hair such smiling lips such a graceful mien such wonderful charms of person and of mind
How would it be possible to listen unmoved to a voice which is clearer and purer than crystal
Ah
my mothers descriptions fell far short of the truth
But how can one describe the perfections of an angel
To any one who has the happiness or the misfortune of knowing you there can only be one woman in the world
He had gradually approached her chair and now extended his hand to take hold of Marguerites and probably raise it to his lips
But she shrank from the contact as from redhot iron and rising hurriedly with her eyes flashing and her voice quivering with indignation Monsieur
she exclaimed Monsieur
He was so surprised that he stood as if petrified with his eyes wide open and his hand still extended
Permit meallow me to explain he stammered
But she declined to listen
Who has told you that you could address such words to me with impunity
she continued
Your parents I suppose I daresay they told you to be bold
And that is why they have left us and why no servant has appeared
Ah
they make me pay dearly for the hospitality they have given me
As she spoke the tears started from her eyes and glistened on her long lashes
Whom did you fancy you were speaking to
she added
Would you have been so audacious if I had a father or a brother to resent your insults
The lieutenant started as if he had been lashed with a whip
Ah
you are severe
he exclaimed
And a happy inspiration entering his mind he continued A man does not insult a woman mademoiselle when while telling her that he loves her and thinks her beautiful he offers her his name and life
Mademoiselle Marguerite shrugged her shoulders ironically and remained for a moment silent
She was very proud and her pride had been cruelly wounded but reason told her that a continuation of this scene would render a prolonged sojourn in the Generals house impossible and where could she go without exciting malevolent remarks
Whom could she ask an asylum of
Still this consideration alone would not have sufficed to silence her
But she remembered that a quarrel and a rupture with the Fondeges would certainly imperil the success of her plans
So I will swallow even this affront she said to herself and then in a tone of melancholy bitterness she remarked aloud A man cannot set a very high value on his name when he offers it to a woman whom he knows absolutely nothing about
Excuse meyou forget that my mother Your mother has only known me for a week
An expression of intense surprise appeared on the lieutenants face
Is it possible
he murmured
Your father has met me five or six times at the table of the Count de Chalusse who was his friendbut what does he know of me
resumed Mademoiselle Marguerite
That I came to the Hotel de Chalusse a year ago and that the count treated me like a daughterthat is all
Who I am where I was reared and how and what my past life has been these are matters that M de Fondege knows nothing whatever about
My parents told me that you were the daughter of the Count de Chalusse mademoiselle
What proof have they of it
They ought to have told you that I was an unfortunate foundling with no other name than that of Marguerite
Oh
They ought to have told you that I am poor very poor and that I should probably have been reduced to the necessity of toiling for my daily bread if it had not been for them
An incredulous smile curved the lieutenants lips
He fancied that Mademoiselle Marguerite only wished to prove his disinterestedness and this thought restored his assurance
Perhaps you are exaggerating a little mademoiselle he replied
I am not exaggeratingI possess but ten thousand francs in the worldI swear it by all that I hold sacred
That would not even be the dowry required of an officers wife by law muttered the lieutenant
Was his incredulity sincere or affected
What had his parents really told him
Had they confided everything to him and was he their accomplice
or had they told him nothing
All these questions flashed rapidly through Marguerites mind
You suppose that I am rich monsieur she resumed at last
I understand that only too well
If I was you ought to shun me as you would shun a criminal for I could only be wealthy through a crime
Mademoiselle Yes through a crime
After M de Chalusses death two million francs that had been placed in his escritoire for safe keeping could not be found
Who stole the money
I myself have been accused of the theft
Your father must have told you of this as well as of the cloud of suspicion that is still hanging over me
She paused for the lieutenant had become whiter than his shirt
Good God
he exclaimed in a tone of horror as if a terrible light had suddenly broken upon his mind
He made a movement as if to leave the room but suddenly changing his mind he bowed low before Mademoiselle Marguerite and said in a husky voice Forgive me mademoiselle I did not know what I was doing
I have been misinformed
I have been beguiled by false hopes
I entreat you to say that you forgive me
I forgive you monsieur
But still he lingered
I am only a poor devil of a lieutenant he resumed with no other fortune than my epaulettes no other prospects than an uncertain advancement
I have been foolish and thoughtless
I have committed many acts of folly but there is nothing in my past life for which I have cause to blush
He looked fixedly at Mademoiselle Marguerite as if he were striving to read her inmost soul and in a solemn tone that contrasted strangely with his usual levity of manner he added If the name I bear should ever be compromised my prospects would be blighted forever
The only course left for me would be to tender my resignation
I will leave nothing undone to preserve my honor in the eyes of the world and to right those who have been wronged
Promise me not to interfere with my plans
Mademoiselle Marguerite trembled like a leaf
She now realized her terrible imprudence
He had divined everything
As she remained silent he continued wildly I entreat you
Do you wish me to beg you at your feet
Ah
it was a terrible sacrifice that he demanded of her
But how could she remain obdurate in the presence of such intense anguish
I will remain neutral she replied that is all I can promise
Providence shall decide
Thank you he said sadly suspecting that perhaps it was already too latethank you
Then he turned to go and in fact he had already opened the door when a forlorn hope brought him back to Mademoiselle Marguerite whose hand he took timidly faltering We are friends are we not
She did not withdraw her icy hand and in a scarcely audible voice she repeated We are friends
Convinced that he could obtain nothing more from her than her promised neutrality the lieutenant thereupon hastily left the room and she sank back in her chair more dead than alive
Great God
what is coming now
she murmured
She thought she could understand the unfortunate young mans intentions and she listened with a throbbing heart expecting to hear a stormy explanation between his parents and himself
In point of fact she almost immediately afterward heard the lieutenant inquire in a stern imperious voice Where is my father
The General has just gone to his club
And my mother
A friend of hers called a few moments ago to take her to the opera
What madness
That was all
The outer door opened and closed again with extreme violence and then Marguerite heard nothing save the sneering remarks of the servants
It was indeed madness on the part of M and Madame de Fondege not to have waited to learn the result of this interview planned by themselves and upon which their very lives depended
But delirium seemed to have seized them since thanks to a still inexplicable crime they had suddenly found themselves in possession of an immense fortune
Perhaps in this wild pursuit of pleasure in the haste they displayed to satisfy their covetous longings they hoped to forget or silence the threatening voice of conscience
Such was Mademoiselle Marguerites conclusion but she was not long left to undisturbed meditation
By the lieutenants departure the restrictions which had been placed upon the servants movements had evidently been removed for they came in to clear the table
Having with some little difficulty obtained a candle from one of these model servants Mademoiselle Marguerite now retired to her own room
In her anxiety she forgot Madame Leon but the latter had not forgotten her she was even now listening at the drawing room door inconsolable to think that she had not succeeded in hearing at least part of the conversation between the lieutenant and her dear young lady
Marguerite had no wish to reflect over what had occurred
As she was determined to keep the promise which Lieutenant Gustave had wrung from her it mattered little whether she had committed a great mistake in allowing him to discover her knowledge of his parents guilt and in listening to his entreaties
A secret presentiment warned her that the punishment which would overtake the General and his wife would be none the less terrible despite her own forbearance and that they would find their son more inexorable than the severest judge
The essential thing was to warn the old magistrate and so in a couple of pages she summarized the scene of the evening feeling sure that she would find an opportunity to post her letter on the following day
This duty accomplished she took a book and went to bed hoping to drive away her gloomy thoughts by reading
But the hope was vain
Her eyes read the words followed the lines and crossed the pages but her mind utterly refused to obey her will and in spite of all her efforts persisted in turning to the shrewd youth who had solemnly sworn to find Pascal for her
A little after midnight Madame de Fondege returned from the opera and at once proceeded to reprimand her maid for not having lighted a fire
The General returned some time afterward and he was evidently in the best of spirits
They have not seen their son said Mademoiselle Marguerite to herself and this anxiety combined with many others tortured her so cruelly that she did not fall asleep until near daybreak
Even then she did not slumber long
It was scarcely halfpast seven when she was aroused by a strange commotion and a loud sound of hammering
She was trying to imagine the cause of all this uproar when Madame de Fondege already arrayed in a marvellous robe composed of three skirts and an enormous puff entered the room
I have come to take you away my dear child she exclaimed
The owner of the house has decided to make some repairs and the workmen have already invaded our apartments
The General has taken flight let us follow his exampleso make yourself beautiful and well go at once
Without a word the young girl hastened to obey while Madame de Fondege expiated on the delightful drive they would take together in the wonderful brougham which the General had purchased a couple of days before
As for Lieutenant Gustave she did not even mention his name
Accustomed to the superb equipages of the Chalusse establishment Mademoiselle Marguerite did not consider the muchlauded brougham at all remarkable
At the most it was very showy having apparently been selected with a view to attracting as much attention as possible
Madame de Fondege was not in a mood to consider an objection that morning
She was evidently in a nervous state of mind extremely restless and excited indeed it seemed impossible for her to keep still
In default of something better to do she visited at least a dozen shops asking to see everything finding everything frightful and purchasing without regard to price
It might have been fancied that she wished to buy all Paris
About ten oclock she dragged Marguerite to Van Klopens
Received as a habituee of the establishment thanks to the numerous orders she had given within the past few days she was even allowed to enter the mysterious saloon in which the illustrious ruler of Fashion served such of his clients as had a predilection for absinthe or madeira
On leaving the place and before entering the carriage again Madame de Fondege turned to Marguerite and inquired Where shall we go now
I have given the servants an outing on account of the workmen and we cannot breakfast at home
Why cant we go to a restaurant we two
Many of the most distinguished ladies are in the habit of doing so
You will see how people will look at us
I am sure it will amuse you immensely
Ah
madame you forget that it is not a fortnight since the counts death
Madame de Fondege was about to make an impatient reply but she mastered the impulse and in a tone of hypocritical compassion exclaimed Poor child
poor dear child
thats true
I had forgotten
Well such being the case well go and ask Baroness Trigault to give us our breakfast
You will see a lovely woman
And addressing the coachman she instructed him to drive to the Trigault mansion in the Rue de la Ville lEveque
When Madame de Fondeges brougham drew up before the door the baron was standing in the courtyard with a cigar between his teeth examining a pair of horses which had been sent him on approbation
He did not like his wifes friend and he usually avoided her
But precisely because he was acquainted with the Generals crime and Pascals plans he thought it politic to seem amiable
So on recognizing Madame de Fondege through the carriage window he hastened forward with outstretched hand to assist her in alighting
Did you come to take breakfast with us
he asked
That would be a most delightful The remainder of the sentence died unuttered upon his lips
His face became crimson and the cigar he was holding slipped from his fingers
He had just perceived Mademoiselle Marguerite and his consternation was so apparent that Madame de Fondege could not fail to remark it however she attributed it to the girls remarkable beauty
This is Mademoiselle de Chalusse my dear baron said she the daughter of the noble and esteemed friend whom we so bitterly lament
Ah
it was not necessary to tell the baron who this young girl was he knew it only too well
He was not overcome for long a thought of vengeance speedily flashed through his mind
It seemed to him that Providence itself offered him the means of putting an end to an intolerable situation
Regaining his selfcontrol by a powerful effort he preceded Madame de Fondege through the magnificent apartments of the mansion lightly saying My wife is in her boudoir
She will be delighted to see you
But first of all I have a good secret to confide to you
So let me take this young lady to the baroness and you and I can join them in a moment
Thereupon without waiting for any rejoinder he took Marguerites arm and led her toward the end of the hall
Then opening a door he exclaimed in a mocking voice Madame Trigault allow me to present to you the daughter of the Count de Chalusse
And adding in a whisper This is your mother young girl he pushed the astonished Marguerite into the room closed the door and returned to Madame de Fondege
Paler than her white muslin wrapper the Baroness Trigault sprang from her chair
This was the woman who while her husband was braving death to win fortune for her had been dazzled by the Count de Chalusses wealth and who later in life when she was the richest of the rich had sunk into the very depths of degradationhad stooped indeed to a Coralth
The baroness had once been marvellously beautiful and even now many murmurs of admiration greeted her when she dashed through the Champs Elysees in her magnificent equipage attired in one of those eccentric costumes which she alone dared to wear
She was a type of the wife created by the customs of fashionable society the woman who feels elated when her name appears in the newspapers and in the chronicles of Parisian high life who has no thought of her deserted fireside but is ever tormented by a terrible thirst for bustle and excitement whose head is empty and whose heart is drythe woman who only exists for the world and who is devoured by unappeasable covetousness and who at times envies an actresss liberty and the notoriety of the leaders of the demi monde the woman who is always in quest of fresh excitement and fails to find it the woman who is blase and prematurely old in mind and body and who yet still clings despairingly to her fleeting youth
Inaccessible to any emotion but vanity the baroness had never shed a tear over her husbands sufferings
She was sure of her absolute power over him
What did the rest matter
She even gloried in her knowledge that she could make this manwho loved her in spite of everythingat one moment furious with rage or wild with grief and then an instant afterward plunge him into the rapture of a senseless ecstasy by a word a smile or a caress
For such was her power and she often exercised it mercilessly
Even after the frightful scene that Pascal had witnessed she had made another appeal to the baron and he had been weak enough to give her the thirty thousand francs which M de Coralth needed to purchase his wifes silence
However this time the baroness trembled
Her usual shrewdness had not deserted her and she perfectly understood all that Marguerites presence in that house portended
Since her husband brought this young girlher daughterto her he must know everything and have taken some fatal resolution
Had she indeed exhausted the patience which she had fancied inexhaustible
She was not ignorant of the fact that her husband had disposed of his immense fortune in a way that would enable him to say and prove that he was insolvent whenever occasion required and if he found courage to apply for a legal separation what could she hope to obtain from the courts
A bare living almost nothing
In such a case how could she exist
She would be compelled to spend her last years in the same poverty that had made her youth so wretched
She saw herselfah
what a frightful misfortuneturfed out of her princely home and reduced to furnished apartments rented for five hundred francs a year
Mademoiselle Marguerite was no less startled and horrorstricken than Madame Trigault and she stood rooted to the spot exactly where the baron had left her
Silent and motionless they confronted each other for a moment which seemed a century to both of them
The resemblancewhich had astonished Pascal could not fail to strike them for it was still more noticeable now that they stood face to face
But anything was preferable to this torturing suspense and so summoning all her courage the baroness broke the silence by saying You are the daughter of the Count de Chalusse
I think so but I have no proofs of it
Andyour mother
I dont know her madame and I have no desire to know her
Disconcerted by this brief but implacable reply Madame Trigault hung her head
What could I have to say to my mother
continued Marguerite
That I hate her
My courage would fail me to do so
And yet how can I think without bitterness of the woman who after abandoning me herself endeavored to deprive me of my fathers love and protection
I could have forgiven anything but that
Ah
I have not always been so patient and resigned
The laws of our country do not forbid illigitimate children to search for their parents and more than once I have said to myself that I would discover my mother and have my revenge
But you have no means of discovering her
In this you are greatly mistaken madame
After the Count de Chalusses death a package of letters a glove and some withered flowers were found in one of the drawers of his escritoire
The baroness started back as if a yawning chasm had suddenly opened at her feet
My letters
she exclaimed
Ah
wretched woman that I am he kept them
It is all over
I am lost for of course they have been read
The ribbon securing them together has never been untied
Is that true
Don t deceive me
Where are they thenwhere are they
Under the protection of the seals affixed by the justice of the peace
Madame Trigault tottered as if she were about to fall
Then it is only a reprieve she moaned and I am none the less ruined
Those cursed letters will necessarily be read and all will be discovered
They will see The thought of what they would see endowed her with the energy of despair and clutching hold of Marguerites wrists Listen
said she approaching so near that her hot breath scorched the girls cheeks no one must be allowed to see those lettersit must not be
I will tell you what they contain
I hated my husband I loved the Count de Chalusse madly and he had sworn that he would marry me if ever I became a widow
Do you understand now
The name of the poison I obtainedhow I proposed to administer it and what its effects would beall this is plainly written in my own handwriting and signedyes signed with my own name
The plot failed but it was none the less real positive palpableand those letters are a proof of it
But they shall never be readnonot if I am obliged to set fire to the Hotel de Chalusse with my own hand
Now the counts constant terror the fear with which this woman had inspired him were explained
He was an accomplicehe also had written no doubt and she had preserved his letters as he had preserved hers
Crime had bound them indissolubly together
Horrified beyond expression Marguerite freed herself from Madame Trigaults grasp
I swear to you madame that everything any human being can do to save your letters shall be done by me she exclaimed
And have you any hope of success
Yes replied the girl remembering her friend the magistrate
Moved by a far more powerful emotion than any she had ever known before the baroness uttered an exclamation of joy
Ah
how good you are
she exclaimedhow generous
how noble
You take your revenge in giving me back life honor everythingfor you are my daughter do you not know it
Did they not tell you before bringing you here that I was the hated and unnatural mother who abandoned you
She advanced with tearful eyes and outstretched arms but Marguerite sternly waved her back
Spare yourself madame and spare me the humiliation of an unnecessary explanation
Marguerite
Good God
you repulse me
After all you have promised to do for me will you not forgive me
I will try to forget madame replied the girl and she was already stepping toward the door when the baroness threw herself at her feet crying in a heartrending tone Have pity Marguerite I am your mother
One has no right to deny ones own mother
But the young girl passed on
My mother is dead madame I do not know you
And she left the room without even turning her head without even glancing at the baroness who had fallen upon the floor in a deep swoon
XIX Baron Trigault still held Madame de Fondege a prisoner in the hall
What did he say to her in justification of the expedient he had improvised
His own agitation was so great that he scarcely knew and it mattered but little after all for the good lady did not even pretend to listen to his apologies
Although by no means overshrewd she suspected some great mystery some bit of scandal perhaps and her eyes never once wandered from the door leading to the boudoir
At last this door opened and Mademoiselle Marguerite reappeared
Great heavens
exclaimed Madame de Fondege what has happened to my poor child
For the unfortunate girl advanced with an automatic tread her eyes fixed on vacancy and her hands outstretched as if feeling her way
It indeed seemed to her as if the floor swayed to and fro under her feet as if the walls tottered as if the ceiling were about to fall and crush her
Madame de Fondege sprang forward
What is the matter my dearest
Alas
the poor girl was utterly overcome
It is but a trifle she faltered
But her eyes closed her hands clutched wildly for some support and she would have fallen to the ground if the baron had not caught her in his arms and carried her to a sofa
Help
cried Madame de Fondege help she is dyinga physician
But there was no need of a physician
One of the maids came with some fresh water and a bottle of smelling salts and Marguerite soon recovered sufficiently to sit up and cast a frightened glance around her while she mechanically passed her hand again and again over her cold forehead
Do you feel better my darling
inquired Madame de Fondege at last
Yes
Ah
you gave me a terrible fright see how I tremble
But the worthy ladys fright was as nothing in comparison with the curiosity that tortured her
It was so powerful indeed that she could not control it
What has happened
she asked
Nothing madame nothing
But I am subject to such attacks
I was very cold and the heat of the room made me feel faint
Although she could only speak with the greatest difficulty the baron realized by her tone that she would never reveal what had taken place and his attitude and relief knew no bounds
Dont tire the poor child he said to Madame de Fondege
The best thing you can do would be to take her home and put her to bed
I agree with you but unfortunately I have sent away my brougham with orders not to return for me until one oclock
Is that the only difficulty
If so you shall have a carriage at once my dear madame
So saying the baron made a sign to one of the servants and the man started on his mission at once
Madame de Fondege was silent but furious
He is actually putting me out of doors she thought
This is a little too much
And why doesnt the baroness make her appearanceshe must certainly have heard my voice
What does it all mean
However Im sure Marguerite will tell me when we are alone
But Madame de Fondege was wrong for she vainly plied the girl with questions all the way from the Rue de la Ville lEveque to the Rue Pigalle
She could only obtain this unvarying and obstinate reply Nothing has happened
What do you suppose could have happened
Never in her whole life had Madame de Fondege been so incensed
The blockhead
she mentally exclaimed
Who ever saw such obstinacy
Hateful creatureI could beat her
She did not beat her but on reaching the house she eagerly asked Do you feel strong enough to go up stairs alone
Yes madame
Then I will leave you
You know Van Klopen expects me again at one oclock precisely and I have not breakfasted yet
Remember that my servants are at your disposal and dont hesitate to call them
You are at home recollect
It was not without considerable difficultynot without being compelled to stop and rest several times on her way up stairs that Mademoiselle Marguerite succeeded in reaching the apartments of the Fondege family
Where is madame
inquired the servant who opened the door
She is still out
Will she return to dinner
I dont know
M Gustave has been here three times already he was very angry when he found that there was no one at homehe went on terribly
Besides the workmen have turned everything topsyturvy
However Marguerite had already reached her own room and thrown herself on the bed
She was suffering terribly
Her brave spirit still retained its energy but the flesh had succumbed
Every vein and artery throbbed with violence and while a chill seemed to come to her heart her head burned as if it had been on fire
My Lord she thought am I going to fall ill at the last moment just when I have most need of all my strength
She tried to sleep but was unable to do so
How could she free herself from the thought that haunted her
Her mother
To think that such a woman was her mother
Was it not enough to make her die of sorrow and shame
And yet this woman must be savedthe proofs of her crime must be annihilated with her letters
Marguerite asked herself whether the old magistrate would have it in his power to help her in this respect
Perhaps not and then what could she do
She asked herself if she had not been too cruel too severe
Guilty or not the baroness was still her mother
Had she the right to be pitiless when by stretching out her hand she might perhaps have rescued the wretched woman from her terrible life
Thus thinking the young girl sat alone and forgotten in her little room
The hours went by and daylight had begun to wane when suddenly a shrill whistle resounded in the street under her windows
Piouit
It came upon her like an electric shock and with a bound she sprang to her feet
For this cry was the signal that had been agreed upon between herself and the young man who had so abruptly offered to help her on the occasion of her visit to M Fortunats office
Was she mistaken
Nofor on listening she heard the cry resound a second time even more shrill and prolonged than before
This was no time for hesitation and so she went downstairs at once
Hope sent new blood coursing through her veins and endowed her with invincible energy
On reaching the streetdoor she paused and looked around her
At a short distance off she perceived a young fellow clad in a blouse who was apparently engaged in examining the goods displayed in a shop window
Despite his position he hurriedly exclaimed Follow me at a little distance in the rear until I stop
Marguerite obeyed him in breathless suspense
The young fellow was our friend Victor Chupin now somewhat the worse for his encounter with Vantrasson that same morning
His face was considerably disfigured and one of his eyes was black and swollen nevertheless he was in a state of ecstatic happiness
Happy and yet anxious for as he preceded Mademoiselle Marguerite he said to himself How shall I tell her that I have succeeded
There must be no folly
If I tell her the news suddenly she will most likely faint so I must break the news gently
On reaching the Rue Boursault he turned the corner and paused waiting for Mademoiselle Marguerite to join him
What is the news
she anxiously asked
Everything is progressing finelyslowly but finely
You know something monsieur
Speak
Dont you see how anxious I am
He did see it only too well and his embarrassment increased to such a pitch that he began to scratch his head furiously
At last he decided on a plan
First of all mademoiselle brace yourself against the wall and now stand firm
Yes like that
Now are you all right
Well I have found M
Ferailleur
Chupins precaution was a wise one for Marguerite tottered
Such a success so quickly gained was indeed astounding
Is it possible
she murmured
So possible that I have a letter for you from M Ferailleur in my pocket mademoiselle
Here it isI am to wait for an answer
She took the note he handed her broke the seal with trembling hand and read as follows We are approaching the end my dearest
One step more and we shall triumph
But I must see you today at any risk
Leave the house this evening at eight oclock
My mother will be waiting for you in a cab at the corner of the Rue Pigalle and the Rue Boursault
Come and let no fear of arousing suspicions of the Fondeges deter you
They are henceforth powerless to injure you
PASCAL I will go
replied Marguerite at once careless of the obstacles that might impede the fulfilment of her promise
For it was quite possible that serious difficulties might arise
Madame Leon who had been invisible since the morning might suddenly reappear or the General and his wife might return to dinner
And what could Marguerite answer if they asked her where she wanted to go alone and at such an hour of the evening
And if they attempted to prevent her from keeping her appointment how could she resist
All these were weighty questions and yet she did not hesitate
Pascal had spoken that sufficed and she was determined to obey him implicitly cost what it might
If he advised such a step it was because he deemed it best and necessary and she willingly submitted to the instructions of the man in whom she felt such unbounded confidence
Having told Chupin that she might be relied upon for the evening she was retracing her way home when suddenly the thought occurred to her that she ought not to neglect this opportunity to place a decisive weapon in Pascals hands
She was close to the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette and so without more ado she hurried to the establishment of Carjat the photographer
He was fortunately disengaged and she at once obtained from him a proof of the compromising letter written by the Marquis de Valorsay to Madame Leon
She placed it carefully in her pocket thanked the photographer and then hurried back to the Rue Pigalle to wait for the hour appointed in Pascals letter
Fortunately none of her unpleasant apprehensions were realized
The dinnerhour came and passed and still the house remained deserted
The workmen had gone off and the laughter and chatter of the servants in the kitchen were the only sounds that broke the stillness
Faint for want of foodfor she had taken no nourishment during the day Marguerite had considerable difficulty in obtaining something to eat from the servants
At last however they gave her some soup and cold meat served on a corner of the bare table in the dining room
It was halfpast seven when she finished this frugal meal
She waited a moment and then fearing she might keep Madame Ferailleur waiting she went down into the street
A cab was waiting at the corner of the Rue Boursault as indicated
Its windows were lowered and in the shade one could discern the face and white hair of an elderly lady
Glancing behind her to assure herself that she had not been followed Marguerite eagerly approached the vehicle whereupon a kindly voice exclaimed Jump in quickly mademoiselle  Marguerite obeyed and the door was scarcely closed behind her before the driver had urged his horse into a gallop
He had evidently received his instructions in advance as well as the promise of a magnificent gratuity
Sitting side by side on the back seat the old lady and the young girl remained silent but this did not prevent them from casting stealthy glances at each other and striving to distinguish one anothers features whenever the vehicle passed in front of some brilliantly lighted shop
They had never met before and their anxiety to become acquainted was intense for they each felt that the other would exert a decisive influence upon her life
All of Madame Ferailleurs friends would undoubtedly have been surprised at the step she had taken and yet it was quite in accordance with her character
As long as she had entertained any hope of preventing this marriage she had not hesitated to express and even exaggerate her objections and repugnance
But her point of view was entirely changed when conquered by the strength of her sons passion she at last yielded a reluctant consent
The young girl who was destined to be her daughterinlaw at once became sacred in her eyes and it seemed to her an act of duty to watch over Marguerite and shield her reputation
Having considered the subject she had decided that it was not proper for her sons betrothed to run about the streets alone in the evening
Might it not compromise her honor
and later on might it not furnish venomous Madame de Fondege with an opportunity to exercise her slanderous tongue
Thus the puritanical old lady had come to fetch Marguerite so that whenever occasion required she might be able to say I was there
As for Marguerite after the trials of the day she yielded without reserve to the feeling of rest and happiness that now filled her heart
Again and again had Pascal spoken of his mothers prejudices and the inflexibility of her principles
But he had also spoken of her dauntless energy the nobility of her nature and of her love and devotion to him
With Marguerite moreover one considerationone which she would scarcely have admitted perhapsoutweighed all others Madame Ferailleur was Pascals mother
For that reason alone if for no other she was prepared to worship her
How fervently she blessed this noble woman who a widow
and ruined in fortune by an unprincipled scoundrel had bravely toiled to educate her son making him the man whom Marguerite had freely chosen from among all others
She would have knelt before this grand but simplehearted mother had she dared she would have kissed her hands
And a poignant regret came to her heart when she remembered her own mother Baroness Trigault and compared her with this matchless woman
Meanwhile the cab had passed the outer boulevards and was now whirling along the Route dAsnieres as fast as the horse could drag it
We are almost there remarked Madame Ferailleur speaking for the first time
Marguerites response was inaudible she was so overcome with emotion
The driver had just turned the corner of the Route de la Revolte and it was not long before he checked his panting horse
Look mademoiselle said Madame Ferailleur again this is our home
Upon the threshold bareheaded and breathless with impatience and hope stood a man who was counting the seconds with the violent throbbings of his heart
He did not wait for the cab to stop but springing to the door he opened it and then catching Marguerite in his arms he carried her into the house with a cry of joy
She had not even time to look around her ere he had placed her in an armchair and fallen on his knees before her
At last I see you again my beloved Marguerite he exclaimed
You are mine nothing shall part us again
They sobbed in each others arms
They could bear adversity unmoved but their composure deserted them in this excess of happiness and standing in the doorway Madame Ferailleur felt the tears come to her eyes as she stood watching them
How can I tell you all that I have suffered
said Pascal whose voice was hoarse with feeling
The papers have told you all the details I suppose
How I was accused of cheating at cards how the vile epithet thief was cast in my face how they tried to search me how my most intimate friends deserted me how I was virtually expelled from the Palais de Justice
All this is terrible is it not
Ah well
it is nothing in comparison with the intense unendurable anguish I experienced in thinking that you believed the infamous calumny which disgraced me
Marguerite rose to her feet
You thought that
she exclaimed
You believed that I doubted you
I
Like you I have been accused of robbery myself
Do you believe me guilty
Good God
I suspect you
Then why I was mad Marguerite my only love I was mad
But who would not have lost his senses under such circumstances
It was the very day after this atrocious conspiracy
I had seen Madame Leon and had trusted her with a letter for you in which I entreated you to grant me five minutes Conversation
Alas
I never received it
I know that now but then I was deceived
I went to the little garden gate to await your coming but it was Madame Leon who appeared
She brought me a note written in pencil and signed with your name bidding me an eternal farewell
And fool that I was I did not see that the note was a forgery
Mademoiselle Marguerite was amazed
The veil was now torn aside and the truth revealed to her
Now she remembered Madame Leons embarrassment when she met her returning from the garden on the night following the counts death
Ah well
Pascal she said do you know what I was doing at almost the same moment
Alarmed at having received no news from you I hastened to the Rue dUlm where I learned that you had sold your furniture and started for America
Any other woman might have believed herself deserted under such circumstances but not I I felt sure that you had not fled in ignominious fashion
I was convinced that you had only concealed yourself for a time in order to strike your enemies more surely
Do not shame me Marguerite
It is true that of us two I showed myself the weaker
Lost in the rapture of the present moment they had forgotten the past and the future the agony they had endured the dangers that still threatened them and even the existence of their enemies
But Madame Ferailleur was watching
She pointed to the clock and earnestly exclaimed Time is passing my son
Each moment that is wasted endangers our success
Should any suspicion bring Madame Vantrasson here all would be lost
She cannot come upon us unawares my dear mother
Chupin has promised not to lose sight of her
If she stirs from her shop he will hasten here and throw a stone against the shutters to warn us
But even this did not satisfy Madame Ferailleur
You forget Pascal
she insisted that Mademoiselle Marguerite must be at home again by ten oclock if she consents to the ordeal you feel obliged to impose upon her
This was the voice of duty recalling Pascal to the stern realities of life
He slowly rose conquered his emotion and after reflecting for a moment said First of all Marguerite I owe you the truth and an exact statement of our situation
Circumstances have compelled me to act without consulting you
Have I done right or wrong
You shall judge
And without stopping to listen to the girls protestations he rapidly explained how he had managed to win M de Valorsays confidence discover his plans and become his trusted accomplice
This scoundrels plan is very simple he continued
He is determined to marry you
Why
Because though you are not aware of it you are rich and the sole heiress to the fortune of the Count de Chalusse your father
This surprises you does it not
Very well
listen to me
Deceived by the Marquis de Valorsay the Count de Chalusse had promised him your hand
These arrangements were nearly completed though you had not been informed of them
In fact everything had been decided
At the outset however a grave difficulty had presented itself
The marquis wished your father to acknowledge you before your marriage but this he refused to do
It would expose me to the most frightful dangers he declared
However I will recognize Marguerite as my daughter in my will and at the same time leave all my property to her
But the marquis would not listen to this proposal
I dont doubt your good intentions my dear count said he but suppose this will should be contested your property might pass into other hands
This difficulty put a stop to the proceedings for some time
The marquis asked for guarantees the other refused to give them until at last M de Chalusse discovered an expedient which would satisfy both parties
He confided to M de Valorsays keeping a will in which he recognized you as his daughter and bequeathed you his entire fortune
This document the validity of which is unquestionable has been carefully preserved by the marquis
He has not spoken of its existence and he would destroy it rather than restore it to you at present
But as soon as you became his wife he intended to produce it and thus obtain possession of the counts millions
Ah
the old justice of the peace was not mistaken murmured Mademoiselle Marguerite
Pascal did not hear her
All his faculties were absorbed in the attempt he was making to give a clear and concise explanation for he had much to say and it was growing late
As for the enormous sum you have been accused of taking he continued I know what has become of it it is in the hands of M de Fondege
I know that PascalIm sure of it but the proof the proof
The proof exists and like the will it is in the hands of the Marquis de Valorsay
Is it possible
Great Heavens
You are sure you are not deceived
I have seen the proof and it is overpowering irrefutable
I have touched itI have held it in my hands
And it explains everything which may have seemed strange and incomprehensible to you
The letter which M de Chalusse received on the day of his death was written by his sister
She asked in it for her share of the family estate threatening him with a terrible scandal if he refused to comply with her request
Had the count decided to brave this scandal rather than yield
We have good reason to suppose so
However this much is certain he had a terrible hatred not so much for his sister perhaps as for the man who had seduced her and afterward married her actuated by avaricious motives alone
He had sworn thousands of times that neither husband nor wife should ever have a penny of the large fortune which really belonged to them
Believing that a lawsuit was now inevitable and wishing to conceal his wealth he was greatly embarrassed by the large amount of money he had on hand
What should he do with it
Where could he hide it
He finally decided to intrust it to the keeping of M de Fondege who was known as an eccentric man but whose honesty seemed to be above suspicion
So when he left home on the afternoon of his illness he took the package of banknotes and bonds which you had noticed in the escritoire that morning away with him
We shall never know what passed between your father and the Generalwe can only surmise
But what I do know and what I shall be able to prove is that M de Fondege accepted the trust and that he gave an acknowledgment of it in the form of a letter which read as follows MY DEAR COUNT DE CHALUSSEI hereby acknowledge the receipt on Thursday October 15 186 of the sum of two millions two hundred and fifty thousand francs which I shall deposit in my name at the Bank of France subject to the orders of Mademoiselle Marguerite your daughter on the day she presents this letter
And believe my dear count in the absolute devotion of your old comrade GENERAL DE FONDEGE
Mademoiselle Marguerite was thunderstruck
Who can have furnished you with these particulars
she inquired
The Marquis de Valorsay my dearest and I will explain how he was enabled to do so
M de Fondege wrote the address of his old comrade on this letter which was folded and sealed but not enclosed in an envelope
M de Chalusse proposed to post it himself so that the official stamp might authenticate its date
But on reflection he became uneasy
He felt that this tiny perishable scrap of paper would be the only proof of the deposit which he had confided to M de Fondeges honor
This scrap might be lost burned or stolen
Then what would happen
He had so often seen trustees betray the confidence of which they had seemed worthy
So M de Chalusse racked his brains to discover a means of protection from an improbable but possible misfortune
He found it
Passing a stationers shop he went in purchased one of those letterpresses which merchants use in their correspondence and under pretext of trying it took a copy of M de Fondeges letter
Having done this he placed the copy in an envelope addressed to the Marquis de Valorsay and with his heart relieved of all anxiety posted it at the same time as the original letter
A few moments later he got into the cab in which he was stricken down with apoplexy
Extraordinary as Pascals explanations must have seemed to her Marguerite did not doubt their accuracy in the least
Then it is the copy of this letter which you saw in the possession of the Marquis de Valorsay
Yes
And the original
M de Fondege alone can tell what has become of that
It is evident that he has somehow succeeded in obtaining possession of it
Would he have dared to squander money as he has done if he had not been convinced that there was no proof of his guilt in existence
Perhaps on hearing of the counts sudden death he bribed the concierge at the Hotel de Chalusse to watch for this letter and return it to him
But on this subject I have only conjectures to offer
If they wish you to marry their son it is probably because it seems too hard that you should be left in abject poverty while they are enjoying the fortune they have stolen from you
The vilest scoundrels have their scruples
Besides a marriage with their son would protect them against any possible mischance in the future
He was silent for a moment and then more slowly resumed You see Marguerite we have clear palpable and irrefutable proofs of YOUR innocence but in my efforts to clear my own name of disgrace I have been far less fortunate
I have tried in vain to collect material proofs of the conspiracy against me
It is only by proving the guilt of the Marquis de Valorsay and the Viscount de Coralth that I can establish my innocence and so far I am powerless to do so
Mademoiselle Marguerites face brightened with supreme joy
Then I can serve you in my turn my only love she exclaimed
Ah
blessed be God who inspired me and who thus rewards me for an hour of courage
My poor fathers plan also occurred to me Pascal
Was it not strange
The material proof of your innocence which you have sought for in vain is in my possession written and signed by the Marquis de Valorsay
Like M de Fondege he believes that the letter which proves his guilt is annihilated
He burned it himself and yet it exists
So saying she drew from her bosom one of the copies which she had received from Carjat the photographer and handed it to Pascal adding Look
Pascal eagerly perused the marvellous facsimile of the letter which the marquis had written to Madame Leon
Ah
this is the scoundrels death warrant
he exclaimed exultantly
And approaching Madame Ferailleur who still stood leaning against the door silent and motionless Look mother he repeated look
And he pointed to this paragraph which was so convincing and so explicit that the most exacting jury would have asked for no further evidence
I have formed a plan which will completely efface all remembrance of that cursed P F in case any one could condescend to think of him after the disgrace we fastened upon him the other evening at the house of Madame dA
Nor is this all resumed Mademoiselle Marguerite
There are other letters which will prove that this plot was the marquiss work and which give the name of his accomplice Coralth
And these letters are in the possession of a man of dubious integrity who was once the marquiss ally but who has now become his enemy
He is known as Isidore Fortunat and lives in the Place de la Bourse
Marguerite felt that Madame Ferailleurs keen glance was riveted upon her
She intuitively divined what was passing in the mind of the puritanical old lady and realized that her whole future and the happiness of her entire wedded life depended upon her conduct at that moment
So desirous of making a full confession she hastily exclaimed My conduct may have seemed strange in a young girl Pascal
A timid inexperienced girl who had been carefully kept from all knowledge of life and evil would have been crushed by such a burden of disgrace and could only have wept and prayed
I did weep and pray but I also struggled and fought
In the hour of peril I found myself endowed with some of the courage and energy which distinguished the poor women of the people among whom I formerly earned my bread
The teachings and miseries of the past were not lost to me
And as simply as if she were telling the most natural thing in the world she described the struggle she had undertaken against the world strong in her faith in Pascal and in his love
Ah you are a noble and courageous girl
exclaimed Madame Ferailleur
You are worthy of my son and you will proudly guard our honest name
For some little time already the obstinate old lady had been struggling against the sympathetic emotion that filled her heart and big tears were coursing down her wrinkled cheeks
Unable to restrain herself any longer she now threw both arms around Marguerites neck and drew her toward her in a long embrace murmuring Marguerite my daughter
Ah
how unjust my prejudices were
It might be thought that Pascal was transported with joy on hearing this but no the lines of care on his forehead deepened as he said Happiness is so near
Why must a final test another humiliation separate us from it
But Marguerite now felt strong enough to meet even martyrdom with a smile
Speak Pascal
said she dont you see that it is almost ten oclock
He hesitated there was grief in his eyes and his breath came quick and hard as he resumed For your sake and mine we must conquer at any price
This is the only reason that can justify the horrible expedient I have to suggest
M de Valorsay as you know has boasted of his power to overcome your resistance and he really believes that he possesses this power
Why I have not killed him again and again when he has been at my mercy I can scarcely understand
The only thing that gave me power to restrain myself was my desire for as sure as terrible and as public a revenge as the humiliation he inflicted on me
His plan for your ruin is such as only a scoundrel like himself could conceive
With the assistance of his vile tool Coralth he has formed a league offensive and defensive with the son of the Count de Chalusses sister who is the only acknowledged heir at this momenta young man destitute of heart and intelligence and inordinately vain but neither better nor worse than many others who figure respectably in society
His name is Wilkie Gordon
The marquis has acquired great influence over him and has persuaded him that it is his duty to denounce you to the authorities
He has in short accused you of defrauding the heirs of the Chalusse estate of two millions of francs and also of poisoning the count
The girl shrugged her shoulders disdainfully
As for the robbery we have an answer to that she answered and as regards the poisoningreally the accusation is too absurd
But Pascal still looked gloomy
The matter is more serious than you suppose he replied
They have found a physiciana vile cowardly scoundrelwho for a certain sum has consented to appear in support of the accusation
Dr Jodon I presume
Yes and this is not all
The counts escritoire contains the vial of medicine of which he drank a portion on the day of his death
Well tomorrow night Madame Leon will open the garden gate of the Hotel de Chalusse and admit a rascal who will abstract the vial
Marguerite shuddered
Now she understood the fiendish cunning of the plot
It might ruin me
she murmured
Pascal nodded affirmatively
M de Valorsay wishes you to consider yourself as irretrievably lost and then he intends to offer to save you on condition that you consent to marry him
I should say however that M Wilkie is ignorant of the atrocious projects he is abetting
They are known only to the marquis and M de Coralth and it is I who under the name of Maumejan act as their adviser
It was to me that the marquis sent M Wilkie for assistance in drawing up this accusation
I myself wrote out the denunciation which was as terrible and as formidable as our bitterest enemy could possibly desire combining as it did with perfidious art the reports of the valets and the suspicions of the physician and establishing the connection between the robbery and the murder
It finished by demanding a thorough investigation
And M Wilkie copied and signed this document and carried it to the prosecution office himself
Mademoiselle Marguerite sank halffainting into an armchair
You have done this
she faltered
It was necessary my daughter whispered Madame Ferailleur
Yes it was necessary absolutely necessary repeated Pascal as you will see
Justice which is a human institution and limited in its powers cannot fathom motives read thoughts or interfere with plans however abominable they may be or however near realization
Before it can interfere the law must have material tangible proof convincing to the senses
Until you are arrested the crimes committed by M de Valorsay and those associated with him do not come within the reach of human justice but as soon as you are in prison I can hasten to our friend the justice of the peace and we shall go at once to the investigating magistrate and explain everything
Now when your innocence and the guilt of your accusers have been established what do you fancy the authorities will do
They will wait until your enemies declare themselves in order to capture them all at once and prevent the escape of a single one
Tomorrow night some clever detectives will watch the Hotel de Chalusse and just as Madame Leon and the wretch with her think themselves sure of success they will be caught in the very act and arrested
When they are examined by a magistrate who is conversant with the whole affair can they deny their guilt
No certainly not
Acting upon their confession the authorities will force an entrance into Valorsays house where they will find your fathers will and the receipt given by M de Fondegein a word all the proofs of their guilt
And while this search is going on all your enemies reassured by your arrest will be at a grand soiree given by Baron Trigault
I shall be there as well
Mademoiselle Marguerite had mastered her momentary weakness
She rose to her feet and in a firm voice exclaimed You have acted rightly
Ah
there was no other way
And yet I wished to see you to learn if this course were too repugnant to you
She interrupted him with a gesture
When shall I be arrested
she asked quietly
This evening or tomorrow
was his answer
Very well
I have only one request to make
The Fondeges have a son who has no hand in the affair but who will be more severely punished than his parents if we do not spare them
Could you not I can do nothing Marguerite
I am powerless now
Everything was soon arranged
Marguerite raised her forehead to Pascal for his parting kiss and went away accompanied by Madame Ferailleur who escorted her to the corner of the Rue Boursault
The General and his wife had returned home in advance of Marguerite
She found them sitting in the drawingroom with distorted faces and teeth chattering with fear
With them was a bearded man who as soon as she appeared exclaimed You are Mademoiselle Marguerite are you not
I arrest you in the name of the law
There is my warrant
And without more ado he led her away
XX
Money which nowadays has taken the place of the good fairies of former times had gratified M Wilkies every longing in a single night
Without any period of transition dreamlike as it were he had passed from what he called straitened circumstances to the splendid enjoyment of a princely fortune
Madame dArgeless renunciation had been so correctly drawn up that as soon as he presented his claims and displayed his credentials he was placed in possession of the Chalusse estate
It is true that a few trifling difficulties presented themselves
For instance the old justice of the peace who had affixed the seals refused to remove them from certain articles of furniture especially from the late counts escritoire without an order from the court and several days were needed to obtain this
But what did that matter to M Wilkie
The house with its splendid receptionrooms pictures statuary and gardens was at his disposal and he installed himself therein at once
Twenty horses neighed and stamped in his stables there were at least a dozen carriages in the coachhouse
He devoted his attention exclusively to the horses and vehicles but acting upon the advice of Casimir who had become his valet and oracle he retained all the former servants of the house from Bourigeau the concierge down to the humblest scullery maid
Still he gave them to understand that this was only a temporary arrangement
A man like himself living in this progressive age could scarcely be expected to content himself with what had satisfied the Count de Chalusse
For I have my plans he remarked to Casimir but let Paris wait awhile
He repudiated his former friends
Costard and Serpillon pretended viscounts though they were were quite beneath the notice of a GordonChalusse as M Wilkie styled himself on his visiting cards
However he purchased their share of Pompier de Nanterre feeling convinced that this remarkable steeplechaser had a brilliant future before him
He did not trouble himself to any great extent about his mother
Like every one else he knew that she had disappeared but nothing further
On the other hand the thought of his father the terrible chevalier dindustrie hung over his joy like a pall and each time the great entrance bell announced a visitor he trembled turned pale and muttered Perhaps its he
Tortured by this fear he clung closely to the Marquis de Valorsay as if he felt that this distinguished friend was a powerful support
Besides people of rank and distinction naturally exercised a powerful attraction over him and he fancied he grew several inches taller when in some public place in the street or a restaurant he was able to call out I say Valorsay my good friend or Upon my word
my dear marquis
M de Valorsay received these effusions graciously enough although in point of fact he was terribly bored by the platitudes of his new acquaintance
He intended to send him to Coventry later on but just now M Wilkie was too useful to be ignored
So he had introduced him to his club and was seen with him everywherein the Bois at the restaurants and the theatres
At times some of his friends inquired Who is that queer little fellow
with a touch of irony in their tone but when the marquis carelessly answered A poor devil who has just come into possession of a property worth twenty millions
they became serious and requested the pleasure and honor of an introduction to this fortunate young man
So M de Valorsay had invited GordonChalusse to accompany him to Baron Trigaults approaching fete
It was to be an entertainment for gentlemen only a monster cardparty but every one knew the wealthy baron and no doubt with a view of stimulating curiosity he had declared and the Figaro had repeated that he had a great surprise in store for his guests
Oh
such a surprise
They could have no idea what it was
This fete was to take place on the second day after Mademoiselle Marguerites arrest and on the appointed evening between nine and ten oclock M de Valorsay and his friend Coralth sat together in the formers smokingroom waiting for Wilkie to call for them as had been agreed upon
They were both in the best of spirits
The viscounts apprehensions had been entirely dispelled and the marquis had quite forgotten the twinges of pain in his injured limb
Marguerite will only leave prison to marry me said M de Valorsay triumphantly and he added What a willing tool this Wilkie is
A single word sufficed to make him give all his servants leave of absence
The Hotel de Chalusse will be deserted and Madame Leon and Vantrasson can operate at their leisure
It was ten oclock when M Wilkie made his appearance
Come my good friends
said he my carriage is below
They started off at once and five minutes later they were ushered into the presence of Baron Trigault who received M Wilkie as if he had never seen him before
There was quite a crowd already
At least three or four hundred people had assembled in the Barons receptionrooms and among them were several former habitues of Madame dArgeless house one could also espy M de Fondege ferociously twirling his mustaches as usual together with Kami Bey who was conspicuous by reason of his portly form and eternal red fez
However among these men all noticeable for their studied elegance of attire and manner and all of them known to M de Valorsay there moved numerous others of very different appearance
Their waistcoats were less open and their clothes did not fit them as perfectly on the other hand there was something else than a look of idiotic selfcomplacency on their faces
Who can these people be
whispered the marquis to M de Coralth
They look like lawyers or magistrates
But although he said this he did not really believe it and it was without the slightest feeling of anxiety that he strolled from group to group shaking hands with his friends and introducing M Wilkie
A strange rumor was in circulation among the guests
Many of them declaredwhere could they have heard such a thingthat in consequence of a quarrel with her husband Madame Trigault had left Paris the evening before
They even went so far as to repeat her parting words to the Baron You will never see me again she had said
You are amply avenged
Farewell
However the best informed among the guests the folks who were thoroughly acquainted with all the scandals of the day declared the story false and said that if the baroness had really fled handsome Viscount de Coralth would not appear so calm and smiling
The report WAS true however
But M de Coralth did not trouble himself much about the baroness now
Had he not got in his pocket M Wilkies signature insuring him upward of half a million
Standing near one of the windows in the main receptionroom between the Marquis de Valorsay and M Wilkie the brilliant viscount was gayly chatting with them when a footman in a voice loud enough to interrupt all conversation suddenly announced M
Maumejan
It seemed such a perfectly natural thing to M de Valorsay that Maumejan as one of the barons business agents should be received at his house that he was not in the least disturbed
But M de Coralth having heard the name wished to see the man who had aided and advised the marquius so effectually
He abruptly turned and as he did so the words he would have spoken died upon his lips
He became livid his eyes seemed to start from their sockets and it was with difficulty that he ejaculated He
Who
inquired the astonished marquis
Look
M de Valorsay did so and to his utter amazement he perceived a numerous party in the rear of the man announced under the name of Maumejan
First came Mademoiselle Marguerite leaning on the arm of the whitehaired magistrate and then Madame Ferailleur next M Isidore Fortunat and finally ChupinVictor Chupin resplendent in a handsome brannew black dresssuit
The marquis could no longer fail to understand the truth
He realized who Maumejan really was and the audacious comedy he had been duped by
He was so frightfully agitated that five or six persons sprang forward exclaiming What is the matter marquis
Are you ill
But he made no reply
He felt that he was caught in a trap and he glanced wildly around him seeking for some loophole of escape
However the word of command had evidently been given
Suddenly all the guests scattered about the various drawingrooms poured into the main hall and the doors were closed
Then with a solemnity of manner which no one had ever seen him display before Baron Trigault took the socalled Maumejan by the hand and led him into the centre of the apartment opposite the lofty chimneypiece
Gentlemen he began in a commanding tone this is M Pascal Ferailleur the honorable man who was falsely accused of cheating at cards at Madame dArgeless house
You owe him a hearing
Pascal was greatly agitated
The strangeness of the situation the certainty of speedy and startling rehabilitation perhaps the joy of vengeance the silence which was so profound that he could hear his own panting breath and the many eyes riveted upon him all combined to unnerve him
But only for a moment
He swiftly conquered his weakness and surveying his audience with flashing eyes he explained in a clear and ringing voice the shameful conspiracy to obtain possession of the counts millions and the abominable machinations by which Mademoiselle Marguerite and himself had been victimized
Then when he had finished his explanations he added in a still more commanding voice Now look you can read the culprits guilt on their faces
One is the scoundrel known to you as the Viscount de Coralth but Paul Violaine is his true name
He was formerly an accomplice of the notorious Mascarot he is a cowardly villain for he is married and leaves his wife and children to die of starvation
The Viscount de Coralth fairly bellowed with rage
But Pascal did not heed him
The other criminal is the Marquis de Valorsay he added in the same ringing tone
There was moreover a third culprit who would have inspired mingled pity and disgust if any one had noticed him shrinking into a corner terrified and muttering It wasnt my fault my wife compelled me to do it
This was General de Fondege
Pascal did not mention his name
But it was not absolutely necessary he should do so and besides he remembered Marguerites entreaty respecting the son
However while the young lawyer was speaking the marquis had summoned all his energy and assurance to his aid
Desperate as his plight might be he would not surrender
This is an infamous conspiracy he exclaimed
Baron you shall atone for this
The mans an impostorhe liesall that he says is false
Yes it is false
echoed M de Coralth
But a clamor arose drowning these protestations and the most opprobrious epithets could be heard on every side
How will you prove your assertion
cried M de Valorsay
Dont try that dodge on us
shouted Chupin
Vantrasson and mother Leon have confessed everything
Who defrauded us all with Domingo
cried several people and loud above all the others KamiBey bawled out To say nothing of the fact that the sale of your racing stud was a complete swindle
Meanwhile Pascals former friends and associates his brother advocates and the magistrates who had listened to his first efforts at the bar crowded round him pressing his hands embracing him almost to suffocation censuring themselves for having suspected him the very soul of honor and pleading in selfjustification the degenerate age in which we livean age in which we daily see those whom we had considered immaculate suddenly yield to temptation
And a murmur of respectful admiration rose from the throng when the excitement had subsided a little and the guests had an opportunity to observe Mademoiselle Marguerite whose eyes sparkled more brightly than ever through her happy tears and whose beauty acquired an almost sublime expression from her deep emotion
The wretched Valorsay felt that all was overthat he was irretrievably lost
Seized by a blind fury like that which impels a hunted animal to turn and face the hounds that pursue him and bid them defiance he confronted the throng with his face distorted with passion his eyes bloodshot and foam upon his lips he was absolutely frightful in his cynicism hatred and scorn
Ah
well yes
he exclaimedyes all that you have just heard is true
I was sinking and I tried to save myself as best I could
Beggars cannot be choosers I staked my all upon a single die
If I had won you would have been at my feet but I have lost and you spurn me
Cowards
hypocrites
that you are insult me if you like but tell me how many among you all are sufficiently pure and upright to have a right to despise me
Are there a hundred among you
are there even fifty
A tempest of hisses momentarily drowned his voice but as soon as the uproar had ceased he resumed sneeringly Ah
the truth wounds you my dear friends
Pray dont pretend to be so distressingly virtuous
I was ruinedthat is the long and short of it
But what man of you is not embarrassed
Who among you finds his income sufficient
Which one of you is not encroaching upon his capital
And when you have come to your last louis you will do what I have done or something worse
Do not deny it for not one among you has a more uncompromising conscience more moral firmness or more generous aspirations than I once possessed
You are pursuing what I pursued
You desire what I desireda life of luxury brief if it must be but happya life of gayety wild excitement and dissipation
You too have a passion for pleasure and gambling racehorses and notorious women a table always bountifully spread glasses ever overflowing with wine all the delights of luxury and everything that gratifies your vanity
But an abyss of shame awaits you at the end of it all
I am in it now
I await you there for there you will surely necessarily inevitably come
Ah ha
you will not then think my downfall so very strange
Let me pass
make way
if you please
He advanced with his head haughtily erect and would actually have made his escape if a frightened servant had not at that moment appeared crying MonsieurMonsieur le Baron
a commissary of police is downstairs
He is coming up
He has a warrant
The marquiss frenzied assurance deserted him
He turned even paler than he already was if that were possible and reeled like an ox but partially stunned by the butchers hammer
Suddenly a desperate resolution could be read in his eyes the resolution of the condemned criminal who knowing that he cannot escape the scaffold ascends it with a firm step
He hastily approached Baron Trigault and asked in a husky voice Will you allow me to be arrested in your house baron
mea Valorsay
It might have been supposed that the baron had expected this reproach for without a word he led the marquis and M de Coralth to a little room at the end of the hall pushed them inside and closed the door again
It was time he did so for the commissary of police was already upon the threshold
Which of you gentlemen is the Marquis de Valorsay
he asked
Which of you is Paul Violaine alias the Viscount de The sharp report of firearms suddenly interrupted him
Every one at once rushed to the little room where the wretched men had been conducted
There extended face upward on the floor lay the Marquis de Valorsay with his brains oozing from his fractured skull and his right hand still clutching a revolver
He was dead
And the other
cried the throng the other
The open window and a curtain rudely torn from its fastenings and secured to the balustrade told how M de Coralth had made his escape
It was not till later that people learned what precautions the baron had taken
On the table in that room he had laid two revolvers and two packages containing ten thousand francs each
The viscount had not hesitated
     Pascal Ferailleur and Mademoiselle Marguerite de Chalusse were married at the church of Saint Etienne du Mont only a few steps from the Rue dUlm
Those who knew the mystery connected with the brides parentage were greatly astonished when they saw Baron Trigault act as a witness on this occasion in company with the venerable justice of the peace
But such was the fact nevertheless
Treated more and more outrageously by his daughter and her husband separated from his wife who had nearly lost her reason although her letters were saved the baron has nowadays found affection and a home with Pascal and his wife
He plays cards but seldom nowonly an occasional game of piquet with Madame Ferailleur and he amuses himself by making her start when she is too long in discarding by ejaculating in a stentorian voice We are wasting precious time
Sometimes they go out together to the great astonishment of such as chance to meet the puritanical old lady leaning on the barons arm
She often goes to visit and console the widow Gordon formerly known as Lia dArgeles who now keeps an establishment near Montrouge where she provides poor betrayed and forsaken girls with a home and employment
She has yet to receive any token of remembrance from her son
As for her husband she supposes he is dead or incarcerated in some prison
It is to Madame Gordon that the Fondeges are often indebted for bread
Obliged to disgorge their plunder and left with no resources save the fifty francs a month allowed them by their son who has been promoted to the rank of captain their poverty is necessarily extreme
Oh
those Fondeges
M Fortunat only speaks of them with horror
But he is loud in his praises of Madame Marguerite who repaid him the forty thousand francs he had advanced to M de Valorsay
He speaks in the highest terms of Chupin also but in this he is scarcely sincere for Victor who has been set up in business by Pascal told him very plainly that he was determined not to put his hand to any more dirty work and that expression dirty work rankles in M Fortunats heart
Chupins resolution did not however prevent him from attending the trial of Vantrasson and Madame Leonthe former of whom was sentenced to hard labor for life and the latter to ten years imprisonment
Nothing is known concerning M de Coralth but his wife has disappeared to the great disappointment of M Mouchon
As a dentist Dr Jodon is successful
As for M Wilkie you can learn anything you wish to know concerning him in the newspapers for his sayings doings and movements are constantly being chronicled
The reporters exhaust all the resources of their vocabulary in describing his horses carriages and stables and the gorgeous liveries of his servants
His changes of residence are always mentioned his brilliant sayings are quoted
He is a social success he is admired fondled and flattered
He makes a great stir in the fashionable worldin fact he reigns over it like a king
After all assurance is the winning card in the game of life
