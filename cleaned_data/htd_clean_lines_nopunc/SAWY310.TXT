Internet Wiretap Edition of TOM SAWYER DETECTIVE by MARK TWAIN Electronic edition by dellwiretapspiescom TOM SAWYER DETECTIVE CHAPTER I
AN INVITATION FOR TOM AND HUCK Footnote Strange as the incidents of this story are they are not inventions but facts  even to the public confession of the accused
I take them from an oldtime Swedish criminal trial change the actors and transfer the scenes to America
I have added some details but only a couple of them are important ones
 M T WELL it was the next spring after me and Tom Sawyer set our old nigger Jim free the time he was chained up for a runaway slave down there on Toms uncle Silass farm in Arkansaw
The frost was working out of the ground and out of the air too and it was getting closer and closer onto barefoot time every day and next it would be marble time and next mumbletypeg and next tops and hoops and next kites and then right away it would be summer and go ing in aswimming
It just makes a boy homesick to look ahead like that and see how far off summer is
Yes and it sets him to sighing and saddening around and theres something the matter with him he dont know what
But anyway he gets out by himself and mopes and thinks and mostly he hunts for a lone some place high up on the hill in the edge of the woods and sets there and looks away off on the big Mississippi down there areaching miles and miles around the points where the timber looks smoky and dim its so far off and still and everythings so solemn it seems like everybody youve loved is dead and gone and you most wish you was dead and gone too and done with it all
Dont you know what that is
Its spring fever
That is what the name of it is
And when youve got it you want  oh you dont quite know what it is you DO want but it just fairly makes your heart ache you want it so
It seems to you that mainly what you want is to get away get away from the same old tedious things youre so used to seeing and so tired of and set something new
That is the idea you want to go and be a wanderer you want to go wandering far away to strange countries where everything is mysterious and wonderful and romantic
And if you cant do that youll put up with considerable less youll go any where you CAN go just so as to get away and be thank ful of the chance too
Well me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever and had it bad too but it warnt any use to think about Tom trying to get away because as he said his Aunt Polly wouldnt let him quit school and go traipsing off somers wasting time so we was pretty blue
We was setting on the front steps one day about sundown talk ing this way when out comes his aunt Polly with a letter in her hand and says Tom I reckon youve got to pack up and go down to Arkansaw  your aunt Sally wants you
I most jumped out of my skin for joy
I reckoned Tom would fly at his aunt and hug her head off but if you believe me he set there like a rock and never said a word
It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish with such a noble chance as this opening up
Why we might lose it if he didnt speak up and show he was thankful and grateful
But he set there and studied and studied till I was that distressed I didnt know what to do then he says very cam and I could a shot him for it Well he says Im right down sorry Aunt Polly but I reckon I got to be excused  for the present
His aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at the cold impudence of it that she couldnt say a word for as much as a half a minute and this gave me a chance to nudge Tom and whisper Aint you got any sense
Spiling such a noble chance as this and throwing it away
But he warnt disturbed
He mumbled back Huck Finn do you want me to let her SEE how bad I want to go
Why shed begin to doubt right away and imagine a lot of sicknesses and dangers and objections and first you know shed take it all back
You lemme alone I reckon I know how to work her
Now I never would a thought of that
But he was right
Tom Sawyer was always right  the levelest head I ever see and always AT himself and ready for anything you might spring on him
By this time his aunt Polly was all straight again and she let fly
She says Youll be excused
YOU will
Well I never heard the like of it in all my days
The idea of you talking like that to ME
Now take yourself off and pack your traps and if I hear another word out of you about what youll be excused from and what you wont I lay ILL excuse you  with a hickory
She hit his head a thump with her thimble as we dodged by and he let on to be whimpering as we struck for the stairs
Up in his room he hugged me he was so out of his head for gladness because he was going traveling
And he says Before we get away shell wish she hadnt let me go but she wont know any way to get around it now
After what shes said her pride wont let her take it back
Tom was packed in ten minutes all except what his aunt and Mary would finish up for him then we waited ten more for her to get cooled down and sweet and gentle again for Tom said it took her ten minutes to unruffle in times when half of her feathers was up but twenty when they was all up and this was one of the times when they was all up
Then we went down being in a sweat to know what the letter said
She was setting there in a brown study with it laying in her lap
We set down and she says Theyre in considerable trouble down there and they think you and Huckll be a kind of diversion for them  comfort they say
Much of that theyll get out of you and Huck Finn I reckon
Theres a neigh bor named Brace Dunlap thats been wanting to marry their Benny for three months and at last they told him point blank and once for all he COULDNT so he has soured on them and theyre worried about it
I reckon hes somebody they think they better be on the good side of for theyve tried to please him by hiring his no account brother to help on the farm when they cant hardly afford it and dont want him around anyhow
Who are the Dunlaps
They live about a mile from Uncle Silass place Aunt Polly  all the farmers live about a mile apart down there  and Brace Dunlap is a long sight richer than any of the others and owns a whole grist of nig gers
Hes a widower thirtysix years old without any children and is proud of his money and overbear ing and everybody is a little afraid of him
I judge he thought he could have any girl he wanted just for the asking and it must have set him back a good deal when he found he couldnt get Benny
Why Bennys only half as old as he is and just as sweet and lovely asQ well youve seen her
Poor old Uncle Silas  why its pitiful him trying to curry favor that way  so hard pushed and poor and yet hiring that useless Jubiter Dunlap to please his ornery brother
What a name  Jubiter
Whered he get it
Its only just a nickname
I reckon theyve forgot his real name long before this
Hes twentyseven now and has had it ever since the first time he ever went in swimming
The school teacher seen a round brown mole the size of a dime on his left leg above his knee and four little bits of moles around it when he was naked and he said it minded him of Jubiter and his moons and the children thought it was funny and so they got to calling him Jubiter and hes Jubiter yet
Hes tall and lazy and sly and sneaky and ruther cowardly too but kind of goodnatured and wears long brown hair and no beard and hasnt got a cent and Brace boards him for nothing and gives him his old clothes to wear and despises him
Jubiter is a twin
Whats tother twin like
Just exactly like Jubiter  so they say used to was anyway but he haint been seen for seven years
He got to robbing when he was nineteen or twenty and they jailed him but he broke jail and got away  up North here somers
They used to hear about him robbing and burglaring now and then but that was years ago
Hes dead now
At least thats what they say
They dont hear about him any more
What was his name
Jake
There wasnt anything more said for a considerable while the old lady was thinking
At last she says The thing that is mostly worrying your aunt Sally is the tempers that that man Jubiter gets your uncle into
Tom was astonished and so was I Tom says Tempers
Uncle Silas
Land you must be jok ing
I didnt know he HAD any temper
Works him up into perfect rages your aunt Sally says says he acts as if he would really hit the man sometimes
Aunt Polly it beats anything I ever heard of
Why hes just as gentle as mush
Well shes worried anyway
Says your uncle Silas is like a changed man on account of all this quarreling
And the neighbors talk about it and lay all the blame on your uncle of course because hes a preacher and haint got any business to quarrel
Your aunt Sally says he hates to go into the pulpit hes so ashamed and the people have begun to cool toward him and he aint as popular now as he used to was
Well aint it strange
Why Aunt Polly he was always so good and kind and moony and absentminded and chuckleheaded and lovable  why he was just an angel
What CAN be the matter of him do you reckon
CHAPTER II
JAKE DUNLAP WE had powerful good luck because we got a chance in a sternwheeler from away North which was bound for one of them bayous or onehorse rivers away down Louisiana way and so we could go all the way down the Upper Mississippi and all the way down the Lower Mississippi to that farm in Arkansaw with out having to change steamboats at St Louis not so very much short of a thousand miles at one pull
A pretty lonesome boat there warnt but few passengers and all old folks that set around wide apart dozing and was very quiet
We was four days getting out of the upper river because we got aground so much
But it warnt dull  couldnt be for boys that was traveling of course
From the very start me and Tom allowed that there was somebody sick in the stateroom next to ourn be cause the meals was always toted in there by the wait ers
By and by we asked about it  Tom did and the waiter said it was a man but he didnt look sick
Well but AINT he sick
I dont know maybe he is but pears to me hes just letting on
What makes you think that
Because if he was sick he would pull his clothes off SOME time or other  dont you reckon he would
Well this one dont
At least he dont ever pull off his boots anyway
The mischief he dont
Not even when he goes to bed
No
It was always nuts for Tom Sawyer  a mystery was
If youd lay out a mystery and a pie before me and him you wouldnt have to say take your choice it was a thing that would regulate itself
Because in my nature I have always run to pie whilst in his nature he has always run to mystery
People are made different
And it is the best way
Tom says to the waiter Whats the mans name
Phillips
Whered he come aboard
I think he got aboard at Elexandria up on the Iowa line
What do you reckon hes aplaying
I haint any notion  I never thought of it
I says to myself heres another one that runs to pie
Anything peculiar about him
 the way he acts or talks
No  nothing except he seems so scary and keeps his doors locked night and day both and when you knock he wont let you in till he opens the door a crack and sees who it is
By jimminy its intresting
Id like to get a look at him
Say  the next time youre going in there dont you reckon you could spread the door and  No indeedy
Hes always behind it
He would block that game
Tom studied over it and then he says Looky here
You lend me your apern and let me take him his breakfast in the morning
Ill give you a quarter
The boy was plenty willing enough if the head steward wouldnt mind
Tom says thats all right he reckoned he could fix it with the head steward and he done it
He fixed it so as we could both go in with aperns on and toting vittles
He didnt sleep much he was in such a sweat to get in there and find out the mystery about Phillips and moreover he done a lot of guessing about it all night which warnt no use for if you are going to find out the facts of a thing whats the sense in guessing out what aint the facts and wasting ammunition
I didnt lose no sleep
I wouldnt give a dern to know whats the matter of Phillips I says to myself
Well in the morning we put on the aperns and got a couple of trays of truck and Tom he knocked on the door
The man opened it a crack and then he let us in and shut it quick
By Jackson when we got a sight of him we most dropped the trays
and Tom says Why Jubiter Dunlap whered YOU come from
Well the man was astonished of course and first off he looked like he didnt know whether to be scared or glad or both or which but finally he settled down to being glad and then his color come back though at first his face had turned pretty white
So we got to talking together while he et his breakfast
And he says But I aint Jubiter Dunlap
Id just as soon tell you who I am though if youll swear to keep mum for I aint no Phillips either
Tom says Well keep mum but there aint any need to tell who you are if you aint Jubiter Dunlap
Why
Because if you aint him youre tother twin Jake
Youre the spitn image of Jubiter
Well Im Jake
But looky here how do you come to know us Dunlaps
Tom told about the adventures wed had down there at his uncle Silass last summer and when he see that there warnt anything about his folks  or him either for that matter  that we didnt know he opened out and talked perfectly free and candid
He never made any bones about his own case said hed been a hard lot was a hard lot yet and reckoned hed be a hard lot plumb to the end
He said of course it was a danger ous life and  He give a kind of gasp and set his head like a person thats listening
We didnt say anything and so it was very still for a second or so and there warnt no sounds but the screaking of the woodwork and the chug chugging of the machinery down below
Then we got him comfortable again telling him about his people and how Braces wife had been dead three years and Brace wanted to marry Benny and she shook him and Jubiter was working for Uncle Silas and him and Uncle Silas quarreling all the time  and then he let go and laughed
Land
he says its like old times to hear all this tittletattle and does me good
Its been seven years and more since I heard any
How do they talk about me these days
Who
The farmers  and the family
Why they dont talk about you at all  at least only just a mention once in a long time
The nation
he says surprised why is that
Because they think you are dead long ago
No
Are you speaking true
 honor bright now
He jumped up excited
Honor bright
There aint anybody thinks you are alive
Then Im saved Im saved sure
Ill go home
Theyll hide me and save my life
You keep mum
Swear youll keep mum  swear youll never never tell on me
Oh boys be good to a poor devil thats being hunted day and night and dasnt show his face
Ive never done you any harm Ill never do you any as God is in the heavens swear youll be good to me and help me save my life
Wed a swore it if hed been a dog and so we done it
Well he couldnt love us enough for it or be grate ful enough poor cuss it was all he could do to keep from hugging us
We talked along and he got out a little handbag and begun to open it and told us to turn our backs
We done it and when he told us to turn again he was perfectly different to what he was before
He had on blue goggles and the naturalestlooking long brown whiskers and mustashes you ever see
His own mother wouldnt a knowed him
He asked us if he looked like his brother Jubiter now
No Tom said there aint anything left thats like him except the long hair
All right Ill get that cropped close to my head be fore I get there then him and Brace will keep my secret and Ill live with them as being a stranger and the neighbors wont ever guess me out
What do you think
Tom he studied awhile then he says Well of course me and Huck are going to keep mum there but if you dont keep mum yourself theres going to be a little bit of a risk  it aint much maybe but its a little
I mean if you talk wont people notice that your voice is just like Jubiters and mightnt it make them think of the twin they reckoned was dead but maybe after all was hid all this time under another name
By George he says youre a sharp one
Youre perfectly right
Ive got to play deef and dumb when theres a neighbor around
If Id a struck for home and forgot that little detail  However I wasnt striking for home
I was breaking for any place where I could get away from these fellows that are after me then I was going to put on this disguise and get some different clothes and  He jumped for the outside door and laid his ear against it and listened pale and kind of panting
Presently he whispers Sounded like cocking a gun
Lord what a life to lead
Then he sunk down in a chair all limp and sick like and wiped the sweat off of his face
CHAPTER III
A DIAMOND ROBBERY FROM that time out we was with him most all the time and one or tother of us slept in his upper berth
He said he had been so lonesome and it was such a comfort to him to have company and somebody to talk to in his troubles
We was in a sweat to find out what his secret was but Tom said the best way was not to seem anxious then likely he would drop into it himself in one of his talks but if we got to asking questions he would get suspicious and shet up his shell
It turned out just so
It warnt no trouble to see that he WANTED to talk about it but always along at first he would scare away from it when he got on the very edge of it and go to talking about something else
The way it come about was this He got to asking us kind of indifferent like about the passengers down on deck
We told him about them
But he warnt satis fied we warnt particular enough
He told us to de scribe them better
Tom done it
At last when Tom was describing one of the roughest and raggedest ones he gave a shiver and a gasp and says Oh lordy thats one of them
Theyre aboard sure  I just knowed it
I sort of hoped I had got away but I never believed it
Go on
Presently when Tom was describing another mangy rough deck passenger he give that shiver again and says Thats him
 thats the other one
If it would only come a good black stormy night and I could get ashore
You see theyve got spies on me
Theyve got a right to come up and buy drinks at the bar yonder forrard and they take that chance to bribe somebody to keep watch on me  porter or boots or somebody
If I was to slip ashore without anybody seeing me they would know it inside of an hour
So then he got to wandering along and pretty soon sure enough he was telling
He was poking along through his ups and downs and when he come to that place he went right along
He says It was a confidence game
We played it on a julery shop in St Louis
What we was after was a couple of noble big dimonds as big as hazelnuts which every body was running to see
We was dressed up fine and we played it on them in broad daylight
We ordered the dimonds sent to the hotel for us to see if we wanted to buy and when we was examining them we had paste counterfeits all ready and THEM was the things that went back to the shop when we said the water wasnt quite fine enough for twelve thousand dollars
TwelveQthousandQdollars
Tom says
Was they really worth all that money do you reckon
Every cent of it
And you fellows got away with them
As easy as nothing
I dont reckon the julery people know theyve been robbed yet
But it wouldnt be good sense to stay around St Louis of course so we considered where wed go
One was for going one way one another so we throwed up heads or tails and the Upper Mississippi won
We done up the dimonds in a paper and put our names on it and put it in the keep of the hotel clerk and told him not to ever let either of us have it again without the others was on hand to see it done then we went down town each by his own self  because I reckon maybe we all had the same notion
I dont know for certain but I reckon maybe we had
What notion
Tom says
To rob the others
What  one take everything after all of you had helped to get it
Certnly
It disgusted Tom Sawyer and he said it was the orneriest lowdownest thing he ever heard of
But Jake Dunlap said it warnt unusual in the profession
Said when a person was in that line of business hed got to look out for his own intrust there warnt no body else going to do it for him
And then he went on
He says You see the trouble was you couldnt divide up two dimonds amongst three
If thered been three  But never mind about that there warnt three
I loafed along the back streets studying and studying
And I says to myself Ill hog them dimonds the first chance I get and Ill have a disguise all ready and Ill give the boys the slip and when Im safe away Ill put it on and then let them find me if they can
So I got the false whiskers and the goggles and this countrified suit of clothes and fetched them along back in a hand bag and when I was passing a shop where they sell all sorts of things I got a glimpse of one of my pals through the window
It was Bud Dixon
I was glad you bet
I says to myself Ill see what he buys
So I kept shady and watched
Now what do you reckon it was he bought
Whiskers
said I
No
Goggles
No
Oh keep still Huck Finn cant you youre only just hendering all you can
What WAS it he bought Jake
Youd never guess in the world
It was only just a screwdriver  just a wee little bit of a screwdriver
Well I declare
What did he want with that
Thats what I thought
It was curious
It clean stumped me
I says to myself what can he want with that thing
Well when he come out I stood back out of sight and then tracked him to a secondhand slop shop and see him buy a red flannel shirt and some old ragged clothes  just the ones hes got on now as youve described
Then I went down to the wharf and hid my things aboard the upriver boat that we had picked out and then started back and had another streak of luck
I seen our other pal lay in HIS stock of old rusty secondhanders
We got the dimonds and went aboard the boat
But now we was up a stump for we couldnt go to bed
We had to set up and watch one another
Pity that was pity to put that kind of a strain on us because there was bad blood between us from a couple of weeks back and we was only friends in the way of business
Bad anyway seeing there was only two dimonds betwixt three men
First we had supper and then tramped up and down the deck together smoking till most midnight then we went and set down in my stateroom and locked the doors and looked in the piece of paper to see if the dimonds was all right then laid it on the lower berth right in full sight and there we set and set and byandby it got to be dreadful hard to keep awake
At last Bud Dixon he dropped off
As soon as he was snoring a good regular gait that was likely to last and had his chin on his breast and looked permanent Hal Clayton nodded towards the dimonds and then towards the outside door and I understood
I reached and got the paper and then we stood up and waited perfectly still Bud never stirred I turned the key of the outside door very soft and slow then turned the knob the same way and we went tiptoeing out onto the guard and shut the door very soft and gentle
There warnt nobody stirring anywhere and the boat was slipping along swift and steady through the big water in the smoky moonlight
We never said a word but went straight up onto the hurricanedeck and plumb back aft and set down on the end of the sky light
Both of us knowed what that meant without having to explain to one another
Bud Dixon would wake up and miss the swag and would come straight for us for he aint afeard of anything or anybody that man aint
He would come and we would heave him overboard or get killed trying
It made me shiver because I aint as brave as some people but if I showed the white feather  well I knowed better than do that
I kind of hoped the boat would land somers and we could skip ashore and not have to run the risk of this row I was so scared of Bud Dixon but she was an upperriver tub and there warnt no real chance of that
Well the time strung along and along and that fellow never come
Why it strung along till dawn begun to break and still he never come
Thunder I says what do you make out of this
 aint it sus picious
Land
Hal says do you reckon hes playing us
 open the paper
I done it and by gracious there warnt anything in it but a couple of little pieces of loafsugar
THATS the reason he could set there and snooze all night so comfortable
Smart
Well I reckon
He had had them two papers all fixed and ready and he had put one of them in place of tother right under our noses
We felt pretty cheap
But the thing to do straight off was to make a plan and we done it
We would do up the paper again just as it was and slip in very elaborate and soft and lay it on the bunk again and let on WE didnt know about any trick and hadnt any idea he was alaughing at us behind them bogus snores of hisn and we would stick by him and the first night we was ashore we would get him drunk and search him and get the dimonds and DO for him too if it warnt too risky
If we got the swag wed GOT to do for him or he would hunt us down and do for us sure
But I didnt have no real hope
I knowed we could get him drunk  he was always ready for that  but whats the good of it
You might search him a year and never find  Well right there I catched my breath and broke off my thought
For an idea went ripping through my head that tore my brains to rags  and land but I felt gay and good
You see I had had my boots off to unswell my feet and just then I took up one of them to put it on and I catched a glimpse of the heel bottom and it just took my breath away
You re member about that puzzlesome little screwdriver
You bet I do says Tom all excited
Well when I catched that glimpse of that boot heel the idea that went smashing through my head was I know where hes hid the dimonds
You look at this boot heel now
See its bottomed with a steel plate and the plate is fastened on with little screws
Now there wasnt a screw about that feller anywhere but in his boot heels so if he needed a screwdriver I reckoned I knowed why
Huck aint it bully
says Tom
Well I got my boots on and we went down and slipped in and laid the paper of sugar on the berth and sat down soft and sheepish and went to listening to Bud Dixon snore
Hal Clayton dropped off pretty soon but I didnt I wasnt ever so wide awake in my life
I was spying out from under the shade of my hat brim searching the floor for leather
It took me a long time and I begun to think maybe my guess was wrong but at last I struck it
It laid over by the bulkhead and was nearly the color of the carpet
It was a little round plug about as thick as the end of your little finger and I says to myself theres a dimond in the nest youve come from
Before long I spied out the plugs mate 
Think of the smartness and coolness of that blatherskite
He put up that scheme on us and reasoned out what we would do and we went ahead and done it perfectly exact like a couple of puddn heads
He set there and took his own time to un screw his heelplates and cut out his plugs and stick in the dimonds and screw on his plates again 
He allowed we would steal the bogus swag and wait all night for him to come up and get drownded and by George its just what we done
I think it was power ful smart
You bet your life it was
says Tom just full of admiration
CHAPTER IV
THE THREE SLEEPERS WELL all day we went through the humbug of watching one another and it was pretty sickly business for two of us and hard to act out I can tell you
About night we landed at one of them little Missouri towns high up toward Iowa and had supper at the tavern and got a room upstairs with a cot and a double bed in it but I dumped my bag under a deal table in the dark hall while we was moving along it to bed single file me last and the landlord in the lead with a tallow candle
We had up a lot of whisky and went to playing highlowjack for dimes and as soon as the whisky begun to take hold of Bud we stopped drinking but we didnt let him stop
We loaded him till he fell out of his chair and laid there snoring
We was ready for business now
I said we better pull our boots off and hisn too and not make any noise then we could pull him and haul him around and ransack him without any trouble
So we done it
I set my boots and Buds side by side where theyd be handy
Then we stripped him and searched his seams and his pockets and his socks and the inside of his boots and everything and searched his bundle
Never found any dimonds
We found the screwdriver and Hal says What do you reckon he wanted with that
I said I didnt know but when he wasnt looking I hooked it
At last Hal he looked beat and discour aged and said wed got to give it up
That was what I was waiting for
I says Theres one place we haint searched
What place is that
he says
His stomach
By gracious I never thought of that
NOW were on the homestretch to a dead moral certainty
Howll we manage
Well I says just stay by him till I turn out and hunt up a drug store and I reckon Ill fetch something thatll make them dimonds tired of the company theyre keeping
He said thats the ticket and with him looking straight at me I slid myself into Buds boots instead of my own and he never noticed
They was just a shade large for me but that was considerable better than be ing too small
I got my bag as I went agroping through the hall and in about a minute I was out the back way and stretching up the river road at a fivemile gait
And not feeling so very bad neither  walking on dimonds dont have no such effect
When I had gone fifteen minutes I says to myself theres moren a mile behind me and everything quiet
Another five minutes and I says theres considerable more land behind me now and theres a man back there thats begun to wonder whats the trouble
Another five and I says to myself hes getting real uneasy  hes walking the floor now
Another five and I says to myself theres two mile and a half behind me and hes AWFUL uneasy  be ginning to cuss I reckon
Pretty soon I says to my self forty minutes gone  he KNOWS theres something up
Fifty minutes  the truths abusting on him now
he is reckoning I found the dimonds whilst we was searching and shoved them in my pocket and never let on  yes and hes starting out to hunt for me
Hell hunt for new tracks in the dust and theyll as likely send him down the river as up
Just then I see a man coming down on a mule and before I thought I jumped into the bush
It was stupid
When he got abreast he stopped and waited a little for me to come out then he rode on again
But I didnt feel gay any more
I says to myself Ive botched my chances by that I surely have if he meets up with Hal Clayton
Well about three in the morning I fetched Elex andria and see this sternwheeler laying there and was very glad because I felt perfectly safe now you know
It was just daybreak
I went aboard and got this state room and put on these clothes and went up in the pilot house  to watch though I didnt reckon there was any need of it
I set there and played with my dimonds and waited and waited for the boat to start but she didnt
You see they was mending her machinery but I didnt know anything about it not being very much used to steamboats
Well to cut the tale short we never left there till plumb noon and long before that I was hid in this stateroom for before breakfast I see a man coming away off that had a gait like Hal Claytons and it made me just sick
I says to myself if he finds out Im aboard this boat hes got me like a rat in a trap
All hes got to do is to have me watched and wait  wait till I slip ashore thinking he is a thousand miles away then slip after me and dog me to a good place and make me give up the dimonds and then hell  oh I know what hell do
Aint it awful  awful
And now to think the OTHER ones aboard too
Oh aint it hard luck boys  aint it hard
But youll help save me WONT you
 oh boys be good to a poor devil thats being hunted to death and save me  Ill worship the very ground you walk on
We turned in and soothed him down and told him we would plan for him and help him and he neednt be so afeard and so by and by he got to feeling kind of comfortable again and unscrewed his heelplates and held up his dimonds this way and that admiring them and loving them and when the light struck into them they WAS beautiful sure why they seemed to kind of bust and snap fire out all around
But all the same I judged he was a fool
If I had been him I would a handed the dimonds to them pals and got them to go ashore and leave me alone
But he was made differ ent
He said it was a whole fortune and he couldnt bear the idea
Twice we stopped to fix the machinery and laid a good while once in the night but it wasnt dark enough and he was afeard to skip
But the third time we had to fix it there was a better chance
We laid up at a country woodyard about forty mile above Uncle Silass place a little after one at night and it was thickening up and going to storm
So Jake he laid for a chance to slide
We begun to take in wood
Pretty soon the rain come adrenching down and the wind blowed hard
Of course every boathand fixed a gunny sack and put it on like a bonnet the way they do when they are toting wood and we got one for Jake and he slipped down aft with his handbag and come tramping forrard just like the rest and walked ashore with them and when we see him pass out of the light of the torchbasket and get swallowed up in the dark we got our breath again and just felt grateful and splendid
But it wasnt for long
Somebody told I reckon for in about eight or ten minutes them two pals come tearing forrard as tight as they could jump and darted ashore and was gone
We waited plumb till dawn for them to come back and kept hoping they would but they never did
We was awful sorry and lowspirited
All the hope we had was that Jake had got such a start that they couldnt get on his track and he would get to his brothers and hide there and be safe
He was going to take the river road and told us to find out if Brace and Jubiter was to home and no strangers there and then slip out about sundown and tell him
Said he would wait for us in a little bunch of sycamores right back of Toms uncle Silass tobacker field on the river road a lonesome place
We set and talked a long time about his chances and Tom said he was all right if the pals struck up the river instead of down but it wasnt likely because maybe they knowed where he was from more likely they would go right and dog him all day him not suspecting and kill him when it come dark and take the boots
So we was pretty sorrowful
CHAPTER V A TRAGEDY IN THE WOODS WE didnt get done tinkering the machinery till away late in the afternoon and so it was so close to sundown when we got home that we never stopped on our road but made a break for the sycamores as tight as we could go to tell Jake what the delay was and have him wait till we could go to Braces and find out how things was there
It was getting pretty dim by the time we turned the corner of the woods sweating and panting with that long run and see the sycamores thirty yards ahead of us and just then we see a couple of men run into the bunch and heard two or three terrible screams for help
Poor Jake is killed sure we says
We was scared through and through and broke for the tobacker field and hid there trembling so our clothes would hardly stay on and just as we skipped in there a couple of men went tearing by and into the bunch they went and in a second out jumps four men and took out up the road as tight as they could go two chasing two
We laid down kind of weak and sick and listened for more sounds but didnt hear none for a good while but just our hearts
We was thinking of that awful thing laying yonder in the sycamores and it seemed like being that close to a ghost and it give me the cold shudders
The moon come aswelling up out of the ground now powerful big and round and bright be hind a comb of trees like a face looking through prison bars and the black shadders and white places begun to creep around and it was miserable quiet and still and nightbreezy and graveyardy and scary
All of a sud den Tom whispers Look
 whats that
Dont
I says
Dont take a person by sur prise that way
Im most ready to die anyway with out you doing that
Look I tell you
Its something coming out of the sycamores
Dont Tom
Its terrible tall
Oh lordylordy
lets  Keep still  its acoming this way
He was so excited he could hardly get breath enough to whisper
I had to look
I couldnt help it
So now we was both on our knees with our chins on a fence rail and gazing  yes and gasping too
It was coming down the road  coming in the shadder of the trees and you couldnt see it good not till it was pretty close to us then it stepped into a bright splotch of moonlight and we sunk right down in our tracks  it was Jake Dunlaps ghost
That was what we said to ourselves
We couldnt stir for a minute or two then it was gone We talked about it in low voices
Tom says Theyre mostly dim and smoky or like theyre made out of fog but this one wasnt
No I says I seen the goggles and the whiskers perfectly plain
Yes and the very colors in them loud countrified Sunday clothes  plaid breeches green and black  Cotton velvet westcot firered and yaller squares  Leather straps to the bottoms of the breeches legs and one of them hanging unbottoned  Yes and that hat  What a hat for a ghost to wear
You see it was the first season anybody wore that kind  a black sitffbrim stovepipe very high and not smooth with a round top  just like a sugarloaf
Did you notice if its hair was the same Huck
No  seems to me I did then again it seems to me I didnt
I didnt either but it had its bag along I noticed that
So did I
How can there be a ghostbag Tom
Sho
I wouldnt be as ignorant as that if I was you Huck Finn
Whatever a ghost has turns to ghost stuff
Theyve got to have their things like anybody else
You see yourself that its clothes was turned to ghoststuff
Well then whats to hender its bag from turning too
Of course it done it
That was reasonable
I couldnt find no fault with it
Bill Withers and his brother Jack come along by talking and Jack says What do you reckon he was toting
I dunno but it was pretty heavy
Yes all he could lug
Nigger stealing corn from old Parson Silas I judged
So did I
And so I allowed I wouldnt let on to see him
Thats me too
Then they both laughed and went on out of hearing
It showed how unpopular old Uncle Silas had got to be now
They wouldnt a let a nigger steal anybody elses corn and never done anything to him
We heard some more voices mumbling along towards us and getting louder and sometimes a cackle of a laugh
It was Lem Beebe and Jim Lane
Jim Lane says Who
 Jubiter Dunlap
Yes
Oh I dont know
I reckon so
I seen him spad ing up some ground along about an hour ago just be fore sundown  him and the parson
Said he guessed he wouldnt go tonight but we could have his dog if we wanted him
Too tired I reckon
Yes  works so hard
Oh you bet
They cackled at that and went on by
Tom said we better jump out and tag along after them because they was going our way and it wouldnt be comfortable to run across the ghost all by ourselves
So we done it and got home all right
That night was the second of September  a Satur day
I shant ever forget it
Youll see why pretty soon 
CHAPTER VI
PLANS TO SECURE THE DIAMONDS WE tramped along behind Jim and Lem till we come to the back stile where old Jims cabin was that he was captivated in the time we set him free and here come the dogs piling around us to say howdy and there was the lights of the house too so we warnt afeard any more and was going to climb over but Tom says Hold on set down here a minute
By George
Whats the matter
says I
Matter enough
he says
Wasnt you expect ing we would be the first to tell the family who it is thats been killed yonder in the sycamores and all about them rapscallions that done it and about the dimonds theyve smouched off of the corpse and paint it up fine and have the glory of being the ones that knows a lot more about it than anybody else
Why of course
It wouldnt be you Tom Sawyer if you was to let such a chance go by
I reckon it aint going to suffer none for lack of paint I says when you start in to scollop the facts
Well now he says perfectly cam what would you say if I was to tell you I aint going to start in at all
I was astonished to hear him talk so
I says Id say its a lie
You aint in earnest Tom Sawyer
Youll soon see
Was the ghost barefooted
No it wasnt
What of it
You wait  Ill show you what
Did it have its boots on
Yes
I seen them plain
Swear it
Yes I swear it
So do I
Now do you know what that means
No
What does it mean
Means that them thieves DIDNT GET THE DIMONDS
Jimminy
What makes you think that
I dont only think it I know it
Didnt the breeches and goggles and whiskers and handbag and every blessed thing turn to ghoststuff
Everything it had on turned didnt it
It shows that the reason its boots turned too was because it still had them on after it started to go hanting around and if that aint proof that them blatherskites didnt get the boots Id like to know what youd CALL proof
Think of that now
I never see such a head as that boy had
Why I had eyes and I could see things but they never meant nothing to me
But Tom Sawyer was different
When Tom Sawyer seen a thing it just got up on its hind legs and TALKED to him  told him everything it knowed
I never see such a head
Tom Sawyer I says Ill say it again as Ive said it a many a time before I aint fitten to black your boots
But thats all right  thats neither here nor there
God Almighty made us all and some He gives eyes thats blind and some He gives eyes that can see and I reckon it aint none of our lookout what He done it for its all right or Hed a fixed it some other way
Go on  I see plenty plain enough now that them thieves didnt get way with the dimonds
Why didnt they do you reckon
Because they got chased away by them other two men before they could pull the boots off of the corpse
Thats so
I see it now
But looky here Tom why aint we to go and tell about it
Oh shucks Huck Finn cant you see
Look at it
Whats agoing to happen
Theres going to be an inquest in the morning
Them two men will tell how they heard the yells and rushed there just in time to not save the stranger
Then the juryll twaddle and twaddle and twaddle and finally theyll fetch in a verdict that he got shot or stuck or busted over the head with something and come to his death by the in spiration of God
And after theyve buried him theyll auction off his things for to pay the expenses and thens OUR chance
How Tom
Buy the boots for two dollars
Well it most took my breath
My land
Why Tom WELL get the dimonds
You bet
Some day therell be a big reward offered for them  a thousand dollars sure
Thats our money
Now well trot in and see the folks
And mind you we dont know anything about any murder or any dimonds or any thieves  dont you forget that
I had to sigh a little over the way he had got it fixed
Id a SOLD them dimonds  yes sir  for twelve thousand dollars but I didnt say anything
It wouldnt done any good
I says But what are we going to tell your aunt Sally has made us so long getting down here from the village Tom
Oh Ill leave that to you he says
I reckon you can explain it somehow
He was always just that strict and delicate
He never would tell a lie himself
We struck across the big yard noticing this that and tother thing that was so familiar and we so glad to see it again and when we got to the roofed big passageway betwixt the double log house and the kitchen part there was everything hanging on the wall just as it used to was even to Uncle Silass old faded green baize workinggown with the hood to it and rag gedy white patch between the shoulders that always looked like somebody had hit him with a snowball and then we lifted the latch and walked in
Aunt Sally she was just aripping and atearing around and the children was huddled in one corner and the old man he was huddled in the other and praying for help in time of need
She jumped for us with joy and tears running down her face and give us a whacking box on the ear and then hugged us and kissed us and boxed us again and just couldnt seem to get enough of it she was so glad to see us and she says Where HAVE you been aloafing to you goodfor nothing trash
Ive been that worried about you I didnt know what to do
Your traps has been here ever so long and Ive had supper cooked fresh about four times so as to have it hot and good when you come till at last my patience is just plumb wore out and I declare I  I  why I could skin you alive
You must be starving poor things
 set down set down everybody dont lose no more time
It was good to be there again behind all that noble cornpone and spareribs and everything that you could ever want in this world
Old Uncle Silas he peeled off one of his bulliest oldtime blessings with as many layers to it as an onion and whilst the angels was haul ing in the slack of it I was trying to study up what to say about what kept us so long
When our plates was all loadened and wed got agoing she asked me and I says Well you see  er  Mizzes  Huck Finn
Since when am I Mizzes to you
Have I ever been stingy of cuffs or kisses for you since the day you stood in this room and I took you for Tom Sawyer and blessed God for sending you to me though you told me four thousand lies and I believed every one of them like a simpleton
Call me Aunt Sally  like you always done
So I done it
And I says Well me and Tom allowed we would come along afoot and take a smell of the woods and we run across Lem Beebe and Jim Lane and they asked us to go with them blackberrying tonight and said they could bor row Jubiter Dunlaps dog because he had told them just that minute  Where did they see him
says the old man and when I looked up to see how HE come to take an intrust in a little thing like that his eyes was just burning into me he was that eager
It surprised me so it kind of throwed me off but I pulled myself together again and says It was when he was spading up some ground along with you towards sundown or along there
He only said Um in a kind of a disappointed way and didnt take no more intrust
So I went on
I says Well then as I was asaying  Thatll do you neednt go no furder
It was Aunt Sally
She was boring right into me with her eyes and very indignant
Huck Finn she says howd them men come to talk about going ablack berrying in September  in THIS region
I see I had slipped up and I couldnt say a word
She waited still agazing at me then she says And howd they come to strike that idiot idea of going ablackberrying in the night
Well mm they  er  they told us they had a lantern and  Oh SHET up  do
Looky here what was they going to do with a dog
 hunt blackberries with it
I think mm they  Now Tom Sawyer what kind of a lie are you fix ing YOUR mouth to contribit to this mess of rubbage
Speak out  and I warn you before you begin that I dont believe a word of it
You and Hucks been up to something you no business to  I know it perfectly well I know you BOTH of you
Now you explain that dog and them blackberries and the lantern and the rest of that rot  and mind you talk as straight as a string  do you hear
Tom he looked considerable hurt and says very dignified It is a pity if Huck is to be talked to that way just for making a little bit of a mistake that anybody could make
What mistake has he made
Why only the mistake of saying blackberries when of course he meant strawberries
Tom Sawyer I lay if you aggravate me a little more Ill  Aunt Sally without knowing it  and of course without intending it  you are in the wrong
If youd a studied natural history the way you ought you would know that all over the world except just here in Arkansaw they ALWAYS hunt strawberries with a dog  and a lantern  But she busted in on him there and just piled into him and snowed him under
She was so mad she couldnt get the words out fast enough and she gushed them out in one everlasting freshet
That was what Tom Sawyer was after
He allowed to work her up and get her started and then leave her alone and let her burn herself out
Then she would be so aggravated with that subject that she wouldnt say another word about it nor let anybody else
Well it happened just so
When she was tuckered out and had to hold up he says quite cam And yet all the same Aunt Sally  Shet up
she says I dont want to hear another word out of you
So we was perfectly safe then and didnt have no more trouble about that delay
Tom done it elegant
CHAPTER VII
A NIGHTS VIGIL BENNY she was looking pretty sober and she sighed some now and then but pretty soon she got to asking about Mary and Sid and Toms aunt Polly and then Aunt Sallys clouds cleared off and she got in a good humor and joined in on the questions and was her lovingest best self and so the rest of the supper went along gay and pleasant
But the old man he didnt take any hand hardly and was absentminded and restless and done a considerable amount of sigh ing and it was kind of heartbreaking to see him so sad and troubled and worried
By and by a spell after supper come a nigger and knocked on the door and put his head in with his old straw hat in his hand bowing and scraping and said his Marse Brace was out at the stile and wanted his brother and was getting tired waiting supper for him and would Marse Silas please tell him where he was
I never see Uncle Silas speak up so sharp and fractious before
He says Am I his brothers keeper
And then he kind of wilted together and looked like he wished he hadnt spoken so and then he says very gentle But you neednt say that Billy I was took sudden and irritable and I aint very well these days and not hardly respon sible
Tell him he aint here
And when the nigger was gone he got up and walked the floor backwards and forwards mumbling and muttering to himself and plowing his hands through his hair
It was real pitiful to see him
Aunt Sally she whispered to us and told us not to take notice of him it embarrassed him
She said he was always thinking and thinking since these troubles come on and she allowed he didnt moren about half know what he was about when the thinking spells was on him and she said he walked in his sleep considerable more now than he used to and sometimes wandered around over the house and even outdoors in his sleep and if we catched him at it we must let him alone and not disturb him
She said she reckoned it didnt do him no harm and may be it done him good
She said Benny was the only one that was much help to him these days
Said Benny appeared to know just when to try to soothe him and when to leave him alone
So he kept on tramping up and down the floor and muttering till by and by he begun to look pretty tired then Benny she went and snuggled up to his side and put one hand in his and one arm around his waist and walked with him and he smiled down on her and reached down and kissed her and so little by little the trouble went out of his face and she persuaded him off to his room
They had very petting ways together and it was uncommon pretty to see
Aunt Sally she was busy getting the children ready for bed so by and by it got dull and tedious and me and Tom took a turn in the moonlight and fetched up in the watermelonpatch and et one and had a good deal of talk
And Tom said hed bet the quarreling was all Jubiters fault and he was going to be on hand the first time he got a chance and see and if it was so he was going to do his level best to get Uncle Silas to turn him off
And so we talked and smoked and stuffed water melons much as two hours and then it was pretty late and when we got back the house was quiet and dark and everybody gone to bed
Tom he always seen everything and now he see that the old green baize workgown was gone and said it wasnt gone when he went out so he allowed it was curious and then we went up to bed
We could hear Benny stirring around in her room which was next to ourn and judged she was worried a good deal about her father and couldnt sleep
We found we couldnt neither
So we set up a long time and smoked and talked in a low voice and felt pretty dull and downhearted
We talked the murder and the ghost over and over again and got so creepy and crawly we couldnt get sleepy nohow and noway
By and by when it was away late in the night and all the sounds was late sounds and solemn Tom nudged me and whispers to me to look and I done it and there we see a man poking around in the yard like he didnt know just what he wanted to do but it was pretty dim and we couldnt see him good
Then he started for the stile and as he went over it the moon came out strong and he had a longhandled shovel over his shoulder and we see the white patch on the old work gown
So Tom says Hes awalking in his sleep
I wish we was allowed to follow him and see where hes going to
There hes turned down by the tobackerfield
Out of sight now
Its a dreadful pity he cant rest no better
We waited a long time but he didnt come back any more or if he did he come around the other way so at last we was tuckered out and went to sleep and had nightmares a million of them
But before dawn we was awake again because meantime a storm had come up and been raging and the thunder and lightning was awful and the wind was athrashing the trees around and the rain was driving down in slanting sheets and the gullies was running rivers
Tom says Looky here Huck Ill tell you one thing thats mighty curious
Up to the time we went out last night the family hadnt heard about Jake Dunlap being mur dered
Now the men that chased Hal Clayton and Bud Dixon away would spread the thing around in a half an hour and every neighbor that heard it would shin out and fly around from one farm to tother and try to be the first to tell the news
Land they dont have such a big thing as that to tell twice in thirty year
Huck its mighty strange I dont understand it
So then he was in a fidget for the rain to let up so we could turn out and run across some of the people and see if they would say anything about it to us
And he said if they did we must be horribly surprised and shocked
We was out and gone the minute the rain stopped
It was just broad day then
We loafed along up the road and now and then met a person and stopped and said howdy and told them when we come and how we left the folks at home and how long we was going to stay and all that but none of them said a word about that thing which was just astonishing and no mistake
Tom said he believed if we went to the sycamores we would find that body laying there solitary and alone and not a soul around
Said he believed the men chased the thieves so far into the woods that the thieves probly seen a good chance and turned on them at last and maybe they all killed each other and so there wasnt anybody left to tell
First we knowed gabbling along that away we was right at the sycamores
The cold chills trickled down my back and I wouldnt budge another step for all Toms persuading
But he couldnt hold in hed GOT to see if the boots was safe on that body yet
So he crope in  and the next minute out he come again with his eyes bulging he was so excited and says Huck its gone
I WAS astonished
I says Tom you dont mean it
Its gone sure
There aint a sign of it
The ground is trampled some but if there was any blood its all washed away by the storm for its all puddles and slush in there
At last I give in and went and took a look myself and it was just as Tom said  there wasnt a sign of a corpse
Dern it I says the dimonds is gone
Dont you reckon the thieves slunk back and lugged him off Tom
Looks like it
It just does
Now whered they hide him do you reckon
I dont know I says disgusted and whats more I dont care
Theyve got the boots and thats all I cared about
Hell lay around these woods a long time before I hunt him up
Tom didnt feel no more intrust in him neither only curiosity to know what come of him but he said wed lay low and keep dark and it wouldnt be long till the dogs or somebody rousted him out
We went back home to breakfast ever so bothered and put out and disappointed and swindled
I warnt ever so down on a corpse before
CHAPTER VIII
TALKING WITH THE GHOST IT warnt very cheerful at breakfast
Aunt Sally she looked old and tired and let the children snarl and fuss at one another and didnt seem to notice it was going on which wasnt her usual style me and Tom had a plenty to think about without talking Benny she looked like she hadnt had much sleep and whenever shed lift her head a little and steal a look towards her father you could see there was tears in her eyes and as for the old man his things stayed on his plate and got cold without him knowing they was there I reckon for he was thinking and thinking all the time and never said a word and never et a bite
By and by when it was stillest that niggers head was poked in at the door again and he said his Marse Brace was getting powerful uneasy about Marse Jubiter which hadnt come home yet and would Marse Silas please  He was looking at Uncle Silas and he stopped there like the rest of his words was froze for Uncle Silas he rose up shaky and steadied himself leaning his fingers on the table and he was panting and his eyes was set on the nigger and he kept swallowing and put his other hand up to his throat a couple of times and at last he got his words started and says Does he  does he  think  WHAT does he think
Tell him  tell him  Then he sunk down in his chair limp and weak and says so as you could hardly hear him Go away  go away
The nigger looked scared and cleared out and we all felt  well I dont know how we felt but it was awful with the old man panting there and his eyes set and looking like a person that was dying
None of us could budge but Benny she slid around soft with her tears running down and stood by his side and nestled his old gray head up against her and begun to stroke it and pet it with her hands and nodded to us to go away and we done it going out very quiet like the dead was there
Me and Tom struck out for the woods mighty solemn and saying how different it was now to what it was last summer when we was here and everything was so peaceful and happy and everybody thought so much of Uncle Silas and he was so cheerful and simple hearted and puddnheaded and good  and now look at him
If he hadnt lost his mind he wasnt muck short of it
That was what we allowed
It was a most lovely day now and bright and sun
shiny and the further and further we went over the hills towards the prairie the lovelier and lovelier the trees and flowers got to be and the more it seemed strange and somehow wrong that there had to be trouble in such a world as this
And then all of a sudden I catched my breath and grabbed Toms arm and all my livers and lungs and things fell down into my legs
There it is
I says
We jumped back behind a bush shivering and Tom says Sh
 dont make a noise
It was setting on a log right in the edge of a little prairie thinking
I tried to get Tom to come away but he wouldnt and I dasnt budge by myself
He said we mightnt ever get another chance to see one and he was going to look his fill at this one if he died for it
So I looked too though it give me the fan tods to do it
Tom he HAD to talk but he talked low
He says Poor Jakey its got all its things on just as he said he would
NOW you see what we wasnt certain about  its hair
Its not long now the way it was its got it cropped close to its head the way he said he would
Huck I never see anything look any more naturaler than what It does
Nor I neither I says Id recognize it any wheres
So would I
It looks perfectly solid and genu wyne just the way it done before it died
So we kept agazing
Pretty soon Tom says Huck theres something mighty curious about this one dont you know
IT oughtnt to be going around in the daytime
Thats so Tom  I never heard the like of it before
No sir they dont ever come out only at night  and then not till after twelve
Theres something wrong about this one now you mark my words
I dont believe its got any right to be around in the daytime
But dont it look natural
Jake was going to play deef and dumb here so the neighbors wouldnt know his voice
Do you reckon it would do that if we was to holler at it
Lordy Tom dont talk so
If you was to holler at it Id die in my tracks
Dont you worry I aint going to holler at it
Look Huck its ascratching its head  dont you see
Well what of it
Why this
Whats the sense of it scratching its head
There aint anything there to itch its head is made out of fog or something like that and cant itch
A fog cant itch any fool knows that
Well then if it dont itch and cant itch what in the nation is it scratching it for
Aint it just habit dont you reckon
No sir I dont
I aint a bit satisfied about the way this one acts
Ive a blame good notion its a bogus one  I have as sure as Im asitting here
Because if it  Huck
Well whats the matter now
YOU CANT SEE THE BUSHES THROUGH IT
Why Tom its so sure
Its as solid as a cow
I sort of begin to think  Huck its biting off a chaw of tobacker
By George THEY dont chaw  they haint got anything to chaw WITH
Huck
Im alistening
It aint a ghost at all
Its Jake Dunlap his own self
Oh your granny
I says
Huck Finn did we find any corpse in the syca mores
No
Or any sign of one
No
Mighty good reason
Hadnt ever been any corpse there
Why Tom you know we heard  Yes we didJ heard a howl or two
Does that prove anybody was killed
Course it dont
And we seen four men run then this one come walking out and we took it for a ghost
No more ghost than you are
It was Jake Dunlap his own self and its Jake Dunlap now
Hes been and got his hair cropped the way he said he would and hes playing himself for a stranger just the same as he said he would
Ghost
Hum
 hes as sound as a nut
Then I see it all and how we had took too much for granted
I was powerful glad he didnt get killed and so was Tom and we wondered which he would like the best  for us to never let on to know him or how
Tom reckoned the best way would be to go and ask him
So he started but I kept a little behind because I didnt know but it might be a ghost after all
When Tom got to where he was he says Me and Hucks mighty glad to see you again and you neednt be afeared well tell
And if you think itll be safer for you if we dont let on to know you when we run across you say the word and youll see you can depend on us and would ruther cut our hands off than get you into the least little bit of danger
First off he looked surprised to see us and not very glad either but as Tom went on he looked pleasanter and when he was done he smiled and nodded his head several times and made signs with his hands and says Googoo  googoo the way deef and dummies does
Just then we see some of Steve Nickersons people coming that lived tother side of the prairie so Tom says You do it elegant I never see anybody do it better
Youre right play it on us too play it on us same as the others itll keep you in practice and prevent you making blunders
Well keep away from you and let on we dont know you but any time we can be any help you just let us know
Then we loafed along past the Nickersons and of course they asked if that was the new stranger yonder and whered he come from and what was his name and which communion was he Babtis or Methodis and which politics Whig or Democrat and how long is he staying and all them other questions that humans always asks when a stranger comes and animals does too
But Tom said he warnt able to make anything out of deef and dumb signs and the same with goo gooing
Then we watched them go and bullyrag Jake because we was pretty uneasy for him
Tom said it would take him days to get so he wouldnt forget he was a deef and dummy sometimes and speak out be fore he thought
When we had watched long enough to see that Jake was getting along all right and working his signs very good we loafed along again allowing to strike the schoolhouse about recess time which was a threemile tramp
I was so disappointed not to hear Jake tell about the row in the sycamores and how near he come to get ting killed that I couldnt seem to get over it and Tom he felt the same but said if we was in Jakes fix we would want to go careful and keep still and not take any chances
The boys and girls was all glad to see us again and we had a real good time all through recess
Coming to school the Henderson boys had come across the new deef and dummy and told the rest so all the scholars was chuck full of him and couldnt talk about anything else and was in a sweat to get a sight of him because they hadnt ever seen a deef and dummy in their lives and it made a powerful excitement
Tom said it was tough to have to keep mum now said we would be heroes if we could come out and tell all we knowed but after all it was still more heroic to keep mum there warnt two boys in a million could do it
That was Tom Sawyers idea about it and reckoned there warnt anybody could better it
CHAPTER IX
FINDING OF JUBITER DUNLAP IN the next two or three days Dummy he got to be powerful popular
He went associating around with the neighbors and they made much of him and was proud to have such a rattling curiosity among them
They had him to breakfast they had him to dinner they had him to supper they kept him loaded up with hog and hominy and warnt ever tired staring at him and wondering over him and wishing they knowed more about him he was so uncommon and romantic
His signs warnt no good people couldnt under stand them and he probly couldnt himself but he done a sight of googooing and so everybody was sat isfied and admired to hear him go it
He toted a piece of slate around and a pencil and people wrote questions on it and he wrote answers but there warnt anybody could read his writing but Brace Dunlap
Brace said he couldnt read it very good but he could manage to dig out the meaning most of the time
He said Dummy said he belonged away off somers and used to be well off but got busted by swindlers which he had trusted and was poor now and hadnt any way to make a living
Everybody praised Brace Dunlap for being so good to that stranger
He let him have a little logcabin all to himself and had his niggers take care of it and fetch him all the vittles he wanted
Dummy was at our house some because old Uncle Silas was so afflicted himself these days that anybody else that was afflicted was a comfort to him
Me and Tom didnt let on that we had knowed him before and he didnt let on that he had knowed us before
The family talked their troubles out before him the same as if he wasnt there but we reckoned it wasnt any harm for him to hear what they said
Generly he didnt seem to notice but sometimes he did
Well two or three days went along and everybody got to getting uneasy about Jubiter Dunlap
Every body was asking everybody if they had any idea what had become of him
No they hadnt they said and they shook their heads and said there was something powerful strange about it
Another and another day went by then there was a report got around that praps he was murdered
You bet it made a big stir
Every bodys tongue was clacking away after that
Saturday two or three gangs turned out and hunted the woods to see if they could run across his remainders
Me and Tom helped and it was noble good times and exciting
Tom he was so brimful of it he couldnt eat nor rest
He said if we could find that corpse we would be celebrated and more talked about than if we got drownded
The others got tired and give it up but not Tom Sawyer  that warnt his style
Saturday night he didnt sleep any hardly trying to think up a plan and towards daylight in the morning he struck it
He snaked me out of bed and was all excited and says Quick Huck snatch on your clothes  Ive got it
Bloodhound
In two minutes we was tearing up the river road in the dark towards the village
Old Jeff Hooker had a bloodhound and Tom was going to borrow him
I says The trails too old Tom  and besides its rained you know
It dont make any difference Huck
If the bodys hid in the woods anywhere around the hound will find it
If hes been murdered and buried they wouldnt bury him deep it aint likely and if the dog goes over the spot hell scent him sure
Huck were going to be celebrated sure as youre born
He was just ablazing and whenever he got afire he was most likely to get afire all over
That was the way this time
In two minutes he had got it all ciphered out and wasnt only just going to find the corpse  no he was going to get on the track of that murderer and hunt HIM down too and not only that but he was going to stick to him till  Well I says you better find the corpse first I reckon thats aplenty for today
For all we know there AINT any corpse and nobody haint been mur dered
That cuss could a gone off somers and not been killed at all
That graveled him and he says Huck Finn I never see such a person as you to want to spoil everything
As long as YOU cant see anything hopeful in a thing you wont let anybody else
What good can it do you to throw cold water on that corpse and get up that selfish theory that there aint been any murder
None in the world
I dont see how you can act so
I wouldnt treat you like that and you know it
Here weve got a noble good opportunity to make a ruputation and  Oh go ahead I says
Im sorry and I take it all back
I didnt mean nothing
Fix it any way you want it
HE aint any consequence to me
If hes killed Im as glad of it as you are and if he  I never said anything about being glad I only  Well then Im as SORRY as you are
Any way you druther have it that is the way I druther have it
He  There aint any druthers ABOUT it Huck Finn no body said anything about druthers
And as for  He forgot he was talking and went tramping along studying
He begun to get excited again and pretty soon he says Huck itll be the bulliest thing that ever happened if we find the body after everybody else has quit look ing and then go ahead and hunt up the murderer
It wont only be an honor to us but itll be an honor to Uncle Silas because it was us that done it
Itll set him up again you see if it dont
But Old Jeff Hooker he throwed cold water on the whole business when we got to his blacksmith shop and told him what we come for
You can take the dog he says but you aint agoing to find any corpse because there aint any corpse to find
Everybodys quit looking and theyre right
Soon as they come to think they knowed there warnt no corpse
And Ill tell you for why
What does a person kill another person for Tom Sawyer
 answer me that
Why he  er  Answer up
You aint no fool
What does he kill him FOR
Well sometimes its for revenge and  Wait
One thing at a time
Revenge says you and right you are
Now who ever had anything agin that poor trifling noaccount
Who do you reckon would want to kill HIM
 that rabbit
Tom was stuck
I reckon he hadnt thought of a person having to have a REASON for killing a person be fore and now he sees it warnt likely anybody would have that much of a grudge against a lamb like Jubiter Dunlap
The blacksmith says by and by The revenge idea wont work you see
Well then whats next
Robbery
Bgosh that must a been it Tom
Yes sirree I reckon weve struck it this time
Some feller wanted his gallusbuckles and so he  But it was so funny he busted out laughing and just went on laughing and laughing and laughing till he was most dead and Tom looked so put out and cheap that I knowed he was ashamed he had come and he wished he hadnt
But old Hooker never let up on him
He raked up everything a person ever could want to kill another person about and any fool could see they didnt any of them fit this case and he just made no end of fun of the whole business and of the people that had been hunting the body and he said If theyd had any sense theyd a knowed the lazy cuss slid out because he wanted a loafing spell after all this work
Hell come pottering back in a couple of weeks and then howll you fellers feel
But laws bless you take the dog and go and hunt his re mainders
Do Tom
Then he busted out and had another of them forty rod laughs of hisn
Tom couldnt back down after all this so he said All right unchain him and the blacksmith done it and we started home and left that old man laughing yet
It was a lovely dog
There aint any dog thats got a lovelier disposition than a bloodhound and this one knowed us and liked us
He capered and raced around ever so friendly and powerful glad to be free and have a holiday but Tom was so cut up he couldnt take any intrust in him and said he wished hed stopped and thought a minute before he ever started on such a fool errand
He said old Jeff Hooker would tell every body and wed never hear the last of it
So we loafed along home down the back lanes feel ing pretty glum and not talking
When we was pass ing the far corner of our tobacker field we heard the dog set up a long howl in there and we went to the place and he was scratching the ground with all his might and every now and then canting up his head sideways and fetching another howl
It was a long square the shape of a grave the rain had made it sink down and show the shape
The minute we come and stood there we looked at one another and never said a word
When the dog had dug down only a few inches he grabbed something and pulled it up and it was an arm and a sleeve
Tom kind of gasped out and says Come away Huck  its found
I just felt awful
We struck for the road and fetched the first men that come along
They got a spade at the crib and dug out the body and you never see such an excitement
You couldnt make anything out of the face but you didnt need to
Everybody said Poor Jubiter its his clothes to the last rag
Some rushed off to spread the news and tell the justice of the peace and have an inquest and me and Tom lit out for the house
Tom was all afire and most out of breath when we come tearing in where Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally and Benny was
Tom sung out Me and Hucks found Jubiter Dunlaps corpse all by ourselves with a bloodhound after everybody else had quit hunting and given it up and if it hadnt a been for us it never WOULD a been found and he WAS murdered too  they done it with a club or something like that and Im going to start in and find the mur derer next and I bet Ill do it
Aunt Sally and Benny sprung up pale and astonished but Uncle Silas fell right forward out of his chair on to the floor and groans out Oh my God youve found him NOW
CHAPTER X
THE ARREST OF UNCLE SILAS THEM awful words froze us solid
We couldnt move hand or foot for as much as half a minute
Then we kind of come to and lifted the old man up and got him into his chair and Benny petted him and kissed him and tried to comfort him and poor old Aunt Sally she done the same but poor things they was so broke up and scared and knocked out of their right minds that they didnt hardly know what they was about
With Tom it was awful it most petrified him to think maybe he had got his uncle into a thousand times more trouble than ever and maybe it wouldnt ever happened if he hadnt been so ambitious to get celebrated and let the corpse alone the way the others done
But pretty soon he sort of come to himself again and says Uncle Silas dont you say another word like that
Its dangerous and there aint a shadder of truth in it
Aunt Sally and Benny was thankful to hear him say that and they said the same but the old man he wagged his head sorrowful and hopeless and the tears run down his face and he says No  I done it poor Jubiter I done it
It was dreadful to hear him say it
Then he went on and told about it and said it happened the day me and Tom come  along about sundown
He said Jubiter pestered him and aggravated him till he was so mad he just sort of lost his mind and grabbed up a stick and hit him over the head with all his might and Jubiter dropped in his tracks
Then he was scared and sorry and got down on his knees and lifted his head up and begged him to speak and say he wasnt dead and before long he come to and when he see who it was holding his head he jumped like he was most scared to death and cleared the fence and tore into the woods and was gone
So he hoped he wasnt hurt bad
But laws he says it was only just fear that gave him that last little spurt of strength and of course it soon played out and he laid down in the bush and there wasnt anybody to help him and he died
Then the old man cried and grieved and said he was a murderer and the mark of Cain was on him and he had disgraced his family and was going to be found out and hung
But Tom said No you aint going to be found out
You DIDNT kill him
ONE lick wouldnt kill him
Somebody else done it
Oh yes he says I done it  nobody else
Who else had anything against him
Who else COULD have anything against him
He looked up kind of like he hoped some of us could mention somebody that could have a grudge against that harmless noaccount but of course it warnt no use  he HAD us we couldnt say a word
He noticed that and he saddened down again and I never see a face so miserable and so pitiful to see
Tom had a sudden idea and says But hold on
 somebody BURIED him
Now who  He shut off sudden
I knowed the reason
It give me the cold shudders when he said them words because right away I remembered about us seeing Uncle Silas prowling around with a longhandled shovel away in the night that night
And I knowed Benny seen him too because she was talking about it one day
The minute Tom shut off he changed the subject and went to begging Uncle Silas to keep mum and the rest of us done the same and said he MUST and said it wasnt his business to tell on himself and if he kept mum nobody would ever know but if it was found out and any harm come to him it would break the familys hearts and kill them and yet never do anybody any good
So at last he promised
We was all of us more com fortable then and went to work to cheer up the old man
We told him all hed got to do was to keep still and it wouldnt be long till the whole thing would blow over and be forgot
We all said there wouldnt any body ever suspect Uncle Silas nor ever dream of such a thing he being so good and kind and having such a good character and Tom says cordial and hearty he says Why just look at it a minute just consider
Here is Uncle Silas all these years a preacher  at his own expense all these years doing good with all his might and every way he can think of  at his own ex pense all the time always been loved by everybody and respected always been peaceable and minding his own business the very last man in this whole deestrict to touch a person and everybody knows it
Suspect HIM
Why it aint any more possible than  By authority of the State of Arkansaw I arrest you for the murder of Jubiter Dunlap
shouts the sheriff at the door
It was awful
Aunt Sally and Benny flung themselves at Uncle Silas screaming and crying and hugged him and hung to him and Aunt Sally said go away she wouldnt ever give him up they shouldnt have him and the niggers they come crowding and crying to the door and  well I couldnt stand it it was enough to break a persons heart so I got out
They took him up to the little onehorse jail in the village and we all went along to tell him goodbye and Tom was feeling elegant and says to me Well have a most noble good time and heaps of danger some dark night getting him out of there Huck and itll be talked about everywheres and we will be celebrated but the old man busted that scheme up the minute he whispered to him about it
He said no it was his duty to stand whatever the law done to him and he would stick to the jail plumb through to the end even if there warnt no door to it
It disappointed Tom and graveled him a good deal but he had to put up with it
But he felt responsible and bound to get his uncle Silas free and he told Aunt Sally the last thing not to worry because he was going to turn in and work night and day and beat this game and fetch Uncle Silas out innocent and she was very loving to him and thanked him and said she knowed he would do his very best
And she told us to help Benny take care of the house and the children and then we had a goodbye cry all around and went back to the farm and left her there to live with the jailers wife a month till the trial in October
CHAPTER XI
TOM SAWYER DISCOVERS THE MURDERERS WELL that was a hard month on us all
Poor Benny she kept up the best she could and me and Tom tried to keep things cheerful there at the house but it kind of went for nothing as you may say
It was the same up at the jail
We went up every day to see the old people but it was awful dreary because the old man warnt sleeping much and was walking in his sleep considerable and so he got to looking fagged and miserable and his mind got shaky and we all got afraid his troubles would break him down and kill him
And whenever we tried to persuade him to feel cheer fuler he only shook his head and said if we only knowed what it was to carry around a murderers load in your heart we wouldnt talk that way
Tom and all of us kept telling him it WASNT murder but just acci dental killing
but it never made any difference  it was murder and he wouldnt have it any other way
He actuly begun to come out plain and square towards trial time and acknowledge that he TRIED to kill the man
Why that was awful you know
It made things seem fifty times as dreadful and there warnt no more com fort for Aunt Sally and Benny
But he promised he wouldnt say a word about his murder when others was around and we was glad of that
Tom Sawyer racked the head off of himself all that month trying to plan some way out for Uncle Silas and manys the night he kept me up most all night with this kind of tiresome work but he couldnt seem to get on the right track no way
As for me I reckoned a body might as well give it up it all looked so blue and I was so downhearted but he wouldnt
He stuck to the business right along and went on planning and thinking and ransacking his head
So at last the trial come on towards the middle of October and we was all in the court
The place was jammed of course
Poor old Uncle Silas he looked more like a dead person than a live one his eyes was so hollow and he looked so thin and so mournful
Benny she set on one side of him and Aunt Sally on the other and they had veils on and was full of trouble
But Tom he set by our lawyer and had his finger in every wheres of course
The lawyer let him and the judge let him
He most took the business out of the law yers hands sometimes which was well enough be cause that was only a mudturtle of a backsettlement lawyer and didnt know enough to come in when it rains as the saying is
They swore in the jury and then the lawyer for the prostitution got up and begun
He made a terrible speech against the old man that made him moan and groan and made Benny and Aunt Sally cry
The way HE told about the murder kind of knocked us all stupid it was so different from the old mans tale
He said he was going to prove that Uncle Silas was SEEN to kill Jubiter Dunlap by two good witnesses and done it deliberate and SAID he was going to kill him the very minute he hit him with the club and they seen him hide Jubiter in the bushes and they seen that Jubiter was stonedead
And said Uncle Silas come later and lugged Jubiter down into the tobacker field and two men seen him do it
And said Uncle Silas turned out away in the night and buried Jubiter and a man seen him at it
I says to myself poor old Uncle Silas has been lying about it because he reckoned nobody seen him and he couldnt bear to break Aunt Sallys heart and Bennys and right he was as for me I would a lied the same way and so would anybody that had any feeling to save them such misery and sorrow which THEY warnt no ways responsible for
Well it made our lawyer look pretty sick and it knocked Tom silly too for a little spell but then he braced up and let on that he warnt worried  but I knowed he WAS all the same
And the people  my but it made a stir amongst them
And when that lawyer was done telling the jury what he was going to prove he set down and begun to work his witnesses
First he called a lot of them to show that there was bad blood betwixt Uncle Silas and the diseased and they told how they had heard Uncle Silas threaten the diseased at one time and another and how it got worse and worse and everybody was talking about it and how diseased got afraid of his life and told two or three of them he was certain Uncle Silas would up and kill him some time or another
Tom and our lawyer asked them some questions but it warnt no use they stuck to what they said
Next they called up Lem Beebe and he took the stand
It come into my mind then how Lem and Jim Lane had come along talking that time about borrow ing a dog or something from Jubiter Dunlap and that brought up the blackberries and the lantern and that brought up Bill and Jack Withers and how they passed by talking about a nigger stealing Uncle Silass corn and that fetched up our old ghost that come along about the same time and scared us so  and here HE was too and a privileged character on accounts of his being deef and dumb and a stranger and they had fixed him a chair inside the railing where he could cross his legs and be comfortable whilst the other people was all in a jam so they couldnt hardly breathe
So it all come back to me just the way it was that day and it made me mournful to think how pleasant it was up to then and how miserable ever since
LEM BEEBE sworn said  I was acoming along that day second of September and Jim Lane was with me and it was towards sundown and we heard loud talk like quarrelling and we was very close only the hazel bushes between thats along the fence and we heard a voice say Ive told you moren once Id kill you and knowed it was this prisoners voice and then we see a club come up above the bushes and down out of sight again
and heard a smashing thump and then a groan or two and then we crope soft to where we could see and there laid Jupiter Dunlap dead and this prisoner standing over him with the club and the next he hauled the dead man into a clump of bushes and hid him and then we stooped low to be cut of sight and got away
Well it was awful
It kind of froze everybodys blood to hear it and the house was most as still whilst he was telling it as if there warnt nobody in it
And when he was done you could hear them gasp and sigh all over the house and look at one another the same as to say Aint it perfectly terrible  aint it awful
Now happened a thing that astonished me
All the time the first witnesses was proving the bad blood and the threats and all that Tom Sawyer was alive and lay ing for them and the minute they was through he went for them and done his level best to catch them in lies and spile their testimony
But now how different
When Lem first begun to talk and never said anything about speaking to Jubiter or trying to borrow a dog off of him he was all alive and laying for Lem and you could see he was getting ready to crossquestion him to death pretty soon and then I judged him and me would go on the stand by and by and tell what we heard him and Jim Lane say
But the next time I looked at Tom I got the cold shivers
Why he was in the brownest study you ever see  miles and miles away
He warnt hearing a word Lem Beebe was saying and when he got through he was still in that brownstudy just the same
Our lawyer joggled him and then he looked up startled and says Take the witness if you want him
Lemme alone  I want to think
Well that beat me
I couldnt understand it
And Benny and her mother  oh they looked sick they was so troubled
They shoved their veils to one side and tried to get his eye but it warnt any use and I couldnt get his eye either
So the mudturtle he tackled the witness but it didnt amount to nothing and he made a mess of it
Then they called up Jim Lane and he told the very same story over again exact
Tom never listened to this one at all but set there thinking and thinking miles and miles away
So the mudturtle went in alone again and come out just as flat as he done before
The lawyer for the prostitution looked very comfortable but the judge looked disgusted
You see Tom was just the same as a regular lawyer nearly because it was Arkansaw law for a prisoner to choose anybody he wanted to help his lawyer and Tom had had Uncle Silas shove him into the case and now he was botching it and you could see the judge didnt like it much
All that the mudturtle got out of Lem and Jim was this he asked them Why didnt you go and tell what you saw
We was afraid we would get mixed up in it our selves
And we was just starting down the river ahunting for all the week besides but as soon as we come back we found out theyd been searching for the body so then we went and told Brace Dunlap all about it
When was that
Saturday night September 9th
The judge he spoke up and says Mr Sheriff arrest these two witnesses on suspicions of being accessionary after the fact to the murder
The lawyer for the prostitution jumps up all excited and says Your honor
I protest against this extraordi  Set down
says the judge pulling his bowie and laying it on his pulpit
I beg you to respect the Court
So he done it
Then he called Bill Withers
BILL WITHERS sworn said I was coming along about sundown Saturday September 2d by the prisoners field and my brother Jack was with me and we seen a man toting off something heavy on his back and allowed it was a nigger stealing corn we couldnt see distinct next we made out that it was one man carrying another and the way it hung so kind of limp we judged it was somebody that was drunk and by the mans walk we said it was Parson Silas and we judged he had found Sam Cooper drunk in the road which he was always trying to reform him and was toting him out of danger
It made the people shiver to think of poor old Uncle Silas toting off the diseased down to the place in his tobacker field where the dog dug up the body but there warnt much sympathy around amongst the faces and I heard one cuss say Tis the coldest blooded work I ever struck lugging a murdered man around like that and going to bury him like a animal and him a preacher at that
Tom he went on thinking and never took no notice so our lawyer took the witness and done the best he could and it was plenty poor enough
Then Jack Withers he come on the stand and told the same tale just like Bill done
And after him comes Brace Dunlap and he was look ing very mournful and most crying and there was a rustle and a stir all around and everybody got ready to listen and lost of the women folks said Poor cretur poor cretur and you could see a many of them wip ing their eyes
BRACE DUNLAP sworn said I was in considerable trouble a long time about my poor brother but I reckoned things warnt near so bad as he made out and I couldnt make myself believe anybody would have the heart to hurt a poor harmless cretur like that  by jings I was sure I seen Tom give a kind of a faint little start and then look disappointed again  and you know I COULDNT think a preacher would hurt him  it warnt natural to think such an onlikely thing  so I never paid much attention and now I shant ever ever forgive myself for if I had a done different my poor brother would be with me this day and not laying yonder murdered and him so harmless
He kind of broke down there and choked up and waited to get his voice and people all around said the most pitiful things and women cried and it was very still in there and solemn and old Uncle Silas poor thing he give a groan right out so everybody heard him
Then Brace he went on Saturday September 2d he didnt come home to supper
Byandby I got a little uneasy and one of my niggers went over to this prisoners place but come back and said he warnt there
So I got uneasier and uneasier and couldnt rest
I went to bed but I couldnt sleep and turned out away late in the night and went wandering over to this prisoners place and all around about there a good while hoping I would run across my poor brother and never knowing he was out of his troubles and gone to a better shore  So he broke down and choked up again and most all the women was crying now
Pretty soon he got another start and says But it warnt no use so at last I went home and tried to get some sleep but couldnt
Well in a day or two everybody was uneasy and they got to talking about this prisoners threats and took to the idea which I didnt take no stock in that my brother was murdered so they hunted around and tried to find his body but couldnt and give it up
And so I reckoned he was gone off somers to have a little peace and would come back to us when his troubles was kind of healed
But late Saturday night the 9th Lem Beebe and Jim Lane come to my house and told me all  told me the whole awful sassination and my heart was broke
And THEN I remembered something that hadnt took no hold of me at the time because reports said this prisoner had took to walking in his sleep and doing all kind of things of no consequence not knowing what he was about
I will tell you what that thing was that come back into my memory
Away late that awful Saturday night when I was wandering around about this prisoners place grieving and troubled I was down by the corner of the tobacker field and I heard a sound like digging in a gritty soil and I crope nearer and peeped through the vines that hung on the rail fence and seen this prisoner SHOVELING  shoveling with a longhandled shovel  heaving earth into a big hole that was most filled up his back was to me but it was bright moonlight and I knowed him by his old green baize workgown with a splattery white patch in the middle of the back like somebody had hit him with a snowball
HE WAS BURYING THE MAN HED MURDERED
And he slumped down in his chair crying and sob bing and most everybody in the house busted out wailing and crying and saying Oh its awful  awful  horrible
and there was a most tremendous ex citement and you couldnt hear yourself think and right in the midst of it up jumps old Uncle Silas white as a sheet and sings out ITS TRUE EVERY WORD  I MURDERED HIM IN COLD BLOOD
By Jackson it petrified them
People rose up wild all over the house straining and staring for a better look at him and the judge was hammering with his mallet and the sheriff yelling Order  order in the court  order
And all the while the old man stood there aquaking and his eyes aburning and not looking at his wife and daughter which was clinging to him and begging him to keep still but pawing them off with his hands and saying he WOULD clear his black soul from crime he WOULD heave off this load that was more than he could bear and he WOULDNT bear it another hour
And then he raged right along with his awful tale every body astaring and gasping judge jury lawyers and everybody and Benny and Aunt Sally crying their hearts out
And by George Tom Sawyer never looked at him once
Never once  just set there gazing with all his eyes at something else I couldnt tell what
And so the old man raged right along pouring his words out like a stream of fire I killed him
I am guilty
But I never had the notion in my life to hurt him or harm him spite of all them lies about my threatening him till the very minute I raised the club  then my heart went cold
 then the pity all went out of it and I struck to kill
In that one moment all my wrongs come into my mind all the insults that that man and the scoundrel his brother there had put upon me and how they laid in together to ruin me with the people and take away my good name and DRIVE me to some deed that would destroy me and my family that hadnt ever done THEM no harm so help me God
And they done it in a mean revenge  for why
Because my innocent pure girl here at my side wouldnt marry that rich insolent ignorant coward Brace Dunlap whos been sniveling here over a brother he never cared a brass farthing for  I see Tom give a jump and look glad THIS time to a dead certainty  and in that moment Ive told you about I forgot my God and remembered only my hearts bitterness God forgive me and I struck to kill
In one second I was miserably sorry  oh filled with remorse but I thought of my poor family and I MUST hide what Id done for their sakes and I did hide that corpse in the bushes and presently I carried it to the tobacker field and in the deep night I went with my shovel and buried it where  Up jumps Tom and shouts NOW Ive got it
and waves his hand oh ever so fine and starchy towards the old man and says Set down
A murder WAS done but you never had no hand in it
Well sir you could a heard a pin drop
And the old man he sunk down kind of bewildered in his seat and Aunt Sally and Benny didnt know it because they was so astonished and staring at Tom with their mouths open and not knowing what they was about
And the whole house the same
I never seen people look so helpless and tangled up and I haint ever seen eyes bug out and gaze without a blink the way theirn did
Tom says perfectly cam Your honor may I speak
For Gods sake yes  go on
says the judge so astonished and mixed up he didnt know what he was about hardly
Then Tom he stood there and waited a second or two  that was for to work up an effect as he calls it  then he started in just as cam as ever and says For about two weeks now theres been a little bill sticking on the front of this courthouse offering two thousand dollars reward for a couple of big dimonds  stole at St Louis
Them dimonds is worth twelve thousand dollars
But never mind about that till I get to it
Now about this murder
I will tell you all about it  how it happened  who done it  every DEtail
You could see everybody nestle now and begin to listen for all they was worth
This man here Brace Dunlap thats been sniveling so about his dead brother that YOU know he never cared a straw for wanted to marry that young girl there and she wouldnt have him
So he told Uncle Silas he would make him sorry
Uncle Silas knowed how powerful he was and how little chance he had against such a man and he was scared and worried and done everything he could think of to smooth him over and get him to be good to him he even took his no account brother Jubiter on the farm and give him wages and stinted his own family to pay them and Jubiter done everything his brother could contrive to insult Uncle Silas and fret and worry him and try to drive Uncle Silas into doing him a hurt so as to injure Uncle Silas with the people
And it done it
Everybody turned against him and said the meanest kind of things about him and it graduly broke his heart  yes and he was so worried and distressed that often he warnt hardly in his right mind
Well on that Saturday that weve had so much trouble about two of these witnesses here Lem Beebe and Jim Lane come along by where Uncle Silas and Jubiter Dunlap was at work  and that much of what theyve said is true the rest is lies
They didnt hear Uncle Silas say he would kill Jubiter they didnt hear no blow struck they didnt see no dead man and they didnt see Uncle Silas hide anything in the bushes
Look at them now  how they set there wishing they hadnt been so handy with their tongues anyway theyll wish it before I get done
That same Saturday evening Bill and Jack Withers DID see one man lugging off another one
That much of what they said is true and the rest is lies
First off they thought it was a nigger stealing Uncle Silass corn  you notice it makes them look silly now to find out somebody overheard them say that
Thats because they found out by and by who it was that was doing the lugging and THEY know best why they swore here that they took it for Uncle Silas by the gait  which it WASNT and they knowed it when they swore to that lie
A man out in the moonlight DID see a murdered person put under ground in the tobacker field  but it wasnt Uncle Silas that done the burying
He was in his bed at that very time
Now then before I go on I want to ask you if youve ever noticed this that people when theyre thinking deep or when theyre worried are most always doing something with their hands and they dont know it and dont notice what it is their hands are doing
some stroke their chins some stroke their noses some stroke up UNDER their chin with their hand some twirl a chain some fumble a button then theres some that draws a figure or a letter with their finger on their cheek or under their chin or on their under lip
Thats MY way
When Im restless or worried or thinking hard I draw capital Vs on my cheek or on my under lip or under my chin and never anything BUT capital Vs  and half the time I dont notice it and dont know Im doing it
That was odd
That is just what I do only I make an O
And I could see people nodding to one another same as they do when they mean THATs so
Now then Ill go on
That same Saturday  no it was the night before  there was a steamboat laying at Flaglers Landing forty miles above here and it was raining and storming like the nation
And there was a thief aboard and he had them two big dimonds thats advertised out here on this courthouse door and he slipped ashore with his handbag and struck out into the dark and the storm and he was ahoping he could get to this town all right and be safe
But he had two pals aboard the boat hiding and he knowed they was going to kill him the first chance they got and take the dimonds because all three stole them and then this fellow he got hold of them and skipped
Well he hadnt been gone moren ten minutes be fore his pals found it out and they jumped ashore and lit out after him
Probly they burnt matches and found his tracks
Anyway they dogged along after him all day Saturday and kept out of his sight and towards sundown he come to the bunch of sycamores down by Uncle Silass field and he went in there to get a disguise out of his handbag and put it on before he showed himself here in the town  and mind you he done that just a little after the time that Uncle Silas was hitting Jubiter Dunlap over the head with a club  for he DID hit him
But the minute the pals see that thief slide into the bunch of sycamores they jumped out of the bushes and slid in after him
They fell on him and clubbed him to death
Yes for all he screamed and howled so they never had no mercy on him but clubbed him to death
And two men that was running along the road heard him yelling that way and they made a rush into the syca i more bunch  which was where they was bound for anyway  and when the pals saw them they lit out and the two new men after them achasing them as tight as they could go
But only a minute or two  then these two new men slipped back very quiet into the syca mores
THEN what did they do
I will tell you what they done
They found where the thief had got his disguise out of his carpetsack to put on so one of them strips and puts on that disguise
Tom waited a little here for some more effect  then he says very deliberate The man that put on that dead mans disguise was  JUBITER DUNLAP
Great Scott
everybody shouted all over the house and old Uncle Silas he looked perfectly astonished
Yes it was Jubiter Dunlap
Not dead you see
Then they pulled off the dead mans boots and put Jubiter Dunlaps old ragged shoes on the corpse and put the corpses boots on Jubiter Dunlap
Then Jubiter Dunlap stayed where he was and the other man lugged the dead body off in the twilight and after midnight he went to Uncle Silass house and took his old green workrobe off of the peg where it always hangs in the passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and put it on and stole the longhandled shovel and went off down into the tobacker field and buried the murdered man
He stopped and stood half a minute
Then  And who do you reckon the murdered man WAS
It was  JAKE Dunlap the longlost burglar
Great Scott
And the man that buried him was  BRACE Dunlap his brother
Great Scott
And who do you reckon is this mowing idiot here thats letting on all these weeks to be a deef and dumb stranger
Its  JUBITER Dunlap
My land they all busted out in a howl and you never see the like of that excitement since the day you was born
And Tom he made a jump for Jubiter and snaked off his goggles and his false whiskers and there was the murdered man sure enough just as alive as anybody
And Aunt Sally and Benny they went to hugging and crying and kissing and smothering old Uncle Silas to that degree he was more muddled and confused and mushed up in his mind than he ever was before and that is saying considerable
And next people begun to yell Tom Sawyer
Tom Sawyer
Shut up every body and let him go on
Go on Tom Sawyer
Which made him feel uncommon bully for it was nuts for Tom Sawyer to be a public character that away and a hero as he calls it
So when it was all quiet he says There aint much left only this
When that man there Bruce Dunlap had most worried the life and sense out of Uncle Silas till at last he plumb lost his mind and hit this other blatherskite his brother with a club I reckon he seen his chance
Jubiter broke for the woods to hide and I reckon the game was for him to slide out in the night and leave the country
Then Brace would make everybody believe Uncle Silas killed him and hid his body somers and that would ruin Uncle Silas and drive HIM out of the country  hang him maybe I dunno
But when they found their dead brother in the sycamores without knowing him because he was so battered up they see they had a better thing disguise BOTH and bury Jake and dig him up presently all dressed up in Jubiters clothes and hire Jim Lane and Bill Withers and the others to swear to some handy lies  which they done
And there they set now and I told them they would be looking sick before I got done and that is the way theyre looking now
Well me and Huck Finn here we come down on the boat with the thieves and the dead one told us all about the dimonds and said the others would murder him if they got the chance and we was going to help him all we could
We was bound for the sycamores when we heard them killing him in there but we was in there in the early morning after the storm and allowed nobody hadnt been killed after all
And when we see Jubiter Dunlap here spreading around in the very same disguise Jake told us HE was going to wear we thought it was Jake his own self  and he was googooing deef and dumb and THAT was according to agreement
Well me and Huck went on hunting for the corpse after the others quit and we found it
And was proud too but Uncle Silas he knocked us crazy by telling us HE killed the man
So we was mighty sorry we found the body and was bound to save Uncle Silass neck if we could and it was going to be tough work too because he wouldnt let us break him out of prison the way we done with our old nigger Jim
I done everything I could the whole month to think up some way to save Uncle Silas but I couldnt strike a thing
So when we come into court today I come empty and couldnt see no chance anywheres
But by and by I had a glimpse of something that set me thinking  just a little wee glimpse  only that and not enough to make sure but it set me thinking hard  and WATCHING when I was only letting on to think and by and by sure enough when Uncle Silas was pil ing out that stuff about HIM killing Jubiter Dunlap I catched that glimpse again and this time I jumped up and shut down the proceedings because I KNOWED Jubiter Dunlap was asetting here before me
I knowed him by a thing which I seen him do  and I remem bered it
Id seen him do it when I was here a year ago
He stopped then and studied a minute  laying for an effect  I knowed it perfectly well
Then he turned off like he was going to leave the platform and says kind of lazy and indifferent Well I believe that is all
Why you never heard such a howl
 and it come from the whole house What WAS it you seen him do
Stay where you are you little devil
You think you are going to work a body up till his mouths awatering and stop there
What WAS it he done
That was it you see  he just done it to get an effect  you couldnt a pulled him off of that plat form with a yoke of oxen
Oh it wasnt anything much he says
I seen him looking a little excited when he found Uncle Silas was actuly fixing to hang himself for a murder that warnt ever done and he got more and more nervous and worried I awatching him sharp but not seeming to look at him  and all of a sudden his hands begun to work and fidget and pretty soon his left crept up and HIS FINGER DRAWED A CROSS ON HIS CHEEK and then I HAD him
Well then they ripped and howled and stomped and clapped their hands till Tom Sawyer was that proud and happy he didnt know what to do with him self
And then the judge he looked down over his pulpit and says My boy did you SEE all the various details of this strange conspiracy and tragedy that youve been de scribing
No your honor I didnt see any of them
Didnt see any of them
Why youve told the whole history straight through just the same as if youd seen it with your eyes
How did you manage that
Tom says kind of easy and comfortable Oh just noticing the evidence and piecing this and that together your honor just an ordinary little bit of detective work anybody could a done it
Nothing of the kind
Not two in a million could a done it
You are a very remarkable boy
Then they let go and give Tom another smashing round and he  well he wouldnt a sold out for a silver mine
Then the judge says But are you certain youve got this curious history straight
Perfectly your honor
Here is Brace Dunlap  let him deny his share of it if he wants to take the chance Ill engage to make him wish he hadnt said anything Well you see HES pretty quiet
And his brothers pretty quiet and them four witnesses that lied so and got paid for it theyre pretty quiet
And as for Uncle Silas it aint any use for him to put in his oar I wouldnt believe him under oath
Well sir that fairly made them shout and even the judge he let go and laughed
Tom he was just feeling like a rainbow
When they was done laughing he looks up at the judge and says Your honor theres a thief in this house
A thief
Yes sir
And hes got them twelvethousand dollar dimonds on him
By gracious but it made a stir
Everybody went shouting Which is him
which is him
pint him out
And the judge says Point him out my lad
Sheriff you will arrest him
Which one is it
Tom says This late dead man here  Jubiter Dunlap
Then there was another thundering letgo of astonish ment and excitement but Jubiter which was astonished enough before was just fairly putrified with astonish ment this time
And he spoke up about half crying and says Now THATS a lie
Your honor it aint fair Im plenty bad enough without that
I done the other things  Brace he put me up to it and persuaded me and promised hed make me rich some day and I done it and Im sorry I done it and I wisht I hadnt but I haint stole no dimonds and I haint GOT no dimonds I wisht I may never stir if it aint so
The sheriff can search me and see
Tom says Your honor it wasnt right to call him a thief and Ill let up on that a little
He did steal the dimonds but he didnt know it
He stole them from his brother Jake when he was laying dead after Jake had stole them from the other thieves but Jubiter didnt know he was stealing them and hes been swelling around here with them a month yes sir twelve thousand dollars worth of dimonds on him  all that riches and going around here every day just like a poor man
Yes your honor hes got them on him now
The judge spoke up and says Search him sheriff
Well sir the sheriff he ransacked him high and low and everywhere searched his hat socks seams boots everything  and Tom he stood there quiet laying for another of them effects of hisn
Finally the sheriff he give it up and everybody looked disappointed and Jubiter says There now
whatd I tell you
And the judge says It appears you were mistaken this time my boy
Then Tom took an attitude and let on to be studying with all his might and scratching his head
Then all of a sudden he glanced up chipper and says Oh now Ive got it 
Id forgot
Which was a lie and I knowed it
Then he says Will somebody be good enough to lend me a little small screwdriver
There was one in your brothers handbag that you smouched Jubiter
but I reckon you didnt fetch it with you
No I didnt
I didnt want it and I give it away
Thats because you didnt know what it was for
Jubiter had his boots on again by now and when the thing Tom wanted was passed over the peoples heads till it got to him he says to Jubiter Put up your foot on this chair
And he kneeled down and begun to unscrew the heelplate everybody watching and when he got that big dimond out of that bootheel and held it up and let it flash and blaze and squirt sunlight everwhichaway it just took every bodys breath and Jubiter he looked so sick and sorry you never see the like of it
And when Tom held up the other dimond he looked sorrier than ever
Land
he was thinking how he would a skipped out and been rich and independent in a foreign land if hed only had the luck to guess what the screwdriver was in the carpetbag for
Well it was a most exciting time take it all around and Tom got cords of glory
The judge took the dimonds and stood up in his pulpit and cleared his throat and shoved his spectacles back on his head and says Ill keep them and notify the owners and when they send for them it will be a real pleasure to me to hand you the two thousand dollars for youve earned the money  yes and youve earned the deepest and most sincerest thanks of this community besides for lifting a wronged and innocent family out of ruin and shame and saving a good and honorable man from a felons death and for exposing to infamy and the pun ishment of the law a cruel and odious scoundrel and his miserable creatures
Well sir if thered been a brass band to bust out some music then it would a been just the perfectest thing I ever see and Tom Sawyer he said the same
Then the sheriff he nabbed Brace Dunlap and his crowd and by and by next month the judge had them up for trial and jailed the whole lot
And everybody crowded back to Uncle Silass little old church and was ever so loving and kind to him and the family and couldnt do enough for them and Uncle Silas he preached them the blamedest jumbledest idiotic sermons you ever struck and would tangle you up so you couldnt find your way home in daylight but the peo ple never let on but what they thought it was the clear est and brightest and elegantest sermons that ever was and they would set there and cry for love and pity but by George they give me the jimjams and the fan tods and caked up what brains I had and turned them solid but by and by they loved the old mans intellects back into him again and he was as sound in his skull as ever he was which aint no flattery I reckon
And so the whole family was as happy as birds and nobody could be gratefuler and lovinger than what they was to Tom Sawyer and the same to me though I hadnt done nothing
And when the two thousand dollars come Tom give half of it to me and never told any body so which didnt surprise me because I knowed him
END OF TOM SAWYER DETECTIVE
