SUSAN LENOX HER RISE AND FALL by David Graham Phillips Volume I DAVID GRAHAM PHILLIPS A TRIBUTE Even now I cannot realize that he is dead and often in the city streetson Fifth Avenue in particularI find myself glancing ahead for a glimpse of the tall boyish familiar figureexperience once again a flash of the old happy expectancy
I have lived in many lands and have known men
I never knew a finer man than Graham Phillips
His were the clearest bluest most honest eyes I ever saweyes that scorned untrutheyes that penetrated all sham
In repose his handsome features were a trifle sternand the magic of his smile was the more wonderfulsuch a sunny youthful engaging smile
His mere presence in a room was exhilarating
It seemed to freshen the very air with a keen sweetness almost pungent
He was tall spare leisurely ironstrong yet figure features and bearing were delightfully boyish
Men liked him women liked him when he liked them
He was the most honest man I ever knew clean in mind cleancut in body a little overserious perhaps except when among intimates a little prone to hoist the burdens of the world on his young shoulders
His was a knightly mind a paladin character
But he could unbend and the memory of such hours with himhours that can never be againhurts more keenly than the memory of calmer and more sober moments
We agreed in many matters he and I in many we differed
To me it was a greater honor to differ in opinion with such a man than to find an entire synod of my own mind
Becauseand of course this is the opinion of one man and worth no more than thatI have always thought that Graham Phillips was head and shoulders above us all in his profession
He was to have been really great
He isby his last book Susan Lenox
Not that when he sometimes discussed the writing of it with me I was in sympathy with it
I was not
We always were truthful to each other
But when a giant molds a lump of clay into tremendous masses lesser men become confused by the huge contours the vast distances the terrific spaces the majestic scope of the ensemble
So I
But he went on about his business
I do not know what the public may think of Susan Lenox
I scarcely know what I think
It is a terrible bookterrible and true and beautiful
Under the depths there are unspeakable things that writhe
His plumbline touches them and they squirm
He bends his head from the clouds to do it
Is it worth doing
I dont know
But this I do knowthat within the range of all fiction of all lands and of all times no character has so overwhelmed me as the character of Susan Lenox
She is as real as life and as unreal
She is Life
Hers was the concentrated nobility of Heaven and Hell
And the divinity of the one and the tragedy of the other
For she had known boththis girlthe most pathetic the most human the most honest character ever drawn by an American writer
In the presence of his last work so overwhelming so stupendous we lesser men are left at a loss
Its magnitude demands the perspective that time only can lend it
Its dignity and austerity and its pitiless truth impose upon us that honest and intelligent silence which even the quickest minds concede is necessary before an honest verdict
Truth was his goddess he wrought honestly and only for her
He is dead but he is to have his day in court
And whatever the verdict if it be a true one were he living he would rest content
ROBERT W CHAMBERS
BEFORE THE CURTAIN A few years ago as to the most important and most interesting subject in the world the relations of the sexes an author had to choose between silence and telling those distorted truths beside which plain lying seems almost white and quite harmless
And as no author could afford to be silent on the subject that underlies all subjects our literature in so far as it attempted to deal with the most vital phases of human nature was beneath contempt
The authors who knew they were lying sank almost as low as the nastynice purveyors of fake idealism and candied pruriency who fancied they were writing the truth
Now it almost seems that the day of lying conscious and unconscious is about run
And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
There are three ways of dealing with the sex relations of men and womentwo wrong and one right
For lack of more accurate names the two wrong ways may be called respectively the AngloSaxon and the Continental
Both are in essence processes of spicing up and coloring up perfectly innocuous facts of nature to make them poisonously attractive to perverted palates
The wishywashy literature and the wishywashy morality on which it is based are not one stage moreor lessrotten than the libertine literature and the libertine morality on which it is based
So far as degrading effect is concerned the pure sweet story or play false to nature false to true morality propagandist of indecent emotions disguised as idealism need yield nothing to the socalled strong story
Both pander to different forms of the same diseased craving for the unnatural
Both produce moral atrophy
The one tends to encourage the shallow and unthinking in ignorance of life and so causes them to suffer the merciless penalties of ignorance
The other tends to miseducate the shallow and unthinking to give them a ruinously false notion of the delights of vice
The AngloSaxon morality is like a nude figure salaciously draped the Continental strength is like a nude figure salaciously distorted
The AngloSaxon article reeks the stench of disinfectants the Continental reeks the stench of degenerate perfume
The Continental shouts Hypocrisy
at the AngloSaxon the AngloSaxon shouts Filthiness
at the Continental
Both are right they are twin sisters of the same horrid mother
And an author of either allegiance has to have many a redeeming grace of style of character drawing of philosophy to gain him tolerance in a clean mind
There is the third and right way of dealing with the sex relations of men and women
That is the way of simple candor and naturalness
Treat the sex question as you would any other question
Dont treat it reverently dont treat it rakishly
Treat it naturally
Dont insult your intelligence and lower your moral tone by thinking about either the decency or the indecency of matters that are familiar undeniable and unchangeable facts of life
Dont look on woman as mere female but as human being
Remember that she has a mind and a heart as well as a body
In a sentence dont join in the prurient clamor of purity hypocrites and strong libertines that exaggerates and distorts the most commonplace if the most important feature of life
Let us try to be as sensible about sex as we are trying to be about all the other phenomena of the universe in this more enlightened day
Nothing so sweetens a sin or so delights a sinner as getting bigeyed about it and him
Those of us who are naughty arent nearly so naughty as we like to think nor are those of us who are nice nearly so nice
Our virtues and our failings areperhaps to an unsuspected degreethe result of the circumstances in which we are placed
The way to improve individuals is to improve these circumstances and the way to start at improving the circumstances is by looking honestly and fearlessly at things as they are
We must know our world and ourselves before we can know what should be kept and what changed
And the beginning of this wisdom is in seeing sex relations rationally
Until that fundamental matter is brought under the sway of good common sense improvement in other directions will be slow indeed
Let us stop lyingto othersto ourselves

SUSAN LENOX CHAPTER I THE childs dead said Nora the nurse
It was the upstairs sittingroom in one of the pretentious houses of Sutherland oldest and most charming of the towns on the Indiana bank of the Ohio
The two big windows were open their limp and listless draperies showed that there was not the least motion in the stifling humid air of the July afternoon
At the center of the room stood an oblong table over it were neatly spread several thicknesses of white cotton cloth naked upon them lay the body of a newborn girl baby
At one side of the table nearer the window stood Nora
Hers were the hard features and corrugated skin popularly regarded as the result of a life of toil but in fact the result of a life of defiance to the laws of health
As additional penalties for that same selfindulgence she had an enormous bust and hips thin face and arms hollow sinewstriped neck
The young man blond and smooth faced at the other side of the table and facing the light was Doctor Stevens a recently graduated pupil of the famous Schulze of Saint Christopher who as much as any other one man is responsible for the rejection of hocuspocus and the injection of common sense into American medicine
For upwards of an hour young Stevens coat off and shirt sleeves rolled to his shoulders had been toiling with the lifeless form on the table
He had tried everything his training his reading and his experience suggestedall the more or less familiar devices similar to those indicated for cases of drowning
Nora had watched him at first with interest and hope then with interest alone finally with swiftly deepening disapproval as her compressed lips and angry eyes plainly revealed
It seemed to her his effort was degenerating into sacrilege into defiance of an obvious decree of the Almighty
However she had not ventured to speak until the young man with a muttered ejaculation suspiciously like an imprecation straightened his stocky figure and began to mop the sweat from his face hands and bared arms
When she saw that her verdict had not been heard she repeated it more emphatically
The childs dead said she as I told you from the setout
She made the sign of the cross on her forehead and bosom while her fat dry lips moved in a Hail Mary
The young man did not rouse from his reverie
He continued to gaze with a baffled expression at the tiny form so like a whimsical caricature of humanity
He showed that he had heard the womans remark by saying to himself rather than to her Dead
Whats that
Merely another name for ignorance
But the current of his thought did not swerve
It held to the one course What would his master the dauntless the infinitely resourceful Schulze do if he were confronted by this intolerable obstacle of a perfect machine refusing to do its duty and pump vital force through an eagerly waiting body
Hed make it go Id bet my life the young man muttered
Im ashamed of myself
As if the reproach were just the spur his courage and his intelligence had needed his face suddenly glowed with the upshooting fire of an inspiration
He thrust the big white handkerchief into his hip pocket laid one large strong hand upon the small beautifully arched chest of the baby
Nora roused by his expression even more than by his gesture gave an exclamation of horror
Dont touch it again she cried between entreaty and command
Youve done all you canand more
Stevens was not listening
Such a fine baby too he said hesitatingthe old woman mistakenly fancied it was her words that made him pause
I feel no good at all he went on as if reasoning with himself no good at all losing both the mother and the child
She didnt want to live replied Nora
Her glances stole somewhat fearfully toward the door of the adjoining roomthe bedroom where the mother lay dead
There wasnt nothing but disgrace ahead for both of them
Everybodyll be glad
Such a fine baby muttered the abstracted young doctor
Lovechildren always is said Nora
She was looking sadly and tenderly down at the tiny symmetrical formsymmetrical to her and the doctors expert eyes
Such a deep chest she sighed
Such pretty hands and feet
A real lovechild
There she glanced nervously at the doctor it was meet and proper and pious to speak well of the dead but she felt she might be going rather far for a good woman
Ill try it cried the young man in a resolute tone
It cant do any harm and Without finishing his sentence he laid hold of the body by the ankles swung it clear of the table
As Nora saw it dangling head downwards like a dressed suckling pig on a butchers hook she vented a scream and darted round the table to stop by main force this revolting desecration of the dead
Stevens called out sternly Mind your business Nora
Push the table against the wall and get out of the way
I want all the room there is
Oh Doctorfor the blessed Jesus sake Push back that table
Nora shrank before his fierce eyes
She thought his exertions his disappointment and the heat had combined to topple him over into insanity
She retreated toward the farther of the open windows
With a curse at her stupidity Stevens kicked over the table used his foot vigorously in thrusting it to the wall
Now
exclaimed he taking his stand in the center of the room and gauging the distance of ceiling floor and walls
Nora her back against the window frame her fingers sunk in her big loose bosom stared petrified
Stevens like an athlete swinging an indian club whirled the body round and round his head at the full length of his powerful arms
More and more rapidly he swung it until his breath came and went in gasps and the sweat was trickling in streams down his face and neck
Round and round between ceiling and floor whirled the naked body of the babyround and round for minutes that seemed hours to the horrified nurseround and round with all the strength and speed the young man could put forthround and round until the room was a blur before his throbbing eyes until his expression became fully as demoniac as Nora had been fancying it
Just as she was recovering from her paralysis of horror and was about to fly shrieking from the room she was halted by a sound that made her draw in air until her bosom swelled as if it would burst its gingham prison
She craned eagerly toward Stevens
He was whirling the body more furiously than ever
Was that you
asked Nora hoarsely
Or was it She paused listened
The sound came againthe sound of a drowning person fighting for breath
Itsits muttered Nora
What is it Doctor
Life
panted Stevens triumph in his glistening streaming face
Life
He continued to whirl the little form but not so rapidly or so vigorously
And now the sound was louder or rather less faint less uncertainwas a crywas the cry of a living thing
Shes alivealive
shrieked the woman and in time with his movements she swayed to and fro from side to side laughing weeping wringing her hands patting her bosom her cheeks
She stretched out her arms
My prayers are answered
she cried
Dont kill her you brute
Give her to me
You shant treat a baby that way
The unheeding doctor kept on whirling until the cry was continuous a low but lusty wail of angry protest
Then he stopped caught the baby up in both arms burst out laughing
You little minx
he saidor rather gaspeda tenderness quite maternal in his eyes
But I got you
Nora the table
Nora righted the table spread and smoothed the cloths extended her scrawny eager arms for the baby
Stevens with a jerk of the head motioned her aside laid the baby on the table
He felt for the pulse at its wrist bent to listen at the heart
Quite useless
That strong rising howl of helpless fury was proof enough
Her majesty the baby was mad through and throughtherefore alive through and through
Grand heart action
said the young man
He stood aloof hands on his hips head at a proud angle
You never saw a healthier specimen
Itll be many a year bar accidents before shes that near death again
But it was Noras turn not to hear
She was soothing and swaddling the outraged baby
Therethere
she crooned
Norall take care of you
The bad man shant come near my little preciousno the wicked man shant touch her again
The bedroom door opened
At the slight noise superstitious Nora paled shriveled within her green and white checked gingham
She slowly turned her head as if on this day of miracles she expected yet anotherthe resurrection of the resurrected babys mother poor Miss Lorella
But Lorella Lenox was forever tranquil in the sleep that engulfed her and the sorrows in which she had been entangled by an impetuous trusting heart
The apparition in the doorway was commonplacethe mistress of the house Lorellas elder and married sister Fannyneither fair nor dark neither tall nor short neither thin nor fat neither pretty nor homely neither stupid nor bright neither neat nor dowdyone of that multitude of excellent unobtrusive human beings who make the restful stretches in a world of agitationsand who respond to the impetus of circumstance as unresistingly as cloud to wind
As the wail of the child smote upon Fannys ears she lifted her head startled and cried out sharply Whats that
Weve saved the baby Mrs Warham replied the young doctor beaming on her through his glasses
Oh
said Mrs Warham
And she abruptly seated herself on the big chintzcovered sofa beside the door
And its a lovely child pleaded Nora
Her womans instinct guided her straight to the secret of the conflict raging behind Mrs Warhams unhappy face
The finest girl in the world cried Stevens wellmeaning but tactless
Girl
exclaimed Fanny starting up from the sofa
Is it a girl
Nora nodded
The young man looked downcast he was realizing the practical side of his victory for sciencethe consequences to the girl child to all the relatives
A girl
moaned Fanny sinking to the sofa again
God have mercy on us
Louder and angrier rose the wail
Fanny after a brief struggle with herself hurried to the table looked down at the tiny helplessness
Her face softened
She had been a mother four times
Only one had livedher fair little twoyearold Ruthand she would never have any more children
The tears glistened in her eyes
What ails you Nora Mulvey
she demanded
Why arent you tending to this poor little creature
Nora sprang into action but she wrapped the baby herself
The doctor in deep embarrassment withdrew to the farther window
She fussed over the baby lingeringly but finally resigned it to the nurse
Take it into the bathroom she said where everythings ready to feed itthough I never dreamed As Nora was about to depart she detained her
Let me look at it again
The nurse understood that Fanny Warham was searching for evidence of the mysterious but suspected paternity whose secret Lorella with true Lenox obstinacy had guarded to the end
The two women scanned the features
A man would at a glance have abandoned hope of discovering anything from a chart so vague and confused as that wrinkled twisted swollen face of the newborn
Not so a woman
Said Nora She seems to me to favor the Lenoxes
But I thinkI kind o thinkI see a trace ofof There she halted waiting for encouragement
Of Galt
suggested Fanny in an undertone
Of Galt assented Nora her tone equally discreet
That nose is Galtlike and the set of the earsand a kind of something to the neck and shoulders
Maybe so said Fanny doubtfully
She shook her head drearily sighed
Whats the use
Lorellas gone
And this morning General Galt came down to see my husband with a letter hed got from Jimmie
Jimmie denies it
Perhaps so
Again perhaps the General wrote him to write that and threatened him if he didnt
But whats the use
Well never know
And they never did
When young Stevens was leaving George Warham waylaid him at the front gate separated from the spacious old creeperclad house by long lawns and an avenue of elms
I hear the childs going to live said he anxiously
Ive never seen anything more alive replied Stevens
Warham stared gloomily at the ground
He was evidently ashamed of his feelings yet convinced that they were human and natural
A moments silence between the men then Stevens put his hand on the gate latch
Diddidmy wife began Warham
Did she say what she calculated to do
Not a word George
After a silence
You know how fond she is of babies
Yes I know replied Warham
Fanny is a true woman if ever there was one
With a certain defiance And Lorellashe was a sweet womanly girl
As sweet and good as she was pretty replied Stevens heartily
The way she kept her mouth shut about that hound whoever he is
Warhams Roman face grew savage revealed in startling apparition a stubborn cruelty of which there was not a trace upon the surface
If I ever catch the Ill fill him full of holes
Hed be lynchedwhoever he is said Stevens
Thats right
cried Warham
This is the North but its near enough to Kentucky to know what to do with a wretch of that sort
His face became calmer
That poor little baby
Hell have a hard row to hoe
Stevens flushed a guilty red
Itsitsa girl he stammered
Warham stared
A girl
he cried
Then his face reddened and in a furious tone he burst out Now dont that beat the devil for luck


A girl
Good Lorda girl
Nobody in this townll blame her consoled Stevens
You know better than that Bob
A girl
Why its downright wicked


I wonder what Fanny allows to do
He showed what fear was in his mind by wheeling savagely on Stevens with a stormy We cant keep herwe simply cant
Whats to become of her
protested Stevens gently
Warham made a wild vague gesture with both arms
Damn if I know
Ive got to look out for my own daughter
I wont have it
Damn it I wont have it
Stevens lifted the gate latch
Well Goodby George
Ill look in again this evening
And knowing the moral ideas of the town all he could muster by way of encouragement was a halfhearted Dont borrow trouble
But Warham did not hear
He was moving up the tanbark walk toward the house muttering to himself
When Fanny unable longer to conceal Lorellas plight had told him pity and affection for his sweet sisterinlaw who had made her home with them for five years had triumphed over his principles
He had himself arranged for Fanny to hide Lorella in New York until she could safely return
But just as the sisters were about to set out Lorella low in body and in mind fell ill Then Georgeand Fanny toohad striven with her to give them the name of her betrayer that he might be compelled to do her justice
Lorella refused
I told him she said and heI never want to see him again
They pleaded the disgrace to them but she replied that he would not marry her even if she would marry him and she held to her refusal with the firmness for which the Lenoxes were famous
They suspected Jimmie Galt because he had been about the most attentive of the young men until two or three months before and because he had abruptly departed for Europe to study architecture
Lorella denied that it was he
If you kill him she said to Warham you kill an innocent man
Warham was so exasperated by her obstinacy that he was at first for taking her at her offer and letting her go away
But Fanny would not hear of it and he acquiesced
NowThis child must be sent away off somewhere and never be heard of again he said to himself
If itd been a boy perhaps it might have got along
But a girl Theres nothing can be done to make things right for a girl thats got no father and no name
The subject did not come up between him and his wife until about a week after Lorellas funeral
But he was thinking of nothing else
At his big grocery storewholesale and retailhe sat morosely in his office brooding over the disgrace and the danger of deeper disgracefor he saw what a hold the baby already had upon his wife
He was ashamed to appear in the streets he knew what was going on behind the sympathetic faces heard the whisperings as if they had been trumpetings
And he was as much afraid of his own soft heart as of his wifes
But for the sake of his daughter he must be firm and just
One morning as he was leaving the house after breakfast he turned back and said abruptly Fan dont you think youd better send the baby away and get it over with
No said his wife unhesitatinglyand he knew his worst suspicion was correct
Ive made up my mind to keep her
It isnt fair to Ruth
Send it awaywhere
Anywhere
Get it adopted in ChicagoCincinnatiLouisville
Lorellas baby
When she and Ruth grow upwhat then
People aint so low as some think
The sins of the parents are visited on the children unto I dont care interrupted Fanny
I love her
Im going to keep her
Wait here a minute
When she came back she had the baby in her arms
Just look she said softly
George frowned tried not to look but was soon drawn and held by the sweet fresh blooming face so smooth so winning so innocent
And think how she was sent back to lifefrom beyond the grave
It must have been for some purpose
Warham groaned Oh Lord I dont know what to do
Butit aint fair to our Ruth
I dont see it that way



Kiss her George
Warham kissed one of the soft cheeks swelling like a ripening apple
The baby opened wide a pair of wonderful dark eyes threw up its chubby arms and laughedsuch a laugh


There was no more talk of sending her away
CHAPTER II NOT quite seventeen years later on a fine June morning Ruth Warham issued hastily from the house and started down the long tanbark walk from the front veranda to the street gate
She was now nineteennearer twentyand a very pretty young woman indeed
She had grown up one of those small slender blondes exquisite and dolllike who cannot help seeming fresh and sweet whatever the truth about them without or within
This morning she had on a new summer dress of a blue that matched her eyes and harmonized with her coloring
She was looking her best and she had the satisfying confidencegiving sense that it was so
Like most of the unattached girls of small towns she was always dreaming of the handsome stranger who would fall in lovethe thrilling lovestory kind of love at first sight
The weather plays a conspicuous part in the romancings of youth she felt that this was precisely the kind of day fate would be most likely to select for the meeting
Just before dressing she had been reading about the wonderful himin Robert Chambers latest storyand she had spent full fifteen minutes of blissful reverie over the accompanying Fisher illustration
Now she was issuing hopefully forth as hopefully as if adventure were the rule and order of life in Sutherland instead of a desperate monotony made the harder to bear by the glory of its scenery
She had got only far enough from the house to be visible to the secondstory windows when a young voice called Ruthie
Arent you going to wait for me
Ruth halted an expression anything but harmonious with the pretty blue costume stormed across her face
I wont have her along
she muttered
I simply wont
She turned slowly and as she turned effaced every trace of temper with a dexterity which might have given an onlooker a poorer opinion of her character than perhaps the facts as to human nature justify
The countenance she presently revealed to those upper windows was sunny and sweet
No one was visible but the horizontal slats in one of the only closed pair of shutters and a vague suggestion of movement rather than form behind them gave the impression that a woman not far enough dressed to risk being seen from the street was hidden there
Evidently Ruth knew for it was toward this window that she directed her gaze and the remark Cant wait dear
Im in a great hurry
Mamma wants the silk right away and Ive got to match it
But Ill be only a minute pleaded the voicea much more interesting more musical voice than Ruths rather shrill and thin high soprano
NoIll meet you up at papas store
All right
Ruth resumed her journey
She smiled to herself
That means said she half aloud Ill steer clear of the store this morning
But as she was leaving the gate into the wide shady sleepy street who should come driving past in a village cart but Lottie Wright
And Lottie reined her pony in to the sidewalk and in the shade of a symmetrical walnut tree proceeded to invite Ruth to a dancea long story as Lottie had to tell all about it the decorations the favors the food who would be there what she was going to wear and so on and on
Ruth was intensely interested but kept remembering something that caused her to glance uneasily from time to time up the tanbark walk under the arching boughs toward the house
Even if she had not been interested she would hardly have ventured to break off Lottie Wright was the only daughter of the richest man in Sutherland and therefore social arbiter to the younger set
Lottie stopped abruptly said Well I really must get on
And theres your cousin coming down the walk
I know youve been waiting for her
Ruth tried to keep in countenance but a blush of shame and a frown of irritation came in spite of her
Im sorry I cant ask Susie too pursued Lottie in a voice of hypocritical regret
But there are to be exactly eighteen couplesand I couldnt
Of course not said Ruth heartily
Susanll understand
I wouldnt for the world do anything to hurt her feelings continued Lottie with the selfcomplacent righteousness of a deacon telling the congregation how good grace has made him
Her prominent commonplace brown eyes were gazing up the walk an expression distressingly like envious anger in them
She had a thick pudgy face an oily skin an outcropping of dull red pimples on the chin
Many women can indulge their passion for sweets at meals and sweets between meals without serious injuryto complexion Lottie Wright unluckily couldnt
I feel sorry for Susie she went on in the ludicrous patronizing tone that needs no describing to anyone acquainted with any fashionable set anywhere from China to Peru
And I think the way you all treat her is simply beautiful
But then everybody feels sorry for her and tries to be kind
She knowsabout herself I meandoesnt she Ruthie
I guess so replied Ruth almost hanging her head in her mortification
Shes very good and sweet
Indeed she is said Lottie
And father says shes far and away the prettiest girl in town
With this parting shot which struck precisely where she had aimed Lottie gathered up the reins and drove on calling out a friendly Hello Susie dearie to Susan Lenox who on her purposely lagging way from the house had nearly reached the gate
What a nasty thing Lottie Wright is
exclaimed Ruth to her cousin
She has a mean tongue admitted Susan tall and slim and straight with glorious dark hair and a skin healthily pallid and as smooth as clear
But shes got a good heart
She gives a lot away to poor people
Because she likes to patronize and be kowtowed to retorted Ruth
Shes mean I tell you
Then with a vicious gleam in the blue eyes that hinted a deeper and less presentable motive for the telling she added Why shes not going to ask you to her party
Susan was obviously unmoved
She has the right to ask whom she pleases
Andshe laughedif I were giving a party Id not want to ask herthough I might do it for fear shed feel left out
Dont you feelleft out
Susan shook her head
I seem not to care much about going to parties lately
The boys dont like to dance with me and I get tired of sitting the dances out
This touched Ruths impulsively generous heart and womans easy tears filled her eyes her cousins remark was so pathetic the more pathetic because its pathos was absolutely unconscious
Ruth shot a pitying glance at Susan but the instant she saw the loveliness of the features upon which that expression of unconsciousness lay like innocence upon a bed of roses the pity vanished from her eyes to be replaced by a disfiguring envy as hateful as an evil emotion can be at nineteen
Susan still lacked nearly a month of seventeen but she seemed older than Ruth because her mind and her body had developed beyond her yearsor perhaps it would be more accurate to say beyond the average of growth at seventeen
Also her personality was stronger far more definite
Ruth tried to believe herself the cleverer and the more beautiful at times with a certain success
But as she happened to be a shrewd young personan inheritance from the Warhamsshe was haunted by misgivingsand worse
Those whose vanity never suffers from these torments will of course condemn her but whoever has known the pain of having to concede superiority to someone with whom she or heis constantly contrasted will not be altogether without sympathy for Ruth in her struggles often vain struggles against the mortal sin of jealousy
The truth is Susan was beyond question the beauty of Sutherland
Her eyes very dark at birth had changed to a soft dreamy violetgray
Hair and coloring lashes and eyebrows remained dark thus her eyes and the intense red of her lips had that vicinage of contrast which is necessary to distinction
To look at her was to be at once fascinated by those violetgray eyesby their color by their clearness by their regard of calm grave inquiry by their mystery not untouched by a certain sadness
She had a thick abundance of wavy hair not so long as Ruths golden braids but growing beautifully instead of thinly about her low brow about her delicately modeled ears and at the back of her exquisite neck
Her slim nose departed enough from the classic line to prevent the suggestion of monotony that is in all purely classic faces
Her nostrils had the sensitiveness that more than any other outward sign indicates the imaginative temperament
Her chin and throatto look at them was to know where her lover would choose to kiss her first
When she smiled her large even teeth were dazzling
And the smile itself was exceedingly sweet and winning with the violetgray eyes casting over it that seriousness verging on sadness which is the natural outlook of a highly intelligent nature
For while stupid vain people are suspicious and easily offended only the intelligent are truly sensitivekeenly susceptible to all sensations
The dull ear is suspicious the acute ear is sensitive
The intense red of her lips at times so vivid that it seemed artificial and their sinuous sensitive curve indicated a temperament that was frankly proclaimed in her figuresensuous graceful slenderthe figure of girlhood in its perfection and of perfect womanhood toolike those tropical flowers that look innocent and young and fresh yet stir in the beholder passionate longings and visions
Her walk was worthy of face and figurefree and firm and graceful the small head carried proudly without haughtiness
This physical beauty had as an aureole to illuminate it and to set it off a manner that was wholly devoid of mannerismsof those that men and women think out and exhibit to give added charm to themselvestricks of cuteness as lisp and baby stare tricks of dignity as grave brow and body always carried rigidly erect tricks of sweetness and kindliness as the ever ready smile and the warm handclasp
Susan the interested in the world about her Susan the selfunconscious had none of these tricks
She was at all times her own self
Beauty is anything but rare likewise intelligence
But this quality of naturalness is the greatest of all qualities
It made Susan Lenox unique
It was not strangenor inexcusable that the girls and their parents had begun to pity Susan as soon as this beauty developed and this personality had begun to exhale its delicious perfume
It was but natural that they should start the whole town to being kind to the poor thing
And it was equally the matter of course that they should have achieved their objectshould have impressed the conventional masculine mind of the town with such a sense of the poor things social isolation and impossibility that the boys ceased to be her eagerly admiring friends were afraid to be alone with her to ask her to dance
Women are conventional as a business but with men conventionality is a groveling superstition
The youths of Sutherland longed for sighed for the alluring sweet bright Susan but they dared not with all the women saying Poor thing
What a pity a nice man cant afford to have anything to do with her
It was an interesting typical example of the profound snobbishness of the male character
Rarely after Susan was sixteen did any of the boys venture to ask her to dance and so give himself the joy of encircling that lovely form of hers yet from babyhood her fascination for the male sex regardless of age or temperament had been uncannynaturally she being a lovechild said the old women
And from fourteen on it grew steadily
It would be difficult for one who has not lived in a small town to understand exactly the kind of isolation to which Sutherland consigned the girl without her realizing it without their fully realizing it themselves
Everyone was friendly with her
A stranger would not have noticed any difference in the treatment of her and of her cousin Ruth
Yet not one of the young men would have thought of marrying her would have regarded her as his equal or the equal of his sisters
She went to all the general entertainments
She was invited to all the houses when failure to invite her would have seemed pointedbut only then
She did not think much about herself she was fond of studyfonder of readingfondest perhaps of making dresses and hats especially for Ruth whom she thought much prettier than herself
Thus she was only vaguely subconsciously conscious of there being something peculiar and mysterious in her lot
This isolation rather than her dominant quality of selfeffacing consideration for others was the chief cause of the extraordinary innocence of her mind
No servant no girl no audacious boy ever ventured to raise with her any question remotely touching on sex
All those questions seemed to Puritan Sutherland in any circumstances highly indelicate in relation to Susan they seemed worse than indelicate dreadful though the thought was that there could be anything worse than indelicacy
At fifteen she remained as unaware of even the existence of the mysteries of sex as she had been at birth
Nothing definite enough to arouse her curiosity had ever been said in her hearing and such references to those matters as she found in her reading passed her by as any matter of which he has not the beginnings of knowledge will fail to arrest the attention of any reader
It was generally assumed that she knew all about her origin that someone had some time or other told her
Even her Aunt Fanny thought so thought she was hiding the knowledge deep in her heart explained in that way her content with the solitude of books and sewing
Susan was the worst possible influence in Ruths life
Our character is ourself is born with us clings to us as the flesh to our bones persists unchanged until we die
But upon the circumstances that surround us depends what part of our character shall show itself
Ruth was born with perhaps something more than the normal tendency to be envious and petty
But these qualities might never have shown themselves conspicuously had there been no Susan for her to envy
The very qualities that made Susan lovable reacted upon the pretty pert blond cousin to make her the more unlovable
Again and again when she and Susan were about to start out together and Susan would appear in beauty and grace of person and dress Ruth would excuse herself would fly to her room to lock herself in and weep and rage and hate
And at the high school when Susan scored in a recitation or in some dramatic entertainment Ruth would sit with bitten lip and surging bosom pale with jealousy
Susans isolation the way the boys avoided having with her the friendly relations that spring up naturally among young people these gave Ruth a partial revenge
But Susan seemingly unconscious rising sweetly and serenely above all pettiness Ruths hatred deepened though she hid it from everyone almost from herself
And she depended more and more utterly upon Susan to select her clothes for her to dress her to make her look well for Susan had taste and Ruth had not
On that bright June morning as the cousins went up Main Street together Susan gave herself over to the delight of sun and air and of the flowering gardens before the attractive houses they were passing Ruth with the day quite dark for her all its joys gone was fighting against a hatred of her cousin so vicious that it made her afraid
Ill have no chance at all her angry heart was saying so long as Susies around keeping everybody reminded of the family shame
And that was a truth she could not downface mean and ungenerous though thinking it might be
The worst of all was that Susan in a simple white dress and an almost untrimmed white straw hat with a graceful curve to its brim and set at the right angle upon that wavy dark hair was making the beauty of her short blond cousin dim and somehow common
At the corner of Maple Street Ruths selfcontrol reached its limit
She halted took the sample of silk from her glove
There was not a hint of her feelings in her countenance for shame and the desire to seem to be better than she was were fast making her an adept in hypocrisy
You go ahead and match it for mamma said she
Ive got to run in and see Bessie Andrews
But I promised Uncle George Id come and help him with the monthly bills objected Susan
You can do both
Itll take you only a minute
If mother had known you were going uptown shed never have trusted me
And Ruth had tucked the sample in Susans belt and was hurrying out Maple Street
There was nothing for Susan to do but go on alone
Two squares and she was passing the show place of Sutherland the home of the Wrights
She paused to regale herself with a glance into the grove of magnificent elms with lawns and bright gardens beyondfor the Wright place filled the entire square between Broad and Myrtle Streets and from Main to Monroe
She was starting on when she saw among the trees a young man in striped flannels
At the same instant he saw her
Hello Susie
he cried
I was thinking about you
Susan halted
When did you get back Sam
she asked
I heard you were going to stay on in the East all summer
After they had shaken hands across the hedge that came almost to their shoulders Susan began to move on
Sam kept pace with her on his side of the carefully trimmed boxwood barrier
Im going back East in about two weeks said he
Its awfully dull here after Yale
I just blew inhavent seen Lottie or father yet
Coming to Lotties party
No said Susan
Why not
Susan laughed merrily
The best reason in the world
Lottie has only invited just so many couples
Ill see about that cried Sam
Youll be asked all right all right
No said Susan
She was one of those whose way of saying no gives its full meaning and intent
Ill not be asked thank youand Ill not go if I am
By this time they were at the gate
He opened it came out into the street
He was a tallish athletic youth dark and pleasing enough of feature to be called handsome
He was dressed with a great deal of style of the efflorescent kind called sophomoric
He was a Sophomore at Yale
But that was not so largely responsible for his selfcomplacent expression as the deference he had got from babyhood through being heir apparent to the Wright fortune
He had a sophisticated way of inspecting Susans charms of figure no less than charms of face that might have made a disagreeable impression upon an experienced onlooker
There is a time for feeling without knowing why one feels and that period ought not to have been passed for young Wright for many a year
My but youre looking fine Susie
exclaimed he
I havent seen anyone that could hold a candle to you even in the East
Susan laughed and blushed with pleasure
Go on said she with raillery
I love it
Come in and sit under the trees and Ill fill all the time youll give me
This reminded her
I must hurry uptown she said
Goodby
Hold on
cried he
What have you got to do
He happened to glance down the street
Isnt that Ruth coming
So it is said Susan
I guess Bessie Andrews wasnt at home
Sam waved at Ruth and called Hello
Glad to see you
Ruth was all sweetness and smiles
She and her motherquite privately and with nothing openly said on either sidehad canvassed Sam as a possibility
There had been keen disappointment at the news that he was not coming home for the long vacation
How are you Sam
said she as they shook hands
My Susie doesnt he look New York
Sam tried to conceal that he was swelling with pride
Oh this is nothing said he deprecatingly
Ruths heart was aflutter
The Fisher picture of the Chambers lovemaker thought she might almost be a photograph of Sam
She was glad she had obeyed the mysterious impulse to make a toilette of unusual elegance that morning
How get rid of Susan
Ill take the sample Susie said she
Then you wont have to keep father waiting
Susie gave up the sample
Her face was no longer so bright and interested
Oh drop it cried Sam
Come inboth of you
Ill telephone for Joe Andrews and well take a driveor anything you like
He was looking at Susan
Cant do it replied Susan
I promised Uncle George
Oh bother
urged Sam
Telephone him
Itll be all rightwont it Ruth
You dont know Susie said Ruth with a queer strained laugh
Shed rather die than break a promise
I must go Susan now said
Goodby
Come on Ruth cried Sam
Lets walk uptown with her
And you can help match the silk said Ruth
Not for me replied young Wright
Then to Susan Whatve you got to do
Maybe its something I could help at
No
Its for Uncle George and me
Well Ill go as far as the store
Thenwell see
They were now in the business part of Main Street were at Wilsons dry goods store
You might find it here suggested the innocent Susan to her cousin
Ruth colored veiled her eyes to hide their flash
Ive got to go to the store firstto get some money she hastily improvised
Sam had been walking between the two girls
He now changed to the outside and so put himself next Susan alone put Susan between him and Ruth
The maneuver seemed to be a mere politeness but Ruth knew better
What fate had intended as her lucky day was being changed into unlucky by this cousin of hers
Ruth walked sullenly along hot tears in her eyes and a choke in her throat as she listened to Sams flatterings of her cousin and to Susans laughing delighted replies
She tried to gather herself together to think up something funny or at least interesting with which to break into the teteatete and draw Sam to herself
She could think nothing but envious hateful thoughts
At the doors of Warham and Company wholesale and retail grocers the three halted
I guess Ill go to Vandermarks said Ruth
I really dont need money
Come on Sam
NoIm going back home
I ought to see Lottie and father
My but its dull in this town
Well so long said Susan
She nodded sparkling of hair and skin and eyes and went into the store
Sam and Ruth watched her as she walked down the broad aisle between the counters
From the store came a mingling of odors of fruit of spices of freshly ground coffee
Susans an awful pretty girl isnt she
declared Sam with rude enthusiasm
Indeed she is replied Ruth as heartilyand with an honest if discouraged effort to feel enthusiastic
What a figure
And she has such a good walk
Most women walk horribly
Come on to Vandermarks with me and Ill stroll back with you offered Ruth
Sam was still gazing into the store where far to the rear Susan could be seen the graceful head the gently swelling bust the soft lines of the white dress the pretty ankles revealed by the short skirtthere was indeed a profile worth a mans looking at on a fine June day
Ruths eyes were upon Sam handsome dressed in the Eastern fashion an ideal lover
Come on Sam urged Ruth
No thanks he replied absently
Ill go back
Good luck
And not glancing at her he lifted his straw hat with its band of Yale blue and set out
Ruth moved slowly and disconsolately in the opposite direction
She was ashamed of her thoughts but shame never yet withheld anybody from being human in thought
As she turned to enter Vandermarks she glanced down the street
There was Sam returned and going into her fathers store
She hesitated could devise no plan of action hurried into the dry goods store
Sinclair the head salesman and the beau of Sutherland was an especial friend of hers
The tall slender hungrylooking young man devoured with ambition for speedy wealth had no mind to neglect so easy an aid to that ambition as nature gave him in making him a ladycharmer
He had resolved to marry either Lottie Wright or Ruth WarhamRuth preferred because while Lottie would have many times more money her skin made her a stiff dose for a young man brought up to the American tradition that the face is the woman
But that morning Sinclair exerted his charms in vain
Ruth was in a hurry was distinctly rude cut short what in other circumstances would have been a prolonged and delightful flirtation by tossing the sample on the counter and asking him to do the matching for her and to send the silk right away
Which said she fairly bolted from the store
She arrived barely in time
Young Wright was issuing from Warham and Company
He smiled friendly enough but Ruth knew where his thoughts were
Get what you wanted
inquired he and went on to explain I came back to find out if you and Susie were to be at home this evening
Thought Id call
Ruth paled with angry dismay
She was going to a party at the Sinclairsone to which Susan was not invited
Arent you going to Sinclairs
said she
I was
But I thought Id rather call
Perhaps Ill go there later
He was coming to call on Susan
All the way down Main Street to the Wright place Ruth fought against her mood of angry and depressed silence tried to make the best of her chance to impress Sam
But Sam was absent and humiliatingly near to curt
He halted at his fathers gate
She halted also searched the grounds with anxious eyes for sign of Lottie that would give her the excuse for entering
So long said Sam
Do come to Sinclairs early
You always did dance so well
Oh dancing bores me said the blase Sophomore
But Ill be round before the shindys over
Ive got to take Lot home
He lifted the hat again with what both he and Ruth regarded as a gesture of most elegant carelessness
Ruth strolled reluctantly on feeling as if her toilet had been splashed or crushed
As she entered the front door her mother in a wrapper and curl papers appeared at the head of the stairs
Why
cried she
Wheres the silk
Its for your dress tonight you know
Itll be along was Ruths answer her tone dreary her lip quivering
I met Sam Wright
Oh
exclaimed her mother
Hes back is he
Ruth did not reply
She came on up the stairs went into the sittingroomthe room where Doctor Stevens seventeen years before had torn the baby Susan from the very claws of death
She flung herself down buried her head in her arms upon that same table
She burst into a storm of tears
Why dearie dear cried her mother whatever is the matter
Its wicked and hateful sobbed the girl butOh mamma I hate Susan
She was along and Sam hardly noticed me and hes coming here this evening to call
But youll be at Sinclairs
exclaimed Mrs Warham
Not Susan sobbed Ruth
He wants to see only her
The members of the Second Presbyterian Church of which Fanny Warham was about the most exemplary and assiduous female member would hardly have recognized the face encircled by that triple row of curlpapered locks shinily plastered with quinceseed liquor
She was at womans second critical age and the strange emotions working in her mindof whose disorder no one had an inklingwere upon the surface now
She ventured this freedom of facial expression because her daughters face was hid
She did not speak
She laid a tender defending hand for an instant upon her daughters shoulderlike the caress of love and encouragement the lioness gives her cub as she is about to give battle for it
Then she left the room
She did not know what to do but she knew she must and would do something
CHAPTER III THE telephone was downstairs in the rear end of the hall which divided the lower floor into two equal parts
But hardly had Mrs Warham given the Sinclairs number to the exchange girl when Ruth called from the head of the stairs Whatre you doing there mamma
Ill tell Mrs Sinclair youre sick and cant come
Then Ill send Susan in your place
Dont
cried Ruth in an agitated angry voice
Ring offquick
Now Ruth let me Ring off
ordered Ruth
You mustnt do that
Youll have the whole town talking about how Im throwing myself at Sams headand that Im jealous of Susan
Mrs Warham said Never mind into the telephone sender and hung up the receiver
She was frightened but not convinced
Hers was a slow oldfashioned mind and to it the scheme it had worked out seemed a model of skillful duplicity
But Ruth of the younger and subtler generation realized instantly how transparent the thing was
Mrs Warham was abashed but not angered by her daughters curt contempt
Its the only way I can think of said she
And I still dont see Of course you dont cut in Ruth ruffled by the perilously narrow escape from being the laughing stock of the town
People arent as big fools as they used to be mamma
They dont believe nowadays everything thats told them
There isnt anybody that doesnt know Im never sick
Nowell have to She reflected a moment pausing halfway down the stairs while her mother watched her swollen and tearstained face
We might send Susan away for the evening suggested the mother
Yes assented the daughter
Papa could take her with him for a drive to North Sutherlandto see the Provosts
Then Samd come straight on to the Sinclairs
Ill call up your father
No
cried Ruth stamping her foot
Call up Mr Provost and tell him papas coming
Then you can talk with papa when he gets home to dinner
But maybe If that doesnt work out we can do something else this afternoon
The mother and the daughter avoided each others eyes
Both felt mean and small guilty toward Susan but neither was for that reason disposed to draw back
As Mrs Warham was trying the new dress on her daughter she said Anyhow Samd be wasting time on Susan
Hed hang round her for no good
Shed simply get talked about
The poor child cant be lively or smile but what people begin to wonder if shes going the way ofof Lorella
Thats so agreed Ruth and both felt better
Was Aunt Lorella very pretty mamma
Lovely
replied Fanny and her eyes grew tender for she had adored Lorella
You never saw such a complexionlike Susans only snowwhite
Nervously and hastily Most as fine as yours Ruthie
Ruth gazed complacently into the mirror
Im glad Im fair and not big said she
Yes indeed
I like the womanly woman
And so do men
Dont you think we ought to send Susan away to visit somewhere
asked Ruth at the next opportunity for talk the fitting gave
Its getting more and morepointedthe way people act
And shes so sweet and good Id hate to have her feelings hurt
In a burst of generosity Shes the most considerate human being I ever knew
Shed give up anything rather than see someone else put out
Shes too much that way
We cant be too much that way said Mrs Warham in mechanical Christian reproof
Oh I know retorted Ruth thats all very well for church and Sundays
But I guess if you want to get along youve got to look out for Number One



Yes she ought to visit somewhere
Ive been trying to think said her mother
She couldnt go any place but your Uncle Zekes
But its so lonesome out there I havent the heart to send her
Besides she wouldnt know what to make of it
Whatd father say
Thats another thing
Mrs Warham had latterly grown jealous not without reasonof her husbands partiality for Susan
Ruth sighed
Oh dear
cried she
I dont know what to do
Hows she ever going to get married
If shed only been a boy
said Mrs Warham on her knees taking the unevenness out of the front of the skirt
A girl has to suffer for her mothers sins
Ruth made no reply
She smiled to herselfthe comment of the younger generation upon the older
Sin it might have been but worse than that it was a stupidityto let a man make a fool of her
Lorella must have been a poor weakminded creature
By dinner time Ruth had completely soothed and smoothed her vanity
Sam had been caught by Susan simply because he had seen Susan before he saw her
All that would be necessary was a good chance at him and he would never look at Susan again
He had been in the East where the admired type was her ownrefined ladylike the woman of the dainty appearance and manners and tastes
A brief undisturbed exposure to her charms and Susan would seem coarse and countrified to him
There was no denying that Susan had style but it was fully effective only when applied to a sunny fairylike beauty such as hers
But at midday when Susan came in with Warham Ruths jealousy opened all her inwardbleeding wounds again
Susans merry eyes her laughing mouth her funny way of saying even commonplace thingshow could quiet unobtrusive ladylike charms such as Ruths have a chance if Susan were about
She waited silent and anxious while her mother was having the talk with her father in the sittingroom
Warham mere man was amused by his wifes scheming
Dont put yourself out Fanny said he
If the boy wants Ruth and she wants him why well and good
But youll only make a mess interfering
Let the young people alone
Im surprised George Warham cried Fanny that you can show so little sense and heart
To hear you talk Id think marriage was a business like groceries
Mrs Warham thought it was in a sense
But she would never have dared say so aloud even to her husbandor rather especially to her husband
In matters of men and women he was thoroughly innocent with the simplicity of the oldtime man of the small town and the country he fancied that while in grocery matters and the like the world was full of guile in matters of the heart it was idyllic Arcadian with never a thought of duplicity except among a few obviously wicked and designing people
I guess we both want to see Ruth married well was all she could venture
Id rather the girls stayed with us declared Warham
Id hate to give them up
Of course hastily agreed Fanny
Stillits the regular order of nature
Oh Ruthll marryonly too soon said Warham
And marry well
Im not so sure though that marrying any of old Wrights breed would be marrying what ought to be called well
Money isnt everythingnot by a long sightthough of course its comfortable
I never heard anything against Sam protested Mrs Warham
Youve heard what Ive heardthat hes wild and loose
But then you women like that in a man
Weve got to put up with it you mean cried Fanny indignant
Women like it persisted Warham
And I guess Sams only sowing the usual wild oats getting ready to settle
No mother you let Ruth alone
If she wants him shell get himshe or Susan
Mrs Warham compressed her lips and lowered her eyes
Ruth or Susanas if it didnt matter which
Susan isnt ours she could not refrain from saying
Indeed she is
retorted George warmly
Why she couldnt be more our own Yes certainly interrupted Fanny
She moved toward the door
She saw that without revealing her entire schemehers and Ruthsshe could make no headway with George
And if she did reveal it he would sternly veto it
So she gave up that direction
She went upstairs George took his hat from the front hall rack and pushed open the screen door
As he appeared on the veranda Susan was picking dead leaves from one of the hanging baskets Ruth seated in the hammock hands in lap her whole attitude intensely still was watching her with narrowed eyes
Whats this I hear cried Warham laughing about you two girls setting your caps for Sam Wright
And his goodhumored brown eyes glanced at Ruth passed on to Susans wealth of wavy dark hair and long rounded form and lingered there
Ruth lowered her eyes and compressed her lips a trick she had borrowed from her mother along with the peculiarities of her mothers disposition that it fitted
Susan flung a laughing glance over her shoulder at her uncle
Not Ruth said she
Only me
I saw him first so hes mine
Hes coming to see me this evening
So I hear
Well the moons full and your aunt and Ill not interruptat least not till ten oclock
No callers on a child like you after ten
Oh I dont think Ill be able to hold him that long
Dont you fret Brownie
But I mustnt make you vain
Coming along to the store
No
Tomorrow said Susan
I can finish in the morning
Im going to wear my white dress with embroidery and its got to be pressedand that means I must do it myself
Poor Sam
And I suppose when he calls youll come down as if youd put on any old thing and didnt care whether he came or not
And youll have primped for an hourand he tooshaving and combing and trying different ties
Susan sparkled at the idea of a young man and such a young man taking trouble for her
Ruth pale kept her eyes down and her lips compressed
She was picturing the gallant appearance the young Sophomore from Yale away off in the gorgeous fashionable East would make as he came in at that gate yonder and up the walk and seated himself on the verandawith Susan
Evidently her mother had failed Susan was not to be taken away
When Warham departed down the walk Ruth rose she could not bear being alone with her triumphant rivaltriumphant because unconscious
She knew that to get Sam to herself all she would have to do would be to hint to Susan the generous what she wanted
But pride forbade that
As her hand was on the knob of the screen door Susan said Why dont you like Sam
Oh I think hes stuckup
Hes been spoiled in the East
Why I dont see any sign of it
You were too flattered by his talking to you said Ruth with a sweetsour little laughan asp of a sneer hid in a basket of flowers
Susan felt the sting but seeing only the flowers did not dream whence it had come
It was nice wasnt it
said she gayly
Maybe youre right about him but I cant help liking him
You must admit hes handsome
He has a bad look in his eyes replied Ruth
Such rage against Susan was swelling within her that it seemed to her she would faint if she did not release at least part of it
You want to look out for him Susie said she calmly and evenly
You dont want to take what he says seriously
Of course not said Susan quite honestly though she no more than the next human being could avoid taking seriously whatever was pleasantly flattering
Hed never think of marrying you
Ruth trembled before and after delivering this venomous shaft
Marrying
cried Susan again quite honestly
Why Im only seventeen
Ruth drew a breath of relief
The shaft had glanced off the armor of innocence without making the faintest dent
She rushed into the house
She did not dare trust herself with her cousin
What might the demon within her tempt her to say next
Come up Ruth
called her mother
The dress is ready for the last tryon
I think its going to hang beautifully
Ruth dragged herself up the stairs lagged into the sittingroom gazed at the dress with a scowl
What did father say
she asked
Its no use trying to do anything with your father
Ruth flung herself in a corner of the sofa
The only thing I can think of said her mother humbly and timidly is phone the Sinclairs as I originally set out to do
And have the whole town laughing at me



Oh what do I care anyhow
Arthur Sinclairs taller and a sight handsomer
Right in the face Sams as plain as Dicks hatband
His looks is all clothes and polishand mighty poor polish I think
Arthurs got rise in him too while Samwell I dont know whatd become of him if old Wright lost his money
But Arthur a mere promise seemed poor indeed beside Sam the actually arrived
To marry Sam would be to step at once into grandeur to marry Arthur would mean years of struggle
Besides Arthur was heavy at least seemed heavy to light Ruth while Sam was her ideal of gay elegance
I detest Arthur Sinclair she now announced
You can get Sam if you want him said her mother confidently
One evening with a mere child like Susie isnt going to amount to much
Ruth winced
Do you suppose I dont know that
cried she
What makes me so mad is his impudencecoming here to see her when he wouldnt marry her or take her any place
Its insulting to us all
Oh I dont think its as bad as all that Ruthie soothed her mother too simpleminded to accept immediately this clever subtlety of selfdeception
You know this townhow people talk
Why his sister and she related their conversation at the gate that morning
You ought to have sat on her hard Ruth said Mrs Warham with dangerously sparkling eyes
No matter what we may think privately it gives people a low opinion of us to Dont I know that
shrilled Ruth
She began to weep
Im ashamed of myself
But we must try the dress on
Mrs Warham spread the skirt using herself as form
Isnt it too lovely
Ruth dried her eyes as she gazed
The dress was indeed lovely
But her pleasure in it was shadowed by the remembrance that most of the loveliness was due to Susans suggestions
Still she tried it on and felt better
She would linger until Sam came would exhibit herself to him and surely he would not tarry long with Susan
This project improved the situation greatly
She began her toilet for the evening at once though it was only three oclock
Susan finished her pressing and started to dress at fivebecause she knew Ruth would be appealing to her to come in and help put the finishing touches to the toilet for the party
And sure enough at halfpast five before she had nearly finished Ruth with a sneaking humility begged her to come for half a minuteif you dont mindand have got time
Susan did Ruths hair over made her change to another color of stockings and slippers put the dress on her did nearly an hours refitting and redraping
Both were late for supper and after supper Susan had to make certain final amendments to the wonderful toilet and then get herself ready
So it was Ruth alone who went down when Sam Wright came
My but you do look all to the good Ruth
cried Sam
And his eyes no less than his tone showed that he meant it
He hadnt realized what a soft white neck the blond cousin had or how perfectly her shoulders rounded into her slim arms
As Ruth moved to depart he said Dont be in such a rush
Wait till Susie finishes her primping and comes down
She had to help me said Ruth with a righteousness she could justly plume herself upon
Thats why shes late
No I must get along
She was wise enough to resist the temptation to improve upon an already splendid impression
Come as soon as you can
Ill be there in a few minutes Sam assured her convincingly
Save some dances for me
Ruth went away happy
At the gate she glanced furtively back
Sam was looking after her
She marched down the street with light step
I must wear lownecked dresses more in the evenings she said to herself
Its foolish for a girl to hide a good neck
Sam at the edge of the veranda regretting his promise to call on Susan was roused by her voice Did you ever see anything as lovely as Ruth
Sams regret vanished the instant he looked at her and the greedy expression came into his sensual confident young face
Shes a corker said he
But Im content to be where I am
Susans dress was not cut out in the neck was simply of the collarless kind girls of her age wear
It revealed the smooth voluptuous yet slender column of her throat
And her arms bare to just above the elbows were exquisite
But Susans fascination did not lie in any or in all of her charms but in that subtlety of magnetism which account for all the sensational phenomena of the relations of men and women
She was a clever girlclever beyond her years perhapsthough in this day seventeen is not far from fully developed womanhood
But even had she been silly men would have been glad to linger on and on under the spell of the sex call which nature had subtly woven into the texture of her voice into the glance of her eyes into the delicate emanations of her skin
They talked of all manner of thingsgames and college East and Westthe wonders of New Yorkthe weather finally
Sam was every moment of the time puzzling how to bring up the one subject that interested both above all others that interested him to the exclusion of all others
He was an ardent student of the game of man and woman had made considerable progress at itremarkable progress in view of his bare twenty years
He had devised as many openings as an expert chess player
None seemed to fit this difficult case how to make love to a girl of his own class whom his conventional socially ambitious nature forbade him to consider marrying
As he observed her in the moonlight he said to himself Ive got to look out or Ill make a damn fool of myself with her
For his heady passion was fast getting the better of those prudent instincts he had inherited from a father who almost breathed by calculation
While he was still struggling for an opening Susan eager to help him but not knowing how there came from the far interior of the house three distant raps
Gracious
exclaimed Susan
Thats Uncle George
It must be ten oclock
With frank regret Im so sorry
I thought it was early
Yes it did seem as if Id just come said Sam
Her shy innocence was contagious
He felt an awkward country lout
Well I suppose I must go
But youll come againsometime
she asked wistfully
It was her first real beauthe first that had interested herand what a dream lover of a beau he looked standing before her in that wonderful light
Come
Rather
exclaimed he in a tone of enthusiasm that could not but flatter her into a sort of intoxication
Id have hard work staying away
But Ruthshell always be here
Oh she goes out a lotand I dont
Will you telephone menext time shes to be out
Yes agreed she with a hesitation that was explained when she added But dont think youve got to come



Oh I must go in
Good nightSusie
Sam held out his hand
She took it with a queer reluctance
She felt nervous afraid as if there were something uncanny lurking somewhere in those moonlight shadows
She gently tried to draw her hand away but he would not let her
She made a faint struggle then yielded
It was so wonderful the sense of the touch of his hand
Susie
he said hoarsely
And she knew he felt as she did
Before she realized it his arms were round her and his lips had met hers
You drive me crazy he whispered
Both were trembling she had become quite coldher cheeks her hand her body even
You mustnt she murmured drawing gently away
You set me crazy he repeated
Do youlove mea little
Oh I must go
she pleaded
Tears were glistening in her long dark lashes
The sight of them maddened him
Do youSusie
he pleaded
ImImvery young she stammered
YesyesI know he assented eagerly
But not too young to love Susie
No
Because you dodont you
The moonlit world seemed a fairyland
Yes she said softly
I guess so
I must go
I must
And moved beyond her power to control herself she broke from his detaining hand and fled into the house
She darted up to her room paused in the middle of the floor her hands clasped over her wildly beating heart
When she could move she threw open the shutters and went out on the balcony
She leaned against the window frame and gazed up at the stars instinctively seeking the companionship of the infinite
Curiously enough she thought little about Sam
She was awed and wonderstruck before the strange mysterious event within her the opening up the flowering of her soul
These vast emotions where did they come from
What were they
Why did she long to burst into laughter to burst into tears
Why did she do neither but simply stand motionless with the stars blazing and reeling in the sky and her heart beating like mad and her blood surging and ebbing
Was thislove
Yesit must be love
Oh how wonderful love wasand how sadand how happy beyond all laughterand how sweet
She felt an enormous tenderness for everybody and for everything for all the worldan overwhelming sense of beauty and goodness
Her lips were moving
She was amazed to find she was repeating the one prayer she knew the one Aunt Fanny had taught her in babyhood
Why should she find herself praying
Lovelove love
She was a woman and she loved
So this was what it meant to be a woman it meant to love
She was roused by the sound of Ruth saying good night to someone at the gate invisible because of the intervening foliage
Why it must be dreadfully late
The Dipper had moved away round to the south and the heat of the day was all gone and the air was full of the cool scented breath of leaves and flowers and grass
Ruths lights shone out upon the balcony
Susan turned to slip into her own room
But Ruth heard called out peevishly Whos there
Only me cried Susan
She longed to go in and embrace Ruth and kiss her
She would have liked to ask Ruth to let her sleep with her but she felt Ruth wouldnt understand
What are you doing out there
demanded Ruth
Its way after one
OhdearI must go to bed cried Susan
Ruths voice somehow seemed to be knocking and tumbling her new dreamworld
What time did Sam Wright leave here
asked Ruth
She was standing in her window now
Susan saw that her face looked tired and worn almost homely
At ten she replied
Uncle George knocked on the banister
Are you sure it was ten
said Ruth sharply
I guess so
Yesit was ten
Why
Ohnothing
Was he at Sinclairs
He came as it was over
He and Lottie brought me home
Ruth was eyeing her cousin evilly
How did you two get on
Susan flushed from head to foot
Ohsoso she answered in an uncertain voice
I dont know why he didnt come to Sinclairs snapped Ruth
Susan flushed againa delicious warmth from head to foot
She knew why
So he too had been dreaming alone
Love
Love
What are you smiling at
cried Ruth crossly
Was I smiling


Do you want me to help you undress
No was the curt answer
Good night
Please let me unhook it at least urged Susan following Ruth into her room
Ruth submitted
Did you have a good time
asked Susan
Of course snapped Ruth
What made you think I didnt
Dont be a silly dear
I didnt think so
I had an awful timeawful
Ruth began to sob turned fiercely on Susan
Leave me alone
she cried
I hate to have you touch me
The dress was of course entirely unfastened in the back
You had a quarrel with Arthur
asked Susan with sympathy
But you know he cant keep away from you
Tomorrow Be careful Susan how you let Sam Wright hang around you cried Ruth with blazing eyes and trembling lips
You be carefulthats all Ive got to say
Why what do you mean
asked Susan wonderingly
Be careful
Hed never think for a minute of marrying you
The words meant nothing to Susan but the tone stabbed into her heart
Why not
she said
Ruth looked at her cousin hung her head in shame
Gogo
she begged
Please go
Im a bad girlbadbad
Go
And crying hysterically she pushed amazed Susan through the connecting door closed and bolted it
CHAPTER IV WHEN Fanny Warham was young her mothercompelled by her fatherrousedrouted outthe children at halfpast six on week days and at seven on Sundays for prayers and breakfast no matter what time they had gone to bed the night before
The horror of this made such an impression upon her that she never permitted Ruth and Susan to be awakened always they slept until they had had their sleep out
Regularity was no doubt an excellent thing for health and for moral discipline but the best rule could be carried to foolish extremes
Until the last year Mrs Warham had made her two girls live a life of the strictest simplicity and regularity with the result that they were the most amazingly soundly healthy girls in Sutherland
And the regimen still held except when they had company in the evening or went outand Mrs Warham saw to it that there was not too much of that sort of thing
In all her life thus far Susan had never slept less than ten hours rarely less than twelve
It lacked less than a minute of ten oclock the morning after Sams call when Susans eyes opened upon her simple palegray bedroom neat and fresh
She looked sleepily at the little clock on the night stand
Mercy me
she cried
And her bare feet were on the floor and she was stretching her lithe young body weak from the relaxation of her profound sleep
She heard someone stirring in Ruths room instantly Ruths remark Hed never think for a minute of marrying you popped into her head
It still meant nothing to her
She could not have explained why it came back or why she fell to puzzling over it as if it held some mysterious meaning
Perhaps the reason was that from early childhood there had been accumulating in some dusky chamber of her mind stray happenings and remarks all baring upon the unsuspected secret of her birth and the unsuspected strangeness of her position in the world where everyone else was definitely placed and ticketed
She was wondering about Ruths queer hysterical outburst evidently the result of a quarrel with Arthur Sinclair
I guess Ruth cares more for him than she lets on thought she
This love that had come to her so suddenly and miraculously made her alert for signs of love elsewhere
She went to the bolted connecting door she could not remember when it had ever been bolted before and she felt forlorn and shut out
Ruth
she called
Is that you
A brief silence then a faint Yes
May I come in
Youd better take your bath and get downstairs
This reminded her that she was hungry
She gathered her underclothes together and with the bundle in her arms darted across the hall into the bathroom
The cold water acted as champagne promises to act but doesnt
She felt giddy with health and happiness
And the bright sun was flooding the bathroom and the odors from the big bed of hyacinths in the side lawn scented the warm breeze from the open window
When she dashed back to her room she was singing and her singing voice was as charming as her speaking voice promised
A few minutes and her hair had gone up in careless grace and she was clad in a fresh dress of tan linen full in the blouse
This with her tan stockings and tan slippers and the radiant youth of her face gave her a look of utter cleanness and freshness that was exceedingly good to see
Im ready she called
There was no answer doubtless Ruth had already descended
She rushed downstairs and into the diningroom
No one was at the little table set in one of the windows in readiness for the late breakfasters
Molly came bringing cocoa a cereal hot biscuit and crabapple preserves all attractively arranged on a large tray
I didnt bring much Miss Susie she apologized
Its so late and I dont want you to spoil your dinner
Were going to have the grandest chicken that ever came out of an egg
Susan surveyed the tray with delighted eyes
Thats plenty she said if you dont talk too much about the chicken
Wheres Ruth
She aint coming down
Shes got a headache
It was that salad for supper over to Sinclairs last night
Salad aint fit for a dog to eat nohowthats my opinion
And at nightits sure to bust your face out or give you the headache or both
Susan ate with her usual enthusiasm thinking the while of Sam and wondering how she could contrive to see him
She remembered her promise to her uncle
She had not eaten nearly so much as she wanted
But up she sprang and in fifteen minutes was on her way to the store
She had seen neither Ruth nor her aunt
Hell be waiting for me to pass she thought
And she was not disappointed
There he stood at the footpath gate into his fathers place
He had arrayed himself in a blue and white flannel suit white hat and shoes a big expensivelooking cigarette adorned his lips
The Martins the Delevans the Castles and the Bowens neighbors across the way were watching him admiringly through the meshes of lace window curtains
She expected that he would come forward eagerly
Instead he continued to lean indolently on the gate as if unaware of her approach
And when she was close at hand his bow and smile were so it seemed to her almost coldly polite
Into her eyes came a confused hurt expression
Susiesweetheart he said the voice in as astonishing contrast as the words to his air of friendly indifference
Theyre watching us from the windows all around here
Ohyes assented she as if she understood
But she didnt
In Sutherland the young people were not so mindful of gossip which it was impossible to escape anyhow
Stilloff there in the East no doubt they had more refined ways without a doubt whatever Sam did was the correct thing
Do you still care as you did last night
he asked
The effect of his words upon her was so obvious that he glanced nervously round
It was delightful to be able to evoke a love like this but he did wish others werent looking
Im going to Uncles store she said
Im late
Ill walk part of the way with you he volunteered and they started on
Thatthat kiss he stammered
I can feel it yet
She blushed deeply happily
Her beauty made him tingle
So can I she said
They walked in silence several squares
When will I see you again
he asked
Tonight
Yesdo come down
ButRuthll be there
I believe Artie Sinclairs coming
Oh that counterjumper
She looked at him in surprise
Hes an awfully nice fellow said she
About the nicest in town
Of course replied Sam elaborately
I beg your pardon
They think differently about those things in the East
What thing
No matter
Sam whose secret dream was to marry some fashionable Eastern woman and cut a dash in Fifth Avenue life had no intention of explaining what was what to one who would not understand would not approve and would be made auspicious of him
I suppose Ruth and Sinclairll pair off and give us a chance
Youll come
Right after dinsupper I mean
In the East we have dinner in the evening
Isnt that queer
exclaimed Susan
But she was thinking of the joys in store for her at the close of the day
I must go back now said Sam
Far up the street he saw his sisters pony cart coming
You might as well walk to the store
It seemed to her that they both had ever so much to say to each other and had said nothing
No
I cant go any further
Goodbythat is till tonight
He was red and stammering
As they shook hands emotion made them speechless
He stumbled awkwardly as he turned to leave became still more hotly selfconscious when he saw the grin on the faces of the group of loungers at a packing case near the curb
Susan did not see the loafers did not see anything distinctly
Her feet sought the uneven brick sidewalk uncertainly and the blood was pouring into her cheeks was steaming in her brain making a red mist before her eyes
She was glad he had left her
The joy of being with him was so keen that it was pain
Now she could breathe freely and could dreamdreamdream
She made blunder after blunder in working over the accounts with her uncle and he began to tease her
You sure are in love Brownie declared he
Her painful but happy blush delighted him
Tell me all about it
She shook her head bending it low to hide her color
No


Sometime
She nodded
She was glancing shyly and merrily at him now
Well some hold that first loves best
Maybe so
But it seems to me any times good enough
Stillthe first times mighty fine eh
He sighed
My but its good to be young
And he patted her thick wavy hair
It did not leak out until supper that Sam was coming
Warham said to Susan While Ruths looking out for Artie you and Ill have a game or so of chess Brownie
Susan colored violently
What
laughed Warham
Are you going to have a beau too
Susan felt two pairs of feminine eyes pouncehostile eyes savagely curious
She paled with fright as queer as unprecedented as those hostile glances
It seemed to her that she had done or was about to do something criminal
She could not speak
An awful silence then her auntshe no longer seemed her loving auntasked in an ominous voice Is someone coming to see you Susan
Sam Wrightstammered SusanI saw him this morninghe was at their gateand he saidI think hes coming
A dead silenceWarham silent because he was eating but the two others not for that reason
Susan felt horribly guilty and for no reason
Id have spoken of it before she said but there didnt seem to be any chance
She had the instinct of fine shy nature to veil the soul she found it hard to speak of anything as sacred as this love of hers and whatever related to it
I cant allow this Susie said her aunt with lips tightly drawn against the teeth
You are too young
Oh come now mother cried Warham goodhumoredly
Thats foolishness
Let the young folks have a good time
You didnt think you were too young at Susies age
You dont understand George said Fanny after she had given him a private frown
Susies gaze was on the tablecloth
I cant permit Sam to come here to see Susie
Ruths eyes were down also
About her lips was a twitching that meant a struggle to hide a pleased smile
Ive no objection to Susies having boys of her own age come to see her continued Mrs Warham in the same precise restrained manner
But Sam is too old
Now mother Mrs Warham met his eyes steadily
I must protect my sisters child George she said
At last she had found what she felt was a just reason for keeping Sam away from Susan so her tone was honest and strong
Warham lowered his gaze
He understood
Ohas you think best Fan I didnt mean to interfere said he awkwardly
He turned on Susan with his affection in his eyes
Well Brownie it looks like chess with your old uncle doesnt it
Susans bosom was swelling her lip trembling
II she began
She choked back the sobs faltered out I dont think I could Uncle and rushed from the room
There was an uncomfortable pause
Then Warham said I must say Fan I thinkif you had to do ityou might have spared the girls feelings
Mrs Warham felt miserable about it also
Susie took me by surprise she apologized
Then defiantly And what else can I do
You know he doesnt come for any good
Warham stared in amazement
Now what does that mean
he demanded
You know very well what it means retorted his wife
Her tone made him understand
He reddened and with too blustering anger brought his fist down on the table
Susans our daughter
Shes Ruths sister
Ruth pushed back her chair and stood up
Her expression made her look much older than she was
I wish you could induce the rest of the town to think that papa said she
Itd make my position less painful
And she too left the room
Whats she talking about
asked Warham
Its true George replied Fanny with trembling lip
Its all my faultinsisting on keeping her
I might have known
I think you and Ruth must be crazy
Ive seen no sign
Have you seen any of the boys calling on Susan since she shot up from a child to a girl
Havent you noticed she isnt invited any more except when it cant be avoided
Warhams face was fiery with rage
He looked helplessly furiously about
But he said nothing
To fight public sentiment would be like trying to thrust back with ones fists an oncreeping fog
Finally he cried Its too outrageous to talk about
If I only knew what to do
moaned Fanny
A long silence while Warham was grasping the fullness of the meaning the frightful meaning in these revelations so astounding to him
At last he said Does she realize
I guess so 


I dont know 


I dont believe she does
Shes the most innocent child that ever grew up
If I had a chance Id sell out and move away
Where
said his wife
Where would people accepther
Warham became suddenly angry again
I dont believe it
he cried his look and tone contradicting his words
Youve been making a mountain out of a molehill
And he strode from the room flung on his hat and went for a walk
As Mrs Warham came from the diningroom a few minutes later Ruth appeared in the side veranda doorway
I think Ill telephone Arthur to come tomorrow evening instead said she
Hed not like it with Sam here too
That would be better assented her mother
Yes Id telephone him if I were you
Thus it came about that Susan descending the stairs to the library to get a book heard Ruth say into the telephone in her sweetest voice Yestomorrow evening Arthur
Some others are comingthe Wrights
Youd have to talk to Lottie 


I dont blame you



Tomorrow evening then
So sorry
Goodby
The girl on the stairway stopped short shrank against the wall
A moment and she hastily reascended entered her room closed the door
Love had awakened the woman and the woman was not so unsuspecting so easily deceived as the child had been
She understood what her cousin and her aunt were about they were trying to take her lover from her
She understood her aunts looks and tones her cousins temper and hysteria
She sat down upon the floor and cried with a breaking heart
The injustice of it
The meanness of it
The wickedness of a world where even her sweet cousin even her loving aunt were wicked
She sat there on the floor a long time abandoned to the misery of a first shattered illusion a misery the more cruel because never before had either cousin or aunt said or done anything to cause her real pain
The sound of voices coming through the open window from below made her start up and go out on the balcony
She leaned over the rail
She could not see the veranda for the masses of creeper but the voices were now quite plain in the stillness
Ruths voice gay and incessant
Presently a mans voice hisand laughing
Then his voice speakingthen the two voices mingledboth talking at once so eager were they
Her loverand Ruth was stealing him from her
Oh the baseness the treachery
And her aunt was helping


Sore of heart utterly forlorn she sat in the balcony hammock aching with love and jealousy
Every now and then she ran in and looked at the clock
He was staying on and on though he must have learned she was not coming down
She heard her uncle and aunt come up to bed
Now the piano in the parlor was going
First it was Ruth singing one of her pretty love songs in that clear small voice of hers
Then Sam played and sanghow his voice thrilled her
Again it was Ruthie singingSweet Dream FacesSusan began to sob afresh
She could see Ruth at the piano how beautiful she lookedand that songit would be impossible for him not to be impressed
She felt the jealousy of despair



Ten oclockhalfpasteleven oclock
She heard them at the edge of the verandaso at last he was going
She was able to hear their words now Youll be up for the tennis in the morning
he was saying
At ten replied Ruth
Of course Susies asked too he saidand his voice sounded careless not at all earnest
Certainly was her cousins reply
But Im not sure she can come
It was all the girl at the balcony rail could do to refrain from crying out a protest
But Sam was saying to Ruth Wellgood night
Havent had so much fun in a long time
May I come again
If you dont Ill think you were bored
Bored
He laughed
Thats too ridiculous
See you in the morning
Good night



Give my love to Susie and tell her I was sorry not to see her
Susan was all in a glow as her cousin answered Ill tell her
doubtless Sam didnt note it but Susan heard the constraint the hypocrisy in that sweet voice
She watched him stroll down to the gate under the arch of boughs dimly lit by the moon
She stretched her arms passionately toward him
Then she went in to go to bed
But at the sound of Ruth humming gayly in the next room she realized that she could not sleep with her heart full of evil thoughts
She must have it out with her cousin
She knocked on the still bolted door
What is it
asked Ruth coldly
Let me in answered Susan
Ive got to see you
Go to bed Susie
Its late
You must let me in
The bolt shot back
All right
And please unhook my dresstheres a dear
Susan opened the door stood on the threshold all her dark passion in her face
Ruth
she cried
Ruth had turned her back in readiness for the service the need of which had alone caused her to unbolt the door
At that swift fierce ejaculation she started wheeled round
At sight of that wild anger she paled
Why Susie
she gasped
Ive found you out
raged Susan
Youre trying to steal him from meyou and Aunt Fanny
It isnt fair
Ill not stand it
What are you talking about
cried Ruth
You must have lost your senses
Ill not stand it Susan repeated advancing threateningly He loves me and I love him
Ruth laughed
You foolish girl
Why he cares nothing about you
The idea of your having your head turned by a little politeness
He loves me he told me so
And I love him
I told him so
Hes mine
You shant take him from me
He told you he loved you
Ruths eyes were gleaming and her voice was shrill with hate
He told you that
Yeshe did
I dont believe you
We love each other cried the dark girl
He came to see me
Youve got Arthur Sinclair
You shant take him away
The two girls shaking with fury were facing each other were looking into each others eyes
If Sam Wright told you he loved you said Ruth with the icy deliberateness of a coldhearted anger he was trying toto make a fool of you
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
Were trying to save you
He and I are engaged
declared Susan
You shant take himand you cant
He loves me
Engaged
jeered Ruth
Engaged
she laughed pretending not to believe yet believing
She was beside herself with jealous anger
Yeswell save you from yourself
Youre like your mother
Youd disgrace usas she did
Dont you dare talk that way Ruth Warham
Its falsefalse
My mother is deadand youre a wicked girl
Its time you knew the truth said Ruth softly
Her eyes were half shut now and sparkling devilishly
You havent got any name
You havent got any father
And no man of any position would marry you
As for Sam She laughed contemptuously
Do you suppose Sam Wright would marry a girl without a name
Susan had shrunk against the door jamb
She understood only dimly but things understood dimly are worse than things that are clear
Me
she muttered
Me
Oh Ruth you dont mean that
Its true said Ruth calmly
And the sooner you realize it the less likely you are to go the way your mother did
Susan stood as if petrified
If Sam Wright comes hanging round you any more youll know how to treat him Ruth went on
Youll appreciate that he hasnt any respect for youthat he thinks youre someone to be trifled with
And if he talked engagement it was only a pretense
Do you understand
The girl leaning in the doorway gazed into vacancy
After a while she answered dully I guess so
Ruth began to fuss with the things on her bureau
Susan went into her room sat on the edge of the bed
A few minutes and Ruth somewhat cooled down and not a little frightened entered
She looked uneasily at the motionless figure
Finally she said Susie
No answer
More sharply Susie
Yes said Susan without moving
You understand that I told you for your own good
And youll not say anything to mother or father
They feel terribly about it and dont want it ever mentioned
You wont let on that you know
Ill not tell said Susan
You know were fond of youand want to do everything for you
No answer
It wasnt truewhat you said about Sams making love to you
Thats all over
I dont want to talk about it
Youre not angry with me Susie
I admit I was angry but it was best for you to knowwasnt it
Yes said Susan
Youre not angry with me
No
Ruth still more uneasy turned back into her own room because there was nothing else to do
She did not shut the door between
When she was in her nightgown she glanced in at her cousin
The girl was sitting on the edge of the bed in the same position
Its after midnight said Ruth
Youd better get undressed
Susan moved a little
I will she said
Ruth went to bed and soon fell asleep
After an hour or so she awakened
Light was streaming through the open connecting door
She ran to it looked in
Susans clothes were in a heap beside the bed
Susan herself with the pillows propping her was staring wideeyed at the ceiling
It was impossible for Ruth to realize any part of the effect upon her cousin of a thing she herself had known for years and had taken always as a matter of course she simply felt mildly sorry for unfortunate Susan
Susie dear she said gently do you want me to turn out the light
Yes said Susan
Ruth switched off the light and went back to bed better content
She felt that now Susan would stop her staring and would go to sleep
Sams call had been very satisfactory
Ruth felt she had shown off to the best advantage felt that he admired her would come to see her next time
And now that she had so arranged it that Susan would avoid him everything would turn out as she wished
Ill use Arthur to make him jealous after a whileand thenIll have things my own way
As she fell asleep she was selecting the rooms Sam and she would occupy in the big Wright mansionwhen were not in the East or in Europe
CHAPTER V RUTH had forgotten to close her shutters so toward seven oclock the light which had been beating against her eyelids for three hours succeeded in lifting them
She stretched herself and yawned noisily
Susan appeared in the connecting doorway
Are you awake
she said softly
What time is it
asked Ruth too lazy to turn over and look at her clock
Ten to seven
Do close my shutters for me
Ill sleep an hour or two
She hazily made out the figure in the doorway
Youre dressed arent you
she inquired sleepily
Yes replied Susan
Ive been waiting for you to wake
Something in the tone made Ruth forget about sleep and rub her fingers over her eyes to clear them for a view of her cousin
Susan seemed about as usualperhaps a little serious but then she had the habit of strange moods of seriousness
What did you want
said Ruth
Susan came into the room sat at the foot of the bedthere was room as the bed was long and Ruth short
I want you to tell me what my mother did
Did
echoed Ruth feebly
Did to disgrace you andme
Oh I couldnt explainnot in a few words
Im so sleepy
Dont bother about it Susan
And she thrust her head deeper into the pillow
Close the shutters
Then Ill have to ask Aunt Fannyor Uncle George or everybodytill I find out
But you mustnt do that protested Ruth flinging herself from left to right impatiently
What is it you want to know
About my motherand what she did
And why I have no fatherwhy Im not like youand the other girls
Ohits nothing
I cant explain
Dont bother about it
Its no use
It cant be helped
And it doesnt really matter
Ive been thinking said Susan
I understand a great many things I didnt know Id noticedever since I was a baby
But what I dont understand She drew a long breath a cautious breath as if there were danger of awakening a pain
What I dont understand iswhy
Andyou must tell me all about it



Was my mother bad
Not exactly bad Ruth answered uncertainly
But she did one thing that was wickedat least that a woman never can be forgiven for if its found out
Did shedid she take something that didnt belong to her
Nonothing like that
No she was they say as nice and sweet as she could beexceptShe wasnt married to your father
Susan sat in a brown study
I cant understand she said at last
Whyshe must have been married ororthere wouldnt have been me
Ruth smiled uneasily
Not at all
Dont you really understand
Susan shook her head
Hehe betrayed herand left herand then everybody knew because you came
Susans violetgray eyes rested a grave inquiring glance upon her cousins face
But if he betrayed herWhat does betray mean
Doesnt it mean he promised to marry her and didnt
Something like that said Ruth
Yessomething like that
Then he was the disgrace said the dark cousin after reflecting
Noyoure not telling me Ruth
What did my mother do
She had you without being married
Again Susan sat in silence trying to puzzle it out
Ruth lifted herself put the pillows behind her back
You dont understandanythingdo you
Well Ill try to explainthough I dont know much about it
And hesitatingly choosing words she thought fitted to those innocent ears hunting about for expressions she thought comprehensible to that innocent mind Ruth explained the relations of the sexesan inaccurate often absurd explanation for she herself knew only what she had picked up from other girlsthe fantastic hodgepodge of pruriency physiology and sheer nonsense which under our system of education distorts and either alarms or inflames the imaginations of girls and boys where the clean simple truth would at least enlighten them
Susan listened with increasing amazement
Well do you understand
Ruth ended
How we come into the worldand what marriage means
I dont believe it declared Susan
Itsawful
And she shivered with disgust
I tell you its true insisted Ruth
I thought it was awful when I first heardwhen Lottie Wright took me out in their orchard where nobody could listen and told me what their cook had told her
But Ive got kind of used to it
But itits so then my mother did marry my father said Susan
No
She let him betray her
And when a woman lets a man betray her without being married by the preacher or somebody why shes ruined forever
But doesnt marriage mean where two people promise to love each other and then betray each other
If theyre married it isnt betraying explained Ruth
If theyre not it is betraying
Susan reflected nodded slowly
I guess I understand
But dont you see it was my father who was the disgrace
He was the one that promised to marry and didnt
How foolish you are
cried Ruth
I never knew you to be stupid
But isnt it so
persisted Susan
Yesin a way her cousin admitted
Onlythe woman must keep herself pure until the ceremony has been performed
But if he said so to her wasnt that saying so to God just as much as if the preacher had been there
No it wasnt said Ruth with irritation
And its wicked to think such things
All I know is God says a woman must be married before shebefore she has any children
And your mother wasnt
Susan shook her head
I guess you dont understand any better than I doreally
No I dont confessed Ruth
But Id like to see any man more than kiss me or put his arm round me without our having been married
But urged Susan if he kissed you wouldnt that be like marriage
Some say so admitted Ruth
But Im not so strict
A little kissing and that often leads a man to propose
Susan reflected again
It all sounds low and sneaking to me was her final verdict
I dont want to have anything to do with it
But Im sure my mother was a good woman
It wasnt her fault if she was lied to when she loved and believed
And anybody who blames her is low and bad
Im glad I havent got any father if fathers have to be made to promise before everybody or else theyll not keep their word
Well Ill not argue about it said Ruth
Im telling you the way things are
The woman has to take all the blame
Susan lifted her head haughtily
Id be glad to be blamed by anybody who was wicked enough to be that unjust
Id not have anything to do with such people
Then youd live alone
No I shouldnt
There are lots of people who are good and Thats wicked Susan interrupted Ruth
All good people think as I tell you they do
Do Aunt Fanny and Uncle George blame my mother
Of course
How could they help it when she Ruth was checked by the gathering lightnings in those violetgray eyes
But pursued Susan after a pause even if they were wicked enough to blame my mother they couldnt blame me
Of course not declared Ruth warmly
Hasnt everybody always been sweet and kind to you
But last night you said Ruth hid her face
Im ashamed of what I said last night she murmured
Ive got Oh such a nasty disposition Susie
But what you saidwasnt it so
Ruth turned away her head
Susan drew a long sigh so quietly that Ruth could not have heard
You understand Ruth said gently everybody feels sorry for you and Susan frowned stormily Theyd better feel sorry for themselves
Oh Susie dear cried Ruth impulsively catching her hand we all love you and mother and father and Iwell stand up for you through everything Dont you dare feel sorry for me
Susan cried wrenching her hand away
Ruths eyes filled with tears
You cant blame us because everybodyYou know God says The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children Im done with everybody cried Susan rising and lifting her proud head Im done with God
Ruth gave a low scream and shuddered
Susan looked round defiantly as if she expected a bolt from the blue to come hurtling through the open window
But the sky remained serene and the quiet scented breeze continued to play with the lace curtains and the birds on the balcony did not suspend their chattering courtship
This lack of immediate effect from her declaration of war upon man and God was encouraging
The last of the crushed cowed feeling Ruth had inspired the night before disappeared
With a soul haughtily plumed and looking defiance from the violetgray eyes Susan left her cousin and betook herself down to breakfast
In common with most children she had always dreamed of a mysterious fate for herself different from the commonplace routine around her
Ruths revelations far from daunting her far from making her feel like cringing before the world in gratitude for its tolerance of her bar sinister seemed a fascinatingly tragic confirmation of her romantic longings and beliefs
No doubt it was the difference from the common lot that had attracted Sam to her and this difference would make their love wholly unlike the commonplace Sutherland wooing and wedding
Yes hers had been a mysterious fate and would continue to be
Nora an old woman now had often related in her presence how Doctor Stevens had brought her to life when she lay apparently indeed really dead upon the upstairs sittingroom tableDoctor Stevens and Noras own prayers
An extraordinary birth in defiance of the laws of God and man an extraordinary resurrection in defiance of the laws of natureyes hers would be a life superbly different from the common
And when she and Sam married how gracious and forgiving she would be to all those badhearted people how she would shame them for their evil thoughts against her mother and herself
The Susan Lenox who sat alone at the little table in the diningroom window eating bread and butter and honey in the comb was apparently the same Susan Lenox who had taken three meals a day in that room all those yearswas indeed actually the same for character is not an overnight creation
Yet it was an amazingly different Susan Lenox too
The first crisis had come she had been put to the test and she had not collapsed in weakness but had stood erect in strength
After breakfast she went down Main Street and at Crooked Creek Avenue took the turning for the cemetery
She sought the Warham plot on the western slope near the quiet brook
There was a clump of cedars at each corner of the plot near the largest of them were three little gravesthe three dead children of George and Fanny
In the shadow of the clump and nearest the brook was a fourth grave apart and to the girl now thrillingly mysterious LORELLA LENOX BORN MAY 9 1859 DIED JULY 17 1879 Twenty years old
Susans tears scalded her eyes
Only a little older than her cousin Ruth was nowRuth who often seemed to her and to everybody younger than herself
And she was goodI know she was good
thought Susan
He was bad and the people who took his part against her were bad
But she was good
She started as Sams voice gay and light sounded directly behind her
What are you doing in a graveyard
cried he
How did you find me
she asked paling and flushing and paling again
Ive been following you ever since you left home
He might have added that he did not try to overtake her until they were where people would be least likely to see
Whose graves are those
he went on cutting across a plot and stepping on several graves to join her
She was gazing at her mothers simple headstone
His glance followed hers he read
Ohbeg pardon he said confusedly
I didnt see
She turned her serious gaze from the headstone to his face which her young imagination transfigured
You knowabout her
she asked
IIIve heard he confessed
ButSusie it doesnt amount to anything
It happened a long time agoand everybodys forgottenand His stammering falsehoods died away before her steady look
How did you find out
Someone just told me replied she
And they said youd never respect or marry a girl who had no father
Nodont denyplease
I didnt believe itnot after what we had said to each other
Sam red and shifting uneasily could not even keep his downcast eyes upon the same spot of ground
You see she went on sweet and grave they dont understand what love meansdo they
I guess not muttered he completely unnerved
Why how seriously the girl had taken him and his wordssuch a few words and not at all definite
No he decided it was the kiss
He had heard of girls so innocent that they thought a kiss meant the same as being married
He got himself together as well as he could and looked at her
But Susie he said youre too young for anything definiteand Im not halfway through college
I understand said she
But you need not be afraid Ill change
She was so sweet so magnetic so compelling that in spite of the frowns of prudence he seized her hand
At her touch he flung prudence to the winds
I love you he cried and putting his arm around her he tried to kiss her
She gently but strongly repulsed him
Why not dear
he pleaded
You love medont you
Yes she replied her honest eyes shining upon his
But we must wait until were married
I dont care so much for the others but Id not want Uncle George to feel I had disgraced him
Why theres no harm in a kiss pleaded he
Kissing you isdifferent she replied
Itsitsmarriage
He understood her innocence that frankly assumed marriage where a sophisticated girl would in the guilt of designing thoughts have shrunk in shame from however vaguely suggesting such a thing
He realized to the full his peril
Im a damn fool he said to himself to hang about her
But somehow I cant help itI cant
And the truth was he loved her as much as a boy of his age is capable of loving and he would have gone on and married her but for the snobbishness smeared on him by the provincialism of the small town and burned in by the toadyism of his fashionable college set
As he looked at her he saw beauty beyond any he had ever seen elsewhere and a sweetness and honesty that made him ashamed before her
No I couldnt harm her he told himself
Im not such a dog as that
But theres no harm in loving her and kissing her and making her as happy as its right to be
Dont be mean Susan he begged tears in his eyes
If you love me youll let me kiss you
And she yielded and the shock of the kiss set both to trembling
It appealed to his vanity it heightened his own agitations to see how pale she had grown and how her rounded bosom rose and fell in the wild tumult of her emotions
Oh I cant do without seeing you she cried
And Aunt Fanny has forbidden me
I thought so
exclaimed he
I did what I could last night to throw them off the track
If Ruth had only known what I was thinking about all the time
Where were you
Upstairson the balcony
I felt it he declared
And when she sang love songs I could hardly keep from rushing up to you
Susie we must see each other
I can come here almost any day
But peopled soon find outand theyd say all sorts of things
And your uncle and aunt would hear
There was no disputing anything so obvious
Couldnt you come down tonight after the others are in bed and the house is quiet
he suggested
She hesitated before the deception though she felt that her family had forfeited the right to control her
But love being the supreme necessity conquered
For a few minutes she conceded
She had been absorbed but his eyes kept alert by his conventional soul had seen several people at a distance observing without seeming to do so
We must separate he now said
You see Susie we mustnt be gossiped about
You know how determined they are to keep us apart
Yesyes she eagerly agreed
Will you go first or shall I
You gothe way you came
Ill jump the brook down where its narrow and cut across and into our place by the back way
What time tonight
Arthurs coming reflected Susie aloud
Ruthll not let him stay late
Shell be sleepy and will go straight to bed
About half past ten
If Im not on the front verandano the side verandaby eleven youll know something has prevented
But youll surely come
Ill come
And it both thrilled and alarmed him to see how much in earnest she was
But he looked love into her loving eyes and went away too intoxicated to care whither this adventure was leading him
At dinner she felt she was no longer a part of this family
Were they not all pitying and looking down on her in their hearts
She was like a deformed person who has always imagined the consideration he has had was natural and equal and suddenly discovers that it is pity for his deformity
She now acutely felt her aunts her cousins dislike and her uncles gentleness was not less galling
In her softly rounded youthful face there was revealed definitely for the first time an underlying expression of strength of what is often confused with its feeble counterfeit obstinacythat power to resist circumstances which makes the unusual and the firm character
The young mobility of her features suggested the easy swaying of the baby sapling in the gentlest breeze
Singularly at variance with it was this expression of tenacity
Such an expression in the face of the young infallibly forecasts an agitated and agitating life
It seemed amazingly out of place in Susan because theretofore she had never been put to the test in any but unnoted trifles and so had given the impression that she was as docile as she was fearful of giving annoyance or pain and indifferent to having her own way
Those who have this temperament of strength encased in gentleness are invariably misunderstood
When they assert themselves though they are in the particular instance wholly right they are regarded as wholly and outrageously wrong
Life deals hardly with them punishes them for the mistaken notion of themselves they have through forbearance and gentleness of heart permitted an unobservant world to form
Susan spent the afternoon on the balcony before her window reading and sewingor rather dreaming over first a book then a dress
When she entered the diningroom at supper time the others were already seated
She saw instantly that something had occurredsomething ominous for her
Mrs Warham gave her a penetrating severe look and lowered her eyes Ruth was gazing sullenly at her plate
Warhams glance was stern and reproachful
She took her place opposite Ruth and the meal was eaten in silence
Ruth left the table first
Next Mrs Warham rose and saying Susan when youve finished I wish to see you in the sittingroom upstairs swept in solemn dignity from the room
Susan rose at once to follow
As she was passing her uncle he put out his hand and detained her
I hope it was only a foolish girls piece of nonsense said he with an attempt at his wonted kindliness
And I know it wont occur again
But when your aunt says things you wont like to hear remember that you brought this on yourself and that she loves you as we all do and is thinking only of your good
What is it Uncle George
cried Susan amazed
What have I done
Warham looked sternly grieved
Brownie he reproached you mustnt deceive
Go to your aunt
She found her aunt seated stiffly in the livingroom her hands folded upon her stomach
So gradual had been the crucial middlelife change in Fanny that no one had noted it
This evening Susan become morbidly acute suddenly realized the contrast between the severe uncertaintempered aunt of today and the amiable altogether and always gentle aunt of two years before
What is it aunt
she said feeling as if she were before a stranger and an enemy
The whole town is talking about your disgraceful doings this morning Ruths mother replied in a hard voice
The color leaped in Susans cheeks
Yesterday I forbade you to see Sam Wright again
And already you disobey
I did not say I would not see him again replied Susan
I thought you were an honest obedient girl cried Fanny the high shrill notes in her voice rasping upon the sensitive the now morbidly sensitive Susan
Insteadyou slip away from the house and meet a young manand permit him to take liberties with you
Susan braced herself
I did not go to the cemetery to meet him she replied and that new or rather newly revived tenacity was strong in her eyes in the set of her sweet mouth
He saw me on the way and followed
I did let him kiss meonce
But I had the right to
You have disgraced yourselfand us all
We are going to be married
I dont want to hear such foolish talk
cried Mrs Warham violently
If you had any sense youd know better
He and I do not feel as you do about my mother said the girl with quiet dignity
Mrs Warham shivered before this fling
Who told you
she demanded
It doesnt matter I know
Well miss since you know then I can tell you that your uncle and I realize youre going the way your mother went
And the whole town thinks youve gone already
Theyre all saying I told you so
I told you so
Like her mother
Mrs Warham was weeping hysterical tears of fury
The whole town
And itll reflect on my Ruth
Oh you miserable girl
Whatever possessed me to take pity on you
Susans hands clutched until the nails sunk into the palms
She shut her teeth together turned to fly
Wait
commanded Mrs Warham
Wait I tell you
Susan halted in the doorway but did not turn
Your uncle and I have talked it over
Oh
cried Susan
Mrs Warhams eyes glistened
Yes he has wakened up at last
Theres one thing he isnt soft about Youve turned him against me
cried the girl despairingly
You mean you have turned him against you retorted her aunt
Anyhow you cant wheedle him this time
Hes as bent as I am
And you must promise us that you wont see Sam again
A pause
Then Susan said I cant
Then well send you away to your Uncle Zekes
Its quiet out there and youll have a chance to think things over
And I reckon hell watch you
Hes never forgiven your mother
Now will you promise
No said Susan calmly
You have wicked thoughts about my mother and you are being wicked to meyou and Ruth
Oh I understand
Dont you dare stand there and lie that way
raved Mrs Warham
Ill give you tonight to think about it
If you dont promise you leave this house
Your uncle has been weak where you were concerned but this caper of yours has brought him to his senses
Well not have you a loose characterand your cousins life spoiled by it
First thing we know no respectable manll marry her either
From between the girls shut teeth issued a cry
She darted across the hall locked herself in her room
CHAPTER VI SAM did not wait until Arthur Sinclair left but all ardor and impatience stole in at the Warhams front gate at ten oclock
He dropped to the grass behind a clump of lilacs and to calm his nerves and to make the time pass more quickly smoked a cigarette keeping its lighted end carefully hidden in the hollow of his hand
He was not twenty feet away was seeing and hearing when Arthur kissed Ruth good night
He laughed to himself
How disappointed she looked last night when she saw I wasnt going to do that
What a charmer Susie must be when the thought of her made the idea of kissing as pretty a girl as Ruth uninteresting almost distasteful
Sinclair departed the lights in parlor and hall went out presently light appeared through the chinks in some of the secondstory shutters
Then followed threequarters of an hour of increasing tension
The tension would have been even greater had he seen the young lady going leisurely about her preparations for bed
For Ruth was of the orderly precise women who are created to foster the virtue of patience in those about them
It took her nearly as long to dress for bed as for a party
She did her hair up in curl papers with the utmost care she washed and rinsed and greased her face and neck and gave them a thorough massage
She shook out and carefully hung or folded or put to air each separate garment
She examined her silk stockings for holes found one darned it with a neatness rivaling that of a stoppeur
She removed from her dressing table and put away in drawers everything that was out of place
She closed each drawer tightly closed and locked the closets looked under the bed turned off the lights over the dressing table
She completed her toilet with a slow washing of her teeth a long spraying of her throat and a deliberate thoroughgoing dripping of boracic acid into each eye to keep and improve its clearness and brilliancy
She sat on the bed reflected on what she had done to assure herself that nothing had been omitted
After a slow look around she drew off her bedroom slippers set them carefully side by side near the head of the bed
She folded her nightgown neatly about her legs thrust them down into the bed
Again she looked slowly searchingly about the room to make absolutely sure she had forgotten nothing had put everything in perfect order
Once in bed she hated to get out yet if she should recall any omission however slight she would be unable to sleep until she had corrected it
Finally sure as fallible humanity can be she turned out the last light lay downwent instantly to sleep
It was hardly a quarter of an hour after the vanishing of that last ray when Sam standing now with heart beating fast and a lump of expectancy perhaps of trepidation too in his throat saw a figure issue from the front door and move round to the side veranda
He made a detour on the lawn so as to keep out of view both from house and street came up to the veranda called to her softly
Can you get over the rail
asked she in the same low tone
Lets go back to the summer house urged he
No
Come up here she insisted
Be careful
The windows above are open
He climbed the rail noiselessly and made an impetuous move for her hand
She drew back
No Sam dear she said
I know its foolish
But Ive an instinct against itand we mustnt
She spoke so gently that he persisted and pleaded
It was some time before he realized how much firmness there was under her gentleness
She was so afraid of making him cross yet he also saw that she would withstand at any cost
He placed himself beside her on the wicker lounge sitting close his cheek almost against hers that they might hear each other without speaking above a whisper
After one of those silences which are the peculiar delight of lovers she drew a long breath and said Ive got to go away Sam
I shant see you again for a long time
They heard about this morning
Theyre sending you away
NoIm going
They feel that Im a disgrace and a drag
So I cant stay
Butyouve got to stay
protested Sam
In wild alarm he suspected she was preparing to make him elope with herand he did not know to what length of folly his infatuation might whirl him
Youve no place to go he urged
Ill find a place said she
You mustntyou mustnt Susie
Why youre only seventeenand have no experience
Ill get experience said she
Nothing could be so bad as staying here
Cant you see that
He could not
Like so many of the children of the rich he had no trace of overnice sense of selfrespect having been lying and toadying all his life to a father who used the power of his wealth at home no less rather more than abroad
But he vaguely realized what delicacy of feeling lay behind her statement of her position and he did not dare express his real opinion
He returned to the main point
Youve simply got to put up with it for the present Susie he insisted
But then of course youre not serious
Yes
I am going
Youll think it over and see Im right dear
Im going tonight
Tonight
he cried
Shh
Sam looked apprehensively around
Both breathed softly and listened with straining ears
His exclamation had not been loud but the silence was profound
I guess nobody heard he finally whispered
You mustnt go Susie
He caught her hand and held it
I love you and I forbid it
I must go dear answered she
Ive decided to take the midnight boat for Cincinnati
In the half darkness he gazed in stupefaction at herthis girl of only seventeen calmly resolving upon and planning an adventure so daring so impossible
As he had been born and bred in that western country where the very children have more independence than the carefully tamed grown people of the East he ought to have been prepared for almost anything
But his father had undermined his courage and independence also his year in the East had given him somewhat different ideas of women
Susans announcement seemed incredible
He was gathering himself for pouring out a fresh protest when it flashed through his mindWhy not
She would go to Cincinnati
He could follow in a few days or a weekand then Well at least they would be free and could have many happy days together
Why how could you get to Cincinnati
he said
You havent any money
Ive a twentydollar gold piece Uncle gave me as a keepsake
And Ive got seventeen dollars in other money and several dollars in change explained she
Ive got two hundred and fortythree dollars and fifty cents in the bank but I cant get thatnot now
Theyll send it to me when I find a place and am settled and let them know
You cant do it Susie
You cant and you mustnt
If you knew what they said to me
Oh I couldnt stay Sam
Ive got some of my clothesa little bundle behind the front door
As soon as Im settled Ill let you know
A silence then he hesitatingly Dont youdo youhadnt I better go with you
She thrilled at this generosity this new proof of love
But she said No I wouldnt let you do that
Theyd blame you
And I want them to know its all my own doing
Youre right Susie said the young man relieved and emphatic
If I went with you itd only get both of us into deeper trouble
Again silence with Sam feeling a kind of awe as he studied the resolute mysterious profile of the girl which he could now see clearly
At last he said And after you get there Susiewhat will you do
Find a boarding house and then look for a place
What kind of a place
In a storeor making dressesor any kind of sewing
Or I could do housework
The sex impulse is prolific of generous impulses
He sitting so close to her and breathing in through his skin the emanations of her young magnetism was moved to the depths by the picture her words conjured
This beautiful girl a mere child born and bred in the lady class wandering away penniless and alone to be a prey to the worlds buffetings which severe enough in reality seem savage beyond endurance to the children of wealth
As he pictured it his heart impulsively expanded
It was at his lips to offer to marry her
But his real selfand ones real self is vastly different from ones impulseshis real self forbade the words passage
Not even the sex impulse intoxicating him as it then was could dethrone snobbish calculation
He was young so while he did not speak he felt ashamed of himself for not speaking
He felt that she must be expecting him to speak that she had the right to expect it
He drew a little away from her and kept silent
The time will soon pass said she absently
The time
Then you intend to come back
I mean the time until youre through college and we can be together
She spoke as one speaks of a dream as to which one has never a doubt but that it will come true
It was so preposterous this idea that he would marry her especially after she had been a servant or God knows what for several yearsit was so absurd that he burst into a sweat of nervous terror
And he hastily drew further away
She felt the change for she was of those who are born sensitive
But she was far too young and inexperienced to have learned to interpret aright the subtle warning of the nerves
You are displeased with me
she asked timidly
NoOh no Susie he stammered
II was thinking
Do put off going for a day or two
Theres no need of hurrying
But she felt that by disobeying her aunt and coming down to see him she had forfeited the right to shelter under that roof
I cant go back said she
Theres a reason
She would not tell him the reason it would make him feel as if he were to blame
When I get a place in Cincinnati she went on Ill write to you
Not here he objected
That wouldnt do at all
No send me a line to the Gibson House in Cincinnati giving me your address
The Gibson House she repeated
Ill not forget that name
Gibson House
Send it as soon as you get a place
I may be in Cincinnati soon
But this is all nonsense
Youre not going
Youd be afraid
She laughed softly
You dont know me
Now that Ive got to go Im glad
And he realized that she was not talking to give herself courage that her words were literally true
This made him admire her and fear her too
There must be something wild and unwomanly in her nature
I guess she inherits it from her motherand perhaps her father whoever he was
Probably she was simply doing a little early what shed have been sure to do sooner or later no matter what had happened
On the whole it was just as well that she was going
I can take her on East in the fall
As soon as she has a little knowledge of the world shell not expect me to marry her
She can get something to do
Ill help her
And now he felt in conceit with himself again felt that he was going to be a good generous friend to her
Perhaps youll be better offonce you get started said he
I dont see how I could be worse off
What is there here for me
He wondered at the good sense of this from a mere child
It was most unlikely that any man of the class she had been brought up in would marry her and how could she endure marriage with a man of the class in which she might possibly find a husband
As for reputation She an illegitimate child never could have a reputation at least not so long as she had her looks
After supper to kill time he had dropped in at Willetts drug store where the young fellows loafed and gossiped in the evenings all the time he was there the conversation had been made up of sly digs and hints about graveyard trysts each thrust causing the kind of laughter that is the wake of the prurient and the obscene
Yes she was right
There could be nothing in it for her in Sutherland
He was filled with pity for her
Poor child
What a shame
There must be something wrong with a world that permitted such iniquities
The clock struck twelve
You must go she said
Sometimes the boat comes as early as halfpast
And she stood up
As he faced her the generous impulse surged again
He caught her in his arms she not resisting
He kissed her again and again murmuring disconnected words of endearment and fighting back the offer to marry her
I mustnt
I mustnt
he said to himself
Whatd become of us
If his passions had been as virgin as inexperienced as hers no power could have held him from going with her and marrying her
But experience had taught him the abysmal difference between before and after and he found strength to be sensible even in the height of his passionate longing for her
She clasped her arms about his neck
Oh my dear love
she murmured
Id do anything for you
I feel that you love me as I love you
Yesyes
And he pressed his lips to hers
An instant and she drew away shaking and panting
He tried to clasp her again but she would not have it
I cant stand it
he murmured
I must go with youI must
No
she replied
It wouldnt do unless we were really married
Wistfully And we cant be that yetcan we
There isnt any way
His passion cooled instantly
There isnt any way he said regretfully
Id not dare tell my father
Yes we must wait till youre of age and have your education and are free
Then She drew a long breath looked at him with a brave smile
The large moon was shining upon them
Well think of that and not let ourselves be unhappywont we
Yes he said
But I must go
I forgot for the minute
Goodby dearest
She put up her lips
He kissed her but without passion now
You might go with me as far as the wharf she suggested
Nosomeone might seeand that would ruin everything
Id like toId It wouldnt do she interrupted
I wouldnt let you come
With sudden agitation she kissed himhe felt that her lips were cold
He pressed her handsthey too were cold
Goodby my darling he murmured vaulted lightly over the rail and disappeared in the deep shadows of the shrubbery
When he was clear of the grounds he paused to light a cigarette
His hand was shaking so that the match almost dropped from his fingers
Ive been making a damn fool of myself he said half aloud
A double damn fool
Ive got to stop that talk about marrying somehowor keep away from her
But I cant keep away
I must have her
Why in the devil cant she realize that a man in my position couldnt marry her
If it wasnt for this marrying talk Id make her happy
Ive simply got to stop this marrying talk
It gets worse and worse
Her calmness deceived her into thinking herself perfectly sane and sober perfectly aware of what she was about
She had left her hat and her bundle behind the door
She put on the hat in the darkness of the hall with steady fingers took up the wellfilled shawl strap and went forth closing the door behind her
In the morning they would find the door unlocked but that would not cause much talk as Sutherland people were all rather careless about locking up
They would not knock at the door of her room until noon perhaps
Then they would find on the pincushion the letter she had written to her uncle saying goodby and explaining that she had decided to remove forever the taint of her mother and herself from their house and their livesa somewhat theatrical letter modeled upon Ouida whom she thought the greatest writer that had ever lived Victor Hugo and two or three poets perhaps excepted
Her bundle was not light but she hardly felt it as she moved swiftly through the deserted moonlit streets toward the river
The wharf boat for the Cincinnati and Louisville mail steamers was anchored at the foot of Pine Street
On the levee before it were piled the boxes bags cases crates barrels to be loaded upon the up boat
She was descending the gentle slope toward this mass of freight when her blood tingled at a deep hoarse mournful whistle from far away she knew it was the up boat rounding the bend and sighting the town
The sound echoed musically back and forth between the Kentucky and the Indiana bluffs died lingeringly away
Again the whistle boomed again the dark forestclad steeps sent the echoes to and fro across the broad silver river
And now she could see the steamer at the benda dark mass picked out with brilliant dots of light the big funnels the two thick pennants of black smoke
And she could hear the faint pleasant stroke of the paddles of the big side wheels upon the water
At the wharf boat there had not been a sign of life
But with the dying away of the second whistle lightsthe lights of lanternsappeared on the levee close to the waters edge and on the wharf boat itself
And behind her the doors of the Sutherland Hotel opened and its office lit up in preparation for any chance arrivals
She turned abruptly out of the beaten path down the gravel levee made for the lower and darker end of the wharf boat
There would be Sutherland people going up the river
But they would be more than prompt everyone came early to boats and trains to begin the sweet draught of the excitement of journeying
So she would wait in the darkness and go aboard when the steamer was about to draw in its planks
At the upper end of the wharf boat there was the broad gangway to the levee for passengers and freight at the lower and dark and deserted end a narrow beam extended from boat to shore to hold the boat steady
Susan balancing herself with her bundle went up to the beam sat down upon a low stanchion in the darkness where she could see the river
Louder and louder grew the regular musical beat of engine and paddle
The searchlight on the forward deck of the General Lytle after peering uncertainly suspiciously at the entire levee and at the river and at the Kentucky shore abruptly focused upon the wharf boat
The General Lytle now seemed a blaze of lightsfrom lower deck from saloon deck from pilot house deck and forward and astern
A hundred interesting sounds came from hertinkling of bells calls from deck to deck whistling creaking of pulleys lowing of cattle grunting of swine plaint of agitated sheep the resigned cluckings of many chickens
Along the rail of the middle or saloon deck were seated a few passengers who had not yet gone to bed
On the lower deck was a swarm of black roustabouts their sooty animal faces their uncannily contrasting white teeth and eyeballs their strange and varied rags lit up by the torches blazing where a gangplank lay ready for running out
And high and clear in the lovely June night sailed the moon spreading a faint benign light upon hills and shores and glistening river upon the graceful stately mail steamer now advancing majestically upon the wharf boat
Susan watched all saw all with quick beating heart and quivering interest
It was the first time that her life had been visited by the fascinating sense of event real event
The tall proud impetuous childwoman standing in the semidarkness beside her bundle was about to cast her stake upon the table in a bold game with Destiny
Her eyes shone with the wonderful expression that is seen only when courage gazes into the bright face of danger
The steamer touched the edge of the wharfboat with gentle care the wharfboat swayed and groaned
Even as the gangplanks were pushing out the ragged fantastic roustabouts with wild savage hilarious cries ran and jumped and scrambled to the wharfboat like a band of escaping lunatics and darted down its shore planks to pounce upon the piles of freight
The mate at the steamer edge to superintend the loading and the wharf master on the levee beside the freight released each a hoarse torrent of profanity to spur on the yelling laughing roustabouts more brute than man
Torches flared cow and sheep pig and chicken uttered each its own cry of dissatisfaction or dismay the mate and wharf master cursed because it was the custom to curse the roustabouts rushed ashore emptyhanded came filing back stooping under their burdens
It was a scene of animation of excitement savage grotesque fascinating
Susan trembling a little so tense were her nerves waited until the last struggling roustabouts were staggering on the boat until the deep whistle sounded warning of approaching departure
Then she took up her bundle and put herself in the line of roustabouts between a halfnaked negro black as coal and bearing a small barrel of beer and a halfnaked mulatto bearing a bundle of loudsmelling untanned skins
Get out of the way lady
yelled the mate eagerly seizing upon a new text for his denunciations
Get out of the way you black hellions
Let the lady pass
Look out lady
You damned sons of hell whatre you about
Ill rip out your bowels Susan fled across the deck and darted up the stairs to the saloon
The steamer was all white without except the black metal work
Withinthat is in the long saloon out of which the cabins opened to right and left and in which the meals were served at extension tablesthere was the palatial splendor of white and gilt
At the forward end near the main entrance was the office
Susan peering in from the darkness of the deck saw that the way was clear
The Sutherland passengers had been accommodated
She entered put her bundle down faced the clerk behind the desk
Why howdy Miss Lenox said he genially beginning to twist his narrow carefully attended blond mustache
Any of the folks with you
She remembered his face but not his name
She remembered him as one of the river characters regarded as outcast by the Christian respectability of Sutherland
But she who could not but be polite to everybody smiled pleasantly though she did not like his expression as he looked at her
No Im alone said she
Ohyour friends are going to meet you at the wharf in the morning said he content with his own explanation
Just sign here please
And as she wrote he went on Ive got one room left
Aint that lucky
Its a nice one too
Youll be very comfortable
Everybody at home well
I aint been in Sutherland for nigh ten years
Every week or so I think I will and then somehow I dont
Heres your keynumber 34 righthand side well down toward the far end yonder
Two dollars please
Thank youexactly right
Hope you sleep well
Thank you said Susan
She turned away with the key which was thrust through one end of a stick about a foot long to make it too bulky for absentminded passengers to pocket
She took up her bundle walked down the long saloon with its gilt decorations its crystal chandeliers its double array of small doors each numbered
The clerk looked after her admiration of the fine curve of her shoulders back and hips written plain upon his insignificant features
And it was a free admiration he would not have dared show had she not been a daughter of illegitimacya girl whose mothers looseness raised pleasing if scandalous suggestions and even possibilities in the mind of every man with a carnal eye
And not unnaturally
To think of her was to think of the circumstances surrounding her coming into the world and to think of those circumstances was to think of immorality
Susan all unconscious of that polluted and impudent gaze was soon standing before the narrow door numbered 34 as she barely made out for the lamps in the saloon chandeliers were turned low
She unlocked it entered the small clean stateroom and deposited her bundle on the floor
With just a glance at her quarters she hurried to the opposite doorthe one giving upon the promenade
She opened it stepped out crossed the deserted deck and stood at the rail
The General Lytle was drawing slowly away from the wharfboat
As that part of the promenade happened to be sheltered from the steamers lights she was seeing the panorama of Sutherlandits long stretch of shaded waterfront its cupolas and steeples the wide leafy streets leading straight from the river by a gentle slope to the base of the dark towering bluffs behind the townall sleeping in peace and beauty in the soft light of the moon
That farthest cupola to the leftit was the Number Two engine house and the third place from it was her uncles house
Slowly the steamer now in midstream drew away from the town
One by one the familiar landmarksthe packing house the soap factory the Geiss brewery the tall chimney of the pumping station the shorn top of Reservoir Hillslipped ghostlily away to the southwest
The sobs choked up into her throat and the tears rained from her eyes
They all pitied and looked down on her there still it had been home the only home she ever had known or ever would know
And until these last few frightful days how happy she had been there
For the first time she felt desolate weak afraid
But not daunted
It is strange to see in strong human character the strength and the weakness two flat contradictions existing side by side and making weak what seems so strong and making strong what seems so weak
However human character is a tangle of inconsistencies as disorderly and inchoate as the tangible and visible parts of nature
Susan felt weak but not the kind of weakness that skulks
And there lay the difference the abysmal difference between courage and cowardice
Courage has full as much fear as cowardice often more but it has a something else that cowardice has not
It trembles and shivers but goes forward
Wiping her eyes she went back to her own cabin
She had neglected closing its other door the one from the saloon
The clerk was standing smirking in the doorway
You must be going away for quite some time said he
And he fixed upon her as greedy and impudent eyes as ever looked from a common face
It was his battle glance
Guileful women bent on trimming him for anything from a piece of plated jewelry to a saucer of ice cream had led him to believe that before it walls of virtue tottered and fell like Jerichos before the trumpets of Joshua
It makes me a little homesick to see the old town disappear hastily explained Susan recovering herself
The instant anyone was watching her emotions always hid
Wouldnt you like to sit out on deck a while
pursued the clerk bringing up a winning smile to reinforce the fetching stare
The idea was attractive for she did not feel like sleep
It would be fine to sit out in the open watch the moon and the stars the mysterious banks gliding swiftly by and new vistas always widening out ahead
But not with this puny sandy little river character not with anybody that night
No replied she
I think Ill go to bed
She had hesitatedand that was enough to give him encouragement
Now do come he urged
You dont know how nice it is
And they say Im mighty good company
No thanks
Susan nodded a pleasant dismissal
The clerk lingered
Cant I help you in some way
Wouldnt you like me to get you something
Nonothing
Going to visit in Cincinnati
I know the town from A to Izzard
Its a lot of fun over the Rhine
Ive had mighty good times therethe kind a pretty lively girl like you would take to
When do we get to Cincinnati
About eightmaybe halfpast seven
Depends on the landings we have to make and the freight
Then Ill not have much time for sleep said Susan
Good night
And no more realizing the coldness of her manner than the reason for his hanging about she faced him hand on the door to close it
You aint a bit friendly wheedled he
Im sorry you think so
Good nightand thank you
And he could not but withdraw his form from the door
She closed it and forgot him
And she did not dream she had passed through one of those perilous adventures incident to a female traveling aloneadventures that even in the telling frighten ladies whose nervousness for their safety seems to increase in direct proportion to the degree of tranquillity their charms create in the male bosom
She decided it would be unwise regularly to undress the boat might catch fire or blow up or something
She took off skirt hat and ties loosened her waist and lay upon the lower of the two plain hard little berths
The throb of the engines the beat of the huge paddles made the whole boat tremble and shiver
Faintly up from below came the sound of quarrels over crapshooting of banjos and singingfrom the roustabouts amusing themselves between landings
She thought she would not be able to sleep in these novel and exciting surroundings
She had hardly composed herself before she lost consciousness to sleep on and on dreamlessly without motion
CHAPTER VII SHE was awakened by a crash so uproarious that she sat bolt upright before she had her eyes open
Her head struck stunningly against the bottom of the upper berth
This further confused her thoughts
She leaped from the bed caught up her slippers reached for her openedup bundle
The crash was still billowing through the boat she now recognized it as a great gong sounding for breakfast
She sat down on the bed and rubbed her head and laughed merrily
I am a greenhorn
she said
Another minute and Id have had the whole boat laughing at me
She felt rested and hungryravenously hungry
She tucked in her blouse washed as well as she could in the tiny bowl on the little washstand
Then before the cloudy watermarked mirror she arranged her scarcely mussed hair
A charming vision of fresh young loveliness strong erect healthy bright of eye and of cheek she made as after a furtive look up and down the saloon she stepped from her door a very few minutes after the crash of that gong
With much scuffling and bustling the passengers most of them country people were hurrying into places at the tables which now had their extension leaves and were covered with coarse white tablecloths and with dishes of nicked stoneware white indeed but shabbily so
But Susans young eyes were not critical
To her it all seemed fine with the rich flavor of adventure
A more experienced traveler might have been filled with gloomy foreboding by the quality of the odor from the cooking
She found it delightful and sympathized with the unrestrained eagerness of the homely country faces about her with the children beating their spoons on their empty plates
The colored waiters presently began to stream in each wearing a soiled white jacket each bearing aloft a huge tray on which were stacked filled dishes and steaming cups
Colored people have a keen instinct for class
One of the waiters happened to note her advanced bowing and smiling with that goodhumored unservile courtesy which is the peculiar possession of the Americanized colored race
He flourished her into a chair with a Good morning miss
Its going to be a fine day
And as soon as she was seated he began to form round her plate a large inclosing arc of side dishesfried fish fried steak fried egg fried potatoes wheat cakes canned peaches a cup of coffee
He drew toward her a can of syrup a pitcher of cream and a bowl of granulated sugar
Anything else
said he with a show of teeth white and sound
Nonothing
Thank you so much
Her smile stimulated him to further courtesies
Some likes the yeggs biled
Shall I change em
No
I like them this way
She was so hungry that the idea of taking away a certainty on the chance of getting something out of sight and not yet cooked did not attract her
Perhapsa little better piece of steak
Nothis looks fine
Her enthusiasm was not mere politeness
I clean forgot your hot biscuits
And away he darted
When he came back with a heaping plate of hot biscuits Sally Lunn and cornbread she was eating as heartily as any of her neighbors
It seemed to her that never had she tasted such grand food as this served in the white and gold saloon with strangeness and interest all about her and the delightful sense of motionmotion into the fascinating golden unknown
The men at the table were eating with their knives each had one protecting forearm and hand cast round his arc of small dishes as if to ward off probable attempt at seizure
And they swallowed as if the boat were afire
The women ate more daintily as became members of the finer sex on public exhibition
They were wearing fingerless net gloves and their little fingers stood straight out in that gesture which every truly elegant woman deems necessary if the food is to be daintily and artistically conveyed to her lips
The children mussed and gormed themselves their dishes the tablecloth
Susan loved it all
Her eyes sparkled
She ate everything and regretted that lack of capacity made it impossible for her to yield to the entreaties of her waiter that she have a little more
She rose went into the nearest passageway between saloon and promenade stealthily took a tencent piece from her pocketbook
She called her waiter and gave it to him
She was blushing deeply frightened lest this the first tip she had ever given or seen given be misunderstood and refused
Im so much obliged she said
You were very nice
The waiter bowed like a prince always with his simple friendly smile the tip disappeared under his apron
Nobody could help being nice to you lady
She thanked him again and went to the promenade
It seemed to her that they had almost arrived
Along shore stretched a continuous line of housespretty houses with gardens
There were electric cars
Nearer the river lay several parallel lines of railway track along which train after train was speeding some of them short trains of ordinary day coaches others long trains made up in part of coaches grander and more beautiful than any she had ever seen
She knew they must be the parlor and dining and sleeping cars she had read about
And now they were in the midst of a fleet of steamers and barges and far ahead loomed the first of Cincinnatis big suspension bridges pictures of which she had many a time gazed at in wonder
There was a mingling of strange loud noiseswhistles engines on the water on shore there was a multitude of what seemed to her feverish activitiesshe who had not been out of quiet Sutherland since she was a baby too young to note things
The river the shores grew more and more crowded
Susans eyes darted from one new object to another and eagerly though she looked she felt she was missing more than she saw
Why Susan Lenox
exclaimed a voice almost in her ear
She closed her teeth upon a cry suddenly she was back from wonderland to herself
She turned to face dumpy dressy Mrs Waterbury and her husband with the glossy kinky ringlets and the long wavy mustache
How do you do
she stammered
We didnt know you were aboard said Mrs Waterbury a silly ducklegged woman looking proudly uncomfortable in her beadtrimmed black silk
YesImIm here confessed Susan
Going to the city to visit
Yes said Susan
She hesitated then repeated Yes
What elegant breakfasts they do serve on these boats
I suppose your friendsll meet you
But Mort and Ill look after you till they come
Oh it isnt necessary protested Susan
The steamer was passing under the bridge
There were cities on both shoreshuge masses of dingy brick streets filled with motion of every kindalways motion incessant motion and change
Were about there arent we
she asked
The wharfs up beyond the second bridgethe Covington Bridge explained Waterbury with the air of the old experienced globetrotter
Theres a third one further up but you cant see it for the smoke
And he went on and on volubly airing his intimate knowledge of the great city which he visited once a year for two or three days to buy goods
He ended with a scornful My but Cincinnatis a dirty place
Dirty it might be but Susan loved it dirt and all
The smoke the grime somehow seemed part of it one of its charms one of the things that made it different from and superior to monotonous country and country town
She edged away from the Waterburys hid in her stateroom watching the panorama through the curtained glass of her promenade deck door
She was completely carried away
The city
So this was the city
And her dreams of travel of new sights new faces were beginning to come true
She forgot herself forgot what she had left behind forgot what she was to face
All her power of thought and feeling was used up in absorbing these unfolding wonders
And when the June sun suddenly pierced the heavy clouds of fog and smoke she clasped her hands and gasped Lovely
Oh how lovely
And now the steamer was at the huge wharfboat in shape like the one at Sutherland but in comparative size like the real Noahs Ark beside a toy ark
And from the whole tremendous scene rose an enormous clamor the stentorian voice of the city
That voice is discordant and terrifying to many
To Susan on that day it was the most splendid burst of music
Awakeawake
it cried
Awake and live She opened her door that she might hear it betterrattle and rumble and roar shriek of whistle clang of bell
And the peopleThousands on thousands hurrying hither and yon like bees in a hive
Awake awake and live
The noises from the saloon reminded her that the journey was ended that she must leave the boat
And she did not know where to goshe and her bundle
She waited until she saw the Waterburys along with the other passengers moving up the levee
Then she issued forthby the promenade deck door so that she would not pass the office
But at the head of the companionway in the forward part of the deck there the clerk stood looking even pettier and more offensive by daylight
She thought to slip by him
But he stopped stroking his mustache and called out to her Havent your friends come
She frowned angry in her nervousness
I shall get on very well she said curtly
Then she repented smiled politely added Thank you
Ill put you in a carriage he offered hastening down the stairs to join her
She did not know what to say or do
She walked silently beside him he carrying her bundle
They crossed the wharfboat
A line of dilapidated looking carriages was drawn up near the end of the gangplank
The sight of them the remembrance of what she had heard of the expensiveness of city carriages nerved her to desperation
Give me my things please she said
I think Ill walk
Where do you want to go
The question took her breath away
With a quickness that amazed her her lips uttered The Gibson House
Oh
Thats a right smart piece
But you can take a car
Ill walk with you to the car
Theres a line a couple of squares up that goes almost by the door
You know it isnt far from Fourth Street
She was now in a flutter of terror
She went stumbling along beside him not hearing a word of his voluble and flirtatious talk
They were in the midst of the mad rush and confusion
The noises no longer mingled but individual smote savagely upon her ears startling her making her look dazedly round as if expecting death to swoop upon her
At the corner of Fourth Street the clerk halted
He was clear out of humor with her so dumb so unappreciative
Therell be a car along soon said he sourly
You neednt wait said she timidly
Thank you again
You cant miss it
Goodby
And he lifted his hattipped it ratherfor he would not have wasted a full lift upon such a female
She gave a gasp of relief when he departed then a gasp of terrorfor upon the opposite corner stood the Waterburys
The globetrotter and his wife were so dazed by the city that they did not see her though in their helpless glancing round they looked straight at her
She hastily ran into a drug store on the corner
A young man in shirt sleeves held up by pink garters and with oily black hair carefully parted and plastered put down a pestle and mortar and came forward
He had kind brown eyes but there was something wrong with the lower part of his face
Susan did not dare look to see what it was lest he should think her unfeeling
He was behind the counter
Susan saw the soda fountain
As if by inspiration she said Some chocolate soda please
Ice cream
asked the young man in a peculiar voice like that of one who has a harelip
Please said Susan
And then she saw the sign Ice Cream ten cents and wished she hadnt
The young man mixed the soda put in a liberal helping of ice cream set it before her with a spoon in it rested the knuckles of his brown hairy hands on the counter and said It is hot
Yes indeed assented Susan
I wonder where I could leave my bundle for a while
Im a stranger and I want to look for a boarding house
You might leave it here with me said the young man
Thats about our biggest line of tradethat and postage stamps and telephoneand the directory 
He laughed heartily
Susan did not see why she did not like the sound either for the young mans deformity of lower jaw deformed his laughter as well as his speech
However she smiled politely and ate and drank her soda slowly
Ill be glad to take care of your bundle the young man said presently
Ever been here before
No said Susan
That is not since I was about four years old
I was four said the young man when a horse stepped on my mouth in the street
My how dreadful
exclaimed Susan
You can see some of the scar yet the young man assured her and he pointed to his curiously sunken mouth
The doctors said it was the most remarkable case of the kind on record continued he proudly
That was what led me into the medical line
You dont seem to have your boarding house picked
I was going to look in the papers
Thats dangerousespecially for a young lady
Some of them boarding houseswell theyre no bettern they ought to be
I dont suppose you know of any
My aunt keeps one
And shes got a vacancy it being summer
Im afraid itd be too expensive for me said Susan to feel her way
The young man was much flattered
But he said Oh it aint so toppy
I think you could make a deal with her for five per
Susan looked inquiring
Five a weekroom and board
I might stand that said Susan reflectively
Then deciding for complete confidence Im looking for work too
What line
Oh I never tried anything
I thought maybe dressmaking or millinery
Mighty poor season for jobs
The times are bad anyhow
He was looking at her with kindly curiosity
If I was you Id go back homeand wait
Susan shrank within herself
I cant do that she said
The young man thought awhile then said If you should go to my aunts you can say Mr Ellison sent you
No that aint me
Its the boss
You see a respectable boarding house asks for references
Susan colored deeply and her gaze slowly sank
I didnt know that she murmured
Dont be afraid
Aunt Kate aint so particularleastways not in summer when things is slow
And I know youre quiet
By the time the soda was finished the young manwho said his name was Robert Wyliehad written on the back of Ellisons business card in a Spencerian hand Mrs Kate Wylie 347 West Sixth Street
He explained that Susan was to walk up two squares and take the car going west the conductor would let her off at the right place
Youd better leave your things here said Mr Wylie holding up the card so that they could admire his penmanship together
You may not hit it off with Aunt Kate
Dont think youve got to stay there just because of me
Im sure Ill like it Susan declared confidently
Her spirits were high she felt that she was in a strong run of luck
Wylie lifted her package over the counter and went to the door with her to point out the direction
This is Fourth
The next up is Fifth
The next wide one is Sixthand you can read it on the lamppost too
Isnt that convenient
exclaimed Susan
What a lovely city this is
Theres worse said Mr Wylie not to seem vain of his native town
They shook hands most friendly and she set out in the direction he had indicated
She was much upset by the many vehicles and the confusion but she did her best to seem at ease and at home
She watched a girl walking ahead of hera shopgirl who seemed welldressed and stylish especially about the hat and hair
Susan tried to walk like her
I suppose I look and act greener than I really am thought she
But Ill keep my eyes open and catch on
And in this as in all her thoughts and actions since leaving she showed confidence not because she was conceited but because she had not the remotest notion what she was actually attempting
How many of us get credit for courage as we walk unconcerned through perils or essay and conquer great obstacles when in truth we are not courageous but simply unaware
As a rule knowledge is power or rather a source of power but there are times when ignorance is a power and knowledge a weakness
If Susan had known she might perhaps have stayed at home and submitted and with crushed spirit might have sunk under the sense of shame and degradation
But she did not know so Columbus before his sailors or Caesar at the Rubicon among his soldiers did not seem more tranquil than she really was
Wylie who suspected in the direction of the truth wondered at her
Shes game she is he muttered again and again that morning
What a nerve for a kidand a lady too
She found the right corner and the right car without further adventure and the conductor assured her that he would set her down before the very door of the address on the card
It was an open car with few passengers
She took the middle of the long seat nearest the rear platform and looked about her like one in a happy dream
On and on and yet on they went
With every square they passed more people so it seemed to her than there were in all Sutherland
And what huge stores
And what wonderful displays of things to wear
Where would the people be found to buy such quantities and where would they get the money to pay
How many restaurants and saloons
Why everybody must be eating and drinking all the time
And at each corner she looked up and down the cross streets and there were more and ever more magnificent buildings throngs upon throngs of people
Was there no end to it
This was Sixth Street still Sixth Street as she saw at the corner lampposts
Then there must be five more such streets between this and the river and she could see up the cross streets that the city was even vaster in the direction of the hills
And there were all these cross streets
It was stupefyingoverwhelmingincredible
She began to be nervous they were going so far
She glanced anxiously at the conductor
He was watching her interestedly understood her glance answered it with a reassuring nod
He called out Im looking out for you miss
Ive got you on my mind
Dont you fret
She gave him a bright smile of relief
They were passing through a double row of what seemed to her stately residences and there were few people on the sidewalks
The air too was clearer though the walls were grimy and also the grass in the occasional tiny front yards
But the curtains at the windows looked clean and fresh and so did the better class of people among those on the sidewalk
It delighted her to see so many welldressed women wearing their clothes with an air which she told herself she must acquire
She was startled by the conductors calling out Now miss
She rose as he rang the bell and was ready to get off when the car stopped for she was eager to cause him as little trouble as possible
The house is right straight before you said the conductor
The numbers in the transom
She thanked him descended was on the sidewalk before Mrs Wylies
She looked at the house and her heart sank
She thought of the small sum in her purse it was most unlikely that such a house as this would harbor her
For here was a grand stone stairway ascending to a deep stone portico and within it great doors bigger than those of the Wright mansion the palace of Sutherland
However she recalled the humble appearance and mode of speech of her friend the drug clerk and plucked up the courage to ascend and to ring
A slattern colored maid opened the door
At the first glance within at the first whiff of the interior air Susan felt more at ease
For she was seeing what even her bedazzled eyes recognized as cheap dowdiness and the smell that assailed her nostrils was that of a house badly and poorly keptthe smell of cheap food and bad butter cooking of cats of undusted rooms of various unrecognizable kinds of staleness
She stood in the center of the big dingy parlor gazing round at the grimed chromos until Mrs Wylie entereda thin middleaged woman with small brown eyes set wide apart a perpetual frown and a chin so long and so projected that she was almost jimberjawed
While Susan explained stammeringly what she had come for Mrs Wylie eyed her with increasing disfavor
When Susan had finished she unlocked her lips for the first time to say The rooms took
Oh
cried Susan in dismay
The telephone rang in the back parlor
Mrs Wylie excused herself to answer
After a few words she closed the doors between
She was gone fully five minutes to Susan it seemed an hour
She came back saying Ive been talking to my nephew
He called up
Well I reckon you can have the room
It aint my custom to take in ladies as young as you
But you seem to be all right
Your parents allowed you to come
I havent any replied Susan
Im here to find a place and support myself
Mrs Wylie continued to eye her dubiously
Well I have no wish to pry into your affairs
Mind your own business thats my rule
She spoke with defiance as if the contrary were being asserted by some invisible person who might appear and gain hearing and belief
She went on If Mr Ellison wants it why I suppose its all right
But you cant stay out latern ten oclock
I shant go out at all of nights said Susan eagerly
You look quiet said Mrs Wylie with the air of adding that appearances were rarely other than deceptive
Oh I am quiet declared Susan
It puzzled her this recurrence of the suggestion of noisiness
I cant allow much companynone in your room
There wont be any company
She blushed deeply
That is aa young man from our townhe may call once
But hell be off for the East right away
Mrs Wylie reflected on this Susan the while standing uneasily dreading lest decision would be against her
Finally Mrs Wylie said Robert says you want the fivedollar room
Ill show it to you
They ascended two flights through increasing shabbiness
On the third floor at the rear was a rooma mere continuation of the narrow hall partitioned off
It contained a small folding bed a small table a tiny bureau a washstand hardly as large as that in the cabin on the boat a row of hooks with a curtain of flowered chintz before them a kitchen chair a chromo of Awake and Asleep a torn and dirty rag carpet
The odor of the room stale damp verging on moldy seemed the fitting exhalation from such an assemblage of forbidding objects
Its a nice comfortable room said Mrs Wylie aggressively
I couldnt afford to give it and two meals for five dollars except till the first of September
After that its eight
Ill be glad to stay if youll let me said Susan
Mrs Wylies suspicion so plain in those repellent eyes took all the courage out of her
The great adventure seemed rapidly to be losing its charms
She could not think of herself as content or anything but sad and depressed in such surroundings as these
How much better it would be if she could live out in the open out where it was attractive
I suppose youve got some baggage said Mrs Wylie as if she rather expected to hear that she had not
I left it at the drug store explained Susan
Your trunk
Susan started nervously at that explosive exclamation
II havent got a trunkonly a few things in a shawl strap
Well I never
Mrs Wylie tossed her head clucked her tongue disgustedly against the roof of her mouth
But I suppose if Mr Ellison says so why you can stay
Thank you said Susan humbly
Even if it would not have been basest ingratitude to betray her friend Mr Wylie still she would not have had the courage to confess the truth about Mr Ellison and so get herself ordered into the street
II think Ill go for my things
The custom is to pay in advance said Mrs Wylie sharply
Oh yesof course stammered Susan
She seated herself on the wooden chair and opened out her purse
She found the five among her few bills extended it with trembling fingers toward Mrs Wylie
At the same time she lifted her eyes
The womans expression as she bored into the pocketbook terrified her
Never before had she seen the savage greediness that is bred in the city among the people who fight against fearful odds to maintain their respectability and to save themselves from the ever threatened drop to the despised working class
Thank you  said Mrs Wylie taking the bill as if she were conferring a favor upon Susan
I make everybody pay promptly
The first of the week or out they go
I used to be easy and I came near going down
Oh I shouldnt stay a minute if I couldnt pay said the girl
Im going to look for something right away
Well I dont want to discourage you but theres a great many out of work
Still I suppose youll be able to wheedle some man into giving you a job
But I warn you Im very particular about morals
If I see any signs Mrs Wylie did not finish her sentence
Any words would have been weaker than her look
Susan colored and trembled
Not at the poisonous hint as to how money could be got to keep on paying for that room for the hint passed wide of Susan
She was agitated by the thought if Mrs Wylie should learn that she was not respectable
If Mrs Wylie should learn that she was namelesswas born in disgrace so deep that no matter how good she might be she would yet be classed with the wicked
Im down like a thousand of brick on any woman that is at all loose with the men continued the landlady
I never could understand how any woman could so far forget herself
And the woman whom the men had all her life been helping to their uttermost not to forget herself looked sharp suspicion and envy at Susan the lovely
Why are women of the Mrs Wylie sort so swift to suspect
Can it be that in some secret chamber of their never assailed hearts there lurks a longinga feeling as to what they would do if they had the chance
Mrs Wylie continued I hope you have strict Christian principles
I was brought up Presbyterian said Susan anxiously
She was far from sure that in Cincinnati and by its Mrs Wylies Presbyterian would be regarded as Christian
Theres your kind of a church a few squares from here was all Mrs Wylie deigned to reply
Susan suspected a sneer at Presbyterianism in her accent
Thatll be nice she murmured
She was eager to escape
Ill go for my things
You can walk down and take the Fourth Street car suggested her landlady
Then you can watch out and not miss the store
The conductors are very impudent and forgetful
Susan escaped from the house as speedily as her flying feet would take her down the two flights
In the street once more her spirits rose
She went south to Fourth Street decided to walk instead of taking a car
She now found herself in much more impressive surroundings than before and realized that Sixth Street was really one of the minor streets
The further uptown she went the more excited she became
After the district of stately mansions with wonderful carriages driving up and away and women dressed like those in the illustrated story papers came splendid shops and hotels finer than Susan had believed there were anywhere in the world
And most of the peoplethe crowds on crowds of peoplelooked prosperous and cheerful and so delightfully citified
She wondered why so many of the men stared at her
She assumed it must be something rural in her appearance though that ought to have set the women to staring too
But she thought little about this so absorbed was she in seeing all the new things
She walked slowly pausing to inspect the shop windowsthe gorgeous dresses and hats and jewelry the thousand costly things scattered in careless profusion
And the crowds
How secure she felt among these multitudes of strangers not one of them knowing or suspecting her secret of shame
She no longer had the sense of being outcast branded
When she had gone so far that it seemed to her she certainly must have missed the drug store carefully though she had inspected each corner as she went she decided that she must stop someone of this hurrying throng and inquire the way
While she was still screwing her courage to this boldness she espied the sign and hastened joyfully across the street
She and Wylie welcomed each other like old friends
He was delighted when he learned that she had taken the room
You wont mind Aunt Kate after a while said he
Shes sour and nosey but shes honest and respectableand thats the main thing just now with you
And I think youll get a job all right
Aunt Kates got a lady friend thats head saleslady at Shillitos
Shell know of something
Wylie was so kind and so hopeful that Susan felt already settled
As soon as customers came in she took her parcel and went Wylie saying Ill drop round after supper and see how things are getting on
She took the Sixth Street car back and felt like an old resident
She was critical of Sixth Street now and of the women she had been admiring there less than two hours beforecritical of their manners and of their dress
The exterior of the boarding house no longer awed her
She was getting a point of viewas she proudly realized
By the time Sam cameand surely that wouldnt be many daysshe would be quite transformed
She mounted the steps and was about to ring when Mrs Wylie herself with stormy brow and snapping eyes opened the door
Go into the parlor she jerked out from between her unpleasantlooking receding teeth
Susan gave her a glance of frightened wonder and obeyed
CHAPTER VIII AT the threshold her bundles dropped to the floor and all color fled from her face
Before her stood her Uncle George and Sam Wright and his father
The two elderly men were glowering at her Sam white as his shirt and limp was hanging his head
So missYouve got back eh
cried her uncle in a tone she would not have believed could come from him
As quickly as fear had seized her she now shook it off
Yes Uncle she said calmly meeting his angry eyes without flinching
And back came that expression of resolutionof stubbornness we call it when it is the flag of opposition to our will
Whatd have become of you demanded her uncle if I hadnt found out early this morning and got after Sam here and choked the truth out of him
Susan gazed at Sam but he was such a pitiful figure so mean and frightened that she glanced quickly back to her uncle
She said But he didnt know where I was
Dont lie to me cried Warham
It wont do you any good any more than his lying kept us from finding you
We came on the train and saw the Waterburys in the street and theyd seen you go into the drug store
Wed have caught you there if wed been a few minutes sooner but we drove and got here in time
Now tell me Susanand his voice was cruelly harshall about whats been going on between you and Sam
She gazed fearlessly and was silent
Speak up
commanded Sams father
Yesand no lies said her uncle
I dont know what you mean Susan at last answeredtruthfully enough yet to gain time too
You cant play that game any longer cried Warham
You did make a fool of me but my eyes are open
Your aunts right about you
Oh Uncle George
said the girl a sob in her voice
But he gazed pitilesslygazed at the woman he was now abhorring as the treacherous fallen unsexed daughter of fallen Lorella
Speak out
Crying wont help you
What have you and this fellow been up to
You disgrace
Susan shrank and shivered but answered steadfastly Thats between him and me Uncle
Warham gave a snort of fury turned to the elder Wright
You see Wright cried he
Its as my wife and I told you
Your boys lying
Well send the landlady out for a preacher and marry them
Hold on George objected Wright soothingly
I agreed to that only if thered been something wrong
Im not satisfied yet
He turned to Susan said in his gruff blunt way Susan have you been loose with my boy here
Loose
said Susan wonderingly
Sam roused himself
Tell them it isnt so Susan he pleaded and his voice was little better than a whine of terror
Your uncles going to kill me and my fatherll kick me out
Susans heart grew sick as she looked at himlooked furtively for she was ashamed to see him so abject
If you mean did I let him kiss me she said to Mr Wright why I did
We kissed several times
But we had the right to
We were engaged
Sam turned on his father in an agony of terror
That isnt true
he cried
I swear it isnt father
We arent engaged
I only made love to her a little as a fellow does to lots of girls
Susan looked at him with wide horrified eyes
Sam
she exclaimed breathlessly
Sam
Sams eyes dropped but he managed to turn his face in her direction
The situation was too serious for him he did not dare to indulge in such vanities as manhood or manly appearance
Thats the truth Susan he said sullenly
You talked a lot about marrying but I never thought of such a thing
Butyou saidyou loved me
I didnt mean anything by it
There fell a silence that was interrupted by Mr Wright
You see theres nothing in it Warham
Ill take my boy and go
Not by a damn sight
cried Warham
Hes got to marry her
Susan did Sam promise to marry you
When he got through college replied Susan
I thought so
And he persuaded you to run away
No said Susan
He I say yes stormed her uncle
Dont lie
Warham
Warham
remonstrated Mr Wright
Dont browbeat the girl
He begged me not to go said Susan
You lying fool
shouted her uncle
Then to Wright If he did ask her to stay it was because he was afraid it would all come outjust as it has
I never promised to marry her
whined Sam
Honest to God father I never did
Honest to God Mr Warham
You know thats so Susan
It was you that did all the marrying talk
Yes she said slowly
Yes I believe it was
She looked dazedly at the three men
I supposed he meant marriage because her voice faltered but she steadied it and went onbecause we loved each other
I knew it
cried her uncle
You hear Wright
She admits he betrayed her
Susan remembered the horrible part of her cousins sex revelations
Oh no
she cried
I wouldnt have let him do thateven if he had wanted to
Nonot even if wed been married
You see Warham
cried Mr Wright in triumph
I see a liar
was Warhams furious answer
Shes trying to defend him and make out a case for herself
I am telling the truth said Susan
Warham gazed unbelievingly at her speechless with fury
Mr Wright took his silk hat from the corer of the piano
Im satisfied theyre innocent said he
So Ill take my boy and go
Not if I know it
retorted Warham
Hes got to marry her
But the girl says shes pure says he never spoke of marriage says he begged her not to run away
Be reasonable Warham
For a good Christian sneered he at Wright youre mighty easily convinced by a flimsy lie
In your heart you know the boy has wronged her and that shes shielding him just as There Warham checked himself it would be anything but timely to remind Wright of the character of the girls mother
Ill admit said Mr Wright smoothly that I wasnt overanxious for my boys marriage with a girl whose mother wasunfortunate
But if your charge had been true Warham Id have made the boy do her justice she being only seventeen
Come Sam
Sam slunk toward the door
Warham stared fiercely at the elder Wright
And you call yourself a Christian
he sneered
At the doorSam had already disappearedMr Wright paused to say Im going to give Sam a discipline hell remember
The girls only been foolish
Dont be harsh with her
You damned hypocrite
shouted Warham
I might have known what to expect from a man who cut the wages of his hands to pay his church subscription
But Wright was far too crafty to be drawn
He went on pushing Sam before him
As the outer door closed behind them Mrs Wylie appeared
I want you both to get out of my house as quick as you can she snapped
My boardersll be coming to dinner in a few minutes
Warham took his straw hat from the floor beside the chair behind him
Ive nothing to do with this girl here
Good day madam
And he strode out of the house slamming the door behind him
Mrs Wylie looked at Susan with storming face and bosom
Susan did not see
She was gazing into space her face blanched
Clear out
cried Mrs Wylie
And she ran to the outer door and opened it
How dare you come into a respectable house
She wished to be so wildly angry that she would forget the five dollars which she as a professing Christian in full church standing would have to pay back if she remembered
Clear out this minute
she cried shrilly
If you dont Ill throw your bundle into the street and you after it
Susan took up the bundle mechanically slowly went out on the stoop
The door closed with a slam behind her
She descended the steps walked a few yards up the street paused at the edge of the curb and looked dazedly about
Her uncle stood beside her
Now where are you going
he said roughly
Susan shook her head
I suppose he went on Ive got to look after you
You shant disgrace my daughter any further
Susan simply looked at him her eyes unseeing her brain swept clean of thought by the cyclone that had destroyed all her dreams and hopes
She was not horrified by his accusations such things had little meaning for one practically in complete ignorance of sex relations
Besides the miserable fiasco of her romantic love left her with a feeling of abasement of degradation little different from that which overwhelms a woman who believes her virtue is her all and finds herself betrayed and abandoned
She now felt indeed the outcast looked down upon by all the world
If you hadnt lied he fumed on youd have been his wife and a respectable woman
The girl shivered
Instead youre a disgrace
Everybody in Sutherlandll know youve gone the way your mother went
Go away said the girl piteously
Let me alone
Alone
What will become of you
He addressed the question to himself not to her
It doesnt matter was her reply in a dreary tone
Ive been betrayed as my mother was
It doesnt matter what I knew it
cried Warham with no notion of what the girl meant by the word betrayed
Why didnt you confess the truth while he was here and his father was ready to marry him to you
I knew youd been loose with him as your Aunt Fanny said
But I wasnt said Susan
I wouldnt do such a thing
There you go lying again
It doesnt matter said she
All I want is for you to go away
You do
sneered he
And then what
Ive got to think of Ruthie
He snatched the bundle from her hand
Come on
I must do all I can to keep the disgrace to my family down
As for you you dont deserve anything but the gutter where youd sink if I left you
Your aunts right
Youre rotten
You were born rotten
Youre your mothers own brat
Yes I am she cried
And Im proud of it
She turned from him was walking rapidly away
Come with me
ordered Warham following and seizing her by the arm
No said Susan wrenching herself free
Then Ill call a policeman and have you locked up
Uncle and niece stood regarding each other hatred and contempt in his gaze hatred and fear in hers
Youre a child in lawthough God knows youre anything but a child in fact
Come along with me
Youve got to
Im going to see that youre put out of harms way
You wouldnt take me back to Sutherland
she cried
He laughed savagely
I guess not
Youll not show your face there againthough Ive no doubt youd be brazen enough to brass it out
Noyou cant pollute my home again
I cant go back to Sutherland
You shant I say
You ran off because you had disgraced yourself
No
cried Susan
No
Dont lie to me
Dont speak to me
Ill see what I can do to hide this mess
Come along
Susan looked helplessly round the street saw nothing not even eager curious faces pressed against many a window pane saw only a desolate waste
Then she walked along beside her uncle both of them silent he carrying her bundle she tightly clutching her little purse
Perhaps the most amazing the most stunning of all the blows fate had thus suddenly showered upon her was this transformation of her uncle from gentleness to ferocity
But many a far older and far wiser woman than seventeenyearold Susan has failed to understand how it is with the man who does not regard woman as a fellow human being
To such she is either an object of adoration a quintessence of purity and innocence or less than the dust sheer filth
Warhams anger was no gust
He was simply the average man of small intelligence great vanity and abject snobbishness or terror of public opinion
There could be but one reason for the flight of Lorellas daughterrottenness
The only point to consider now was how to save the imperiled family standing how to protect his own daughter whom his good nature and his wifes weakness had thus endangered
The one thing that could have appeased his hatred of Susan would have been her marriage to Sam Wright
Then he would havenot indeed forgiven or reinstated herbut tolerated her
It is the dominance of such ideas as his that makes for woman the slavery she discovers beneath her queenly sway if she happens to do something deeply displeasing to her masculine subject and adorer
They went to the Central Station
The O and M express which connected with the train on the branch line to Sutherland would not leave until a quarter past two
It was only a few minutes past one
Warham led the way into the station restaurant with a curt nod he indicated a seat at one of the small tables and dropped into the opposite seat
He ordered beefsteak and fried potatoes coffee and apple pie
Sit still
he said to her roughly and rose to go out to buy a paper
The girl sat with her hands in her lap and her eyes upon them
She looked utterly pitifully tired
A moment and he came back to resume his seat and read the paper
When the waiter flopped down the steak and the dish of greasily fried potatoes before his plate he stuffed the paper in his pocket cut a slice of the steak and put it on the plate
The waiter noisily exchanged it for the empty plate before Susan
Warham cut two slices of the steak for himself took a liberal helping of the potatoes pushed the dish toward her
Do you want the coffee now or with the pie
asked the waiter
Now said Warham
Coffee for the young lady too
Warham scowled at her
Coffee
he demanded
She did not answer she did not hear
Yes she wants coffee said Warham
Hustle it
Yes sir
And the waiter bustled away with a great deal of motion that created a deceptive impression of speed
Warham was helping himself to steak again when the coffee came a suspiciouslooking liquid diffusing an odor of staleness reheated again and again an under odor of metal pot not too frequently scoured
Warham glanced at Susans plate
She had not disturbed the knife and fork on either side of it
Eat
he commanded
And when she gave no sign of having heard he repeatedly sharply Eat I tell you
She started nervously took up the knife and fork cut a morsel off the slice of steak
When she lifted it to her lips she suddenly put it back in the plate
I cant she said
Youve got to ordered he
I wont have you acting this way
I cant she repeated monotonously
I feel sick
Nature had luckily so made her that it was impossible for her to swallow when her nerves were upset or when she was tired thus she would not have the physical woes that aggravate and prolong mental disturbance if food is taken at times when it instantly turns to poison
He repeated his order in a still more savage tone
She put her elbows on the table rested her head wearily upon her hands shook her head
He desisted
When he had eaten all of the steak except the fat and the gristly tail and nearly all the potatoes the waiter took the used dishes away and brought two generous slices of apple pie and set down one before each
With the pie went a cube of American cream or rattrap cheese
Warham ate his own pie and cheese then as she had not touched hers he reached for it and ate it also
Now he was watching the clock and between liftings of laden fork to his mouth verifying the clocks opinion of the hour by his own watch
He called for the bill paid it gave the waiter five centsa concession to the tipping custom of the effete city which judging by the waiters expression might as well not have been made
Still Warham had not made it with an idea of promoting good feeling between himself and the waiter but simply to show that he knew the city and its ways
He took up the shawl strap said Come on in the voice which he deemed worthy of the fallen creature he must through Christian duty and worldly prudence for the time associate with
She rose and followed him to the ticket office
He had the return half of his own ticket
When she heard him ask for a ticket to North Sutherland she shivered
She knew that her destination was his brother Zekes farm
From Cincinnati to North Vernon where they were to change cars he sat beside her without speech
At North Vernon where they had to occupy a bench outside the squat and squalid station for nearly two hours he sat beside her without speech
And without a single word on either side they journeyed in the poking nosoonerwellstartedthanstopping accommodation train southbound
Several Sutherland people were aboard
He nodded surlily to those who spoke to him
He read an Indianapolis paper which he had bought at North Vernon
All the way she gazed unseeingly out over the fair June landscape of rolling or hilly fields ripening in the sun
At North Sutherland he bade her follow him to a dilapidated barn a few yards from the railway tracks where was displayed a homemade signV Goslin
Livery and Sale Stable
There was dickering and a final compromise on four dollars where the proprieter had demanded five and Warham had declared two fifty liberal
A surrey was hitched with two horses
Warham opened the awkward door to the rear seat and ordered Susan to jump in
She obeyed he put the bundle on the floor beside her
He sat with the driverthe proprietor himself
The horses set off at a round pace over the smooth turnpike
It was evening and a beautiful coolness issued from the woods on either side
They skimmed over the long level stretches they climbed hills they raced down into valleys
Warham and the ragged rawboned old proprietor kept up a kind of conversationabout crops and politics about the ownership value and fertility of the farms they were passing
Susan sat quiet motionless most of the time
The last daylight faded the stars came out the road wound in and out up and down amid cool dark silence and mysterious fascinating shadows
The moon appeared above the tree tops straight aheada big moon with a lower arc of the rim clipped off
The turnpike ended they were making equally rapid progress over the dirt road which was in perfect condition as there had been no rain for several days
The beat of the flying hoofs was soft now the two mens voices fell into a lower key the moon marked out the line of the road clearly made strange spectral minglings of light and darkness in the woods glorified the open fields and gave the occasional groups of farm buildings an ancient beauty and dignity
The girl slept
At nine oclock the twentymile drive ended in a long slow climb up a road so washed out so full of holes and bowlders that it was no road at all but simply a weatherbeaten hillside
A mile of this with the liverymans cursesdod rot it and gosh dang it and similar modifications of profanity for Christian use and for the presence of the sexringing out at every step
Susan soon awakened rather because the surrey was pitching so wildly than because of Goslins denunciations
A brief level stretch and they stopped for Warham to open the outer gate into his brother Zekes big farm
A quarter of a mile through wheat to the tops of the wheels and they reached the second gate
A descent into a valley a crossing of a creek an ascent of a steep hill and they were at the third gatebetween pasture and barnyard
Now they came into view of the house set upon a slope where a spring bubbled out
The house was white and a white picket fence cut off its lawn from the barnyard
A dog with a deep voice began to bark
They drove up to the front gate and stopped
The dog barked in a frenzy of rage and they heard his straining and jerking at his chain
A clump of cedars brooded to the right of the house their trunks were whitewashed up to the lowest branches
The house had a high stoop with wooden steps
As Warham descended and hallooed there came a fierce tugging at the front door from the inside
But the front door was not in the habit of being opened and stoutly resisted
The assault grew more strenuous the door gave way and a tall thin farmer appeared
Hello Zeke called George
He opened the surrey door
Get down he said to the girl at the same time taking her bundle
He set it on the horse block beside the gate took out his pocketbook and paid over the four dollars
Goodby Vic said he pleasantly
Thats a good team youve got
Not so coarse said Vic
Goodby Mr
Warham
And off he drove
Zeke Warham had now descended the steps and was opening the front gate which was evidently as unaccustomed to use as the front door
Howdy George said he
Aint that Susie youve got with you
Like George Zeke had had an elementary education
But he had married an ignorant woman and had lived so long among his farm hands and tenants that he used their mode of speech
Yes its Susie said George shaking hands with his brother
Howdy Susie said Zeke shaking hands with her
I see youve got your things with you
Come to stay awhile
George interrupted
Susan go up on the porch and take your bundle
The girl took up the shawl strap and went to the front door
She leaned upon the railing of the stoop and watched the two men standing at the gate
George was talking to his brother in a low tone
Occasionally the brother uttered an ejaculation
She could not hear their heads were so turned that she could not see their faces
The moon made it almost as bright as day
From the pasture woods came a low sweet chorus of night lifefrogs and insects and occasionally a night bird
From the orchard to the left and the clover fields beyond came a wonderful scented breeze
She heard a step in the hall her Aunt Sallie appeareda comfortable voluble woman a hard worker and a harder eater and showing it in thin hair and wrinkled face
Why Susie Lenox aint that you
she exclaimed
Yes Aunt said Susan
Her aunt kissed her diffusing that earthy odor which is the basis of the smell of country persons
At various hours of the day this odor would be modified with the smell of cow stables of chickens of cooking according to immediate occupation
But whatever other smell there was the earthy smell persisted
And it was the smell of the house too
Whos at the gate with your Uncle Zeke
inquired Sallie
Aint it George
Yes said Susan
Why dont he come in
She raised her voice
George aint you coming in
Howdy Sallie called George
You take the girl in
Zeke and Ill be along
Some business I reckon said her aunt to Susan
Come on
Have you had supper
No said Susan
She was hungry now
The splendid health of the girl that had calmed her torment of soul into a dull ache was clamoring for foodfood to enable her body to carry her strong and enduring through whatever might befall
Ill set something out for you said Sallie
Come right in
You might leave your bundle here by the parlor door
Well put you in the upstairs room
They passed the front stairway went back through the hall through the big lowceilinged livingroom with its vast fireplace now covered for the warm season by a screen of flowered wallpaper
They were in the plain old diningroom with its smaller fireplace and its big oldfashioned cupboards built into the wall on either side of the projecting chimneypiece
There aint much resumed Sallie
But I reckon you kin make out
On the gayly patterned table cover she set an array of substantial plates and glasses
From various cupboards in diningroom and adjoining kitchen she assembled a glass pitcher of sweet milk a glass pitcher of buttermilk a plate of cold cornbread a platter of cold fried chicken a dish of golden butter a pan of cold fried potatoes a jar of preserved crab apples and another of peach butter
Susan watched with hungry eyes
She was thinking of nothing but food now
Her aunt looked at her and smiled
My but youre shootin up
she exclaimed admiring the girls tall straight figure
And you dont seem to get stringy and bony like so many but keep nice and round
Do set down
II think Ill wait until Uncle George comes
Nothing of the kind
She pushed a wooden chair before one of the two plates she had laid
I see youve still got that lovely skin
And how tasty you dress
Now do set
Susan seated herself
Pitch right in child urged Sallie
Hows yer aunt and her Ruth
Theyretheyre well thank you
Do eat
No said Susan
Ill wait for Uncle
Never mind your manners
I know youre starved
Then seeing that the girl would not eat she said Well Ill go fetch him
But Susan stopped her
Please please dont she entreated
Sallie stared to oppose then arrested by the intense appealing expression in those violetgray eyes so beautifully shaded by dark lashes and brows she kept silent bustled aimlessly about boiling with suddenly aroused curiosity
It was nearly half an hour by the big square wooden clock on the chimneypiece when Susan heard the steps of her two uncles
Her hunger fled the deathly sickness surged up again
She trembled grew ghastly in the yellow lamplight
Her hands clutched each other in her lap
Why Susie
cried her aunt
Whatever is the matter of you
The girl lifted her eyes to her aunts face the eyes of a wounded suffering horribly suffering animal
She rose rushed out of the door into the yard flung herself down on the grass
But still she could not get the relief of tears
After a while she sat up and listened
She heard faintly the voices of her uncle and his relatives
Presently her aunt came out to her
She hid her face in her arm and waited for the new harshness to strike
Get up and come in Susie
The voice was kind was pityingnot with the pity that galls but with the pity of one who understands and feels and is also human the pity that soothes
At least to this woman she was not outcast
The girl flung herself down again and sobbedpoured out upon the bosom of our mother earth all the torrents of tears that had been damming up within her
And Sallie knelt beside her and patted her now and then with a Thats right
Cry it out sweetie
When tears and sobs subsided Sallie lifted her up walked to the house with her arm round her
Do you feel better
Some admitted Susan
The men folks have went
So we kin be comfortable
After youve et youll feel still better
Gorge Warham had made a notable inroad upon the food and drink
But there was an abundance left
Susan began with a hesitating sipping at a glass of milk and nibbling at one of the generous cubes of oldfashioned cornbread
Soon she was busy
It delighted Sallie to see her eat
She pressed the preserves the chicken the cornbread upon her
I havent eaten since early this morning apologized the girl
That means a big hole to fill observed Sallie
Try this buttermilk
But Susan could hold no more
I reckon youre pretty well tired out observed Sallie
Ill help you straighten up said Susan rising
No
Let me take you up to bedwhile the mens still outside
Susan did not insist
They returned through the empty sittingroom and along the hall
Aunt Sallie took the bundle and they ascended to the spare bedroom
Sallie showed her into the front rooma damp earthy odor a wallpaper with countless reproductions of two little brown girls in a brown swing under a brown tree a lofty bed white and tomblike some preposterous artificial flowers under glass on chimneypiece and table three bright chromos on the walls God Bless Our Home in pink blue and yellow worsted over the door
Ill run down and put the things away said her aunt
Then Ill come back
Susan put her bundle on the sofa opened it found nightgown and toilet articles on top
She looked uncertainly about rapidly undressed got into the nightgown
Ill turn down the bed and lie on it until Auntie comes she said to herself
The bed was delightfully cool the shuck mattress made soft crackling sounds under her and gave out a soothing odor of the fields
Hardly had her head touched the pillow when she fell sound asleep
In a few minutes her aunt came hurrying in stopped short at sight of that lovely childlike face with the lamplight full upon it
One of Susans tapering arms was flung round her dark wavy hair
Sallie Warham smiled gently
Bless the baby she said half aloud
Then her smile faded and a look of sadness and pity came
Poor child
she murmured
The Warham mens hard
But then all the mens hard
Poor child
And gently she kissed the girls flushed cheek
And she never had no mother nor nothing
She sighed gradually lowered the flame of the little old glass lamp blew it out and went noiselessly from the room closing the door behind her
CHAPTER IX SUSAN sat up in bed suddenly rubbing the sleep from her eyes
It was broad day and the birds were making a mighty clamor
She gazed round astonished that it was not her own room
Then she remembered
But it was as a child remembers for when we have the sense of perfect physical wellbeing we cannot but see our misfortunes with the childs sense of unrealityand Susan had not only health but youth was still in the child stage of the period between childhood and womanhood
She lay down again with the feeling that so long as she could stay in that comfortable bed with the world shut out just so long would all be well with her
Soon however the restlessness of all nature under the stimulus and heat of that brilliant day communicated itself to her vigorous young body
For repose and inaction are as foreign to healthy life as death itself of which they are the symptoms and if ever there was an intense and vivid life Susan had it
She got up and dressed and leaned from the window watching the twohorse reaper in the wheat fields across the hollow of the pasture and listening to its faint musical whirr
The cows which had just been milked were moving sedately through the gate into the pasture where the bull under a tree was placidly awaiting them
A boy in huge straw hat and a blue cotton shirt and linsey woolsey trousers rolled high upon his brown bare legs was escorting the herd
Her aunt in fresh blue checked calico came in
Wouldnt you like some breakfast
said she
And Susan read in her manner that the men were out of the way
No I dont feel hungry Susan replied
She thought this was true but when she was at the table she ate almost as heartily as she had the night before
As Susan ate she gazed out into the back yard of the house where chickens of all sizes colors and ages were peering and picking about
Through the fence of the kitchen garden she saw Lew the farm hand digging potatoes
There were ripening beans on tall poles and in the farther part the forming heads of cabbages the sprouting melon vines the beautiful fresh green of the just springing garden corn
The window through which she was looking was framed in morning glories and hollyhocks and over by the garden gate were on the one side a clump of elders on the other the hardy graceful stalks of gaudily spreading sunflowers
Bees flew in and out and one lighted upon the dish of honey in the comb that went so well with the hot biscuit
She rose and wandered out among the chickens to pick up little fluffy youngsters one after another and caress them to look in the henhouse itself where several hens were sitting with the pensive expression that accompanies the laying of eggs
She thought of those other hens less conventional who ran away to lay in secret places in the weeds to accumulate a store against the time when the setting instinct should possess them
She thought of those cannier less docile hens and laughed
She opened a gate into the barnyard intending to go to the barn for a look at the horses taking in the duck pond and perhaps the pigs on the way
Her Uncle Gorges voice arrested her
Susan he cried
Come here
She turned and looked wistfully at him
The same harsh unforgiving countenancemean with anger and petty thoughts
As she moved hesitatingly toward him he said You are not to go out of the yard
And he reentered the house
What a mysterious cruel world
Could it be the same world she had lived in so happily all the years until a few days agothe same she had always found Gods beautiful world full of gentleness and kindness
And why had it changed
What was this sin that after a long sleep in her mothers grave had risen to poison everyone against her
And why had it risen
It was all beyond her
She strolled wretchedly within bounds with a foreboding of impending evil
She watched Lew in the garden she got her aunt to let her help with the churningdrive the dasher monotonously up and down until the butter came then she helped work the butter helped gather the vegetables for dinner did everything and anything to keep herself from thinking
Toward eleven oclock her Uncle Zeke appeared in the diningroom called his wife from the kitchen
Susan felt that at last something was to happen
After a long time her aunt returned there were all the evidences of weeping in her face
Youd better go to your room and straighten it up she said without looking at the girl
The thing has aired long enough I reckon



And youd better stay up there till I call you
Susan had finished the room was about to unpack the heavyladen shawl strap and shake the wrinkles out of the skirts folded away for two days now
She heard the sound of a horses hoofs went to the window
A young man whom she recognized as one of her Uncle Zekes tenants was hitching to the horse block a wellsetup young mare drawing a species of broadseated breaking sulky
He had a handsome common face a wavy black mustache
She remembered that his name was FergusonJeb Ferguson and that he was working on shares what was known as the creekbottom farm which began about a mile and a half away straight down the pasture hollow
He glanced up at the window raised his black slouch hat and nodded with the selfconscious selfassured grin of the desired of women
She tried to return this salute with a pleasant smile
He entered the gate and she heard his boots upon the front steps
Now away across the hollow another figure appeareda man on horseback coming through the wheat fields
He was riding toward the farther gate of the pasture at a leisurely dignified pace
She had only made out that he had abundant whiskers when the sound of a step upon the stairs caused her to turn
As that step came nearer her heart beat more and more wildly
Her wide eyes fixed upon the open door of the room
It was her Uncle George
Sit down he said as he reached the threshholdsic
I want to talk to you
She seated herself with hands folded in her lap
Her head was aching from the beat of the blood in her temples
Zeke and I have talked it over said Warham
And weve decided that the only thing to do with you is to get you settled
So in a few minutes now youre going to be married
Her lack of expression showed that she did not understand
In fact she could only feelfeel the cruel contemptuous anger of that voice which all her days before had caressed her
Weve picked out a good husband for you Warham continued
Its Jeb Ferguson
Susan quivered
II dont want to she said
It aint a question of what you want retorted Warham roughly
He was twentyfour hours and a nights sleep away from his first fierce outblazing of furyaway from the influence of his wife and his daughter
If it had not been for his brother Zeke narrow and cold the event might have been different
But Zeke was there to keep his sense of duty strong
And that he might nerve himself and hide and put down any tendency to be a softhearted foola tendency that threatened to grow as he looked at the girlthe childhe assumed the roughest manner he could muster
It aint a question of what you want he repeated
Its a question of whats got to be done to save my family and you toofrom disgrace
We aint going to have any more bastards in this family
The word meant nothing to the girl
But the sound of it as her uncle pronounced it made her feel as though the blood were drying up in her veins
We aint going to take any chances pursued Warham less roughly for now that he had looked the situation full and frankly in the face he had no nerve to brace himself
The necessity of what he was prepared to do and to make her do was too obvious
Fergusons here and Zeke saw the preacher we sent for riding in from the main road
So Ive come to tell you
If youd like to fix up a little why your Aunt Salliell be here in a minute
You want to pray God to make you a good wife
And you ought to be thankful you have sensible relations to step in and save you from yourself
Susan tried to speak her voice died in her throat
She made another effort
I dont want to she said
Then what do you want to dotell me that
exclaimed her uncle rough again
For her manner was very moving the more so because there was none of the usual appeal to pity and to mercy
She was silent
There isnt anything else for you to do
I want toto stay here
Do you think Zeked harbor youwhen youre about certain to up and disgrace us as your mother did
I havent done anything wrong said the girl dully
Dont you dare lie about that
Ive seen Ruth do the same with Artie Sinclairand all the girls with different boys
You miserable girl
cried her uncle
I never heard it was so dreadful to let a boy kiss you
Dont pretend to be innocent
You know the difference between that and what you did
Susan realized that when she had kissed Sam she had really loved him
Perhaps that was the fatal difference
And her motherthe sin there had been that she really loved while the man hadnt
Yes it must be so
Ruths explanation of these mysteries had been different but then Ruth had also admitted that she knew little about the matterand Susan most doubted the part that Ruth had assured her was certainly true
I didnt know said Susan to her uncle
Nobody ever told me
I thought we were engaged
A good woman dont need to be told retorted Warham
But Im not going to argue with you
Youve got to marry
I couldnt do that said the girl
No I couldnt
Youll either take him or you go back to Sutherland and Ill have you locked up in the jail till you can be sent to the House of Correction
You can take your choice
Susan sat looking at her slim brown hands and interlacing her long fingers
The jail
The House of Correction was dreadful enough for though she had never seen it she had heard what it was for what kind of boys and girls lived there
But the jailshe had seen the jail back behind the courthouse with its air of mystery and of horror
Not Hell itself seemed such a frightful thing as that jail
Wellwhich do you choose
said her uncle in a sharp voice
The girl shivered
I dont care what happens to me she said and her voice was dull and sullen and hard
And it doesnt much matter sneered Warham
Every time he looked at her his anger flamed again at the outrage to his love his trust his honor and the impending danger of more illegitimacy
Marrying Jeb will give you a chance to reform and be a good woman
He understandsso you neednt be afraid of what hell find out
I dont care what happens to me the girl repeated in the same monotonous voice
Warham rose
Ill send your Aunt Sallie said he
And when I call shell bring you down
The girls silence her nonresistance the awful expression of her still featuresmade him uneasy
He went to the window instead of to the door
He glanced furtively at her but he might have glanced openly as there wasnt the least danger of meeting her eyes
Youre marrying about as well as you could have hoped to anyhowbetter probably he observed in an argumentative defensive tone
Zeke says Jebs about the likeliest young fellow he knowsa likelier fellow than either Zeke or I was at his age
Ive given him two thousand dollars in cash
That ought to start you off well
And he went out without venturing another look at her
Her youth and helplessness her stony misery were again making it harder for him to hold himself to what he and the fanatic Zeke had decided to be his duty as a Christian as a father as a guardian
Besides he did not dare face his wife and his daughter until the whole business was settled respectably and finally
His sisterinlaw was waiting in the next room
As soon as his descent cleared the way she hurried in
From the threshold she glanced at the girl what she saw sent her hurrying out to recompose herself
But the instant she again saw that expression of mute and dazed despair the tears fought for release
The effort to suppress outward signs of pity made her plain fat face grotesque
She could not speak
With a corner of her apron she wiped imaginary dust from the glass bells that protected the artificial flowers
The poor child
And all for no fault of hersand because she had been born out of wedlock
But then the old woman reflected was it not one of the most familiar of Gods mysterious ways that people were punished most severely of all for the things that werent their faultfor being born in shame or in bad or low families or sickly or for being stupid or ugly or ignorant
She envied Zekehis unwavering belief in religion
She believed but her tender heart was always leading her into doubts
She at last got some sort of control over her voice
Itll turn out for the best she said with her back to Susan
It dont make much difference nohow who a woman marries so long as hes steady and a good provider
Jeb seems to be a nice feller
Hes better looking than your Uncle George was before he went to town and married a Lenox and got sleeked up
And Jeb aint near so close as some
Thats a lot in a husband
And in a kind of hysteria bred of fear of silence just then she rattled on telling how this man lay awake o nights thinking how to skin a flea for its hide and tallow how that one had said only a fool would pay over a quarter for a new hat for his wife Will it be long
asked the girl
Ill go down and see said Mrs Warham glad of a real excuse for leaving the room
She began to cry as soon as she was in the hall
Two sparrows lit upon the window sill near Susan and screamed and pecked at each other in a mock fight
She watched them but her shiver at the faint sound of her aunts returning step far away down the stairs showed where her attention was
When Zekes wife entered she was standing and said Is it time
Come on honey
Now dont be afraid
Susan advanced with a firm step preceded her aunt down the stairs
The black slouch hat and the straw of dignified cut were side by side on the shiny hall table
The parlor door was open the rarely used showroom gave forth an earthy moldy odor like that of a disturbed grave
Its shutters for the first time in perhaps a year were open the mud daubers that had built in the crevices between shutters and sills fancying they would never be disturbed were buzzing crossly about their ruined homes
The four men were seated each with his legs crossed and each wearing the funereal expression befitting a solemn occasion
Susan did not lift her eyes
The profusely whiskered man seated on the haircloth sofa smoothed his black alpaca coat reset the black tie deep hid by his beard rose and advanced with a clerical smile whose real kindliness took somewhat from its offensive unction
This is the young lady is it
said he reaching for Susans rising but listless hand
She is indeed a young lady
The two Warham men stood shifting uneasily from leg to leg and rubbing their faces from time to time
Sallie Warham was standing also her big unhealthy face twitching fantastically
Jeb alone was seatedchair tilted back hands in trousers pockets a bucolic grin of embarrassment giving an expression of pain to his common features
A strained silence then Zeke Warham said I reckon we might as well go ahead
The preacher took a small blackbound book from the inside pocket of his limp and dusty coat cleared his throat turned over the pages
That rustling the creaking of his collar on his overstarched shirt band and the buzzing of the mud daubers round the windows were the only sounds
The preacher found the place cleared his throat again
Mr Ferguson Jeb tall spare sallow rose awkwardly 
You and Miss Lenox will take your places here and he indicated a position before him
Susan was already in place Jeb shuffled up to stand at her left
Sallie Warham hid her face in her apron
The preacher cleared his throat vigorously beganDearly belovedand so on and on
When he put the questions to Susan and Jeb he told them what answer was expected and they obeyed him Jeb muttering Susan with a mere movement of the lips
When he had finisheda matter of less than three minuteshe shook hands warmly first with Susan then with Jeb
Live in the fear of the Lord he said
Thats all thats necessary
Sallie put down her apron
Her face was haggard and gray
She kissed Susan tenderly then led her from the room
They went upstairs to the bedroom
Do you want to stay to dinner
she asked in the hoarse undertone of funeral occasions
Or would you rather go right away
Id rather go said the girl
You set down and make yourself comfortable
Ill hook up your shawl strap
Susan sat by the window her hands in her lap
The hand with the new circlet of gold on it was uppermost
Sallie busied herself with the bundle abruptly she threw her apron over her face knelt by the bed and sobbed and uttered inarticulate moans
The girl made no sound did not move looked unseeingly at her inert hands
A few moments and Sallie set to work again
She soon had the bundle ready brought Susans hat put it on
Its so hot I reckon youll carry your jacket
I aint seen as pretty a blue dress as thisyet its plainlike too
She went to the top of the stairs
She wants to go Jeb she called loudly
Youd better get the sulky ready
The answer from below was the heavy thump of Jebs boots on the oilcloth covering of the hall floor
Susan from the window dully watched the young farmer unhitch the mare and lead her up in front of the gate
Come on honey said Aunt Sallie taking up the bundle
The girlshe seemed a child nowfollowed her
On the front stoop were George and his brother and the preacher
The men made room for them to pass
Sallie opened the gate Susan went out
Youll have to hold the bundle said Sallie
Susan mounted to the seat took the bundle on her knees
Jeb who had the lines left the mares head and got up beside his bride
Good day all he said nodding at the men on the stoop
Good day Mrs
Warham
Come and see us real soon said Sallie
Her fat chin was quivering her tiredlooking washedout eyes gazed mournfully at the girl who was acting and looking as if she were walking in her sleep
Good day all repeated Jeb and again he made the clucking sound
Goodby and God bless you said the preacher
His nostrils were luxuriously sniffing the air which bore to them odors of cookery
The mare set out
Susans gaze rested immovably upon the heavy bundle in her lap
As the road was in wretched repair Jebs whole attention was upon his driving
At the gate between barnyard and pasture he said You hold the lines while I get down
Susans fingers closed mechanically upon the strips of leather
Jeb led the mare through the gate closed it resumed his seat
This time the mare went on without exacting the clucking sound
They were following the rocky road along the wester hillside of the pasture hollow
As they slowly made their way among the deep ruts and bowlders from frequent moistenings of the lips and throats noises and twitchings of body and hands it was evident that the young farmer was getting ready for conversation
The struggle at last broke surface with Zeke Warham dont waste no time road patchindoes he
Susan did not answer
Jeb studied her out of the corner of his eye the first time a fairly good bit of roadway permitted
He could make nothing of her face except that it was about the prettiest he had ever seen
Plainly she was not eager to get acquainted still acquainted they must get
So he tried again My sister Keziahshe keeps house for meshell be mighty surprised when I turn up with a wife
I didnt let on to her what I was about nary a word
He laughed and looked expectantly at the girl
Her expression was unchanged
Jeb again devoted himself to his driving
No I didnt let on he presently resumed
Fact is I want sure myself till I seed you at the winder
He smiled flirtatiously at her
Then I decided to go ahead
I dunno but I somehow kinder allow you and mell hit it off purty welldont you
Susan tried to speak
She found that she could notthat she had nothing to say
Youre the kind of a girl I always had my mind set on pursued Jeb who was an expert lovemaker
I like a smooth skin and pouty lips that looks as if they wanted to be kissed
He took the reins in one hand put his arm round her clumsily found her lips with his
She shrank slightly then submitted
But Jeb somehow felt no inclination to kiss her again
After a moment he let his arm drop away from her waist and took the reins in both hands with an elaborate pretense that the bad road compelled it
A long silence then he tried again Its cool and nice under these here trees aint it
Yes she said
I aint saw you out here for several years now
How long has it been
Three summers ago
You must a growed some
I dont seem to recollect you
You like the country
Yes
Sho
Youre just sayin that
You want to live in town
Well so do I
And as soon as I get things settled a little Im goin to take what Ive got and the two thousand from your Uncle George and open up a livery stable in town
Susans strange eyes turned upon him
In Sutherland
she asked breathlessly
Right in Sutherland replied he complacently
I think Ill buy Jake Antles place in Jefferson Street
Susan was blanched and trembling
Oh no she cried
You mustnt do that
Jeb laughed
You see if I dont
And well live in style and you can keep a gal and stay dolled up all the time
Oh I know how to treat you
I want to stay in the country cried Susan
I hate Sutherland
Now dont you be afraid soothed Jeb
When people see youve got a husband and money theyll not be down on you no more
Theyll forget all about your mawand they wont know nothin about the other thing
You treat me right and Ill treat you right
Im not one to rake up the past
There aint arry bit of meanness about me
But youll let me stay here in the country
pleaded Susan
Her imagination was torturing her with pictures of herself in Sutherland and the people craning and whispering and mocking
You go where I go replied Jeb
A womans place is with her man
And Ill knock anybody down that looks cockeyed at you
Oh
murmured Susan sinking back against the support
Dont you fret Susie ordered Jeb confident and patronizing
You do what I say and everythingll be all right
Thats the way to get along with me and get nice clothesdo what I say
With them that crosses me Im mighty ugly
But you aint agoin to cross me



Now about the house
I reckon Id better send Keziah off right away
You kin cook
Aa little said Susan
Jeb looked relieved
Then shed be in the way
Two women about always fightsand Keziahs got the Ferguson temper
Shes afraid of me but now and then she fergits and has a tantrum
Jeb looked at her with a smile and a frown
Perk up a little he more than half ordered
I dont want Keziah jeerin at me
Susan made a pitiful effort to smile
He eyed it sourly grunted gave the mare a cut with the whip that caused her to leap forward in a gallop
Whoa
he yelled
Whoadamn you
And he sawed cruelly at her mouth until she quieted down
A turning and they were before a shallow storyandahalf frame house which squatted like an old roadside beggar behind a weatherbeaten picket fence
The sagging shingle roof sloped abruptly there were four little windows downstairs and two smaller upstairs
The door was in the center of the house a weedy path led from its crooked step between two patches of weedy grass to the gate in the fence
Whoa
shouted Jeb with the double purpose of stopping the mare and informing the house of his arrival
Then to Susan You git down and Ill drive round to the barn yonder
He nodded toward a dilapidated clapboard structure small and mean set between a dirty lopsided straw heap and a manure heap
Go right in and make yourself at home
Tell Keziah who you air
Ill be along soon as I unhitch and feed the mare
Susan was staring stupidly at the houseat her new home
Git down he said sharply
You dont act as if your hearin or your manners was much to brag on
He felt awkward and embarrassed with this delicately bred lovely childwoman in the to him wonderfully fine and fashionable dress
To hide his nervousness and to brave it out he took the only way he knew the only way shy people usually knowthe way of gruffness
It was not a ferocious gruffness for a man of his kind but it seemed so to her who had been used to gentleness only until these last few days
His grammar his untrained voice his rough clothes the odor of stale sweat and farm labor he exhaled made him horrible to herthough she only vaguely knew why she felt so wretched and why her body shrank from him
She stepped down from the sulky almost falling in her dizziness and blindness
Jeb touched the mare with the whip and she was alone before the housea sweet forlorn figure childish utterly out of place in those surroundings
On the threshold in faded and patched calico stood a tall gaunt woman with a family likeness to Jeb
She had thin shiny black hair a hard brown skin high cheekbones and snapping black eyes
When her thin lips parted she showed on the left side of the mouth three large and glittering gold teeth that in the contrast made their gray not too clean neighbors seem white
Howdy
she called in a tone of hostility
Susan tried in vain to respond
She stood gazing
What dye want
He he told me to go in faltered Susan
She had no sense of reality
It was a dreamonly a dreamand she would awaken in her own clean pretty palegray bedroom with Ruth gayly calling her to come down to breakfast
Who are you
demanded Keziahfor at a glance it was the sister
ImIm Susan Lenox
OhZeke Warhams niece
Come right in
And Keziah looked as if she were about to bite and claw
Susan pushed open the latchless gate went up the short path to the doorstep
I think Ill wait till he comes she said
No
Come in and sit down Miss Lenox
And Keziah drew a rushbottomed rocking chair toward the doorway
Susan was looking at the interior
The lower floor of the house was divided into three small rooms
This central room was obviously the parlorthe calicocovered sofa the center table the two dingy chromos and a battered cottage organ made that certain
On the floor was a rag carpet on the walls torn and dirty paper with huge weather stains marking where water had leaked from the roof down the supporting beams
Keziah scowled at Susans frank expression of repulsion for the surroundings
Susan seated herself on the edge of the chair put her bundle beside her
I allow youll stay to dinner said Keziah
Yes replied Susan
Then Ill go put on some more to cook
Oh noplease dontI couldnt eat anythingreally I couldnt
The girl spoke hysterically
Just then Jeb came round the house and appeared in the doorway
He grinned and winked at Susan looked at his sister
Well Keziah said he what dye think of her
She says shes going to stay to dinner  observed Keziah trying to maintain the veneer of manners she had put on for company
The young man laughed loudly
Thats a good onethat is
he cried nodding and winking at Susan
So you aint tole her
Well Keziah Ive been and gone and got married
And there she is
Shut upyou fool
said Keziah
And she looked apologetically at their guest
But the expression of Susans face made her catch her breath
For the Lords sake
she ejaculated
She aint married you Why not
demanded Jeb
Aint this a free country
Aint I as good as anybody
Keziah blew out her breath in a great gust and seated herself on the tattered calico cover of the sofa
Susan grew deathly white
Her hands trembled
Then she sat quiet upon the edge of the old rushbottomed chair
There was a terrible silence broken by Jebs saying loudly and fiercely Keziah you go get the dinner
Then you pack your duds and clear out for Uncle Bobs
Keziah stared at the bride rose and went to the rear door
Im goin now she answered
The dinners ready except for putting on the table
Through the flimsy partitions they heard her mounting the uncarpeted stairs hustling about upon an uncarpeted floor above and presently descending
Ill hoof it she said reappearing in the doorway
Ill send for my things this afternoon
Jeb not caring to provoke the Ferguson temper said nothing
As for this here marryin continued Keziah I never allowed youd fall so low as to take a baby and a bastard at that
She whirled away
Jeb flung his hat on the table flung himself on the sofa
Wellthats settled said he
You kin get the dinner
Its all in there
And he jerked his head toward the door in the partition to the left
Susan got up moved toward the indicated door
Jeb laughed
Dont you think you might take off your hat and stay awhile
said he
She removed her hat put it on top of the bundle which she left on the floor beside the rocking chair
She went into the kitchen diningroom
It was a squalid room its ceiling and walls smokestained from the cracked and never polished stove in the corner
The air was foul with the strong old onions stewing on the stove
In a skillet slices of pork were frying
On the back of the stove stood a pan of mashed potatoes and a tin coffeepot
On the stained flowered cloth which covered the table in the middle of the room had been laid coarse cracked dishes and discolored steel knives and forks with black wooden handles
Susan half fainting dropped into a chair by one of the open windows
A multitude of fat flies from the stable were running and crawling everywhere were buzzing about her head
She was aroused by Jebs voice Why what thethe damnation
Youve fell asleep
She started up
In a minute
she muttered nervously
And somehow with Jebs eyes on her from the doorway she got the evilsmelling messes from the stove into table dishes from the shelves and then on the table where the flies descended upon them in troops of scores and hundreds
Jeb in his shirt sleeves now sat down and fell to
She sat opposite him her hands in her lap
He used his knife in preference to his fork leaping the blade high packing the food firmly upon it with fork or fingers then thrusting it into his mouth
He ate voraciously smacking his lips breathing hard now and then eructing with frank energy and satisfaction
My stummicks gassy right smart this year he observed after a huge gulp of coffee
Some says the heavy rains last spring put gas into everything but I dunno
Maybe its Keziahs cooking
I hope youll do better
Why you aint eatin nothin
Im not hungry said Susan
Then as he frowned suspiciously I had a late breakfast
He laughed
And the marrying too he suggested with a flirtatious nod and wink
Womens always upset by them kind of things
When he had filled himself he pushed his chair back
Ill set with you while you wash up said he
But youd better take off them Sunday duds
Youll find some calikers that belonged to maw in a box under the bed in our room
He laughed and winked at her
Thats the one on tother side of the settinroom
Yesthats ourn
And he winked again
The girl ghastly white her great eyes staring like a sleepwalkers rose and stood resting one hand on the back of the chair to steady her
Jeb drew a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lighted it
Usually said he I take a pipe or a chaw
But this bein a weddin day He laughed and winked again rose took her in his arms and kissed her
She made a feeble gesture of thrusting him away
Her head reeled her stomach turned
She got away as soon as he would release her crossed the sittingroom and entered the tiny dingy bedroom
The windows were down and the bed had not yet been made
The odor was nauseatingthe staleness left by a not too clean sleeper who abhors fresh air
Susan saw the box under the bed knelt to draw it out
But instead she buried her face in her hands burst into wild sobs
Oh God she prayed stop punishing me
I didnt mean to do wrongand Im sure my mother didnt either
Stop for Thy Sons sake amen
Now surely she would wake
God must answer that prayer
She dared not take her palms from her eyes
Suddenly she felt herself caught from behind
She gave a wild scream and sprang up
Jeb was looking at her with eyes that filled her with a fear more awful than the fear of death
Dont
she cried
Dont
Never mind hon said he in a voice that was terrible just because it was soft
Its only your husband
My but youre purty
And he seized her
She fought
He crushed her
He kissed her with great slobbering smacks and gnawed at the flesh of her neck with teeth that craved to bite
Oh Mr Ferguson for pitys sake
she wailed
Then she opened her mouth wide as one gasping for breath where there is no air and pushing at him with all her strength she vented a series of maniac shrieks
CHAPTER X LATE that afternoon Jeb returned to the house after several hours of uneasy aimless pottering about at barn and woodshed
He stumped and stamped around the kitchen then in the sittingroom finally he mustered the courage to look into the bedroom from which he had slunk like a criminal three hours before
There she lay apparently in the same position
Her waxen color and her absolute stillness added fear to his sense of guilta guilt against which he protested because he felt he had simply done what God and man expected of him
He stood in the low doorway for some time stood there peering and craning until his fear grew so great that he could no longer put off ending or confirming it
Sleepin
said he in a hoarse undertone
She did not reply she did not move
He could not see that she was breathing
Itll soon be time to git supper he went onnot because he was thinking of supper but because he was desperately clutching for something that must draw a reply from herif she could reply
Want me to clean up the dinner and put the supper things on
She made a feeble effort to rise sank back again
He drew an audible sigh of relief at least she was not what her color had suggested
In fact she was morbidly conscious
The instant she had heard him at the outer door she had begun to shiver and shake and not until he moved toward the bedroom door did she become quiet
Then a calm had come into her nerves and her fleshthe calm that descends upon the brave when the peril actually faces
As he stood there her eyes were closed but the smell of himbeneath the earthy odor of his clothing the odor of the bodies of those who eat strong coarse foodstole into her nostrils into her nerves
Her whole body sickened and shrankfor to her now that odor meant marriageand she would not have believed Hell contained or Heaven permitted such a thing as was marriage
She understood now why the Bible always talked of man as a vile creature born in sin
Jeb was stealthily watching her ghastly face her limp body
Feelin sickish
he asked
A slight movement of the head in assent
I kin ride over to Beecamp and fetch Doc Christie
Another and negative shake of the head more determined
The pale lips murmured Nono thank you
She was not hating him
He existed for her only as a symbol in this hideous dream called life that was coiled like a snake about her and was befouling her and stinging her to death
Dont you bother bout supper said he with gruff shamefaced generosity
Ill look out for myself this onct
He withdrew to the kitchen where she heard him clattering dishes and pans
Daylight waned to twilight twilight to dusk to darkness
She did not think she did not feel except an occasional dull pang from some bodily bruise
Her soul her mind were absolutely numb
Suddenly a radiance beat upon her eyes
All in an instant before the lifting of her eyelids soul and body became exquisitely acute for she thought it was he come again with a lamp
She looked it was the moon whose beams struck full in at the uncurtained window and bathed her face in their mild brighteness
She closed her eyes again and presently fell asleepthe utter relaxed sleep of a child that is worn out with pain when nature turns gentle nurse and sets about healing and soothing as only nature can
When she awoke it was with a scream
No she was not dreaming there was an odor in the roomhis odor with that of a saloon added to it
After cooking and eating supper he had taken the jug from its concealment behind the woodbox and had proceeded to cheer his drooped spirits
The more he drank the better content he was with himself with his conduct and the clearer became his conviction that the girl was simply playing womans familiar game of dainty modesty
A proper game it was too only a man must not pay attention to it unless he wished his woman to despise him
When this conviction reached the point of action he put away the jug washed the glass ate a liberal mouthful of the leftover stewed onions as he would not for worlds have his bride catch him tippling
He put out the lamp and went to the bedroom chuckling to himself like a man about to play a particularly clever and extremely goodhumored practical joke
His preparations for the night were as always extremely simple merely a flinging off of his outer clothes and in summer his socks
From time to time he cast an admiring amorous glance at the lovely childlike face in the full moonlight
As he was about to stretch himself on the bed beside her he happened to note that she was dressed as when she came
That stylish Sundayish dress was already too much mussed and wrinkled
He leaned over to wake her with a kiss
It was then that she started up with a scream
Ohohmy God
she exclaimed passing her hand over her brow and staring at him with crazed anguished eyes
Its jest me said he
Thought youd want to git ready fur bed like as not
No thank you no she stammered drawing away toward the inner side of the bed
Please I want to be as I am
Now dont put on sweetness he wheedled
You know youre married and ave got to git used to it
He laid his hand on her arm
She had intended to obey since that was the law of God and man and since in all the world there was no other place for her nameless and outcast
But at his touch she clenched her teeth cried NoMr Fergusonpleaseplease let me be
Now hon he pleaded seizing her with strong gentleness
There aint no call to be skittish
Were married you know
She wrenched herself free
He seized her again
Whats the use of puttin on
I know all about you
You little noname he cursed when her teeth sank into his hand
For an instant at that reminder of her degradation her indelible shame that made her of the low and the vile she collapsed in weakness
Then with new and fierce strength she fought again
When she had exhausted herself utterly she relaxed fell to sobbing and moaning feebly trying to shelter her face from his gluttonous and odorous kisses
And upon the scene the moon shone in all that beauty which from time immemorial has filled the hearts of lovers with ecstasy and of devotees with prayer
They lay quietly side by side he fell into a profound sleep
He was full upon his back his broad chest heaving in the gray cotton undershirt his mouth wide open with its upper fringe of hair in disarray and agitated by his breath
Soon he began to snore a deafening clamor that set some loose object in the dark part of the room to vibrating with a tapping sound
Susan stealthily raised herself upon her elbow looked at him
There was neither horror nor fear in her haggard face but only eagerness to be sure he would not awaken
She inch by inch more softly than a cat climbed over the low footboard was standing on the floor
One silent step at a time with eyes never from his face so clear in the moonlight she made her way toward the door
The snoring stoppedand her heart stopped with it
He gasped gurgled gave a snort and sat up
Whatwhich he ejaculated
Then he saw her near the door
Hellowhar ye goin
I thought Id undress she lied calmly and smoothly
Ohthats right
And he lay down
She stood in the darkness making now and then a faint sound suggestive of undressing
The snoring began againsoft then deep then the steady uproarious intake with the fierce whistling exhalation
She went into the sittingroom felt round in the darkness swift and noiseless
On the sofa she found her bundle tore it open
By feeling alone she snatched her sailor hat a few handkerchiefs two stockings a collar her fingers chanced upon and a toothbrush
She darted to the front door was outside was gliding down the path out through the gate into the road
To the left would be the way she had come
She ran to the right with never a backward glanceran with all the speed in her lithe young body ran with all the energy of her fear and horror and resolve to die rather than be taken
For a few hundred yards the road lay between open fields
But after that it entered a wood
And in that dimness she felt the first beginnings of a sense of freedom
Half a mile and open fields again with a small house on the right a road southeastward on the left
That would be away from her Uncle Zekes and also away from Sutherland which lay twenty miles to the southwest
When she would be followed Jeb would not think of this direction until he had exhausted the other two
She walked she ran she rested she walked and ran and walked again
The moon ascended to the zenith crossed the levels of the upper sky went down in the west a long bar of dusky gray outlined a cloud low upon the horizon in the northeast
She was on the verge of collapse
Her skin the inside of her mouth were hot and dry
She had to walk along at snails pace or her heart would begin to beat as if it were about to burst and the blood would choke up into the veins of her throat to suffocate her
A terrible pain came in her sidecame and wentcame and stayed
She had passed turning after turning to the right to the leftcrossroads leading away in all directions
She had kept to the main road because she did not wish to lose time perhaps return upon her path in the confusion of the darkness
Now she began to look about her at the country
It was still the hills as round Zeke Warhamsthe hills of southeastern Indiana
But they were steeper and higher for she was moving toward the river
There was less open ground more and denser undergrowth and forest
She felt that she was in a wilderness was safe
Night still lay too thick upon the landscape for her to distinguish anything but outlines
She sat down on the ruined and crumbling panel of a zigzag fence to rest and to wait for light
She listened a profound hush
She was alone all alone
How far had she come
She could not guess but she knew that she had done well
She would have been amazed if she had known how well
All the years of her life thanks to Mrs Warhams good sense about health she had been steadily adding to the vitality and strength that were hers by inheritance
Thus the response to this first demand upon them had been almost inevitable
It augured well for the future if the future should draw her into hardships
She knew she had gone far and in what was left of the night and with what was left of her strength she would put such a distance between her and them that they would never believe she had got so far even should they seek in this direction
She was supporting her head upon her hands her elbows upon her knees
Her eyes closed her head nodded she fought against the impulse but she slept
When she straightened up with a start it was broad day
The birds must have finished their morning song for there was only happy comfortable chirping in the branches above her
She rose stiffly
Her legs her whole body ached and her feet were burning and blistered
But she struck out resolutely
After she had gone halfway down a long steep hill she had to turn back because she had left her only possessions
It was a weary climb and her heart quaked with terror
But no one appeared and at last she was once more at the ruins of the fence panel
There lay her sailor hat the handkerchiefs wrapped round the toothbrush the collarand two stockings one black the other brown
And where was her purse
Not there certainly
She glanced round in swift alarm
No one
Yet she had been absolutely sure she had taken her purse from the sittingroom table when she came upon it feeling about in the dark
She had forgotten it she was without a cent
But she had no time to waste in selfreproaches or forebodings
Though the stockings would be of no use to her she took them along because to leave them was to leave a trail
She hastened down the hill
At the bottom ran a deep creekwithout a bridge
The road was now a mere cowpath which only the stoutest vehicles or a horseman would adventure
To her left ran an even wilder trail following the downward course of the creek
She turned out of the road entered the trail
She came to a place where the bowlders over which the creek foamed and splashed as it hurried southeastward were big and numerous enough to make a crossing
She took it went slowly on down the other bank
There was no sign of human intrusion
Steeply on either side rose a hill strewn with huge bowlders many of them large as large houses
The sun filtered through the foliage to make a bright pattern upon the carpet of last years leaves
The birds twittered and chirped the creek hummed its drowsy soothing melody
She was wretchedly weary and Oh so hungry
A little further and two of the great bowlders tumbled down from the steeps had cut off part of the creek had formed a pool which their seamed and pitted and fernadorned walls hid from all observation except that of the birds and the squirrels in the boughs
At once she thought how refreshed she would be if she could bathe in those cool waters
She looked round stepped in between the bowlders
She peered out she listened
She was safe she drew back into her little inclosure
There was a small dry shelf of rock
She hurried off her clothes stood a moment in the delicious warmth of the sunshine stepped into the pool
She would have liked to splash about but she dared make no sound that could be heard above the noise of the water
Luckily the creek was just there rather loud as it was expressing its extreme annoyance over the stolid impudence of the interrupting bowlders
While she was waiting for the sun to dry her she looked at her underclothes
She simply could not put them on as they were
She knelt at the edge of the shelf and rinsed them out as well as she could
Then she spread them on the thick tufts of overhanging fern where the hot sun would get full swing at them
The brown stocking of the two mismates she had brought along almost matched the pair she was wearing
As there was a hole in the toe of one of them she discarded it and so had one fresh stocking
She dried her feet thoroughly with the stocking she was discarding
Then she put her corsets and her dress directly upon her body
She could not afford to wait until the underclothes dried she would carry them until she found for herself a more remote and better hiding place where she could await nightfall
She stuffed the stocking with the hole deep into a cleft in the rock and laid a small stone upon it so that it was concealed
Here where there were no traces no reminders of the human race which had cast her out and pursued her with torture of body and soul here in the wilderness her spirits were going up and her young eyes were looking hopefully round and forward
The uppiling horrors of those two days and their hideous climax seemed a dream which the sun had scattered
Hopefully
That blessed inexperience and sheer imagination of youth enabling it to hope in a large vague way when to hope for any definite and real thing would be impossible
She cleaned her tan low shoes with branches of fern and grass put them on
It is impossible to account for the peculiarities of physical vanity
Probably no one was ever born who had not physical vanity of some kind Susans was her feet and ankles
Not her eyes nor her hair nor her contour nor her skin nor her figure though any or all of these might well have been her pleasure
Of them she never thought in the way of pride or vanity
But of her feet and ankles she was both proud and vainin a reserved wholly unobtrusive way be it said so quietly that she had passed unsuspected
There was reason for this shy secret selfsatisfaction so amusing in one otherwise selfunconscious
Her feet were beautifully formed and the curves of her instep and ankle were beautiful
She gave more attention now to the look of her shoes and of her stockings than to all the rest of this difficult woodland toilet
She then put on the sailor hat fastened the collar to her garter slipped the handkerchiefs into the legs of her stockings
Carrying her underclothes ready to roll them into a ball should she meet anyone she resumed her journey into that rocky wilderness
She was sore she had pains that were the memories of the worst horrors of her hideous dream but up in her strong healthy body up through her strong young soul surged joy of freedom and joy of hope
Compared with what her lot had been until such a few brief days before this lot of friendless wanderer in the wilderness was dark indeed
But she was comparing it with the monstrous dream from which it was the awakening
She was almost happyand madly hungry
An enormous bowlder high above her and firmly fixed in the spine of the hill invited as a place where she could see without being seen could hide securely until darkness came again
She climbed to the base of it found that she might reach the top by stepping from ledge to ledge with the aid of the trees growing so close around it that some of their boughs seemed rooted in its weatherdented cliffs
She dragged herself upward the fifty or sixty feet glad of the difficulties because they would make any pursuer feel certain she had not gone that way
After perhaps an hour she came upon a flat surface where soil had formed where grass and wild flowers and several little trees gave shade and a place to sleep
And from her eyrie she commanded a vast sweep of countryhills and valleys fields creeks here and there lonely farmhouses and far away to the east the glint of the river
To the river
That was her destination
And somehow it would be kind would take her where she would never never dream those frightful dreams again
She went to the side of the bowlder opposite that which she had climbed
She drew back hastily ready to cry with vexation
It was not nearly so high or so steep and on the slope of the hill a short distance away was set a little farmhouse with smoke curling up from its rough stone chimney
She dropped to all fours in the tall grass and moved cautiously toward the edge
Flat upon her breast she worked her way to the edge and looked down
A faintly lined path led from the house through a gate in a zigzag fence and up to the base of her fortress
The rock had so crumbled on that side that a sort of path extended clear up to the top
But her alarm quieted somewhat when she noted how the path was grassgrown
As nearly as she could judge it was about five oclock
So that smoke meant breakfast
Her eyes fixed hungrily upon the thin column of violet vapor mounting straight into the still morning air
When smoke rose in that fashion she remembered it was sure sign of clear weather
And then the thought came What if it had been raining
She simply could not have got away
As she interestedly watched the little house and its yard she saw hurrying through the burdock and dog fennel toward the base of her rock a determined looking hen
Susan laughed silently it was so obvious that the hen was on a pressing and secret business errand
But almost immediately her attention was distracted to observing the movements of a human being she could obscurely make out through one of the windows just back of the chimney
Soon she saw that it was a woman cleaning up a kitchen after breakfastthe early breakfast of the farmhouse in summer
What had they had for breakfast
She sniffed the air
I think I can smell ham and cornbread she said aloud and laughed partly at the absurdity of her fancy chiefly at the idea of such attractive food
She aggravated her hunger by letting her imagination loose upon the glorious possibilities
A stealthy fluttering brought her glance back to the point where the hen had disappeared
The hen reappeared hastened down the path and through the weeds and rejoined the flock in the yard with an air which seemed to say No indeed Ive been right here all the time
Now what was she up to
wondered Susan and the answer came to her
Eggs
A nest hidden somewhere near or in the base of the rock
Could she get down to that nest without being seen from the house or from any other part of the region below
She drew back from the edge crawled through the grass to the place where the path if path it could be called reached the top
She was delighted to find that it made the ascent through a wide cleft and not along the outside
She let herself down cautiously as the footway was crumbling and rotten and slippery with grass
At the lower end of the cleft she peered out
Trees and bushesplenty of them a thick shield between her and the valleys
She moved slowly downward a misstep might send her through the boughs to the hillside forty feet below
She had gone up and down several times before her hungersharpened eyes caught the gleam of white through the ferns growing thickly out of the moist mossy cracks which everywhere seamed the wall
She pushed the ferns aside
There was the nest the length of her forearm into the dim seclusion of a deep hole
She felt round found the egg that was warm
And as she drew it out she laughed softly and said half aloud Breakfast is ready
No not quite ready
Hooking one arm round the bough of a tree that shot up from the hillside to the height of the rock and beyond she pressed her foot firmly against the protecting root of an ancient vine of poison ivy
Thus ensconced she had free hands and she proceeded to remove the thin shell of the egg piece by piece
She had difficulty in restraining herself until the end
At last she put the whole egg into her mouth
And never had she tasted anything so good
But one egg was only an appetizer
She reached in again
She did not wish to despoil the meritorious hen unnecessarily so she held the egg up in her inclosing fingers and looked through it as she had often seen the cook do at home
She was not sure but the inside seemed muddy
She laid it to one side tried another
It was clear and she ate it as she had eaten the first
She laid aside the third the fourth and the fifth
The sixth seemed all rightbut was not
Fortunately she had not been certain enough to feel justified in putting the whole egg into her mouth before tasting it
The taste however was enough to make her reflect that perhaps on the whole two eggs were sufficient for breakfast especially as there would be at least dinner and supper before she could go further
As she did not wish to risk another descent she continued to sort out the eggs
She found four that were or seemed to be all right
The thirteen that looked doubtful or worse when tested by the light she restored with the greatest care
It was an interesting illustration of the rare quality of consideration which at that period of her life dominated her character
She put the four eggs in the bosom of her blouse and climbed up to her eyrie
All at once she felt the delicious languor of body and mind which is Natures forewarning that she is about to put us to sleep whether we will or no
She lost all anxiety about safety looked hastily around for a bed
She found just the place in a corner of the little tableland where the grass grew tall and thick
She took from her bosom the four eggsher dinner and supperand put them between the roots of a tree with a cover of broad leaves over them to keep them cool
She pulled grass to make a pillow took off her collar and laid herself down to sleep
And that days sun did not shine upon a prettier sight than this soundly and sweetly sleeping girl with her oval face suffused by a gentle flush with her rounded young shoulders just moving the bosom of her gray silk blouse with her slim graceful legs curled up to the edge of her carefully smoothed blue serge skirt
You would have said never a care much less a sorrow had shadowed her dawning life
And that is what it means to be youngand free from the curse of selfpity and ignorant of lifes saddest truth that future and past are not two contrasts one is surely bright and the other is sober but they are parts of a continuous fabric woven of the same threads and into the same patterns from beginning to end
When she awoke beautifully rested her eyes clear and soft the shadows which had been long toward the southwest were long though not so long toward the southeast
She sat up and smiled it was so fine to be free
And her woes had not in the least shaken that serene optimism which is youths most delightful if most dangerous possession
She crawled through the grass to the edge of the rock and looked out through the screening leaves of the dense undergrowth
There was no smoke from the chimney of the house
The woman in a blue calico was sitting on the back doorstep knitting
Farther away in fields here and there a few mennot a dozen in allwere at work
From a barnyard at the far edge of the western horizon came the faint sound of a steam thresher and she thought she could see the men at work around it but this might have been illusion
It was a serene and lovely panorama of summer and country
Last of all her eyes sought the glimpse of distant river
She ate two of her four eggs put on the underclothes which were now thoroughly sundried shook out and rebraided her hair
Then she cast about for some way to pass the time
She explored the whole top of the rock but that did not use up more than fifteen minutes as it was so small that every part was visible from every other part
However she found a great many wild flowers and gathered a huge bouquet of the audacious colors of natures gardens so common yet so effective
She did a little botanizinganything to occupy her mind and keep it from the ugly visions and fears
But all too soon she had exhausted the resources of her hiding place
She looked down into the valley to the norththe valley through which she had come
She might go down there and roam it would be something to do and her young impatience of restraint was making her so restless that she felt she could not endure the confines of that little rock
It had seemed huge a brief experience of freedom a few hours between her and the nights horrors and terrors and it had shrunk to a tiny prison cell
Surely she would run no risk in journeying through that trackless wilderness she need not be idle she could hasten her destiny by following the creek in its lonely wanderings which must sooner or later bring it to the river
The river
She was about to get the two remaining eggs and abandon her stronghold when it occurred to her that she would do well to take a last look all around
She went back to the side of the rock facing the house
The woman had suspended knitting and was gazing intently across the hollow to the west where the road from the north entered the landscape
Susan turned her eyes in that direction
Two horsemen at a gallop were moving southward
The girl was well screened but instinctively she drew still further back behind the bushesbut not so far that the two on horseback riding so eagerly were out of her view
The road dipped into the hollow
the galloping horsemen disappeared with it
Susan shifted her gaze to the point on the brow of the hill where the road reappeared
She was quivering in every nerve
When they came into view again she would know
The place she was watching swam before her eyes
Suddenly the two still at a gallop rose upon the crest of the hill
Jeb and her Uncle Zeke
Her vision cleared her nerve steadied
They did not draw rein until they were at the road gate of the little house
The woman rose put down her knitting in the seat of her stiff rushbottomed rocker advanced to the fence
The air was still but Susan could not hear a sound though she craned forward and strained her ears to the uttermost
She shrank as if she had been struck when the three began to gaze up at the rockto gaze it seemed to her at the very spot where she was standing
Was her screen less thick than she thought
Had they seenif not her perhaps part of her dress
Wildly her heart beat as Jeb dismounted from his horse the mare behind which she had made her wedding journeyand stood in the gateway talking with the woman and looking toward the top of the rock
Zeke Warham turned his horse and began to ride slowly away
He got as far as the brow of the hill with Jeb still in the gateway hesitating
Then Susan heard Hold on Mr Warham
I reckon youre right
Warham halted his horse Jeb remounted and joined him
As the woman returned toward the back doorstep the two men rode at a walk down into the hollow
When they reappeared it was on the road by which they had come
And the girl knew the pursuit in that directionthe right directionwas over
Trembling and with a fluttering in her breast like the flapping of a birds wings she sank to the ground
Presently she burst into a passion of tears
Without knowing why she tore off the wedding ring which until then she had forgotten and flung it out among the treetops
A few minutes and she dried her eyes and stood up
The two horsemen were leaving the landscape at the point at which they had entered it
The girl would not have known would have been frightened by her own face had she seen it as she watched them go out of her sightout of her life
She did not understand herself for she was at that age when one is no more conscious of the forces locked up within his unexplored and untested character than the dynamite cartridge is of its secrets of power and terror
CHAPTER XI SHE felt free to go now
She walked toward the place where she had left the eggs
It was on the side of the rock overlooking the creek
As she knelt to remove the leaves she heard from far below a mans voice singing
She leaned forward and glanced down at the creek
In a moment appeared a young man with a fishing rod and a bag slung over his shoulder
His gray and white striped flannel trousers were rolled to his knees
His fair skin and the fair hair waving about his forehead were exposed by the flappingbrimmed straw hat set upon the back of his head
His voice a strong and manly tenor was sending up those steeps a song she had never heard beforea song in Italian
She had not seen what he looked like when she remembered herself and hastily fell back from view
She dropped to the grass and crawled out toward the ledge
When she showed her face it so happened that he was looking straight at her
Hello
he shouted
That you Nell
Susan drew back her blood in a tumult
From below after a brief silence came a burst of laughter
She waited a long time then through a shield of bunches of grass looked again
The young man was gone
She wished that he had resumed his song for she thought she had never heard one so beautiful
Because she did not feel safe in descending until he was well out of the way and because she was so comfortable lying there in the afternoon sunshine watching the birds and listening to them she continued on there glancing now and then at where the creek entered and where it left her range of vision to make sure that no one else should come and catch her
Suddenly sounded a voice from somewhere behind her Hey Nell
Im coming
She sprang to her feet faced about and Crusoe was not more agitated when he saw the print of the naked foot on his islands strand
The straw hat with the flapping brim was just lifting above the edge of the rock at the opposite side where the path was
She could not escape the shelf offered no hiding place
Now the young man was stepping to the level panting loudly
Gee what a climb for a hot day
he cried
Where are you
With that he was looking at Susan less than twenty yards away and drawn up defiantly
He stared took off his hat
He had closecropped wavy hair and eyes as gray as Susans own but it was a bluegray instead of violet
His skin was fair too and his expression intelligent and sympathetic
In spite of his hat and his blue cotton shirt and trousers rolled high on bare sunburned legs there was nothing of the yokel about him
I beg your pardon he exclaimed half humorously
I thought it was my cousin Nell
No said Susan disarmed by his courtesy and by the frank engaging manner of it
I didnt mean to intrude
He showed white teeth in a broad smile
I see from your face that this is your private domain
Oh nonot at all stammered Susan
Yes I insist replied he
Will you let me stay and rest a minute
I ran round the rock and climbed pretty fast
Yesdo said Susan
The young man sat on the grass near where he had appeared and crossed his long legs
The girl much embarrassed looked uneasily about
Perhaps youd sit too
suggested he after eyeing her in a friendly way that could not cause offense and somehow did not cause any great uneasiness
Susan hesitated went to the shadow of a little tree not far from him
He was fanning his flushed face with his hat
The collar of his shirt was open below where the tan ended abruptly his skin was beautifully white
Now that she had been discovered it was as well to be pleasant she reasoned
Its a fine day she observed with a grownup gravity that much amused him
Not for fishing said he
I caught nothing
You are a stranger in these parts
Susan colored and a look of terror flitted into her eyes
Yes she admitted
ImIm passing through
The young man had all he could do to conceal his amusement
Susan flushed deeply again not because she saw his expression for she was not looking at him but because her remark seemed to her absurd and likely to rouse suspicion
I suppose you came up here to see the view said the man
He glanced round
It is pretty good
Youre not visiting down Brooksburg way by any chance
No replied Susan rather composedly and determined to change the subject
What was that song I heard you singing
Ohyou heard did you
laughed he
Its the Dukes song from Rigoletto
Thats an opera isnt itlike Trovatore
Yesan Italian opera
Same author
Its a beautiful song
It was evident that she longed to ask him to sing it
She felt at ease with him he was so unaffected and simple was one of those people who seem to be at home wherever they are
Do you sing
he inquired
Not really replied she
Neither do I
So if youll sing to me Ill sing to you
Susan looked round in alarm
Oh dear noplease dont she cried
Why not
he asked curiously
There isnt a soul about
I knowbutreally you mustnt
Very well said he seeing that her nervousness was not at all from being asked to sing
They sat quietly she gazing off at the horizon he fanning himself and studying her lovely young face
He was somewhere in the neighborhood of twentyfive and a close observer would have suspected him of an unusual amount of experience even for a goodlooking expansive youth of that age
He broke the long silence
Im a newspaper man from Cincinnati
Im on the Commercial there
My names Roderick Spenser
My fathers Clayton Spenser down at Brooksburghe pointed to the southeastbeyond that hill there on the river
Im here on my vacation
And he halted looking at her expectantly
It seemed to her that there was in courtesy no escape without a return biographical sketch
She hung her head twisted her tapering fingers in her lap and looked childishly embarrassed and unhappy
Another long silence again he broke it
Youll pardon my saying so butyoure very young arent you
Not soso terribly young
Im almost seventeen replied she glancing this way and that as if thinking of flight
You look like a child yet you dont he went on and his frank honest voice calmed her
Youve had some painful experience Id say
She nodded her eyes down
A pause then he Honest nowarent yourunning away
She lifted her eyes to his piteously
Please dont ask me she said
I shouldnt think of it replied he with a gentleness in his persistence that made her feel still more like trusting him if it wasnt that Well this world isnt the easiest sort of a place
Lots of rough stretches in the road
Ive struck several and Ive always been glad when somebOdy has given me a lift
And I want to pass it onif youll let me
Its something we owe each otherdont you think
The words were fine enough but it was the voice in which he said them that went to her heart
She covered her face with her hands and released her pent emotions
He took a package of tobacco and a sheaf of papers from his trousers pocket rolled and lighted a cigarette
After a while she dried her eyes looked at him shamefacedly
But he was all understanding and sympathy
Now you feel better dont you
Much said she
And she laughed
I guess Im more upset than I let myself realize
Sorry you left home
I havent any home answered she simply
And I wouldnt go back alive to the place I came from
There was a quality in the energy she put into her words that made him thoughtful
He counseled with the end of his cigarette
Finally he inquired Where are you bound for
I dont know exactly confessed she as if it were a small matter
He shook his head
I see you havent the faintest notion what youre up against
Oh Ill get along
Im strong and I can learn
He looked at her critically and rather sadly
Yesyou are strong said he
But I wonder if youre strong enough
I never was sick in my life
I dont mean that



Im not sure I know just what I do mean
Is it very hard to get to Chicago
inquired she
Its easier to get to Cincinnati
She shook her head positively
It wouldnt do for me to go there
Oh you come from Cincinnati
Nobut IIve been there
Oh they caught you and brought you back
She nodded
This young man must be very smart to understand so quickly
How much money have you got
he asked abruptly
But his fear that she would think him impertinent came of an underestimate of her innocence
I havent got any replied she
I forgot my purse
It had thirty dollars in it
At once he recognized the absolute child only utter inexperience of the world could speak of so small a sum so respectfully
I dont understand at all said he
How long have you been here
All day
I got here early this morning
And you havent had anything to eat
Oh yes
I found some eggs
Ive got two left
Two eggsand no money and no friendsand a woman
Yet she was facing the future hopefully
He smiled with tears in his eyes
You mustnt tell anybody you saw me she went on
No matter what they say dont think you ought to tell on me
He looked at her she at him
When he had satisfied himself he smiled most reassuringly
Ill not was his answer and now she knew she could trust him
She drew a breath of relief and went on as if talking with an old friend
Ive got to get a long ways from here
As soon as its dark Im going
Where
Toward the river
And her eyes lit
The river
Whats there
I dont know said she triumphantly
But he understood
He had the spirit of adventure himselfone could see it at a glancethe spirit that instinctively shuns yesterday and all its works and wings eagerly into tomorrow unknown different newtherefore better
But this girl this childwomanor was she rather womanchildpenniless with nothing but two eggs between her and starvation alone without plans without experience What would become of her


Arent youafraid
he asked
Of what
she inquired calmly
It was the mere unconscious audacity of ignorance yet he saw in her nownot fancied he saw but sawa certain strength of soul both courage and tenacity
No she might suffer sinkbut she would die fighting and she would not be afraid
And he admired and envied her
Oh Ill get along somehow she assured him in the same selfreliant tone
Suddenly she felt it would no longer give her the horrors to speak of what she had been through
Im not very old said she and hers was the face of a woman now
But Ive learned a great deal
You are sure you are not making a mistake ininrunning away
I couldnt do anything else replied she
Im all alone in the world
Theres no oneexcept I hadnt done anything and they said I had disgraced themand they Her voice faltered her eyes sank the color flooded into her face
They gave me to a manand heI had hardly seen him beforehe She tried but could not pronounce the dreadful word
Married you mean
said the young man gently
The girl shuddered
Yes she answered
And I ran away
So strange so startling so moving was the expression of her face that he could not speak for a moment
A chill crept over him as he watched her wide eyes gazing into vacancy
What vision of horror was she seeing he wondered
To rouse her he spoke the first words he could assemble When was this
The vision seemed slowly to fade and she looked at him in astonishment
Why it was last night
she said as if dazed by the discovery
Only last night
Last night
Then you havent got far
No
But I must
I will
And Im not afraid of anything except of being taken back
But you dont realize what may beprobably iswaiting for youat the riverand beyond
Nothing could be so bad said she
The words were nothing but the tone and the expression that accompanied them somehow convinced him beyond a doubt
Youll let me help you
She debated
You might bring me something to eatmightnt you
The eggsll do for supper
But theres tomorrow
I dont want to be seen till I get a long ways off
He rose at once
Yes Ill bring you something to eat
He took a knockabout watch from the breast pocket of his shirt
Its now four oclock
Ive got three miles to walk
Ill ride back and hitch the horse down the creeka little ways down so it wont attract attention to your place up here
Ill be back in about an hour and a half



Maybe Ill think of something thatll help
Can I bring you anything else
No
That isId like a little piece of soap
And a towel
he suggested
I could take care of a towel agreed she
Ill send it back to you when I get settled
Good heavens
He laughed at her simplicity
What an honest child you are
He put out his hand and she took it with charming friendliness
Goodby
Ill hurry
Im so glad you caught me said she
Then apologetically I dont want to be any trouble
I hate to be troublesome
Ive never let anybody wait on me
I dont know when Ive had as much pleasure as this is giving me
And he made a bow that hid its seriousness behind a smile of goodhumored raillery
She watched him descend with a sinking heart
The rockthe worldher life seemed empty now
He had reminded her that there were human beings with good hearts
Butperhaps if he knew his kindness would turn also



No she decided not
Men like him women like Aunt Salliethey did not believe those dreadful wicked ideas that people said God had ordained
Stillif he knew about her birthbranded outcasthe might change
She must not really hope for anything much until she was far far away in a wholly new world where there would be a wholly new sort of people of a kind she had never met
But she was sure they would welcome her and give her a chance
She returned to the tree against which she had been sitting for there she could look at the place his big frame had pressed down in the tall grass and could see him in it and could recall his friendly eyes and voice and could keep herself assured she had not been dreaming
He was a citified man like Sambut how different
A man with a heart like his would never marry a womanno never
He couldnt be a brute like that
Still perhaps nice men married because it was supposed to be the right thing to do and was the only way to have children without people thinking you a disgrace and slighting the childrenand then marrying made brutes of them
No wonder her uncles could treat her so
They were men who had married
Afar off she heard the manly voice singing the song from Rigoletto
She sprang up and listened with eyes softly shining and head a little on one side
The song ended her heart beat fast
It was not many minutes before she watching at the end of the path saw him appear at the bottom of the huge cleft
And the look in his eyes the merry smile about his expressive mouth delighted her
Im so glad to see you
she cried
Over his shoulder was flung his fishing bag and it bulged
Dont be scared by the size of my pack he called up as he climbed
Were going to have supper togetherif youll let me stay
Then you can take as much or as little as you like of whats left
Arrived at the top he halted for a long breath
They stood facing each other
My what a tall girl you are for your age
said he admiringly
She laughed up at him
Ill be as tall as you when I get my growth
She was so lovely that he could scarcely refrain from telling her so
It seemed to him however it would be taking an unfair advantage to say that sort of thing when she was in a way at his mercy
Where shall we spread the table
said he
Im hungry as the horseleechs daughter
And youwhy you must be starved
Im afraid I didnt bring what you like
But I did the best I could
I raided the pantry took everything that was portable
He had set down the bag and had loosened its strings
First he took out a tablecloth
She laughed
Gracious
How stylish we shall be
I didnt bring napkins
We can use the corners of the cloth
He had two knives two forks and a big spoon rolled up in the cloth and a saltcellar
Now heres my triumph
he cried drawing from the bag a pair of roasted chickens
Next came a jar of quince jelly next a paper bag with cold potatoes and cold string beans in it
Then he fished out a huge square of cornbread and a loaf of saltrising bread a pound of butter What will your folks say
exclaimed she in dismay
He laughed
They always have thought I was crazy ever since I went to college and then to the city instead of farming
And out of the bag came a big glass jar of milk
I forgot to bring a glass
he apologized
Then he suspended unpacking to open the jar
Why you must be halfdead with thirst up here all day with not a drop of water
And he held out the jar to her
Drink hearty
he cried
The milk was rich and cold she drank nearly a fourth of it before she could wrest the jar away from her lips
My but that was good
she remarked
He had enjoyed watching her drink
Surely you havent got anything else in that bag
Not much replied he
Heres a towel wrapped round the soap
And here are three cakes of chocolate
You could live four or five days on them if you were put to it
So whatever else you leave dont leave them
AndOh yes heres a calico slip and a sunbonnet and a paper of pins
And thats all
What are they for
I thought you might put them onthe slip over your dressand you wouldnt look quite soso out of placeif anybody should see you
What a fine idea
cried Susan shaking out the slip delightedly
He was spreading the supper on the tablecloth
He carved one of the chickens opened the jelly placed the bread and vegetables and butter
Now
he cried
Lets get busy
And he set her an example she was not slow to follow
The sun had slipped down behind the hills of the northwest horizon
The birds were tuning for their evening song
A breeze sprang up and coquetted with the strays of her wavy dark hair
And they sat crosslegged on the grass on opposite sides of the tablecloth and joked and laughed and ate and ate and laughed and joked until the stars began to appear in the vast paling opal of the sky
They had chosen the center of the grassy platform for their banquet thus from where they sat only the tops of trees and the sky were to be seen
And after they had finished she leaned on her elbow and listened while he smoking his cigarette told her of his life as a newspaper man in Cincinnati
The twilight faded into dusk the dusk into a scarlet darkness
When the moon comes up well start said he
You can ride behind me on the horse part of the way anyhow
The shadow of the parting the ending of this happiness fell upon her
How lonely it would be when he was gone
I havent told you my name she said
Ive told you mine Roderick Spenserwith an s not a c
I remember said she
Ill never forget



Mines Susan Lenox
What was itbefore He halted
Before what
His silence set her to thinking
Oh
she exclaimed in a tone that made him curse his stupidity in reminding her
My names Susan Lenoxand always will be
It was my mothers name
She hesitated decided for frankness at any cost for his kindness forbade her to deceive him in any way
Proudly My mother never let any man marry her
They say she was disgraced but I understand now
She wouldnt stoop to let any man marry her
Spenser puzzled over this but could make nothing of it
He felt that he ought not to inquire further
He saw her anxious eyes her expression of one keyed up and waiting for a verdict
Id have only to look at you to know your mother was a fine woman said he
Then to escape from the neighborhood of the dangerous riddle Now about youryour going he began
Ive been thinking what to do
Youll help me
said she to dispel her last doubta very faint doubt for his words and his way of uttering them had dispelled her real anxiety
Help you
cried he heartily
All I can
Ive got a scheme to propose to you
You say you cant take the mail boat
They know me
IIm from Sutherland
You trust medont you
Indeed I do
Now listen to meas if I were your brother
Will you
Yes
Im going to take you to Cincinnati with me
Im going to put you in my boarding house as my sister
And Im going to get you a position
Thenyou can start in for yourself
But thatll be a great lot of trouble wont it
Not any more than friends of mine took for me when I was starting out
Then as she continued silent What are you thinking
I cant see your face in this starlight
I was thinking how good you are she said simply
He laughed uneasily
Im not often accused of that he replied
Im like most peoplea mixture of good and badand not very strong either way
Im afraid Im mostly impulse that winks out
Butthe question is how to get you to Cincinnati
Its simply impossible for me to go tonight
I cant take you home for the night
I dont trust my people
Theyd not think I was goodor you either
And while usually theyd be rightboth waysthis is an exception
This idea of an exception seemed to amuse him
He went on I dont dare leave you at any farmhouse in the neighborhood
If I did you could be traced
Nono she cried alarmed at the very suggestion
I mustnt be seen by anybody
Well go straight to the river and Ill get a boat and row you across to Kentuckyover to Carrollton
Theres a little hotel
I can leave you Nonot Carrollton she interrupted
My uncle sells goods there and they know him
And if anything is in the Sutherland papers about me why theyd know
Not with you in that slip and sunbonnet
Ill make up a storyabout our wagon breaking down and that Ive got to walk back into the hills to get another before we can go on
Andits the only plan thats at all possible
Obviously he was right but she would not consent
By adroit questioning he found that her objection was dislike of being so much trouble to him
Thats too ridiculous cried he
Why I wouldnt have missed this adventure for anything in the world
His manner was convincing enough but she did not give in until moonrise came without her having thought of any other plan
He was to be Bob Peters she his sister Kate and they were to hail from a farm in the Kentucky hills back of Milton
They practiced the dialect of the region and found that they could talk it well enough to pass the test of a few sentences They packed the fishing bag she wrapped the two eggs in paper and put them in the empty milk bottle
They descended by the patha slow journey in the darkness of that side of the rock as there were many dangers including the danger of making a noise that might be heard by some restless person at the house
After half an hour they were safely at the base of the rock they skirted it went down to the creek found the horse tied where he had left it
With her seated sideways behind him and holding on by an arm half round his waist they made a merry but not very speedy advance toward the river keeping as nearly due south as the breaks in the hills permitted
After a while he asked Do you ever think of the stage
Ive never seen a real stage play said she
But I want toand I will the first chance I get
I meant did you ever think of going on the stage
No
So daring a flight would have been impossible for a baby imagination in the cage of the respectablefamilyinasmalltown
Its one of my dreams to write plays he went on
Wouldnt it be queer if some day I wrote plays for you to act in
When ones fancy is as free as was Susans then it takes any direction chance may suggest
Susans fancy instantly winged along this fascinating route
Ive given recitations at school and in the plays we used to have they let me take the best partsthat isuntiluntil a year or so ago
He noted the hesitation had an instinct against asking why there had come a time when she no longer got good parts
Im sure you could learn to act declared he
And youll be sure of it too after youve seen the people who do it
Oh I dont believe I could said she in rebuke to her own mounting selfconfidence
Then suddenly remembering her birthbrand of shame and overwhelmed by it No I cant hope to be to be anything much
They wouldnt haveme
I know how you feel replied he all unaware of the real reason for this deep humility
When I first struck town I felt that way
It seemed to me I couldnt hope ever to line up with the clever people they had there
But I soon saw there was nothing in that idea
The fact is everywhere in the world theres a lot more things to do than people who can do them
Most of those who get to the topwhere did they start
Where were starting
She was immensely flattered by that we and grateful for it
But she held to her original opinion
There wouldnt be a chance for me said she
They wouldnt have me
Oh I understand said he and he fancied he did
He laughed gayly at the idea that in the theater anyone would care who she waswhat kind of past she had hador present either for that matter
Said he You neednt worry
On the stage they dont ask any questionsany questions except Can you act
Can you get it over
Can you get the hand
Then this stage it was the world she had dreamed ofthe world where there lived a wholly new kind of peoplepeople who could make room for her
She thrilled and her heart beat wildly
In a strangely quiet intense voice she said I want to try
Im sure Ill get along there
Ill workOh so hard
Ill do anything Thats the talk cried he
Youve got the stuff in you
She said little the rest of the journey
Her mind was busy with the idea he had by merest accident given her
If he could have looked in upon her thoughts he would have been amazed and not a little alarmed by the ferment he had set up
Where they reached the river the bank was mud and thick willows the haunt of incredible armies of mosquitoes
Its a mystery to me cried he why these fiends live in lonely places far away from blood when theyre so mad about it
After some searching he found a clear stretch of sandy gravel where she would be not too uncomfortable while he was gone for a boat
He left the horse with her and walked upstream in the direction of Brooksburg
As he had warned her that he might be gone a long time he knew she would not be alarmed for himand she had already proved that timidity about herself was not in her nature
But he was alarmed for herthis girl alone in that lonely darknesswith light enough to make her visible to any prowler
About an hour after he left her he returned in a rowboat he had borrowed at the water mill
He hitched the horse in the deep shadow of the break in the bank
She got into the boat put on the slip and the sunbonnet put her sailor hat in the bag
They pushed off and he began the long hard row across and upstream
The moon was high now and was still near enough to its full glory to pour a flood of beautiful light upon the broad riverthe lovely Ohio at its loveliest part
Wont you sing
he asked
And without hesitation she began one of the simple familiar love songs that were all the music to which the Sutherland girls had access
She sang softly in a deep sweet voice sweeter even than her speaking voice
She had the sunbonnet in her lap the moon shone full upon her face
And it seemed to him that he was in a dream there was nowhere a suggestion of realitynot of its prose not even of its poetry
Only in the land no waking eye has seen could such a thing be
The low sweet voice sang of love the oars clicked rhythmically in the locks and clove the water with musical splash the river between its steep hills shone in the moonlight with a breeze like a friendly spirit moving upon its surface
He urged her and she sang another song and another
She sighed when she saw the red lantern on the Carrollton wharf and he turning his head and seeing echoed her sigh
The first chance you must sing me that song she said
From Rigoletto
I will
Butit tells how fickle women arelike a feather in the wind


They arent all like that thoughdont you think so
Sometimes I think everybodys like a feather in the wind replied she
About loveand everything
He laughed
Except those people who are where there isnt any wind
CHAPTER XII FOR some time Spenser had been rowing well in toward the Kentucky shore to avoid the swift current of the Kentucky River which rushes into the Ohio at Carrollton
A few yards below its mouth in the quiet stretch of backwater along shore lay the wharfboat little more than a landing stage
The hotel was but a hundred feet away at the top of the steep levee
It was midnight so everyone in the village had long been asleep
After several minutes of thunderous hammering Roderick succeeded in drawing to the door a barefooted man with a candle in his huge knotted handa man of great stature amazingly lean and long of leg with a monstrous head thatched and fronted with coarse yellowbrown hair
He had on a dirty cotton shirt and dirty cotton trousersa night dress that served equally well for the day
His feet were flat and thick and were hideous with corns and bunions
Susan had early been made a critical observer of feet by the unusual symmetry of her own
She had seen few feet that were fit to be seen but never she thought had she seen an exhibition so repellent
What thell he began
Then discovering Susan he growled Beg pardon miss
Roderick explainedthat is told the prearranged story
The man pointed to a grimy register on the office desk and Roderick set down the fishing bag and wrote in a cramped scrawly hand Kate Peters Milton Ky The man looked at it through his screen of hair and beard said Come on maam
Just a minute said Roderick and he drew Kate aside and said to her in a low tone Ill be back sometime tomorrow and then well start at once
Butto provide against everythingdont be alarmed if I dont come
Youll know I couldnt help it
And wait
Susan nodded looking at him with trustful grateful eyes
And he went on hurriedly Ill leave this with you to take care of
Its yours as much as mine
She saw that it was a pocketbook instinctively put her hands behind her
Dont be silly he said with goodhumored impatience
Youll probably not need it
If you do youll need it bad
And youll pay me back when you get your place
He caught one of her hands and put the pocketbook in it
As his argument was unanswerable she did not resist further
She uttered not a word of thanks but simply looked at him her eyes swimming and about her mouth a quiver that meant a great deal in her
Impulsively and with flaming cheek he kissed her on the cheek
So long sis he said loudly and strode into the night
Susan did not flush she paled
She gazed after him with some such expression as a man lost in a cave might have as he watches the flickering out of his only light
This way maam said the hotel man sourly taking up the fishing bag
She started followed him up the noisy stairs to a plain neat country bedroom
The price of this heres one fifty a day said he
Weve got em as low as a dollar
Ill take a dollar one please said Susan
The man hesitated
Well he finally snarled business is slack jes now
Seein as youre a lady you kin have this here un fur a dollar
Oh thank youbut if the price is more The other rooms aint fit fur a lady said the hotel man
Then he grinned a very human humorous grin that straightway made him much less repulsive
Anyhow them two durn boys of mine an their cousins is asleep in em
Id as lief rout out a nest of hornets
Ill leave you the candle
As soon as he had gone Susan put out the light ran to the window
She saw the rowboat and Spenser a black spot far out on the river almost gone from view to the southwest
Hastily she lighted the candle again stood at the window and waved a white cover she snatched from the table
She thought she saw one of the oars go up and flourish but she could not be sure
She watched until the boat vanished in the darkness at the bend
She found the soap in the bag and took a slow but thorough bath in the washbowl
Then she unbraided her hair combed it out as well as she could with her fingers rubbed it thoroughly with a towel and braided it again
She put on the calico slip as a nightdress knelt down to say her prayers
But instead of prayers there came flooding into her mind memories of where she had been last night of the horrors of the agonies of body and soul
She rose from her knees put out the light stood again at the window
In after years she always looked back upon that hour as the one that definitely marked the end of girlhood of the thoughts and beliefs which go with the sheltered life and the beginning of womanhood of selfreliance and of the hardinessso near akin to hardnessthe hardiness that must come into the character before a man or a woman is fit to give and take in the combat of life
The bed was coarse but white and clean
She fell asleep instantly and did not awaken until after the vague gradually louder sound of hammering on the door she heard a female voice warning her that breakfast was put nigh over an done
She got up partly drew on one stocking then without taking it off tumbled over against the pillow and was asleep
When she came to herself again the lay of the shadows told her it must be after twelve oclock
She dressed packed her serge suit in the bag with the sailor hat smoothed out the pink calico slip and put it on
For more than a year she had worn her hair in a braid doubled upon itself and tied with a bow at the back of her neck
She decided that if she would part it plait it in two braids and bring them round her head she would look older
She tried this and was much pleased with the result
She thought the new style not only more grownup but also more becoming
The pink slip too seemed to her a success
It came almost to her ankles and its strings enabled her to make it look something like a dress
Carrying the pink sunbonnet down she went in search of something to eat
The hall was full of smoke and its air seemed greasy with the odor of frying
She found that dinner was about to be served
A girl in blue calico skirt and foodsmeared sweatdiscolored blue jersey ushered her to one of the tables in the diningroom
Theres a gentleman comin said she
Ill set him down with you
He wont bite I dont reckon and there aint no use mussin up two tables
There was no protesting against two such arguments so Susan presently had opposite her a fattish man with long oily hair and a face like that of a fallen and dissipated preacher
She recognized him at once as one of those wanderers who visit small towns with cheap shows or selling patent medicines and doing juggling tricks on the street corners in the flare of a gasoline lamp
She eyed him furtively until he caught her at ithe being about the same business himself
Thereafter she kept her eyes steadily upon the tablecloth patched and worn thin with much washing
Soon the plate of each was encircled by the familiar arc of side dishes containing assorted and not very appetizing messesfried steak watery peas stringy beans soggy turnips lumpy mashed potatoes a perilouslooking chicken stew cornbread with streaks of baking soda in it
But neither of the diners was critical and the dinner was eaten with an enthusiasm which the best rarely inspires
With the prunes and driedapple pie the stranger expanded
Warm day miss he ventured
Yes it is a little warm said Susan
She ventured a direct look at him
Above the pleasant kindly eyes there was a brow so unusually well shaped that it arrested even her young and untrained attention
Whatever the mans character or station there could be no question as to his intelligence
The flies are very bothersome continued he
But nothing like Australia
There the flies have to be picked off and theyre big and they bitetake a piece right out of you
The natives used to laugh at us when we were in the ring and would try to brush em away
The stranger had the pleasant easy manner of one who through custom of all kinds of people and all varieties of fortune has learned to be patient and goodhumoredto take the day and the hour as the seasoned gambler takes the cards that are dealt him
Susan said nothing but she had listened politely
The man went on amusing himself with his own conversation
I was in the show business then
Clown was my line but I was rotten at itsimply rotten
Im still in the show businessdifferent line though
Ive got a show of my own
If youre going to be in town perhaps youll come to see us tonight
Our boats anchored down next to the wharf
You can see it from the windows
Come and bring your folks
Thank you said Susanshe had for gotten her role and its accent
But Im afraid well not be here
There was an expression in the strangers facea puzzled curious expression not impertinent rather covertan expression that made her uneasy
It warned her that this man saw she was not what she seemed to be that he was trying to peer into her secret
His brown eyes were kind enough but alarmingly keen
With only half her pie eaten she excused herself and hastened to her room
At the threshold she remembered the pocketbook Spenser had given her
She had left it by the fishing bag on the table
There was the bag but not the pocketbook
I must have put it in the bag she said aloud and the sound and the tone of her voice frightened her
She searched the bag then the room which had not yet been straightened up
She shook out the bed covers looked in all the drawers under the bed went over the contents of the bag again
The pocketbook was gonestolen
She sat down on the edge of the bed her hands in her lap and stared at the place where she had last seen the pocketbookhis pocketbook which he had asked her to take care of
How could she face him
What would he think of her so untrustworthy
What a return for his kindness
She felt weakso weak that she lay down
The food she had taken turned to poison and her head ached fiercely
What could she do
To speak to the proprietor would be to cause a great commotion to attract attention to herselfand how would that help to bring back the stolen pocketbook taken perhaps by the proprietor himself
She recalled that as she hurried through the office from the diningroom he had a queer shifting expression gave her a wheedling cringing good morning not at all in keeping with the character he had shown the night before
The slovenly girl came to do the room Susan sent her away sat by the window gazing out over the river and downstream
He would soon be here the thought made her long to fly and hide
He had been all generosity and this was her way of appreciating it
They sent for her to come down to supper
She refused saying she was not feeling well
She searched the room the bag again and again
She would rest a few minutes then up she would spring and tear everything out
Then back to the window to sit and stare at the river over which the evening shadows were beginning to gather
Once as she was sitting there she happened to see the gaudily painted and decorated show boat
A manthe stranger of the dinner tablewas standing on the forward end smoking a cigar
She saw that he was observing her realized he could have seen her stirring feverishly about her room
A woman came out of the cabin and joined him
As soon as his attention was distracted she closed her shutters
And there she sat alone with the hours dragging their wretched minutes slowly away
That was one of those nights upon which anyone who has had themand who has notlooks back with wonder at how they ever lived how they ever came to an end
She slept a little toward dawnfor youth and health will not let the most despairing heart suffer in sleeplessness
Her headache went but the misery of soul which had been a maddening pain settled down into a throbbing ache
She feared he would come she feared he would not come
The servants tried to persuade her to take breakfast
She could not have swallowed food she would not have dared take food for which she could not pay
What would they do with her if he did not come
She searched the room again hoping against hope a hundred times fancying she felt the purse under some other things each time suffering sickening disappointment
Toward noon the servant came knocking
A letter for you maam
Susan rushed to the door seized the letter tore it open read When I got back to the horse and started to mount he kicked me and broke my leg
You can go on south to the L and N and take a train to Cincinnati
When you find a boarding house send your address to me at the office
Ill come in a few weeks
Id write more but I cant
Dont worry
Everythingll come out right
You are brave and sensible and I back you to win
With the unsigned letter crumpled in her hands she sat at the window with scarcely a motion until noon
She then went down to the show boat
Several peoplemen and womenwere on the forward end quarreling
She looked only at her acquaintance
His face was swollen and his eyes bloodshot but he still wore the air of easy and patient goodhumor
She said standing on the shore Could I speak to you a minute
Certainly maam replies he lifting his dingy straw hat with gaudy stained band
He came down the broad plank to the shore
Why whats the matter
This in a sympathetic tone
Will you lend me two dollars and take me along to work it out
she asked
He eyed her keenly
For the hotel bill
he inquired the cigar tucked away in the corner of his mouth
She nodded
He didnt show up
He broke his leg
Oh
The tone was politely sympathetic but incredulous
He eyed her critically thoughtfully
Can you sing
he finally asked
A little
His hands were deep in the pockets of his baggy light trousers
He drew one of them out with a twodollar bill in it
Go and pay him and bring your things
Were about to push off
Thank you said the girl in the same stolid way
She returned to the hotel brought the bag down from her room stood at the office desk
The servant came
Mr Gumpus has jes stepped out said she
Here is the money for my room
And Susan laid the twodollar bill on the register
Aint you goin to wait fur yeryer brother
Hes not coming replied the girl
SoIll go
Goodby
Goodby
Its awful bein took sick away from home
Thank you said Susan
Goodby
The girls homely ignorant face twisted in a grin
But Susan did not see would have been indifferent had she seen
Since she accepted the war earth and heaven had declared against her she had ceased from the little thought she had once given to what was thought of her by those of whom she thought not at all
She went down to the show boat
The plank had been taken in
Her acquaintance was waiting for her helped her to the deck jumped aboard himself and was instantly busy helping to guide the boat out into midstream
Susan looked back at the hotel
Mr Gumpus was in the doorway amusement in every line of his ugly face
Beside him stood the slovenly servant
She was cryingthe more human second thought of a heart not altogether corrupted by the sordid hardness of her lot
How can faith in the human race falter when one considers how much heart it has in spite of all it suffers in the struggle upward through the dense fogs of ignorance upward toward the truth toward the light of which it never ceases to dream and to hope
Susan stood in the same place with her bag beside her until her acquaintance came
Now said he comfortably as he lighted a fresh cigar well float pleasantly along
I guess you and I had better get acquainted
What is your name
Susan flushed
Kate Peters is the name I gave at the hotel
Thatll do wont it
Never in the world
replied he
You must have a good catchy name
Sayerer He rolled his cigar slowly looking thoughtfully toward the willows thick and green along the Indiana shore
Saywell sayLornaLornaLorna Sackville
Thats a winner
Lorna SackvilleA stroke of genius
Dont you think so
Yes said Susan
It doesnt matter
But it does remonstrated he
You are an artist now and an artists name should always arouse pleasing and romantic anticipations
Its like the odor that heralds the dish
You must remember my dear that you have stepped out of the world of dull reality into the world of ideals of dreams
The sound of two harsh voices one male the other female came from within the cabinoaths reproaches
Her acquaintance laughed
Thats one on meeh
Still what I say is trueor at least ought to be
By the way this is the Burlingham Floating Palace of Thespians floating temple to the histrionic art
I am BurlinghamRobert Burlingham
He smiled extended his hand
Glad to meet you Miss Lorna Sackvilledont forget
She could not but reflect a smile so genuine so goodhumored
Well go in and meet the othersyour fellow starsfor this is an allstar aggregation
Over the broad entrance to the cabin was a chintz curtain strung upon a wire
Burlingham drew this aside
Susan was looking into a room about thirty feet long about twelve feet wide and a scant six feet high
Across it with an aisle between were narrow wooden benches with backs
At the opposite end was a stage with the curtain up and a portable stove occupying the center
At the stove a woman in a chemise and underskirt with slippers on her bare feet was toiling over several pots and pans with fork and spoon
At the edge of the stage with legs swinging sat another woman in a blue sailor suit neither fresh nor notably clean but somehow coquettish
Two men in flannel shirts were seated one on each of the front benches with their backs to her
As Burlingham went down the aisle ahead of her he called out Ladies and gentlemen I wish to present the latest valuable addition to our companyMiss Lorna Sackville the renowned ballad singer
The two men turned lazily and stared at Susan each with an arm hanging over the back of the bench
Burlingham looked at the woman bent over the stovea fat middleaged woman with thin taffyyellow hair done sleekly over a big rat in front and made into a huge coil behind with the aid of one or more false braids
She had a fat face a broad expanse of unpleasantlooking elderly bosom big shapeless white arms
Her contour was almost gone
Her teeth were a curious mixture of natural gold and porcelain
Miss AnstrutherMiss Sackville called Burlingham
Miss Sackville Miss Violet Anstruther
Miss Anstruther and Susan exchanged bowsSusans timid and frightened Miss Anstruthers accompanied by a hostile stare and a hardening of the fat decaying face
Miss ConnemoraMiss Sackville
Burlingham was looking at the younger womanshe who sat on the edge of the little stage
She too was a blond but her hair had taken to the chemical somewhat less reluctantly than had Miss Anstruthers with the result that Miss Connemoras looked golden
Her faceof the baby type must have been softly pretty at one timenot so very distant
Now lines were coming and the hard look that is inevitable with dyed hair
Also her once fine teeth were rapidly going off as half a dozen gold fillings in front proclaimed
At Susans appealing look and smile Miss Connemora nodded not unfriendly
Good God Bob said she to Burlingham with a laugh are you going to get the bunch of us pinched for childstealing
Burlingham started to laugh suddenly checked himself looked uneasily and keenly at Susan
Oh its all right he said with a wave of the hand
But his tone belied his words
He puffed twice at his cigar then introduced the menElbert Eshwell and Gregory Tempesttwo of the kind clearly if inelegantly placed by the phrase greasy hamfats
Mr Eshwells blackdyed hair was smoothly brushed down from a central part Mr Tempests irongray hair was greasily wilda disarray of romantic ringlets
Eshwell was inclined to fat Tempest was gaunt and had the hollow burning eye that bespeaks the sentimental ass
Now Miss Sackville said Burlingham well go on the forward deck and canvass the situation
What for dinner Vi
Same old rot retorted Miss Anstruther wiping the sweat from her face and shoulders with a towel that served also as a dishcloth
Pork and beanspotatoespeach pie
Cheer up said Burlingham
After tomorrow well do better
Thats been the cry ever since we started snapped Violet
For Gods sake shut up Vi groaned Eshwell
Youre always kicking
The cabin was not quite the full width of the broad house boat
Along the outside between each wall and the edge there was room for one person to pass from forward deck to rear
From the cabin roof over the rear deck into the water extended a big rudder oar
When Susan following Burlingham reached the rear deck she saw the man at this oara fat amiablelooking rascal in linsey woolsey and a blue checked shirt open over his chest and revealing a mat of curly gray hair
Burlingham hailed him as Pathis only known name
But Susan had only a glance for him and no ear at all for the chaffing between him and the actormanager
She was gazing at the Indiana shore at a tiny village snuggled among trees and ripened fields close to the waters edge
She knew it was Brooksburg
She remembered the long covered bridge which they had crossedSpenser and she on the horse
To the north of the town on a knoll stood a large red brick house trimmed with white veranda and balconiesfar and away the most pretentious house in the landscape
Before the door was a horse and buggy
She could make out that there were several people on the front veranda one of them a man in blackthe doctor no doubt
Sobs choked up into her throat
She turned quickly away that Burlingham might not see
And under her breath she said Goodby dear
Forgive meforgive me
CHAPTER XIII WOMANS worktable a rocking chair and another with a swayback that made it fairly comfortable for lounging gave the rear deck the air of an outdoor sittingroom which indeed it was
Burlingham after a comprehensive glance at the panorama of summer and fruitfulness through which they were drifting sprawled himself in the swayback chair indicating to Susan that she was to face him in the rocker
Sit down my dear said he
And tell me you are at least eighteen and are not running away from home
You heard what Miss Connemora said
Im not running away from home replied Susan blushing violently because she was evading as to the more important fact
I dont know anything about you and I dont want to know pursued Burlingham alarmed by the evidences of a dangerous tendency to candor
Ive no desire to have my own past dug into and turn abouts fair play
You came to me to get an engagement
I took you
Understand
Susan nodded
You said you could singthat is a little
A very little said the girl
Enough no doubt
That has been our weak pointlack of a ballad singer
Know any balladsNot fancy ones
Nothing fancy
We cater to the plain people and the plain people only like the bestthat is the simplestthe things that reach for the heartstrings with ten strong fingers
You dont happen to know I Stood on the Bridge at Midnight
NoRuth sings that replied Susan and colored violently
Burlingham ignored the slip
Blue Alsatian Mountains
Yes
But thats very old
Exactly
Nothing is of any use to the stage until its very old
Audiences at theaters dont want to hear anything they dont already know by heart
Theyve come to see not to hear
So it annoys them to have to try to hear
Do you understand that
No confessed Susan
Im sorry
But Ill think about it and try to understand it
She thought she was showing her inability to do what was expected of her in paying back the two dollars
Dont bother said Burlingham
Pat
Yes boss said the man at the oar without looking or removing his pipe
Get your fiddle
Pat tied the oar fast and went forward along the roof of the cabin
While he was gone Burlingham explained A frightful souse Patalmost equal to Eshwell and far the superior of Tempest or Vithat is of Tempest
But hes steady enough for our purposes as a rule
Hes the pilot the orchestra the manofallwork the bill distributor
Oh hes a wonder
Graduate of Trinity College Dublinyeggmanpanhandler barrelhouse bumgenius nearly
Has drunk as much booze as there is water in this river Pat was back beside the handle of the oar with a violin
Burlingham suggested to Susan that shed better stand while she sang and if youve any tendency to stage fright remember its your bread and butter to get through well
Youll not bother about your audience
Susan found this thought a potent strengthenerthen and afterward
With surprisingly little embarrassment she stood before her goodnatured sympathetic employer and while Pat scraped out an accompaniment sang the pathetic story of the maiden young and fair and the stranger in the spring who lingered near the fountains just to hear the maiden sing and how he departed after winning her love and how she will never see the stranger where the fountains fall againade ade ade
Her voice was deliciously young and had the pathetic quality that is never absent from anything which has enduring charm for us
Tears were in Burlinghams voicetears for the fate of the maiden tears of response to the haunting pathos of Susans sweet contralto tears of joy at the acquisition of such a number for his program
As her voice died away he beat his plump hands together enthusiastically
Shell doeh Pat
Shell set the haytossers crazy
Susans heart was beating fast from nervousness
She sat down
Burlingham sprang up and put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her
He laughed at her shrinking
Dont mind my dear he cried
Its one of our ways
Now what others do you know
She tried to recall and with his assistance finally did discover that she possessed a repertoire of good old stale ones consisting of Coming Thro the Rye Suwanee River Annie Laurie and Kathleen Mavourneen
She knew many other songs but either Pat could not play them or Burlingham declared them above the head of Reub the rotter
Those five are quite enough said Burlingham
Two regulars two encores with a third in case of emergency
After dinner Miss Anstruther and Ill fit you out with a costume
Youll make a hit at Sutherland tonight
Sutherland
exclaimed Susan suddenly pale
I cant sing therereally I cant
Burlingham made a significant gesture toward Pat at the oar above them and winked at her
Youll not have stage fright my dear
Youll pull through
Susan understood that nothing more was to be said before Pat
Soon Burlingham told him to tie the oar again and retire to the cabin
Ill stand watch said he
I want to talk business with Miss Sackville
When Pat had gone Burlingham gave her a sympathetic look
No confidences mind you my dear he warned
All I want to know is that it isnt stage fright thats keeping you off the program at Sutherland
No replied the girl
It isnt stage fright
ImIm sorry I cant begin right away to earn the money to pay you back
ButI cant
Not even in a velvet and spangle costumeLow neck short sleeves with blond wig and paint and powder
Youll not know yourself my dearreally
I couldnt said Susan
Id not be able to open my lips
Very well
Thats settled
It was evident that Burlingham was deeply disappointed
We were going to try to make a killing at Sutherland
He sighed
However let that pass
If you cant you cant
Im afraid youre angry with me cried she
Iangry
He laughed
Ive not been angry in ten years
Im such a damn damn fool that with all the knocks lifes given me I havent learned much
But at least Ive learned not to get angry
No I understand my dearand will save you for the next town below
He leaned forward and gave her hands a fatherly pat as they lay in her lap
Dont give it a second thought he said
Weve got the whole length of the river before us
Susan showed her gratitude in her face better far than she could have expressed it in words
The two sat silent
When she saw his eyes upon her with that look of smiling wonder in them she said You mustnt think Ive done anything dreadful
I haventreally I havent
He laughed heartily
And if you had youd not need to hang your head in this company my dear
Were all people who have livedand life isnt exactly a class meeting with the elders taking turns at praying and the organ wheezing out gospel hymns
No weve all been up against it most of our liveswhich means weve done the best we could oftener than weve had the chance to do what we ought
He gave her one of his keen looks nodded I like you



What do they tell oftenest when theyre talking about how you were as a baby
Susan did not puzzle over the queerness of this abrupt question
She fell to searching her memory diligently for an answer
Im not sure but I think they speak oftenest of how I never used to like anybody to take my hand and help me along even when I was barely able to walk
They say I always insisted on trudging along by myself
Burlingham nodded slapped his knee
I can believe it he cried
I always ask everybody that question to see whether Ive sited em up right
I rather think I hit you off to a Tas you faced me at dinner yesterday in the hotel
Speaking of dinnerlets go sit in on the one I smell
They returned to the cabin where to make a table a board had been swung between the backs of the second and third benches from the front on the left side of the aisle
Thus the three men sat on the front bench with their legs thrust through between seat and back while the three women sat in dignity and comfort on the fourth bench
Susan thought the dinner by no means justified Miss Anstruthers pessimism
It was good in itself and the better for being in this happygolucky way in this happygolucky company
Once they got started all the grouchiness disappeared
Susan young and optimistic and determined to be pleased soon became accustomed to the looks of her new companionsthat matter of mere exterior about which we shallow surfaceskimmers make such a mighty fuss though in the test situations of life great and small it amounts to precious little
They were all human beings and the girl was unspoiled did not think of them as failures halfwolves of no social position of no standing in the respectable world
She still had much of the natural democracy of children and she admired these new friends who knew so much more than she did who had lived had suffered had come away from horrible battles covered with wounds the scars of which they would bear into the gravebattles they had lost yet they had not given up but had lived on smiling courageous kind of heart
It was their kind hearts that most impressed hertheir kind taking in of her whom those she loved had cast outher the unknown stranger helpless and ignorant
And what Spenser had told her about the stage and its people made her almost believe that they would not cast her out though they knew the dreadful truth about her birth
Tempest told a story that was broad
While the others laughed Susan gazed at him with a puzzled expression
She wished to be polite to please to enjoy
But what that story meant she could not fathom
Miss Anstruther jeered at her
Look at the innocent she cried
Shut up Vi retorted Miss Connemora
Its no use for us to try to be anything but what we are
Still let the baby alone
Yeslet her alone said Burlingham
Itll soak in soon enough Miss Connemora went on
No use rubbing it in
What
said Susan thinking to show her desire to be friendly to be one of them
Dirt said Burlingham dryly
And dont ask any more questions
When the three women had cleared away the dinner and had stowed the dishes in one of the many cubbyholes along the sides of the cabin the three men got ready for a nap
Susan was delighted to see them drop to the tops of the backs of the seats three berths which fitted snugly into the walls when not in use
She saw now that there were five others of the same kind and that there was a contrivance of wires and curtains by which each berth could be shut off to itself
She had a thrilling sense of being in a kind of Swiss Family Robinson storybook come to life
She unpacked her bag contributed the food in it to the common store spread out her serge suit which Miss Anstruther offered to press and insisted on pressing though Susan protested she could do it herself quite well
Youll want to put it on for the arrival at Sutherland said Mabel Connemora
No replied Susan nervously
Not till tomorrow
She saw the curious look in all their eyes at sight of that dress so different from the calico she was wearing
Mabel took her out on the forward deck where there was an awning and a good breeze
They sat there Mabel talking Susan gazing rapt at land and water and at the actress and listening as to a fairy storyfor the actress had lived through many and strange experiences in the ten years since she left her fathers roof in Columbia South Carolina
Susan listened and absorbed as a dry sponge dropped into a pail of water
At her leisure she would think it all out would understand would learn
Now tell me about yourself said Mabel when she had exhausted all the reminiscences she could recall at the momentall that were fit for a babys ears
I will some time said Susan who was ready for the question
But I cantnot yet
It seems to me youre very innocent said Mabel even for a wellbroughtup girl
I was well brought up too
I wish to God my mother had told me a few things
But nonot a thing
What do you mean
inquired Susan
That set the actress to probing the girls innocencewhat she knew and what she did not
It had been many a day since Miss Connemora had had so much pleasure
Well
she finally said
I never would have believed itthough I know these things are so
Now Im going to teach you
Innocence may be a good thing for respectable women who are going to marry and settle down with a good husband to look after them
But it wont do at allnot at all my dearfor a woman who workswho has to meet men in their own world and on their own terms
Its hard enough to get along if you know
If you dontwhen youre knocked down you stay knocked down
YesI want to learn said Susan eagerly
I want to knoweverything Youre not going back
Mabel pointed toward the shore to a home on a hillside with a woman sewing on the front steps and children racing about the yard
Back to that sort of thing
No replied Susan
Ive got nothing to go back to
Nonsense
Nothing repeated Susan in the same simple final way
Im an outcast
The ready tears sprang to Mabels dissipated but still bright eyes
Susans unconscious pathos was so touching
Then Ill educate you
Now dont get horrified or scandalized at me
When you feel that way remember that Mabel Connemora didnt make the world but God
At least so they saythough personally I feel as if the devil had charge of things and the only god was in us poor human creatures fighting to be decent
I tell you men and women aint badnot so damn badexcuse me they will slip out
No its the things that happen to them or what theyre afraidll happenits those things that compel them to be badand get them in the way of being badhard to each other and to hate and to lie and to do all sorts of things
The show boat drifted placidly down with the current of the broad Ohio
Now it moved toward the left bank and now toward the right as the current was deflected by the bendsthe beautiful curves that divided the river into a series of lovely lakelike reaches each with its emerald oval of hills and rolling valleys where harvests were ripening
And in the shadow of the awning Susan heard from those pretty coarse lips in language softened indeed but still far from refined about all there is to know concerning the causes and consequences of the eternal struggle that rages round sex
To make her tale vivid Mabel illustrated it by the story of her own life from girlhood to the present hour
And she omitted no detail necessary to enforce the lesson in life
A few days before Susan would not have believed would not have understood
Now she both believed and understood
And nothing that Mabel told hernot the worst of the possibilities in the world in which she was adventuringburned deep enough to penetrate beyond the wound she had already received and to give her a fresh sensation of pain and horror
You dont seem to be horrified said Mabel
Susan shook her head
No she said
I feelsomehow I feel better
Mabel eyed her curiouslyhad a sense of a mystery of suffering which she dared not try to explore
She said Better
Thats queer
You dont take it at all as I thought you would
Said Susan I had about made up my mind it was all bad
I see that maybe it isnt
Oh the world isnt such a bad placein lots of ways
Youll get a heap of fun out of it if you dont take things or yourself seriously
I wish to God Id had somebody to tell me instead of having to spell it out a letter at a time
Ive got just two pieces of advice to give you
And she stopped speaking and gazed away toward the shore with a look that seemed to be piercing the hills
Please do urged Susan when Mabels long mood of abstraction tried her patience
Ohyestwo pieces of advice
The first is dont drink
Theres nothing to itand itll play hellexcuse meitll spoil your looks and your health and give you a woozy head when you most need a steady one
Dont drinkthats the first advice
I wont said Susan
Oh yes you will
But remember my advice all the same
The second is dont sell your body to get a living unless youve got to
I couldnt do that said the girl
Mabel laughed queerly
Oh yes you couldand will
But remember my advice
Dont sell your body because it seems to be the easy way to make a living
I know most women get their living that way
Ohnono indeed
protested Susan
What a child you are
laughed Mabel
Whats marriage but that


Believe your Aunt Betsy its the poorest way to make a living that ever was inventedmarriage or the other thing
Sometimes youll be tempted to
Youre pretty and youll find yourself up against it with no way out
Youll have to give in for a time no doubt
The men run things in this world and theyll compel itone way or another
But fight back to your feet again
If Id taken my own advice my name would be on every dead wall in New York in letters two feet high
Instead She laughed without much bitterness
And why
All because I never learned to stand alone
Ive even supported mento have something to lean on
Hows that for a poor fool
There Violet Anstruther called her
She rose
You wont take my advice she said by way of conclusion
Nobodyll take advice
Nobody can
We aint made that way
But dont forget what Ive said
And when youve wobbled way off maybe itll give you something to steer back by
Susan sat on there deep in the deepest of those brown studies that had been characteristic of her from early childhood
Oftenperhaps most oftenabstraction means only mental fogginess
But Susan happened to be of those who can concentratecan think things out
And that afternoon oblivious of the beauty around her even unconscious of where she was she studied the world of realitythat world whose existence even the part of it lying within ourselves we all try to ignore or to evade or to deny and get soundly punished for our folly
Taking advantage of the floods of light Mabel Connemora had let in upon herfull light where there had been a dimness that was equal to darknessshe drew from the closets of memory and examined all the incidents of her lifeall that were typical or for other reasons important
One who comes for the first time into new surroundings sees more learns more about them in a brief period than has been seen and known by those who have lived there always
After a few hours of recalling and reconstructing Susan Lenox understood Sutherland probably better than she would have understood it had she lived a long eventless life there
And is not every Sutherland the world in miniature
She also understood her own positionwhy the world of respectability had cast her out as soon as she emerged from childhoodwhy she could not have hoped for the lot to which other girls looked forwardwhy she belonged with the outcasts in a world apartand must live her life there
She felt that she could not hope to be respected loved married
She must work out her destiny along other lines
She understood it all more clearly than would have been expected of her
And it is important to note that she faced her future without repining or selfpity without either joy or despondency
She would go on she would do as best she could
And nothing that might befall could equal what she had suffered in the throes of the casting out
Burlingham roused her from her long reverie
He evidently had come straight from his napstocking feet shirt open at the collar trousers sagging and face shiny with the sweat that accumulates during sleep on a hot day
Round that bend ahead of us is Sutherland said he pointing forward
Up she started in alarm
Now dont get fractious cried he cheerfully
Well not touch shore for an hour at least
And nobodys allowed aboard
You can keep to the cabin
Ill see that youre not bothered
Andthis evening
You can keep to the dressingroom until the shows over and the peopleve gone ashore
And tomorrow morning bright and early well be off
I promised Pat a day for a drunk at Sutherland
Hell have to postpone it
Ill give him three at Jeffersonville instead
Susan put on her sunbonnet as soon as the show boat rounded the bend above town
Thus she felt safe in staying on deck and watching the town drift by
She did not begin to think of going into the cabin until Pat was working the boat in toward the landing a square above the old familiar wharfboat
What day is this
she asked Eshwell
Saturday
Only Saturday
And last Mondayless than five days agoshe had left this town for her Cincinnati adventure
She felt as if months years had passed
The town seemed strange to her and she recalled the landmarks as if she were revisiting in age the scenes of youth
How small the town seemed after Cincinnati
And how squat
Then She saw the cupola of the schoolhouse
Its rooms the playgrounds flashed before her minds eyethe teachers she had likedthose she had fearedthe face of her uncle so kind and lovingthat same face with hate and contempt in it She hurried into the cabin tears blinding her eyes her throat choked with sobs
The Burlingham Floating Palace of Thespians tied up against the float of Bill Phibbss boathousea privilege for which Burlingham had to pay two dollars
Pat went ashore with a sack of handbills to litter through the town
Burlingham followed to visit the offices of the two evening newspapers and by handing them out a line of smooth talkthe one art whereof he was masterto get free advertising
Also there were groceries to buy and odds and ends of elastic fancy crepe paper muslin and the like for repairing the shabby costumes
The others remained on board Eshwell and Tempest to guard the boat against the swarms of boys darting and swooping and chattering like a huge flock of impudent English sparrows
An additionaland the chiefreason for Burlinghams keeping the two actors close was that Eshwell was a drunkard and Tempest a gambler
Neither could be trusted where there was the least temptation
Each despised the others vice and despised the other for being slave to it
Burlingham could trust Eshwell to watch Tempest could trust Tempest to watch Eshwell
Susan helped Mabel with the small and early suppercold chicken and ham fried potatoes and coffee
Afterward all dressed in the cabin
Some of the curtains for dividing off the berths were drawn out of respect to Susan not yet broken to the ways of a mode of life which made privacy and personal modesty impossibleand when any human custom becomes impossible it does not take human beings long to discover that it is also foolish and useless
The women had to provide for a change of costumes
As the dressingroom behind the stage was only a narrow space between the back drop and the forward wall of the cabin dressing in it was impossible so Mabel and Vi put on a costume of tights and over it a dress
Susan was invited to remain and help
The makingup of the faces interested her she was amazed by the transformation of Mabel into youthful loveliness with a dairy maids bloom in place of her pallid pastiness
On the other hand makeup seemed to bring out the horrors of Miss Anstruthers big fat yet hollow face and to create other and worse horrorsas if in covering her face it somehow uncovered her soul
When the two women stripped and got into their tights Susan with polite modesty turned away
However catching sight of Miss Anstruther in the mirror that had been hung up under one of the side lamps she was so fascinated that she gazed furtively at her by that indirect way
Violet happened to see laughed
Look at the babys shocked face Mabel she cried
But she was mistaken
It was sheer horror that held Susans gaze upon Violets incredible hips and thighs violently obtruded by the closereefed corset
Mabel had a slender figure the waist too short and the legs too nearly of the same girth from hip to ankle but for all that attractive
Susan had never before seen a woman in tights without any sort of skirt
You would show up well in those things Violet said to her that is for a thin woman
The men dont care much for thinness
Not the clodhoppers and roustabouts that come to see us retorted Mabel
The more a woman looks like a cow or a sow the better they like it
They dont believe its female unless it looks like what theyre used to in the barnyard and the cattle pen
Miss Anstruther was not in the least offended
She paraded jauntily switching her great hips and laughing
Jealous
she teased
You poor little broomstick
Burlingham was in a white flannel suit that looked well enough in those dim lights
The makeup gave him an air of rakish youth
Eshwell had got himself into an ordinary sack suit
Tempest was in the tattered and dirty finery of a seventeenthcentury courtier
The paint and black made Eshwells face fat and comic it gave Tempest distinction made his hollow blazing eyes brilliant and large
All traces of habitation were effaced from the auditorium the lamps were lighted a ticket box was set up on the rear deck and an iron bar was thrown half across the rear entrance to the cabin that only one person at a time might be able to pass
The curtain was let downa gaudy smear of a garden scene in a French palace in the eighteenth century
Pat the orchestra put on a dress coat and vest and a dickey the coat had white celluloid cuffs pinned in the sleeves at the wrists
As it was still fully an hour and a half from dark Susan hid on the stage when it should be time for the curtain to go up she would retreat to the dressingroom
Through a peephole in the curtain she admired the auditorium and it did look surprisingly well by lamplight with the smutches and faded spots on its bright paint softened or concealed
How many will it hold
she asked Mabel who was walking up and down carrying her long train
A hundred and twenty comfortably replied Miss Connemora
A hundred and fifty crowded
It has held as high as thirty dollars but well be lucky if we get fifteen tonight
Susan glanced round at her
She was smoking a cigarette handling it like a man
Susans expression was so curious that Mabel laughed
Susan distressed cried Im sorry ifif I was impolite
Oh you couldnt be impolite said Mabel
Youve got that to learn tooand mighty important it is
We all smoke
Why not
We got out of cigarettes but Bob bought a stock this afternoon
Susan turned to the peephole
Pat ready to take tickets was barking vigorously in the direction of shore addressing a crowd which Susan of course could not see
Whenever he paused for breath Burlingham leaned from the box and took it up pouring out a stream of eulogies of his show in that easy lightly cynical voice of his
And the audience straggled inyoung fellows and their girls roughs from along the river front farmers in town for a days sport
Susan did not see a single familiar face and she had supposed she knew by sight at least everyone in Sutherland
From fear lest she should see someone she knew her mind changed to longing
At last she was rewarded
Down the aisle swaggered Redney King son of the washerwoman a big hulking bully who used to tease her by pulling her hair during recess and by kicking at her shins when they happened to be next each other in the class standing in long line against the wall of the schoolroom for recitation
From her security she smiled at Redney as representative of all she loved in the old town
And now the four members of the company on the stage and in the dressingroom lost their ease and contemptuous indifference
They had been talking sneeringly about yokels and jays and slum bums
They dropped all that as there spread over them the mysterious spell of the crowd
As individuals the provincials in those seats were ridiculous as a mass they were an audience an object of fear and awe
Mabel was almost in tears Violet talked rapidly with excited gestures and nervous adjustments of various parts of her toilet
The two men paced about Eshwell trembling Tempest with sheer fright in his rolling eyes
They wet their dry lips with dry tongues
Each again and again asked the other anxiously how he was looking and paced away without waiting for the answer
The suspense and nervous terror took hold of Susan she stood in the corner of the dressingroom pressing herself close against the wall her fingers tightly interlocked and hot and cold tremors chasing up and down her body
Burlingham left the box and combined Pats duties with his owna small matter as the audience was seated and a guard at the door was necessary only to keep the loafers on shore from rushing in free
Pat advanced to the little space reserved before the stage sat down and fell to tuning his violin with all the noise he could make to create the illusion of a full orchestra
Miss Anstruther appeared in one of the forward side doors of the auditorium very dignified in her black satin paper muslin dress with many and sparkling hair and neck ornaments and rings that seemed alight
She bowed to the audience pulled a little old cottage organ from under the stage and seated herself at it
After the overture a pause
Susan peeping through a hole in the drop saw the curtain go up drew a long breath of terror as the audience was revealed beyond the row of footlights beyond the big befrizzled blond head of Violet and the drinkseared face of Pat
From the rear of the auditorium came Burlinghams smoothflowing faintly amused voice announcing the beginning of the performance a delightful feast throughout ladies and gentlemen amusing yet elevating ever moral yet with none of the depressing sadness of puritanism
For ladies and gentlemen while we are pious we are not puritan
The first number is a monologue The Mad Prince by that eminent artist Gregory Tempest
He has delivered it before vast audiences amid thunders of applause
Susan thrilled as Tempest strode forthTempest transformed by the footlights and by her young imagination into a true king most wonderfully and romantically bereft of reason by the woes that had assailed him in horrid phalanxes
If anyone had pointed out to her that Tempests awful voice was simply cheap ranting or that her own woes had been as terrible as any that had ever visited a king or that when people go mad it is never from grief but from insides unromantically addled by foolish eating and drinkingif anyone had attempted then and there to educate the girl how angry it would have made her how she would have hated that wellmeaning person for spoiling her illusion
The spell of the stage seized her with Tempests first line first elegant despairing gesture
It held her through Burlingham and Anstruthers sketch of a matrimonial quarrel through Connemora and Eshwells delicious symphonic romanticism of a lovers quarrel and making up through Tempests recitation of Lasca dying to shield her cowboy lover from the hoofs of the stampeded herd
How the tears did stream from Susans eyes as Tempest wailed out those last lines But I wonder why I do not care for the things that are like the things that were
Can it be that half my heart lies buried there in Texas down by the Rio Grande
She saw the little grave in the desert and the vast blue sky and the buzzard sailing lazily to and fro and it seemed to her that Tempest himself had inspired such a love had lost a sweetheart in just that way
No wonder he looked gaunt and holloweyed and sallow
The last part of the performance was Holy Land and comic pictures thrown from the rear on a sheet substituted for the drop
As Burlingham had to work the magic lantern from the dressingroom while Tempest in a kind of monks robe used his voice and elocutionary powers in describing the pictures now lugubriously and now in lighter vein Susan was forced to retreat to the forward deck and missed that part of the show
But she watched Burlingham shifting the slides and altering the forms of the lenses and was in another way as much thrilled and spellbound as by the acting
Nor did the spell vanish when with the audience gone they all sat down to a late supper and made coarse jests and mocked at their own doings and at the people who had applauded
Susan did not hear
She felt proud that she was permitted in so distinguished a company
Every disagreeable impression vanished
How could she have thought these geniuses common and cheap
How had she dared apply to them the standards of the people the dull commonplace people among whom she had been brought up
If she could only qualify for membership in this galaxy
The thought made her feel like a worm aspiring to be a star
Tempest whom she had liked least now filled her with admiration
She saw the tragedy of his life plain and sad upon his features
She could not look at him without her hearts contracting in an ache
It was not long before Mr Tempest who believed himself a ladykiller noted the ingenuous look in the young girls face and began to pose
And it was hardly three bites of a ham sandwich thereafter when Mabel Connemora noted Tempests shootings of his cuffs and rumplings of his oily ringlets and rollings of his hollow eyes
And at the sight Miss Mabels bright eyes became bad and her tongue shot satire at him
But Susan did not observe this
After supper they went straightway to bed
Burlingham drew the curtains round the berth let down for Susan
The others indulged in no such prudery on so hot a night
They put out the lamps and got ready for bed and into it by the dim light trickling in through the big rear doorway and the two small side doorways forward
To help on the circulation of air Pat raised the stage curtain and drop and opened the little door forward
Each sleeper had a small netting suspended over him from the ceiling without that netting the dense swarms of savage mosquitoes would have made sleep impossible
As it was the loud singing of these baffled thousands kept Susan awake
After a while to calm her brain excited by the evenings thronging impressions and by the newor rather reviewedambitions born of them Susan rose and went softly out on deck in her nightgown of calico slip
Because of the breeze the mosquitoes did not trouble her there and she stood a long time watching the towns few faint lightswatching the stars the thronging stars of the Milky Waydreamingdreamingdreaming
Yesterday had almost faded from her for youth lives only in tomorrowyouth in tomorrow age in yesterday and none of us in today which is all we really have
And she with her wonderful health of body meaning youth as long as it lasted she would certainly be young until she was very oldwould keep her youthher dreamsher living always in tomorrow
She was dreaming of her first real tomorrow now
She would work hard at this wonderful professionher professionwould be humble and attentive and surely the day must come when she too would feel upon her heart the intoxicating beat of those magic waves of applause
Susan more excited than ever slipped softly into the cabin and stole into her curtained berth
Like the soughing of the storm above the whimper of the tortured leaves the stentorian snorings of two of the sleepers resounded above the noise of the mosquitoes
She had hardly extended herself in her close little bed when she heard a stealthy step saw one of her curtains drawn aside
Who is it
she whispered unsuspiciously for she could see only a vague form darkening the space between the parted curtains
The answer came in a hoarse undertone Ye dainty little darling
She sat up struck out madly screamed at the top of her lungs
The curtains fell back into place the snoring stopped
Susan all in a sweat and a shiver lay quiet
Hoarse whispering then in Burlinghams voice stern and gruffGet back to your bed and let her alone you rollingeyed The sentence ended with as foul a spatter of filth as man can fling at man
Silence again and after a few minutes the two snores resumed their bass accompaniment to the falsetto of the mosquito chorus
Susan got a little troubled sleep was wide awake when Violet came saying If you want to bathe Ill bring you a bucket of water and you can put up your berth and do it behind your curtains
Susan thanked her and got a most refreshing bath
When she looked out the men were on deck Violet was getting breakfast and Connemora was combing her short thinning yellow hair before a mirror hung up near one of the forward doors
In the mirror Connemora saw her smiled and nodded
You can fix your hair here said she
Im about done
You can use my brush
And when Susan was busy at the mirror Mabel lounged on a seat near by smoking a beforebreakfast cigarette
I wish to God I had your hair said she
I never did have such a wonderful crop of grass on the knoll and the way it up and drops out in bunches every now and then sets me crazy
It wont be long before Ill be down to Vis three hairs and a half
You havent seen her without her wigs
Well dont if you happen to be feeling a bit off
How Burlingham can There she stopped blew out a volume of smoke grinned half amusedly half in sympathy with the innocence she was protectingor rather was initiating by cautious degrees
Who was it raised the row last night
she inquired
I dont know said Susan her face hid by the mass of wavy hair she was brushing forward from roots to ends
You dont
I guess youve got a kind of idea though
No answer from the girl
Well it doesnt matter
It isnt your fault
Mabel smoked reflectively
Im not jealous of hima woman never is
Its the idea of another womans getting away with her property whether she wants it or notthats what sets her madspot to humming
No I dont give aa cigarette buttfor that greasy bum actor
But Ive always got to have somebody
She laughed
The idea of his thinking youd have him
What peacocks men are
Susan understood
The fact of this sort of thing was no longer a mystery to her
But the why of the factthat seemed more amazing than ever
Now that she had discovered that her notion of love being incorporeal was as fanciful as Santa Claus she could not conceive why it should be at all
As she was bringing round the braids for the new coiffure she had adopted she said to Mabel Youlove him
I
Mabel laughed immoderately
You can have him if you want him
Susan shuddered
Oh no she said
I suppose hes very niceand really hes quite a wonderful actor
But II dont care for men
Mabel laughed againcurt bitter
Wait she said
Susan shook her head with youths positiveness
Whats caring got to do with it
pursued Mabel ignoring the headshake
Ive been about quite a bit and Ive yet to see anybody that really cared for anybody else
We care for ourselves
But a man needs a woman and a woman needs a man
They call it loving
They might as well call eating loving
Ask Burly
CHAPTER XIV AT breakfast Tempest was precisely as usual and so were the others
Nor was there effort or any sort of pretense in this
We understand only that to which we are accustomed the man of peace is amazed by the veterans nonchalance in presence of danger and horror of wound and death
To these river wanderers veterans in the unconventional life where the unusual is the usual the unexpected the expected whatever might happen was the matter of course to be dealt with and dismissed
Susan naturally took her cue from them
When Tempest said something to her in the course of the careless conversation round the breakfast table she answeredand had no sense of constraint
Thus an incident that in other surroundings would have been in some way harmful through receiving the exaggeration of undue emphasis caused less stir than the five huge and fiery mosquito bites Eshwell had got in the night
And Susan unconsciously absorbed one of those lessons in the science and art of living that have decisive weight in shaping our destinies
For intelligent living is in large part learning to ignore the unprofitable that one may concentrate upon the profitable
Burlingham announced that they would cast off and float down to Bethlehem
There was a chorus of protests
Why we ought to stay here a week
cried Miss Anstruther
We certainly caught on last night
Didnt we take in seventeen dollars
demanded Eshwell
We cant do better than that anywhere
Whos managing this show
asked Burlingham in his suave but effective way
I think I know what Im about
He met their grumblings with the utmost goodhumor and remained inflexible
Susan listened with eyes down and burning cheeks
She knew Burlingham was leaving the best cow unmilked as Connemora put it because he wished to protect her
She told him so when they were alone on the forward deck a little later as the boat was floating round the bend below Sutherland
Yes he admitted
Ive great hopes from your ballads
I want to get you on
He looked round casually saw that no one was looking drew a peculiarly folded copy of the Sutherland Courier from his pocket
Besidessaid he holding out the paperread that
Susan read George Warham Esq requests us to announce that he has increased the reward for information as to the whereabouts of Mrs Susan Ferguson his young niece nee Susan Lenox to one thousand dollars
There are grave fears that the estimable and lovely young lady who disappeared from her husbands farm the night of her marriage has doubtless in a moment of insanity ended her life
We hope not
Susan lifted her gaze from this paragraph after she had read it until the words ran together in a blur
She found Burlingham looking at her
Said he As I told you before I dont want to know anything
But when I read that it occurred to me if some of the others saw it they might think it was youand might do a dirty trick
He sighed with a cynical little smile
I was tempted myself
A thousand is quite a bunch
You dont knownot yethow a chance to make some moneyany old waycompels a manor a womanwhen moneys as scarce and as useful as it is in this world
As you get along youll notice my dear that the people who get moral goose flesh at the shady doings of others are always people who havent ever really been up against it
I dont know why I didnt He shrugged his shoulders
Now my dear youre in on the secret of why I havent got up in the world
He smiled cheerfully
But I may yet
The games far from over
She realized that he had indeed made an enormous sacrifice for her for though very ignorant about money a thousand dollars seemed a fortune
She had no words she looked away toward the emerald shore and her eyes filled and her lip quivered
How much goodness there was in the worldhow much generosity and affection
Im not sure he went on that you oughtnt to go back
But its your own business
Ive a kind of feeling you know what youre about
No matter what happens to me said she Ill never regret what Ive done
Id kill myself before Id spend another day with the man they made me marry
WellIm not fond of dying observed Burlingham in the light jovial tone that would most quickly soothe her agitation but I think Id take my chances with the worms rather than with the dry rot of a backwoods farm
You may not get your meals so regular out in the world but you certainly do live
Yesthat backwoods life for anybody with a spark of spunk is simply being dead and knowing it
He tore the Courier into six pieces flung them over the side
None of the others saw the paper said he
SoMiss Lorna Sackville is perfectly safe
He patted her on the shoulder
And she owes me a thousand and two dollars
Ill payif youll be patient said the girl taking his jest gravely
Its a good gamble said he
Then he laughed
I guess that had something to do with my virtue
Theres always a practical reasonalways
But the girl was not hearing his philosophies
Once more she was overwhelmed and stupefied by the events that had dashed in upon and over her like swift succeeding billows that give the swimmer no pause for breath or for clearing the eyes
Noyoure not dreaming said Burlingham laughing at her expression
At least no more than we all are
Sometimes I suspect the whole damn shootingmatch is nothing but a dream
Well its a pretty good one eh
And she agreed with him as she thought how smoothly and agreeably they were drifting into the unknown full of the most fascinating possibilities
How attractive this life was how much at home she felt among these people and if anyone should tell him about her birth or about how she had been degraded by Ferguson it wouldnt in the least affect their feeling toward her she was sure
When dodo youtry me
she asked
Tomorrow night at Bethlehema bum little town for us
Well stay there a couple of days
I want you to get used to appearing
He nodded at her encouragingly
Youve got stuff in you real stuff
Dont you doubt it
Get selfconfidenceconceit if you please
Nobody arrives anywhere without it
You want to feel that you can do what you want to do
A fools conceit is that hes it already
A sensible mans conceit is that he can be it if hell only work hard and in the right way
See
II think I do said the girl
Im not sure
Burlingham smoked his cigar in silence
When he spoke it was with eyes carefully averted
Theres another subject the spirit moves me to talk to you about
Thats the one Miss Connemora opened up with you yesterday
As Susan moved uneasily Now dont get scared
Im not letting the woman business bother me much nowadays
All I think of is how to get on my feet again
I want to have a theater on Broadway before the old blackflagger overtakes my craft and makes me walk the plank and jump out into the Big Guess
So you neednt think Im going to worry you
Im not
Oh I didnt think You ought to have though interrupted he
A man like me is a rare exception
Im a rare exception to my ordinary self to be quite honest
Itll be best for you always to assume that every man you run across is looking for just one thing
You know what
Susan the flush gone from her cheeks nodded
I suppose Connemora has put you wise
But there are some things even she dont know about that subject
Now I want you to listen to your grandfather
Remember what he says
And think it over until you understand it
I will said Susan
In the life youve come out of virtue in a womans everything
Shes got to be virtuous or at least to have the reputation of itor shes nothing
You understand that
Yes said Susan
I understand thatnow
Very well
Now in the life youre going into virtue in a woman is nothingno more than it is in a man anywhere
The woman who makes a career becomes like the man who makes a career
How is it with a man
Some are virtuous others are not
But no man lets virtue bother him and nobody bothers about his virtue
Thats the way it is with a woman who cuts loose from the conventional life of society and home and all that
She is virtuous or not as she happens to incline
Her real interest in herself her real value lies in another direction
If it doesnt if she continues to be agitated about her virtue as if it were all there is to herthen the sooner she hikes back to respectability to the conventional routine why the better for her
Shell never make a career any more than she could drive an automobile through a crowded street and at the same time keep a big picture hat on straight
Do you follow me
Im not sure said the girl
Ill have to think about it
Thats right
Dont misunderstand
Im not talking for or against virtue
Im simply talking practical life and all I mean is that you wont get on there by your virtue and you wont get on by your lack of virtue
Now for my advice
Susans look of unconscious admiration and attention was the subtlest flattery
Its frank ingenuous showing of her implicit trust in him so impressed him with his responsibility that he hesitated before he said Never forget this and dont stop thinking about it until you understand it Make men as men incidental in your life precisely as men who amount to anything make women as women incidental
Her first sensation was obviously disappointing
She had expected something far more impressive
Said she I dont care anything about men
Be sensible
How are you to know now what you care about and what you dont
was Burlinghams laughing rebuke
And in the line youve takenthe stagewith your emotions always being stirred up with your thoughts always hovering round the relations of men and womenfor thats the only subject of plays and music and with opportunity thrusting at you as it never thrusts at conventional people youll probably soon find you care a great deal about men
But dont ever let your emotions hinder or hurt or destroy you
Use them to help you
I guess Im shooting pretty far over that young head of yours aint I
Not so very far said the girl
Anyhow Ill remember
If you live big enough and long enough youll go through three stages
The first is the one youre in now
Theyve always taught you without realizing it and so you think that only the strong can afford to do right
You think doing right makes the ordinary person like yourself easy prey for those who do wrong
You think that good peopleif theyre really goodhave to wait until they get to Heaven before they get a chance
Isnt that so
No
But youll not realize it until you pass into the second stage
There youll think you see that only the strong can afford to do wrong
Youll think that everyone except the strong gets it in the neck if he or she does anything out of the way
Youll think youre being punished for your sins and that if you had behaved yourself youd have got on much better
Thats the stage thats coming and what you go through with therehow you come out of the fightwill decide your fateshow whether or not youve got the real stuff in you
Do you understand
Susan shook her head
I thought not
You havent lived long enough yet
Well Ill finish anyhow
Ill remember said Susan
Ill think about it until I do understand
I hope so
The weather and the scenery make me feel like philosophizing
Finally if you come through the second stage all right youll enter the third stage
There youll see that you were right at first when you thought only the strong could afford to do right
And youll see that you were right in the second stage when you thought only the strong could afford to do wrong
For youll have learned that only the strong can afford to act at all and that they can do right or wrong as they please because they are strong
Then you dont believe in right at all
exclaimed the girl much depressed but whether for the right or for her friend she could not have told
Now who said that
Demanded he amused
What did I say
Whyif you want to do right be strong or youll be crushed and if you want to do wrong take care again to be strongor youll be crushed
My moral is be strong
In this world the good weaklings and the bad weaklings had better lie low hide in the tall grass
The strong inherit the earth
They were silent a long time she thinking he observing her with sad tenderness
At last he said You are a nice sweet girlwell brought up
But that means badly brought up for the life youve got to leadthe life youve got to learn to lead
Im beginning to see that said the girl
Her gravity made him feel like laughing and brought the tears to his eyes
The laughter he suppressed
Youre going to fight your way up to whats called the triumphant classthe people on topthey have all the success all the money all the good times
Well the things youve been taughtat churchin the Sunday Schoolin the nice storybooks youve readthose things are all for the triumphant class or for people working meekly along in the station to which God has appointed them and handing over their earnings to their betters
But those nice moral things you believe inthey dont apply to people like youfighting their way up from the meek working class to the triumphant class
You wont believe me nowwont understand thoroughly
But soon youll see
Once youve climbed up among the successful people you can afford to indulgein moderationin practicing the good old moralities
Any dirty work you may need done you can hire done and pretend not to know about it
But while youre climbing no Golden Rule and no turning of the cheek
Tooth and claw thennot sheathed but nakednot by proxy but in your own person
But youre not like that said the girl
The more fool I repeated he
She was surprised that she understood so much of what he had saidchildlike wonder at her wise old heart made wise almost in a nighta wedding night
When Burlingham lapsed into silence laughing at himself for having talked so far over the kiddies head she sat puzzling out what he had said
The world seemed horribly vast and forbidding and the sky so blue and bright seemed far far away
She sighed profoundly
I am so weak she murmured
I am so ignorant
Burlingham nodded and winked
Yes but youll grow said be
I back you to win
The color poured into her cheeks and she burst into tears
Burlingham thought he understood for once his shrewdness went far astray
Excusably since he could not know that he had used the same phrase that had closed Spensers letter to her
Late in the afternoon when the heat had abated somewhat and they were floating pleasantly along with the washing gently aflutter from lines on the roof of the auditorium Burlingham put Eshwell at the rudder and with Pat and the violin rehearsed her
The main thing the only thing to worry about explained he is beginning right
She was standing in the center of the stage he on the floor of the auditorium beside the seated orchestra
That means he went on youve simply got to learn to come in right
Well practice that for a while
She went to the wingswhere there was barely space for her to conceal herself by squeezing tightly against the wall
At the signal from him she walked out
As she had the utmost confidence in his kindness and as she was always too deeply interested in what she and others were doing to be uncomfortably selfconscious she was not embarrassed and thought she made the crossing and took her stand very well
He nodded approvingly
But said he theres a difference between a stage walk and walking anywhere elseor standing
Nothing is natural on the stage
If it were it would look unnatural because the stage itself is artificial and whatever is there must be in harmony with it
So everything must be done unnaturally in such a way that it seems natural
Just as a picture boat looks natural though its painted on a flat surface
Now Ill illustrate
He gave her his hand to help her jump down then he climbed to the stage
He went to the wings and walked out
As he came he called her attention to how he poised his body how he advanced so that there would be from the auditorium no unsightly view of crossing legs how he arranged hands arms shoulders legs head feet for an attitude of complete rest
He repeated his illustration again and again Susan watching and listening with openeyed wonder and admiration
She had never dreamed that so simple a matter could be so complex
When he got her up beside him and went through it with her she soon became as used to the new motions as a beginner at the piano to stretching an octave
But it was only after more than an hours practice that she moved him to say Thatll do for a beginning
Now well sing
She tried Suwanee River first and went through it fairly well singing to him as he stood back at the rear door
He was enthusiasticcunning Burlingham who knew so well how to get the best out of everyone
Mighty goodeh Pat
Yes mighty good
Youve got something better than a great voice my dear
Youve got magnetism
The same thing that made me engage you the minute you asked me is going to make youwell go a long waysa long ways
Now well try The Last Rose of Summer
She sang even better
And this improvement continued through the other four songs of her repertoire
His confidence in her was contagious it was so evident that he really did believe in her
And Pat too wagged his head in a way that made her feel good about herself
Then Burlingham called in the others whom he had sent to the forward deck
Before them the girl went all to pieces
She made her entrance badly she sang worse
And the worse she sang the worse she felt and the worse her next attempt was
At last with nerves unstrung she broke down and sobbed
Burlingham climbed up to pat her on the shoulder
Thats the best sign yet said he
It shows youve got temperament
Yesyouve got the stuff in you
He quieted her interested her in the purely mechanical part of what she was doing
Dont think of who youre doing it before or of how youre doing it but only of getting through each step and each note
If your heads full of that youll have no room for fright
And she was ready to try again
When she finished the last notes of Suwanee River there was an outburst of hearty applause
And the sound that pleased her most was Tempests rich rhetorical Bravo
As a man she abhorred him but she respected the artist
And in unconsciously drawing this distinction she gave proof of yet another quality that was to count heavily in the coming days
Artist he was not
But she thought him an artist
A girl or boy without the intelligence that can develop into flower and fruit would have seen and felt only Tempest the odious personality
Burlingham did not let her off until she was ready to drop with exhaustion
And after supper when they were floating slowly on well out of the channel where they might be run down by some passing steamer with a flinthearted captain or pilot she had to go at it again
She went to bed early and she slept without a motion or a break until the odor of the cooking breakfast awakened her
When she came out her face was bright for the first time
She was smiling laughing chatting was delighted with everything and everybody
Even the thought of Roderick Spenser laid up with a broken leg recurred less often and less vividly
It seemed to her that the leg must be about well
The imagination of healthy youth is reluctant to admit ideas of gloom in any circumstances
In circumstances of excitement and adventure such as Susans at that time it flatly refuses to admit them
They were at anchor before a little town sprawled upon the fields between hills and river edge
A few loafers were chewing tobacco and inspecting the show boat from the shady side of a pile of lumber
Pat had already gone forth with the bundle of handbills he was not only waking up the town but touring the country in horse and buggy was agitating the farmersfor the show boat was to stay at least two nights at Bethlehem
And we ought to do pretty well said Burlingham
The wheats about all threshed and theres a kind of lull
The hayseeds arent so dead tired at night
A couple of weeks ago we couldnt have got half a house by paying for it
As the afternoon wore away and the sun disappeared behind the hills to the southwest Susans spirits oozed
Burlingham and the othersdeliberatelypaid no attention to her acted as if no great universestirring event were impending
Immediately after supper Burlingham said Now Vi get busy and put her into her harness
Make her a work of art
Never was there a finer display of unselfishness than in their eagerness to help her succeed in their intense nervous anxiety lest she should not make a hit
The bad in human nature as Mabel Connemora had said is indeed almost entirely if not entirely the result of the compulsion of circumstances the good is the natural outcropping of normal instincts and resumes control whenever circumstances permit
These wandering players had suffered too much not to have the keenest and gentlest sympathy
Susan looked on Tempest as a wicked man yet she could not but be touched by his almost hysterical excitement over her debut when the near approach of the hour made it impossible for his emotional temperament longer to hide its agitation
Every one of them gave or loaned her a talismanTempest a bit of rabbits foot Anstruther a ring that had twice saved her from drowning at least it had been on her finger each time Connemora a hunchbacks tooth on a faded velvet string Pat a penny which happened to be of the date of her birth year the presence of the penny was regarded by all as a most encouraging sign Eshwell loaned her a miniature silver bug he wore on his watch chain Burlinghams contribution was a large buckeyeEver since Ive had that Ive never been without at least the price of a meal in my pocket
They had got together for her a kind of evening dress a pale blue chiffonlike drapery that left her lovely arms and shoulders bare and clung softly to the lines of her figure
They did her hair up in a graceful sweep from the brow and a simple coil behind
She looked like a woman yet like a child dressed as a woman too for there was as always that exuberant vitality which made each of the hairs of her head seem individual electric
The rouge gave her color enhanced into splendor the brilliance of her violetgray eyeseyes so intensely colored and so admirably framed that they were noted by the least observant
When Anstruther had put the last touches to her toilet and paraded her to the others there was a chorus of enthusiasm
The men no less than the women viewed her with the professional eye
Didnt I tell you all
cried Burlingham as they looked her up and down like a group of connoisseurs inspecting a statue
Wasnt I right
It is the dawn and Juliet is the east orated Tempest in rich romantic tones
A damn shame to waste her on these yaps said Eshwell
Connemora embraced her with tearful eyes
And as sweet as you are lovely you dear
she cried
You simply cant help winning
The two women thought her greatest charms were her form and her feet and ankles
The men insisted that her charm of charms was her eyes
And certainly much could be said for that view
Susans violetgray eyes growing grayer when she was thoughtful growing deeper and clearer and softer shining violet when her emotions were touchedSusans eyes were undoubtedly unusual even in a race in which homely eyes are the exception
When it was her turn and she emerged into the glare of the footlights she came to a full stop and an awful wave of weakness leaped up through legs and body to blind her eyes and crash upon her brain
She shook her head lifted it high like a swimmer shaking off a wave
Her gaze leaped in terror across the blackness of the auditorium with its thickstrewn round white disks of human faces sought the eyes of Burlingham standing in full view in the center of the rear doorwaywhere he had told her to look for him
She heard Pat playing the last of the opening chords Burlingham lifted his hand like a leaders baton
And naturally and sweetly the notes the words of the old darkey song of longing for home began to float out through the stillness
She did not take her gaze from Burlingham
She sang her best sang to please him to show him how she appreciated what he had done for her
And when she finished and bowed the outburst of applause unnerved her sent her dizzy and almost staggering into the wings
Splendid
Splendid
cried Mabel and Anstruther embraced her and Tempest and Eshwell kissed her hands
They all joined in pushing her out again for the encoreBlue Alsatian Mountains
She did not sing quite so steadily but got through in good form the tremolo of nervousness in her voice adding to the wailing pathos of the songs refrain Ade ade ade such dreams must pass away But the Blue Alsatian Mountains seem to watch and wait alway
The crowd clapped stamped whistled shouted but Burlingham defied it
The lady will sing again later he cried
The next number on the regular program is etc etc
The crowd yelled Burlingham stood firm and up went the curtain on Eshwell and Connemoras sketch
It got no applause
Nor did any other numbers on the program
The contrast between the others and the beauty of the girl her delicate sweetness her vital youth her freshness of the early morning flower was inevitable
The crowd could think only of her
The quality of magnetism aside she had sung neither very well nor very badly
But had she sung badly still her beauty would have won her the same triumph
When she came on for her second number with a cloudlike azure chiffon flung carelessly over her dark hair as a scarf Spanish fashion she received a stirring welcome
It frightened her so that Pat had to begin four times before her voice faintly took up the tune
Again Burlinghams encouraging confident gaze flung across the gap between them like a strong rescuing hand strengthened her to her task
This time he let the crowd have two encoresand the show was over for the astute manager seeing how the girl had caught on had moved her second number to the end
Burlingham lingered in the entrance to the auditorium to feast himself on the comments of the crowd as it passed out
When he went back he had to search for the girl found her all in a heap in a chair at the outer edge of the forward deck
She was sobbing piteously
Well for Gods sake
cried he
Is this the way you take it
She lifted her head
Did I do very badly
she asked
You swept em off their big hulking feet replied he
When you didnt come I thought Id disappointed you
Ill bet my hand there never was such a hit made in a river show boatand theyve graduated some of the swells of the profession
Well play here a week to crowded housesmatinees every day too
And this is a twonight stand usually
I must find some more songs
He slapped his thigh
The very thing
he cried
Well ring in some hymns
Rock of Ages sayand Jesus Lover of my Souland you can get em off in a churchy kind of costume something like a surplice
Thatll knock em stiff
And Anstruther can dope out the accompaniments on that wheezer
What dyou think
Whatever you want said the girl
Oh I am so glad
I dont see how you got through so well said he
I didnt dare fail replied Susan
If I had I couldnt have faced you
And by the light of the waning moon he saw the passionate gratitude of her sensitive young face
OhIve done nothing said he wiping the tears from his eyesfor he had his full share of the impulsive sentimental temperament of his profession
Pure selfishness
Susan gazed at him with eyes of the pure deep violet of strongest feeling
I know what you did she said in a low voice
AndId die for you
Burlingham had to use his handkerchief in dealing with his eyes now
This business has given me hysterics said he with a queer attempt at a laugh
Then after a moment God bless you little girl
You wait here a moment
Ill see how suppers getting on
He wished to go ahead of her for he had a shrewd suspicion as to the state of mind of the rest of the company
And he was right
There they sat in the litter of peanut hulls popcorn and fruit skins which the audience had left
On every countenance was jealous gloom
Whats wrong
inquired Burlingham in his cheerful derisive way
You are a nice bunch you are
They shifted uneasily
Mabel snapped out Wheres the infant prodigy
Is she so stuck on herself already that she wont associate with us
You grownup babies mocked Burlingham
I found her out there crying in darkness because she thought shed failed
Now you go bring her in Conny
As for the rest of you Im disgusted
Here weve hit on something thatll land us in Easy Street and youre all filled up with poison
They were ashamed of themselves
Burlingham had brought back to them vividly the girls simplicity and sweetness that had won their hearts even the hearts of the women in whom jealousy of her young beauty would have been more than excusable
Anstruther began to get out the supper dishes and Mabel slipped away toward the forward deck
When the child comes in pursued Burlingham I want to see you people looking and acting human
We are a lot of damn fools admitted Eshwell
Thats why were bum actors instead of doing well at some respectable business
And his jealousy went the way of Violets and Mabels
Pat began to remember that he had shared in the triumphwhere would she have been without his violin work
But Tempest remained somber
In his case better nature was having a particularly hard time of it
His vanity had got savage wounds from the hoots and the Oh bite it off hamfat which had greeted his impressive lecture on the magic lantern pictures
He eyed Burlingham glumly
He exonerated the girl but not Burlingham
He was convinced that the manager in a spirit of mean revenge had put up a job on him
It simply could not be in the ordinary course that any audience without some sly trickery of prompting from an old expert of theatrical doublecrossing would be impatient for a mere chit of an amateur when it might listen to his rich mellow eloquence
Susan came shylyand at the first glance into her face her associates despised themselves for their pettiness
It is impossible for envy and jealousy and hatred to stand before the light of such a nature as Susans
Away from her these very human friends of hers might hate herbut in her presence they could not resist the charm of her sincerity
Everyones spirits went up with the supper
It was Pat who said to Burlingham Bob were going to let the pullet in on the profits equally arent we
Sure replied Burlingham
Anybody kicking
The others protested enthusiastically except Tempest who shot a glance of fiery scorn at Burlingham over a fork laden with potato salad
Thenyoure elected Miss Sackville said Burlingham
Susans puzzled eyes demanded an explanation
Just this said he
We divide equally at the end of the trip all weve raked in after the rent of the boat and expenses are taken off
You get your equal share exactly as if you started with us
But that wouldnt be fair protested the girl
I must pay what I owe you first
She means two dollars she borrowed of me at Carrollton explained Burlingham
And they all laughed uproariously
Ill only take whats fair said the girl
I vote we give it all to her rolled out Tempest in tragedys tone for classic satire
Before Mabel could hurl at him the probably coarse retort she instantly got her lips ready to make Burlinghams cool peacecompelling tones broke in Miss Sackvilles right
She must get only whats fair
She shares equally from tonight onless two dollars
Susan nodded delightedly
She did not knowand the others did not at the excited moment recallthat the company was to date eleven dollars less well off than when it started from the headwaters of the Ohio in early June
But Burlingham knew and that was the cause of the quiet grin to which he treated himself
CHAPTER XV BURLINGHAM had lived too long too actively and too intelligently to have left any of his large original stock of the optimism that had so often shipwrecked his career in spite of his talents and his energy
Out of the bitterness of experience he used to say A young optimist is a young fool
An old optimist is an old ass
A fool may learn an ass cant
And again An optimist steams through the fog taking it for granted everythings all right
A pessimist steams ahead too but he gets ready for trouble
However he was wise enough to keep his private misgivings and reservations from his associates the leaders of the human race always talk optimism and think pessimism
He had told the company that Susan was sure to make a go and after she had made a go he announced the beginning of a season of triumph
But he was surprised when his prediction came true and they had to turn people away from the next afternoons performance
He began to believe they really could stay a week and hired a man to fill the streets of New Washington and other inland villages and towns of the county with a handbill headlining Susan
The news of the lovely young ballad singer in the show boat at Bethlehem spread as interesting news ever does and down came the people to see and hear and to go away exclaiming
Bethlehem the sleepy showed that it could wake when there was anything worth waking for
Burlingham put on the hymns in the middle of the week and even the clergy sent their families
Every morning Susan either with Mabel or with Burlingham or with both took a long walk into the country
It was Burlingham by the way who taught her the necessity of regular and methodical long walks for the preservation of her health
When she returned there was always a crowd lounging about the landing waiting to gape at her and whisper
It was intoxicating to her this delicious draught of the heady wine of fame and Burlingham was not unprepared for the evidences that she thought pretty well of herself felt that she had arrived
He laughed to himself indulgently
Let the kiddie enjoy herself thought he
She needs the selfconfidence now to give her a good foundation to stand on
Then when she finds out what a false alarm this jay excitement was shell not be swept clean away into despair
The chief element in her happiness he of course knew nothing about
Until this successwhich she having no basis for comparison could not but exaggerateshe had been crushed and abused more deeply than she had dared admit to herself by her birth which made all the world scorn her and by the series of calamities climaxing in that afternoon and night of horror at Fergusons
This successit seemed to her to give her the right to have been born the right to live on and hold up her head without effort after Ferguson
Ill show them all before I get through she said to herself over and over again
Theyll be proud of me
Ruth will be boasting to everyone that Im her cousin
And Sam Wrighthell wonder that he ever dared touch such a famous great woman
She only half believed this herself for she had much common sense and small selfconfidence
But pretending that she believed it all gave her the most delicious pleasure
Burlingham took such frank joy in her innocent vanityso far as he understood it and so far as she exhibited itthat the others were goodhumored about it tooall the others except Tempest whom conceit and defeat had long since soured through and through
A tithe of Susans success would have made him unbearable for like most human beings he had a vanity that was Atlantosaurian on starvation rations and would have filled the whole earth if it had been fed a few crumbs
Small wonder that we are ever eagerly on the alert for signs of vanity in others we are seeking the curious comfort there is in the feeling that others have our own weakness to a more ridiculous degree
Tempest twitched to jeer openly at Susan whose exhibition was really timid and modest and not merely excusable but justifiable
But he dared go no further than holding haughtily aloof and casting vaguely into the air ever and anon a tragic sneer
Susan would not have understood if she had seen and did not see
She was treading the heights her eyes upon the sky
She held grave consultation with Burlingham with Violet with Mabel about improving her part
She took it all very very seriouslyand Burlingham was glad of that
Yes she does take herself seriously he admitted to Anstruther
But that wont do any harm as shes so young and as she takes her work seriously too
The trouble about taking oneself seriously is it stops growth
She hasnt got that form of it
Not yet said Violet
Shell wake from her little dream poor child long before the fatal stage
And he heaved a sigh for his own lost illusionsthose illusions that had cost him so dear
Burlingham had intended to make at least one stop before Jeffersonville the first large town on the way down
But Susans capacities as a housefiller decided him for pushing straight for it
Well go where theres a big population to be drawn on said he
But he did not say that in the back of his head there was forming a plan to take a small theater at Jeffersonville if the girl made a hit there
Eshwell to whom he was talking looked glum
Shes going pretty good with these greenies observed he
But Ive my doubts whether city peoplell care for anything so milklike
Burlingham had his doubts too but he retorted warmly Dont you believe it Eshie
Citys an outside
Underneath theres still the simple honest grassygreen heart of the country
Eshwell laughed
So youve stopped jeering at jays
Youve forgotten what a lot of tightwads and petty swindlers they are
Well I dont blame you
Now that theyre giving down to us so freely I feel better about them myself
Its a pity we cant lower the rest of the program to the level of their intellectuals
Burlingham was not tactless enough to disturb Eshwells consoling notion that while Susan was appreciated by these ignorant countryjakes the rest of the company were too subtle and refined in their art
Thats a good idea replied he
Ill try to get together some simple slop
Perhaps a melodrama a good hot one would goeh
After ten days the receipts began to drop
On the fifteenth day there was only a handful at the matinee and in the evening half the benches were empty
About milked dry said Burlingham at the late supper
Well move on in the morning
This pleased everyone
Susan saw visions of bigger triumphs the others felt that they were going where dramatic talent not to say genius would be at least not entirely unappreciated
So the company was at its liveliest next morning as the mosquitoinfested willows of the Bethlehem shore slowly dropped away
They had made an unusually early start for the river would be more and more crowded as they neared the three closeset citiesLouisville Jeffersonville and New Albany and the helpless little show boat must give the steamers no excuse for not seeing her
All daya long dreamy summer daythey drifted lazily downstream and except Tempest all grew gayer and more gay
Burlingham had announced that there were three hundred and seventyeight dollars in the japanned tin box he kept shut up in his bag
At dusk a tug for three dollars nosed them into a wharf which adjoined the thickly populated labor quarter of Jeffersonville
Susan was awakened by a scream
Even as she opened her eyes a dark cloud a dull suffocating terrifying pain descended upon her
When she again became conscious she was lying upon a mass of canvas on the levee with three strange men bending over her
She sat up instinctively caught together the front of the nightdress she had bought in Bethlehem the second day there
Then she looked wildly from face to face
Youre all right maam said one of the men
Not a scratchonly stunned
What was it
said the girl
Where are they
As she spoke she saw Burlingham in his nightshirt propped against a big blue oil barrel
He was staring stupidly at the ground
And now she noted the others scattered about the levee each with a group around him or her
What was it
she repeated
A tug butted its tow of barges into you said someone
Crushed your boat like an eggshell
Burlingham staggered to his feet stared round saw her
Thank God
he cried
Anyone drowned
Anyone hurt
All savedno bones broken someone responded
And the boat
Gone down
Nothing left of her but splinters
The barges were full of coal and building stone
The box
suddenly shouted Burlingham
The box
What kind of a box
asked a boy with lean dirty and much scratched bare legs
A little black tin box like they keep money in
Thats it
Where is it
Its all right said the boy
One of your people a black actorlooking fellow Tempest interjected Burlingham
Go on
He dressed on the wharf and he had the box
Where is he
He said he was going for a doctor
Last I seed of him he was up to the corner yonder
He was movin fast
Burlingham gave a kind of groan
Susan read in his face his fear his suspicionthe suspicion he was ashamed of himself for having
She noted vaguely that he talked with the policeman aside for a few minutes after which the policeman went up the levee
Burlingham rejoined his companions and took command
The first thing was to get dressed as well as might be from such of the trunks as had been knocked out of the cabin by the barge and had been picked up
They were all dazed
Even Burlingham could not realize just what had occurred
They called to one another more or less humorous remarks while they were dressing behind piles of boxes crates barrels and sacks in the wharfboat
And they laughed gayly when they assembled
Susan made the best appearance for her blue serge suit had been taken out dry when she herself was lifted from the sinking wreck the nightgown served as a blouse
Mabels trunk had been saved
Violet could wear none of her things as they were many sizes too small so she appeared in a property skirt of black paper muslin a black velvet property basque a pair of shoes belonging to Tempest
Burlingham and Eshwell made a fairly respectable showing in clothing from Tempests trunk
Their own trunks had gone down
Why wheres Tempest
asked Eshwell
Hell be back in a few minutes replied Burlingham
In fact he ought to be back now
His glance happened to meet Susans he hastily shifted his eyes
Wheres the box
asked Violet
Tempests taking care of it was the managers answer
Tempest
exclaimed Mabel
Her shrewd dissipated eyes contracted with suspicion
Anybody got any money
inquired Eshwell as he fished in his pockets
No one had a cent
Eshwell searched Tempests trunk found a twodollar bill and a one wrapped round a silver dollar and wadded in among some ragged underclothes
Susan heard Burlingham mutter Wonder how he happened to overlook that
But no one else heard
Well we might have breakfast suggested Mabel
They went out on the water deck of the wharfboat looked down at the splinters of the wreck lying in the deep yellow river
Come on said Burlingham and he led the way up the levee
There was no attempt at jauntiness they all realized now
How about Tempest
said Eshwell stopping short halfway up
Tempesthell
retorted Mabel
Come on
What do you mean
cried Violet whose left eye was almost closed by a bruise
Well not see him again
Come on
Bob
shrieked Violet at Burlingham
Do you hear that
Yes said he
Keep calm and come on 
Arent you going to do anything
she screamed seizing him by the coat tail
You must damn ityou must
I got the policeman to telephone headquarters said Burlingham
What else can be done
Come on
And a moment later the bedraggled and dejected company filed into a cheap levee restaurant
Bring some coffee Burlingham said to the waiter
Then to the others Does anybody want anything else
No one spoke
Coffees all he said to the waiter
It came and they drank it in silence each ones brain busy with the disaster from the standpoint of his own resulting ruin
Susan glanced furtively at each face in turn
She could not think of her own fate there was such despair in the faces of these others
Mabel looked like an old woman
As for Violet every feature of her homeliness her coarseness her dissipated premature old age stood forth in all its horror
Susans heart contracted and her flesh crept as she glanced quickly away
But she still saw and it was many a week before she ceased to see whenever Violets name came into her mind
Burlingham too looked old and broken
Eshwell and Pat neither of whom had ever had the smallest taste of success were stolid like cornered curs taking their beating and waiting in silence for the blows to stop
Here Eshie said the manager take care of the three dollars
And he handed him the bills
Ill pay for the coffee and keep the change
Im going down to the owners of that tug and see what I can do
When he had paid they followed him out
At the curbstone he said Keep together somewhere round the wharfboat
So long
He lifted the battered hat he was wearing smiled at Susan
Cheer up Miss Sackville
Well down em yet
And away he wenta strange figure his burly frame squeezed into a dingy old frock suit from among Tempests costumes
A dreary two hours the last halfhour in a drizzling rain from which the narrow eaves of the now closed and locked wharfboat sheltered them only a little
There he comes
cried Susan and sure enough Burlingham separated from the crowd streaming along the street at the top of the levee and began to descend the slope toward them
They concentrated on his face hoping to get some indication of what to expect but he never permitted his face to betray his mind
He strode up the plank and joined them
Tempest come
he asked
Tempest
cried Mabel
Havent I told you hes jumped
Dont you suppose I know him
And you brought him into the company raged Violet
Burlingham didnt want to take him
He looked the fool and jackass he is
Why didnt you warn us he was a rotten thief too
Wasnt it for shoplifting you served six months in Joliet
retorted Mabel
You lieyou streetwalker
screamed Violet
Ladies
Ladies
said Eshwell
Thats what I say observed Pat
Im no lady replied Mabel
Im an actress
An actresshehe
jeered Violet
An actress
Shut up all of you commanded Burlingham
Ive got some money
I settled for cash
How much
cried Mabel and Violet in the same breath their quarrel not merely finished but forgotten
Three hundred dollars
For the boat and all
demanded Eshwell
Why Bob They think it was for boat and all interrupted Burlingham with his cynical smile
They set out to bully and cheat me
They knew I couldnt get justice
So I let em believe I owned the boatand Ive got fifty apiece for us
Sixty said Violet
Fifty
There are six of us
You dont count in this little Jonah here do you
cried Violet scowling evilly at Susan
Nonodont count me in begged Susan
I didnt lose anything
Mabel pinched her arm
Youre right Mr Burlingham said she
Miss Sackville ought to share
Were all in the same box
Miss Sackville will share said Burlingham
Theres going to be no skunking about this as long as Im in charge
Eshwell and Pat sided with Violet
While the rain streamed the five with Susan a horrified onlooker fought on and on about the division of the money
Their voices grew louder
They hurled the most frightful epithets at one another
Violet seized Mabel by the hair and the men interfered all but coming to blows themselves in the melee
The wharfmaster rushed from his office drove them off to the levee
They continued to yell and curse even Burlingham losing control of himself and releasing all there was of the tough and the blackguard in his nature
Two policemen came calmed them with threat of arrest
At last Burlingham took from his pocket one at a time three small rolls of bills
He flung one at each of the three who were opposing his division
Take that you dirty curs he said
And be glad Im giving you anything at all
Most managers wouldnt have come back
Come on Miss Sackville
Come on Mabel
And the two followed him up the levee leaving the others counting their shares
At the street corner they went into a general store where Burlingham bought two ninetyeightcent umbrellas
He gave Mabel one held the other over Susan and himself as they walked along
Well ladies said he we begin life again
A clean slate a fresh startas if nothing had ever happened
Susan looked at him to try to give him a grateful and sympathetic smile
She was surprised to see that so far as she could judge he had really meant the words he had spoken
Yes I mean it said he
Always look at life as it isas a game
With every deal whether you win or lose your stake growsfor your stakes your wits and you add to em by learning something with each deal
What are you going to do Mabel
Get some clothes
The water wrecked mine and this rain has finished my hat
Well go together said Burlingham
They took a car for Louisville descended before a department store
Burlingham had to fit himself from the skin out Mabel had underclothes needed a hat a dress summer shoes
Susan needed underclothes shoes a hat for she was bareheaded
They arranged to meet at the first entrance down the side street Burlingham gave Susan and Mabel each their fifty dollars and went his way
When they met again in an hour and a half they burst into smiles of delight
Burlingham had transformed himself into a jaunty fashionable young middleaged man with an air of success achieved and prosperity assured
He had put the fine finishing touch to his transformation by getting a haircut and a shave
Mabel looked like a showy chorus girl in a striped blue and white linen suit a big beflowered hat and a fluffy blouse of white chiffon
Susan had resisted Mabels entreaties had got a plain sensible linen blouse of a kind that on a pinch might be washed out and worn without ironing
Her new hat was a simple blue sailor with a dark blue band that matched her dress
I spent thirtysix dollars said Burlingham
I only spent twentytwo declared Mabel
And this child here only parted with seven of her dollars
I had no idea she was so thrifty 
And nowwhat
said Burlingham
Im going round to see a friend of mine replied Mabel
Shes on the stage too
Theres sure to be something doing at the summer places
Maybe I can ring Miss Sackville in
There ought to be a good living in those eyes of hers and those feet and ankles
Im sure I can put her next to something
Then you can give her your address said Burlingham
Why shes going with me cried Mabel
You dont suppose Id leave the child adrift
No shes going with me to a boarding house Ill find for her said Burlingham
Into Mabels face flashed the expression of the suspicion such a statement would at once arouse in a mind trained as hers had been
Burlinghams look drove the expression out of her face and suspicion at least into the background
Shes not going with your friend said Burlingham a hint of sternness in his voice
Thats bestisnt it
Miss Connemoras eyes dropped
Yes I guess it is replied she
WellI turn down this way
Well keep on and go out Chestnut Street said Burlingham
You can write to heror to mecare of the General Delivery
Thats best
You may hear from Tempest
You can write me there too
Mabel was constrained and embarrassed
Goodby Miss Sackville
Susan embraced and kissed her
Mabel began to weep
Oh its all so suddenand frightful she said
Do try to be good Lorna
You can trust Bob
She looked earnestly appealingly at him
Yes Im sure you can
Andhes right about me
Goodby
She hurried away not before Susan had seen the tears falling from her kind fastfading eyes
Susan stood looking after her
And for the first time the truth about the catastrophe came to her
She turned to Burlingham
How brave you are
she cried
Oh whatd be the use in dropping down and howling like a dog
replied he
That wouldnt bring the boat back
It wouldnt get me a job
And you shared equally when you lost the most of all
They were walking on
The boat was mine too said he in a dry reflective tone
I told em it wasnt when we started out because I wanted to get a good share for rent and so on without any kicking from anybody
The loss did not appeal to her it was the lie he had told
She felt her confidence shaking
You didnt mean toto she faltered stopped
To cheat them
suggested he
Yes I did
Soto sort of balance things up I divided equally all I got from the tug people
Whatre you looking so unhappy about
I wish you hadnt told me she said miserably
I dont see why you did
Because I dont want you making me into a saint
Im like the rest you see about in pants cheating and lying with or without pretending to themselves that theyre honest
Dont trust anybody my dear
The sooner you get over the habit the sooner youll cease to tempt people to be hypocrites
All the serious trouble Ive ever got into has come through trusting or being trusted
He looked gravely at her burst out laughing at her perplexed alarmed expression
Oh Lord it isnt as bad as all that said he
The rains stopped
Lets have breakfast
Thena new dealwith everything to gain and nothing to lose
Its a great advantage to be in a position where youve got nothing to lose
CHAPTER XVI BURLINGHAM found for her a comfortable room in a flat in West Chestnut Streeta respectable middleclass neighborhood with three churches in full view and the spires of two others visible over the housetops
Her landlady was Mrs Redding a simplehearted deaf old widow with bright kind eyes beaming guilelessness through steelframed spectacles
Mrs Redding had only recently been reduced to the necessity of letting a room
She stated her moderate priceseven dollars a week for room and boardas if she expected to be arrested for attempted extortion
I give good meals she hastened to add
I do the cooking myselfand buy the best
Im no hand for canned stuff
As for that there cold storage its no bettern slow poison and not so terrible slow at that
Anything your daughter wants Ill give her
Shes not my daughter said Burlingham and it was his turn to be red and flustered
Im simply looking after her as shes alone in the world
Im going to live somewhere else
But Ill come here for meals if youre willing maam
IId have to make that extry Im afraid pleaded Mrs Redding
Rather
exclaimed Burlingham
I eat like a pair of Percherons
How much did you calculate to pay
inquired the widow
Her one effort at price fixing though entirely successful had exhausted her courage
Burlingham was clear out of his class in those idyllic days of protector of innocence
He proceeded to be more than honest
Oh say five a week
Gracious
Thats too much protested she
I hate to charge a body for food somehow
It dont seem to be accordin to what God tells us
But I dont see no way out
Ill come for five not a cent less insisted Burlingham
I want to feel free to eat as much as I like
And it was so arranged
Away he went to look up his acquaintances while Susan sat listening to the widow and trying to convince her that she and Mr Burlingham didnt want and couldnt possibly eat all the things she suggested as suitable for a nice supper
Susan had been learning rapidly since she joined the theatrical profession
She saw why this fine old woman was getting poorer steadily was arranging to spend her last years in an almshouse
What a queer world it was
What a strange way for a good God to order things
The better you were the worse off you were
No doubt it was Burlinghams lifelong goodness of heart as shown in his generosity to her that had kept him down
It was the same way with her dead mothershe had been loving and trusting had given generously without thought of self with generous confidence in the man she lovedand had paid with reputation and life
She compelled Burlingham to take what was left of her fifty dollars
You wouldnt like to make me feel mean was the argument she used
I must put in what Ive gotthe same as you do
Now isnt that fair
And as he was dead broke and had been unable to borrow he did not oppose vigorously
She assumed that after a day or two spent in getting his bearings he would take her with him as he went looking
When she suggested it he promptly vetoed it
That isnt the way business is done in the profession said he
The staryoure the starkeeps in the background and her managerthats me does the hustling
She had every reason for believing this but as the days passed with no results sitting about waiting began to get upon her nerves
Mrs Redding had the remnant of her dead husbands library and he had been a man of broad taste in literature
But Susan ardent reader though she was could not often lose herself in books now
She was too impatient for realities too anxious about them
Burlingham remained equable neither hopeful nor gloomy he made her feel that he was strong and it gave her strength
Thus she was not depressed when on the last day of their week he said I think wed better push on to Cincinnati tomorrow
Theres nothing here and weve got to get placed before our cash gives out
In Cincinnati there are a dozen places to one in this snide town
The idea of going to Cincinnati gave her a qualm of fear but it passed away when she considered how she had dropped out of the world
They think Im dead she reflected
Anyhow Id never be looked for among the kind of people Im in with now
The past with which she had broken seemed so far away and so dim to her that she could not but feel it must seem so to those who knew her in her former life
She had such a sense of her own insignificance now that she knew something of the vastness and business of the world that she was without a suspicion of the huge scandal and excitement her disappearance had caused in Sutherland
To Cincinnati they went next day by the L and N and took two tiny rooms in the dingy old Walnut Street House at a special ratefive dollars a week for the two as a concession to the profession
Well eat in cheap restaurants and spread our capital out said Burlingham
I want you to get placed right not just placed
He bought a box of blacking and a brush instructed her in the subtle art of making a frontan art whereof he was past master as Susan had long since learned
Never let yourself look poor or act poor until you simply have to throw up the sponge said he
The world judges by appearances
Put your first money and your last into clothes
And nevernevertell a hardluck story
Always seem to be doing well and comfortably looking out for a chance to do better
The whole world runs from seedy people and whimperers
Am Ithat way
she asked nervously
Not a bit declared he
The day you came up to me in Carrollton I knew you were playing in the hardest kind of hard luck because of what I had happened to see and hearand guess
But you werent looking for pityand that was what I liked
And it made me feel you had the stuff in you
Id not waste breath teaching a whiner or a cheap skate
You couldnt be cheap if you tried
The reason I talk to you about these things is so youll learn to put the artistic touches by instinct into what you do
Youve taken too much trouble for me said the girl
Dont you believe it my dear laughed he
If I can do with you what I hopeIve an instinct that if I win out for you Ill come into my own at last
Youve taught me a lot said she
I wonder replied he
That is I wonder how much youve learned
Perhaps enough to keep younot to keep from being knocked down by fate but to get on your feet afterward
I hope soI hope so
They dropped coffee bought milk by the bottle he smuggling it to their rooms disguised as a roll of newspapers
They carried in rolls also and cut down their restaurant meals to supper which they got for twentyfive cents apiece at a bakery restaurant in Seventh Street
There is a way of resorting to these little economiesa snobbish selfdespairing waythat makes them sordid and makes the person indulging in them sink lower and lower
But Burlingham could not have taken that way
He was the adventurer born was a hardy seasoned campaigner who had never looked on life in the snobs way had never felt the impulse to apologize for his defeats or to grow haughty over his successes
Susan was an apt pupil and for the career that lay before her his instructions were invaluable
He was teaching her how to keep the craft afloat and shipshape through the worst weather that can sweep the sea of life
How do you make yourself look always neat and clean
he asked
She confessed I wash out my things at night and hang them on the inside of the shutters to dry
Theyre ready to wear again in the morning
Getting on
cried he full of admiration
They simply cant down us and they might as well give up trying
But I dont look neat sighed she
I cant iron
Nothats the devil of it laughed he
He pulled aside his waistcoat and she saw he was wearing a dickey
And my cuffs are pinned in he said
I have to be careful about raising and lowering my arms
Cant I wash out some things for you
she said then hurried on to put it more strongly
Yes give them to me when we get back to the hotel
It does help a man to feel hes clean underneath
And weve got nothing to waste on laundries
I wish I hadnt spent that fifteen cents to have my heels straightened and new steels put in them
She had sat in a cobblers while this repair to the part of her person she was most insistent upon had been effected
He laughed
A good investment that said he
Ive been noticing how you always look nice about the feet
Keep it up
The surest sign of a sloven and a failure of a moral mental and physical nogood is downattheheel
Always keep your heels straight Lorna
And never had he given her a piece of advice more to her liking
She thought she knew now why she had always been so particular about her boots and shoes her slippers and her stockings
He had given her a new confidence in herselfin a strength within her somewhere beneath the weakness she was always seeing and feeling
Not until she thought it out afterward did she realize what they were passing through what frightful days of failure he was enduring
He acted like the steadynerved gambler at life that he was
He was not one of those more or less weak losers who have to make desperate efforts to conceal a fainting heart
His heart was not fainting
He simply played calmly on feeling that the next throw was as likely to be for as against him
She kept close to her room walking about thereshe had never been much of a sitterthinking practicing the new songs he had got for hercharacter songs in which he trained her as well as he could without music or costume or any of the accessories
He also had an idea for a church scene with her in a choir boys costume singing the most moving of the simple religious songs to organ music
She from time to time urged him to take her on the rounds with him
But he stood firm giving always the same reason of the custom in the profession
Gradually perhaps by some form of that curious process of infiltration that goes on between two minds long in intimate contact the conviction came to her that the reason he alleged was not his real reason but as she had absolute confidence in him she felt that there was some good reason or he would not keep her in the backgroundand that his silence about it must be respected
So she tried to hide from him how weary and heartsick inaction was making her how hard it was for her to stay alone so many hours each day
As he watched her closely it soon dawned on him that something was wrong and after a day or so he worked out the explanation
He found a remedythe reading room of the public library where she could make herself almost content the whole day long
He began to have a haggard look and she saw he was sick was keeping up his strength with whisky
Its only this infernal summer cold I caught in the smashup he explained
I cant shake it but neither can it get me down
Id not dare fall sick
Whatd become of us
She knew that us meant only herself
Her mind had been aging rapidly in those long periods of unbroken reflection
To develop a human being leave him or her alone most of the time it is too much company too little time to digest and assimilate that keep us thoughtless and unformed until life is half over
She astonished him by suddenly announcing one evening I am a drag on you
Im going to take a place in a store
He affected an indignation so artistic that it ought to have been convincing
Im ashamed of you
he cried
I see youre losing your nerve
This was ingenious but it did not succeed
You cant deceive me any longer was her steady answer
Tell me honestcouldnt you have got something to do long ago if it hadnt been for trying to do something for me
Sure replied he too canny to deny the obvious
But what has that to do with it
If Id had a living offer Id have taken it
But at my age a man doesnt dare take certain kinds of places
Itd settle him for life
And Im playing for a really big stake and Ill win
When I get what I want for you well make as much money a month as I could make a year
Trust me my dear
It was plausible and her loss of nerve was visibly aggravating his conditionthe twitching of hands and face the terrifying brightness of his eyes of the color in the deep hollows under his cheek bones
But she felt that she must persist
How much money have we got
she asked
Oha great deal enough
You must play square with me said she
Im not a baby but a womanand your partner
Dont worry me child
Well talk about it tomorrow
How much
Youve no right to hide things from me
Youhurt me
Eleven dollars and eighty centswhen this bill for suppers paid and the waitress tipped
Ill try for a place in a store said she
Dont talk that way or think that way cried he angrily
Theres where so many people fail in life
They dont stick to their game
I wish to God Id had sense enough to break straight for Chicago or New York
But its too late now
What I lack is nervenerve to do the big bold things my brains show me I ought
His distress was so obvious that she let the subject drop
That night she lay awake as she had fallen into the habit of doing
But instead of purposeless rambling thoughts she was trying definitely to plan a search for work
Toward three in the morning she heard him tossing and mutteringfor the wall between their rooms was merely plastered laths covered with paper
She tried his door it was locked
She knocked got no answer but incoherent ravings
She roused the office and the night porter forced the door
Burlinghams gas was lighted he was sitting up in beda haggard disheveled insane man raving on and onnames of men and women she had never heardoaths disjointed sentences
Brain fever I reckon said the porter
Ill call a doctor
In a few minutes Susan was gladdened by the sight of a young man wearing the familiar pointed beard and bearing the familiar black bag
He made a careful examination asked her many questions finally said Your father has typhoid I fear
He must be taken to a hospital
But we have very little money said Susan
I understand replied the doctor marveling at the calmness of one so young
The hospital I mean is free
Ill send for an ambulance
While they were waiting beside Burlingham whom the doctor had drugged into unconsciousness with a hypodermic Susan said Can I go to the hospital and take care of him
No replied the doctor
You can only call and inquire how he is until hes well enough to see you
And how long will that be
I cant say
He hadnt the courage to tell her it would be three weeks at least perhaps six or seven
He got leave of the ambulance surgeon for Susan to ride to the hospital and he went along himself
As the ambulance sped through the dimly lighted streets with clanging bell and heavy pounding of the horses hoofs on the granite pavement Susan knelt beside Burlingham holding one of his hot hands
She was remembering how she had said that she would die for himand here it was he that was dying for her
And her heart was heavy with a load of guilt the heaviest she was ever to feel in her life
She could not know how misfortune is really the lot of human beings it seemed to her that a special curse attended her striking down all who befriended her
They dashed up to great open doors of the hospital
Burlingham was lifted was carried swiftly into the receiving room
Susan with tearless eyes bent over embraced him lingeringly kissed his fiery brow his wasted cheeks
One of the surgeons in white duck touched her on the arm
We cant delay he said
No indeed she replied instantly drawing back
She watched the stretcher on wheels go noiselessly down the corridor toward the elevator and when it was gone she still continued to look
You can come at any hour to inquire said the young doctor who had accompanied her
Now well go into the office and have the slip made out
They entered a small room divided unequally by a barrier desk behind it stood a lean coffeesallowed young man with a scrawny neck displayed to the uttermost by a standing collar scarcely taller than the band of a shirt
He directed at Susan one of those obtrusively shrewd glances which shallow people practice and affect to create the impression that they have a genius for character reading
He drew a pad of blank forms toward him wiped a pen on the mat into which his mousecolored hair was roached above his right temple
Well miss whats the patients name
Robert Burlingham
Age
I dont know
About what
II dont know
I guess he isnt very young
But I dont know
Put down forty Sim said the doctor
Very well Doctor Hamilton
Then to Susan Color white I suppose
Nativity
Susan recalled that she had heard him speak of Liverpool as his birthplace
English said she
Profession
Actor
Residence
He hasnt any
It was sunk at Jeffersonville
We stop at the Walnut Street House
Walnut Street House
Was he married or single
Single
Then she recalled some of the disconnected ravings
IIdont know
Single said the clerk
No I guess Ill put it widower
Next friend or relative
I am 
Daughter
First name
I am not his daughter 
Oh niece
Full name please
I am no relationjust hishis friend
Sim the clerk looked up sharply
Hamilton reddened glowered at him
I understand said Sim leering at her
And in a tone that reeked insinuation which quite escaped her he went on Well put your name down
What is it
Lorna Sackville
You dont look Englishnot at all the English style of beauty ehDoctor
Thats all Miss Sackville said Hamilton with a scowl at the clerk
Susan and he went out into Twelfth Street
Hamilton from time to time stole a glance of sympathy and inquiry into the sad young face as he and she walked eastward together
Hes a strong man and sure to pull through said the doctor
Are you alone at the hotel
Ive nobody but him in the world replied she
I was about to venture to advise that you go to a boarding house pursued the young man
Thank you
Ill see
Theres one opposite the hospitala reasonable place
Ive got to go to work said the girl to herself rather than to him
Oh you have a position
Susan did not reply and he assumed that she had
If you dont mind Id like to call and seeMr Burlingham
The physicians at the hospital are perfectly competent as good as there are in the city
But Im not very busy and Id be glad to go
We havent any money said the girl
And I dont know when we shall have
I dont want to deceive you
I understand perfectly said the young man looking at her with interested but respectful eyes
Im poor myself and have just started
Will they treat him well when hes got no money
As well as if he paid
And you will go and see that everythings all right
Itll be a pleasure
Under a gas lamp he took out a card and gave it to her
She thanked him and put it in the bosom of her blouse where lay all the money they hadthe eleven dollars and eighty cents
They walked to the hotel as cars were few at that hour
He did all the talkingassurances that her father could not fail to get well that typhoid wasnt anything like the serious disease it used to be and that he probably had a light form of it
The girl listened but her heart could not grow less heavy
As he was leaving her at the hotel door he hesitated then asked if she wouldnt let him call and take her to the hospital the next morning or rather later that same morning
She accepted she hoped that if he were with her she gratefully would be admitted to see Burlingham and could assure herself that he was well taken care of
The night porter tried to detain her for a little chat
Well said he its a good hospitalfor you folks with money
Of course for us poor people its different
You couldnt hire me to go there
Susan turned upon him
Why not
she asked
Oh if a mans poor or cant pay for nice quarters they treat him any old way
Yes theyre good doctors and all that
But theyre like everybody else
They dont give a darn for poor people
But your unclell be all right there
For the first time in her life Susan did not close her eyes in sleep
The young doctor was so moved by her worn appearance that he impulsively said Have you some troubles youve said nothing about
Please dont hesitate to tell me
Oh you neednt worry about me replied she
I simply didnt sleepthats all
Do they treat charity patients badly at the hospital
Certainly not declared he earnestly
Of course a charity patient cant have a room to himself
But thats no disadvantage
How much is a room
The cheapest are ten dollars a week
That includes private attendancea little better nursing than the public patients getperhaps
But reallyMiss Sackville He must have a room said Susan
You are sure you can afford it
The difference isnt He must have a room
She held out a tendollar billten dollars of the eleven dollars and eighty cents
Thisll pay for the first week
You fix it wont you
Young Doctor Hamilton hesitatingly took the money
You are quite quite sure Miss SackvilleQuite sure you can afford this extravagancefor it is an extravagance
He must have the best we can afford evaded she
She waited in the office while Hamilton went up
When he came down after perhaps half an hour he had an air of cheerfulness
Everything going nicely said he
Susans violetgray eyes gazed straight into his brown eyes and the brown eyes dropped
You are not telling me the truth said she
Im not denying hes a very sick man protested Hamilton
Is he She could not pronounce the word
Nothing like thatbelieve me nothing
He has the chances all with him
And Susan tried to believe
He will have a room
He has a room
Thats why I was so long
And Im glad he hasfor to be perfectly honest the attendancenot the treatment but the attendanceis much hetter for private patients
Susan was looking at the floor
Presently she drew a long breath rose
Well I must be going said she
And she went to the street he accompanying her
If youre going back to the hotel said he Im walking that way
No Ive got to go this way replied she looking up Elm Street
He saw she wished to be alone and left her with the promise to see Burlingham again that afternoon and let her know at the hotel how he was getting on
He went east she north
At the first corner she stopped glanced back to make sure he was not following
From her bosom she drew four business cards
She had taken the papers from the pockets of Burlinghams clothes and from the drawer of the table in his room to put them all together for safety she had found these cards the addresses of theatrical agents
As she looked at them she remembered Burlinghams having said that BlynnMaurice Blynn at Vine and Ninth Streetsmight give them something at one of the over the Rhine music halls as a last resort
She noted the address put away the cards and walked on looking about for a policeman
Soon she came to a bridge over a muddy streama little river she thought at first then remembered that it must be the canalthe Rhine as it was called because the citys huge German population lived beyond it keeping up the customs and even the language of the fatherland
She stood on the bridge watching the repulsive waters from which arose the stench of sewage watching canal boats dragged drearily by mules with harnessworn hides followed with her melancholy eyes the course of the canal under bridge after bridge through a lane of dirty noisy factories pouring out from lofty chimneys immense clouds of black smoke
It ought to have been a bright summer day but the sun shone palely through the dense clouds a sticky sooty moisture saturated the air formed a skin of oily black ooze over everything exposed to it
A policeman a big German with stupid honest face brutal yet kindly came lounging along
I beg your pardon said Susan but would you mind telling me where she had forgotten the address fumbled in her bosom for the cards showed him Blynns cardhow I can get to this
The policeman nodded as he read the address
Keep on this way ladyhe pointed his baton southuntil youve passed four streets
At the fifth street turn east
Go onetwothree fourfive streets east
Understand
Yes thank you said the girl with the politeness of deep gratitude
Youll be at Vine
Youll see the name on the street lamp
Blynns on the southwest corner
Think you can find it
Im sure I can
Im going that way continued the policeman
But youd better walk ahead
If you walked with me theyd think you was pinchedand wed have a crowd after us
And he laughed with much shaking of his fat tightly belted body
Susan contrived to force a smile though the suggestion of such a disgraceful scene made her shudder
Thank you so much
Im sure Ill find it
And she hastened on eager to put distance between herself and that awkward company
Dont mention it lady the policeman called after her tapping his baton on the rim of his helmet as a mark of elegant courtesy
She was not at ease until looking back she no longer saw the bluecoat for the intervening crowds
After several slight mistakes in the way she descried ahead of her a large sign painted on the wall of a threestory brick building MAURICE BLYNN THEATRICAL AGENT ALL KINDS OF TALENT PLACED AND SUPPLIED After some investigation she discovered back of the saloon which occupied the street floor a grimy and uneven wooden staircase leading to the upper stories
At the first floor she came face to face with a door on the glass of which was painted the same announcement she had read from the wall
She knocked timidly then louder
A shrill voice came from the interior The doors open
Come in
She turned the knob and entered a small lowceilinged room whose general grime was streaked here and there with smears of soot
It contained a small wooden table at which sprawled a freckled and undernourished office boy and a wooden bench where fretted a woman obviously of the profession
She was dressed in masses of dirty white furbelows
On her head reared a big hat above an incredible quantity of yellow hair on the hat were badly put together plumes of badly curled ostrich feathers
Beneath her skirt was visible one of her feet it was large and fat was thrust into a tiny slipper with high heel ending under the arch of the foot
The face of the actress was young and pertly pretty but worn overpainted overpowdered and underwashed
She eyed Susan insolently
Want to see the boss
said the boy
If you please murmured Susan
Business
Im looking for afor a place
The boy examined her carefully
Appointment
No sir replied the girl
Wellhell see you anyhow said the boy rising
The mass of plumes and yellow bangs and furbelows on the bench became violently agitated
Im first cried the actress
Oh you sit tight Mame jeered the boy
He opened a solid door behind him
Through the crack Susan saw busily writing at a table desk a bald fat man with a pasty skin and a veined and bulbous nose
Lady to see you said the boy in a tone loud enough for both Susan and the actress to hear
Who
What name
snapped the man not ceasing or looking up
Shes young and a queen said the boy
Shall I show her in
Yep
The actress started up
Mr Blynn she began in a loud threatening elocutionary voice
Lo Mame said Blynn still busy
No time to see you
Nothing doing
So long
But Mr Blynn Bite it off Mame ordered the boy
Walk in miss
Susan deeply colored from sympathy with the humiliated actress and from nervousness in those forbidding and ominous surroundings entered the private office
The boy closed the door behind her
The pen scratched on
Presently the man said Well my dear whats your name
With the last word the face lifted and Susan saw a seamed and pitted skin small pale blue eyes showing the white or rather the bloodshot yellow all round the iris a heavy mouth and jaw thick lips the lower lip protruded and was decorated with a blueblack spot like a blood boil as if to indicate where the incessant cigar usually rested
At first glance into Susans sweet young face the small eyes sparkled and danced traveled on to the curves of her form
Do sit down my dear said he in a grotesquely wheedling voice
She took the chair close to him as it was the only one in the little room
What can I do for you
My how fresh and pretty you are
Mr Burlingham began Susan
Ohyoure the girl Bob was talking about
He smiled and nodded at her
No wonder he kept you out of sight
He inventoried her charms again with his sensual confident glance
Bob certainly has got good taste
Hes in the hospital said Susan desperately
So Ive come to get a place if you can find me one
Hospital
Im sorry to hear that
And Mr Blynns tones had that accent of deep sympathy which get a man or woman without further evidence credit for being kindhearted whatever else he is
Yes hes very illwith typhoid said the girl
I must do something right away to help him
Thats finefine said Mr Blynn in the same effective tone
I see youre as sweet as you are pretty
Yesthats finefine
And the moisture was in the little eyes
Well I think I can do something for you
I must do something for you
Had much experienceProfessional I mean
Mr Blynn laughed at his to Susan mysterious joke
Susan smiled faintly in polite response
He rubbed his hands and smacked his lips the small eyes dancing
The moisture had vanished
Oh yes I can place you if you can do anything at all he went on
Id a done it long ago if Bob had let me see you
But he was too foxy
He ought to be ashamed of himself standing in the way of your getting on just out of jealousy
Sing or danceor both
I can sing a little I think said Susan
Now thats modest
Ever worn tights
Susan shook her head a piteous look in her violetgray eyes
Oh youll soon get used to that
And mighty well youll look in em Ill bet eh
Where did Bob get you
And when
Before she could answer he went on Lets see Ive got a date for this evening but Ill put it off
And shes a peach too
So you see what a hit youve made with me
Well have a nice little dinner at the Hotel du Rhine and talk things over
Couldnt I go to work right away
asked the girl
Sure
Ill have you put on at Schaumers tomorrow night He looked shrewdly laughingly at her with contracted eyelids
If everything goes well
Before I do anything for you I have to see what you can do for me
And he nodded and smacked his lips
Oh well have a lovely little dinner
He looked expectantly at her
You certainly are a queen
What a dainty little hand
He reached out one of his handspuffy as if it had been poisoned very white with stubby fingers
Susan reluctantly yielded her hand to his close mushy embrace
No rings
Thats a shame petty He was talking as if to a babyThatll have to be fixedyes it will my little sweetie
My how nice and fresh you are
And his great nostrils repulsively hairy within deeply pitted without sniffed as if over an odorous flower
Susan drew her hand away
What will they give me
she asked
How greedy it is
he wheedled
Well youll get plentyplenty
How much
said the girl
Is it a salary
Of course theres the regular salary
But that wont amount to much
You know how those things are
How much
Oh say a dollar a nightuntil you make a hit
Six dollars a week
Seven
This is a Sunday town
Sundays the big day
Youll have Wednesday Saturday and Sunday matinees but they dont pay for them
Seven dollars a week
And the hospital wanted ten
Couldnt I getabout fifteenor fourteen
I think I could do on fourteen
Rather
I was talking only of the salary
Youll make a good many times fifteenif you play your cards right
Its true Schaumer draws only a beer crowd
But as soon as the word flies round that youre there the boys with the boodlell flock in
Oh youll wear the sparklers all right pet
Rather slowly it was penetrating to Susan what Mr Blynn had in mind
IdId rather take a regular salary said she
I must have ten a week for him
I can live any old way
Oh come off
cried Mr Blynn with a wink
Whats your game
Anyhow dont play it on me
You understand that you cant get something for nothing
Its all very well to love your friend and be true to him
But he cant expecthell not ask you to queer yourself
That sort of thing dont go in the profession



Come now Im willing to set you on your feet give you a good start if youll play fair with meshow appreciation
Will you or wont you
You mean began Susan and paused there looking at him with grave questioning eyes
His own eyes shifted
Yes I mean that
Im a business man not a sentimentalist
I dont want love
Ive got no time for it
But when it comes to giving a girl of the right sort a square deal and a good time why youll find Im as good as there is going
He reached for her hands again his empty flabby chin bags quivering
I want to help Bob and I want to help you
She rose slowly pushing her chair back
She understood now why Burlingham had kept her in the background why his quest had been vain why it had fretted him into mortal illness
Icouldnt do that she said
Im sorry but I couldnt
He looked at her in a puzzled way
You belong to Bob dont you
No
You mean youre straighta good girl
Yes
He was half inclined to believe her so impressive was her quiet natural way in favorable contrast to the noisy protests of women posing as virtuous
Wellif thats sowhy youd better drop out of the professionand get away from Bob Burlingham
Cant I have a place withoutwhat you said
Not as pretty a girl as you
And if they aint pretty the public dont want em
Susan went to the door leading into the office
Nothe other door said Blynn hastily
He did not wish the office boy to read his defeat in Susans countenance
He got up himself opened the door into the hall
Susan passed out
Think it over said he eyes and mouth full of longing
Come round in a day or two and well have another talk
Thank you said Susan
She felt no anger against him
She felt about him as she had about Jeb Ferguson
It was not his fault it was simply the way life was livedpart of the general misery and horror of the established orderlike marriage and the rest of it
Ill treat you white urged Blynn tenderly
Ive got a soft heartthats why Ill never get rich
Any of the othersd ask more and give less
She looked at him with an expression that haunted him for several hours
Thank you
Goodby she said and went down the narrow rickety stairsand out into the confused maze of streets full of strangers
CHAPTER XVII AT the hotel again she went to Burlinghams room gathered his belongingshis suit his wellworn twicetapped shoes his one extra suit of underclothes a soiled shirt two dickeys and cuffs his whisk broom toothbrush a box of blacking the blacking brush
She made the package as compact as she couldit was still a formidable bundle both for size and weightand carried it into her room
Then she rolled into a small parcel her own possessionstwo blouses an undervest a pair of stockings a nightgownreminder of Bethlehem and her brief sip at the cup of successa few toilet articles
With the two bundles she descended to the office
I came to say she said calmly to the clerk that we have no money to pay what we owe
Mr Burlingham is at the hospitalvery sick with typhoid
Here is a dollar and eighty cents
You can have that but Id like to keep it as its all weve got
The clerk called the manager and to him Susan repeated
She used almost the same words she spoke in the same calm monotonous way
When she finished the manager a small brisk man with a large brisk beard said No
Keep the money
Id like to ask you to stay on
But we run this place for a class of people who havent much at best and keep wobbling back and forth across the line
If I broke my rule He made a furious gesture looked at the girl angrilyholding her responsible for his being in a position where he must do violence to every decent instinctMy God miss Ive got a wife and children to look after
If I ran my hotel on sympathy whatd become of them
I wouldnt take anything I couldnt pay for said Susan
As soon as I earn some money Dont worry about that interrupted the manager
He saw now that he was dealing with one who would in no circumstances become troublesome he went on in an easier tone You can stay till the house fills up
Could you give me a place to wait on table and clean up roomsor help cook
No I dont need anybody
The towns full of people out of work
You cant ask me to turn away PleaseI didnt know cried the girl
Anyhow I couldnt give but twelve a month and board continued the manager
And the workfor a lady like you A lady
She dropped her gaze in confusion
If he knew about her birth
Ill do anything
Im not a lady said she
But Ive got to have at least ten a week in cash
No such place here
The manager was glad to find the fault of uppish ideas in this girl who was making it hard for him to be businesslike
No such place anywhere for a beginner
I must have it said the girl
I dont want to discourage you but He was speaking less curtly for her expression made him suspect why she was bent upon that particular amount
I hope youll succeed
Onlydont be depressed if youre disappointed
She smiled gravely at him he bowed avoiding her eyes
She took up her bundles and went out into Walnut Street
He moved a few steps in obedience to an impulse to follow her to give her counsel and warning to offer to help her about the larger bundle
But he checked himself with the frown of his own not too prosperous affairs
It was the hottest part of the day and her way lay along unshaded streets
As she had eaten nothing since the night before she felt faint
Her face was ghastly when she entered the office of the hospital and left Burlinghams parcel
The clerk at the desk told her that Burlingham was in the same conditionand therell be probably no change one way or the other for several days
She returned to the street wandered aimlessly about
She knew she ought to eat something but the idea of food revolted her
She was fighting the temptation to go to the Commercial office Roderick Spensers office
She had not a suspicion that his kindness might have been impulse long since repented of perhaps repented of as soon as he was away from her
She felt that if she went to him he would help her
But I mustnt do it she said to herself
Not after what I did
No she must not see him until she could pay him back
Also and deeper there was a feeling that there was a curse upon her had not everyone who befriended her come to grief
She must not draw anyone else into trouble must not tangle others in the meshes of her misfortunes
She did not reason this out of course but the feeling was not the less strong because the reasons for it were vague in her mind
And there was nothing vague about the resolve to which she finally camethat she would fight her battle herself
Her unheeding wanderings led her after an hour or so to a big department store
Crowds of shoppers mussy hot and cross were pushing rudely in and out of the doors
She entered approached a welldressed bareheaded old gentleman whom she rightly placed as floorwalker inquired of him Where do they ask for work
She had been attracted to him because his was the one face within view not suggesting temper or at least bad humor
It was more than pleasant it was benign
He inclined toward Susan with an air that invited confidence and application for balm for a wounded spirit
The instant the nature of her inquiry penetrated through his pose to the man himself there was a swift change to lofty disdainthe familiar attitude of workers toward fellowworkers of what they regard as a lower class
Evidently he resented her having beguiled him by the false air of young lady into wasting upon her mere servility like himself a display reserved exclusively for patrons
It was Susans first experience of this snobbishness it at once humbled her into the dust
She had been put in her place and that place was not among people worthy of civil treatment
A girl of his own class would have flashed at him probably would have jawed him
Susan meekly submitted she was once more reminded that she was an outcast one for whom the respectable world had no place
He made some sort of reply to her question in the tone the usher of a fashionable church would use to a stranger obviously not in the same set as the habitues
She heard the tone but not the words she turned away to seek the street again
She wandered onthrough the labyrinth of streets through the crowds on crowds of strangers
Ten dollars a week
She knew little about wages but enough to realize the hopelessness of her quest
Ten dollars a weekand her own keep beside
The faces of the crowds pushing past her and jostling her made her heartsick
So much sickness and harassment and discontentso much unhappiness
Surely all these sad hearts ought to be kind to each other
Yet they were not each soul went selfishly alone thinking only of its own burden
She walked on and on thinking in this disconnected way characteristic of a good intelligence that has not yet developed order and sequence a theory of life and a purpose
It had always been her habit to walk about rather than to sit whether indoors or out
She could think better when in motion physically
When she was so tired that she began to feel weak she saw a shaded square with benches under the trees
She entered sat down to rest
She might apply to the young doctor
But no
He was poorand what chance was there of her ever making the money to pay back
No she could not take alms than alms there was no lower way of getting money
She might return to Mr Blynn and accept his offer
The man in all his physical horror rose before her
No she could not do that
At least not yet
She could entertain the idea as a possibility now
She remembered her weddingthe afternoon the night
Yes Blynns offer involved nothing so horrible as thatand she had lived through that
It would be cowardice treachery to shrink from anything that should prove necessary in doing the square thing by the man who had done so much for her
She had said she would die for Burlingham she owed even that to him if her death would help him
Had she then meant nothing but mere lying words of pretended gratitude
But Blynn was always there something else might turn up and her dollar and eighty cents would last another day or so and the ten dollars were not due for six days
No she would not go to Blynn she would wait would take his advicethink it over
A man was walking up and down the shaded alley passing and repassing the bench where she sat
She observed him saw that he was watching her
He was a young mana very young manof middle height strongly built
He had crisp short dark hair a darkish skin amiable bluegray eyes pleasing features
She decided that he was of good family was home from some college on vacation
He was wearing a silk shirt striped flannel trousers a thin serge coat of an attractive shade of blue
She liked his looks liked the way he dressed
It pleased her that such a man should be interested in her he had a frank and friendly air and her sad young heart was horribly lonely
She pretended not to notice him but after a while he walked up to her lifting his straw hat
Good afternoon said he
When he showed his strong sharp teeth in an amiable smile she thought of Sam Wrightonly this man was not weak and mean looking like her last and truest memory picture of Samindeed the only one she had not lost
Good afternoon replied she politely
For in spite of Burlinghams explanations and cautionings she was still the smalltown girl unsuspicious toward courtesy from strange men
Also she longed for someone to talk with
It had been weeks since she had talked with anyone nearer than Burlingham to her own age and breeding
Wont you have lunch with me
he asked
I hate to eat alone
She faint from hunger simply could not help obvious hesitation before saying I dont think I care for any
You havent had yourshave you
No
May I sit down
She moved along the bench to indicate that he might without definitely committing herself
He sat took off his hat
He had a clean fresh look about the neck that pleased her
She was weary of seeing grimy sweaty people and of smelling them
Also except the young doctor since Roderick Spenser left her at Carrolltown she had talked with no one of her own age and classthe class in which she had been brought up the class that after making her one of itself had cast her out forever with its mark of shame upon her
Its mark of shameburning and stinging again as she sat beside this young man
Youre sad about something
suggested he himself nearly as embarrassed as she
My friends ill
Hes got typhoid
That is bad
But hell get all right
They always cure typhoid nowadaysif its taken in time and the nursings good
Everything depends on the nursing
I had it a couple of years ago and pulled through easily
Susan brightened
He spoke so confidently that the appeal to her young credulity toward good news and the hopeful cheerful thing was irresistible
Oh yeshell be over it soon the young man went on especially if hes in a hospital where theyve got the facilities for taking care of sick people
Where is he
In the hospitalup that way
She moved her head vaguely in the direction of the northwest
Oh yes
Its a good onefor the pay patients
I suppose for the poor devils that cant payhe glanced with careless sympathy at the dozen or so tramps on benches nearbyits like all the rest of emlike the whole world for that matter
It must be awful not to have money enough to get on with I mean
Im talking about men
He smiled cheerfully
With a womanif shes prettyits different of course
The girl was so agitated that she did not notice the sly if shy hint in the remark and its accompanying glance
Said she But its a good hospital if you pay
None better
Maybe its good straight through
Ive only heard the servants talkand servants are such liars
StillId not want to trust myself to a hospital unless I could pay
I guess the common people have good reason for their horror of free wards
Nothing free is ever good
The girls face suddenly and startlingly grew almost hard so fierce was the resolve that formed within her
The money must be gotmustand would
She would try every way she could think of between now and tomorrow thenif she failed she would go to Blynn
The young man was saying Youre a stranger in town
I was with a theatrical company on a show boat
It sank
His embarrassment vanished
She saw but she did not understand that it was because he thought he had placed herand that her place was where he had hoped
You are up against it
said he
Come have some lunch
Youll feel better
The good sense of this was unanswerable
Susan hesitated no longer wondered why she had hesitated at first
WellI guess I will
And she rose with a frank childlike alacrity that amused him immensely
You dont look it but youve been about somehavent you
Rather replied she
I somehow thought you knew a thing or two
They walked west to Race Street
They were about the same height
Her costume might have been fresher might have suggested to an expert eye the passedon clothes of a richer relative but her carriage and the fine look of skin and hair and features made the defects of dress unimportant
She seemed of his classof the class comfortable well educated and wellbred
If she had been more experienced she would have seen that he was satisfied with her appearance despite the curious looking little package and would have been flattered
As it was her interest was absorbed in things apart from herself
He talked about the townthe amusements the good times to be had at the overtheRhine beer halls at the hilltop gardens at the dances in the pavilion out at the Zoo
He drew a lively and charming picture one that appealed to her healthy youth to her unsatisfied curiosity to her passionate desire to live the gay free city life of which the small town reads and dreams
You and I can go round together cant we
I havent got much but Ill not try to take your time for nothing of course
That wouldnt be square
Im sure youll have no cause to complain
What do you say
Maybe replied the girl all at once absentminded
Her brain was wildly busy with some ideas started there by his significant words by his flirtatious glances at her by his way of touching her whenever he could make opportunity
Evidently there was an alternative to Blynn
You like a good time dont you
said he
Rather
exclaimed she the violet eyes suddenly very violet indeed and sparkling
Her spirits had suddenly soared
She was acting like one of her age
With that blessed happy hopefulness of healthy youth she had put aside her sorrowsnot because she was frivolous but for the best of all reasons because she was young and superbly vital
Said she Im crazy about dancingand music
I only needed to look at your feetand anklesto know that ventured he the ankles being especially audacious
She was pleased and in youths foolish way tried to hide her pleasure by saying My feet arent exactly small
I should say not
protested he with energy
Little feet would look like the mischief on a girl as tall as you are
Yes we can have a lot of fun
They went into a large restaurant with fly fans speeding
Susan thought it very grandand it was the grandest restaurant she had ever been in
They sat downin a delightfully cool place by a window looking out on a little plot of green with a colladium a fountain some oleanders in full and fragrant bloom the young man ordered with an ease that fascinated her an elaborate lunchsoup a chicken with salad ice cream and fresh peaches
Susan had a menu in her hand and as he ordered she noted the prices
She was dazzled by his extravagancedazzled and frightenedand in a curious vague unnerving way fascinated
Moneythe thing she must have for Burlingham in whose case everything depended on the nursing
In the brief time this boy and she had been together he without making an effort to impress had given her the feeling that he was of the best city class that he knew the worldthe high world
Thus she felt that she must be careful not to show her greenness
She would have liked to protest against his extravagance but she ventured only the timid remonstrance Oh Im not a bit hungry
She thought she was speaking the truth for the ideas whirling so fast that they were dim quite took away the sense of hunger
But when the food came she discovered that she was on the contrary ravenousand she ate with rising spirits with a feeling of content and hope
He had urged her to drink wine or beer but she refused to take anything but a glass of milk and he ended by taking milk himself
He was looking more and more boldly and ardently into her eyes and she received his glances smilingly
She felt thoroughly at ease and at home as if she were back once more among her own sort of peoplewith some element of disagreeable constraint left out
Since she was an outcast she need not bother about the small restraints the girls felt compelled to put upon themselves in the company of boys
Nobody respected a bastard as they called her when they spoke frankly
So with nothing to lose she could at least get what pleasure there was in freedom
She liked it having this handsome welldressed young man making love to her in this grand restaurant where things were so good to eat and so excitingly expensive
He would not regard her as fit to associate with his respectable mother and sisters
In the casts of respectability her place was with Jeb Ferguson
She was better off clear of the whole unjust and horrible business of respectable life clear of it and free frankly in the outcast class
She had not realizedand she did not realizethat association with the players of the show boat had made any especial change in her in fact it had loosened to the sloughing point the whole skin of her conventional trainingthat surface skin which seems part of the very essence of our being until something happens to force us to shed it
Crises catastrophes may scratch that skin or cut clear through it but only the gentle steady everywhereacting pryingloose of day and night association can change it from a skin to a loose envelope ready to be shed at any moment
What are you going to do
asked the young man when the acquaintance had become a friendshipwhich was before the peaches and ice cream were served
I dont know  said the girl with the secretive instinct of selfreliance hiding the unhappiness his abrupt question set to throbbing again
Honestly Ive never met anyone that was so congenial
But maybe you dont feel that way
Then again maybe I do rejoined she forcing a merry smile
His face flushed with embarrassment but his eyes grew more ardent as he said What were you looking for when I saw you in Garfield Place
Was that Garfield Place
she asked in evasion
Yes
And he insisted What were you looking for
What were you looking for
For a pretty girl
They both laughed
And Ive found her
Im suited if you are



Dont look so serious
You havent answered my question
Im looking for work
He smiled as if it were a joke
You mean for a place on the stage
That isnt work
You couldnt work
I can see that at a glance
Why not
Oh you havent been brought up to that kind of life
Youd hate it in every way
And they dont pay women anything for work
My father employs a lot of them
Most of his girls live at home
That keeps the wages down and the others have to piece out withhe smiledone thing and another
Susan sat gazing straight before her
Ive not had much experience she finally said thoughtfully
I guess I dont know what Im about
The young man leaned toward her his face flushing with earnestness
You dont know how pretty you are
I wish my father wasnt so close with me
Id not let you ever speak of work againeven on the stage
What good times we could have
I must be going said she rising
Her whole body was alternately hot and cold
In her brain less vague now were the ideas Mabel Connemora had opened up for her
Oh bother
exclaimed he
Sit down a minute
You misunderstood me
I dont mean Im flat broke
Susan hastily reseated herself showing her confusion
I wasnt thinking of that
Thenwhat were you thinking of
I dont know she repliedtruthfully for she could not have put into words anything definite about the struggle raging in her like a battle in a fog
I often dont exactly know what Im thinking about
I somehow cantcant fit it togetheryet
Do you suppose he went on as if she had not spoken do you suppose I dont understand
I know you cant afford to let me take your time for nothing



Dont you like me a little
She looked at him with grave friendliness
Yes
Then seized with a terror which her habitual manner of calm concealed from him she rose again
Why shouldnt it be me as well as another


At least sit down till I pay the bill
She seated herself stared at her plate
Now what are you thinking about
he asked
I dont know exactly
Nothing much
The waiter brought the bill
The young man merely glanced at the total drew a small roll of money from his trousers pocket put a fivedollar note on the tray with the bill
Susans eyes opened wide when the waiter returned with only two quarters and a dime
She glanced furtively at the young man to see if he too was not disconcerted
He waved the tray carelessly aside the waiter said Thank you in a matterofcourse way dropped the sixty cents into his pocket
The waiters tip was by itself almost as much as she had ever seen paid out for a meal for two persons
Now where shall we go
asked the young man
Susan did not lift her eyes
He leaned toward her took her hand
Youre different from the sort a fellow usually finds said he
And ImIm crazy about you
Lets go said he
Susan took her bundle followed him
She glanced up the street and down
She had an impulse to say she must go away alone it was not strong enough to frame a sentence much less express her thought
She was seeing queer vivid apparently disconnected visionsBurlingham sick unto death on the stretcher in the hospital reception roomBlynn of the hideous face and loose repulsive bodythe contemptuous old gentleman in the shopodds and ends of the things Mabel Connemora had told herthe roll of bills the young man had taken from his pocket when he paidJeb Ferguson in the climax of the horrors of that wedding day and night
They went to Garfield Place turned west paused after a block or so at a little frame house set somewhat back from the street
The young man who had been as silent as shebut nervous instead of preoccupiedopened the gate in the picket fence
This is a firstclass quiet place said he embarrassed but trying to appear at ease
Susan hesitated
She must somehow nerve herself to speak of money to say to him that she needed ten dollarsthat she must have it
If she did not speakif she got nothing for Mr Burlinghamor almost nothingand probably men didnt give women muchif she were going with himto endure again the horrors and the degradation she had suffered from Mr Fergusonif it should be in vain
This nice young man didnt suggest Mr Ferguson in any way
But there was such a mystery about menthey had a way of changing soSam WrightUncle George even Mr Ferguson hadnt seemed capable of torturing a helpless girl for no reason at all We cant stand here the young man was saying
She tried to speak about the ten dollars
She simply could not force out the words
With brain in a whirl with blood beating suffocatingly into her throat and lungs but giving no outward sign of agitation she entered the gate
There was a low oldfashioned porch along the side of the house with an awning curiously placed at the end toward the street
When they ascended the steps under the awning they were screened from the street
The young man pulled a knob
A bell within tinkled faintly Susan started shivered
But the young man looking straight at the door did not see
A colored girl with a pleasant welcoming face opened stood aside for them to enter
He went straight up the stairs directly ahead and Susan followed
At the threshold the trembling girl looked round in terror
She expected to see a place like that foul close little farm bedroomfor it seemed to her that at such times men must seek some dreadful placevile dim fitting
She was in a small attractively furnished room with a bow window looking upon the yard and the street
The furniture reminded her of her own room at her uncles in Sutherland except that the brass bed was far finer
He closed the door and locked it
As he advanced toward her he said What are you seeing
Please dont look like that
Persuasively You werent thinking of mewere you
NoOh no replied she passing her hand over her eyes to try to drive away the vision of Ferguson
You look as if you expected to be murdered
Do you want to go
She forced herself to seem calm
What a coward I am
she said to herself
If I could only die for him instead of this
But I cant
And I must get money for him
To the young man she said No
IIwant to stay
Late in the afternoon when they were once more in the street he said
Id ask you to go to dinner with me but I havent enough money
She stopped short
An awful look came into her face
Dont be alarmed cried he hurried and nervous and blushing furiously
I put thethe present for you in that funny little bundle of yours under one of the folds of the nightgown or whatever it is youve got wrapped on the outside
I didnt like to hand it to you
Ive a feeling somehow that youre not regularlythat kind
Was itten dollars
she said and for all he could see she was absolutely calm
Yes replied he with a look of relief followed by a smile of amused tenderness
I cant make you out he went on
Youre a queer one
Youve had a look in your eyes all afternoonwell if I hadnt been sure you were experienced youd almost have frightened me away
Yes Ive had experience
Thethe worst said the girl
Youyou attract me awfully youve gotwell everything thats nice about a womanand at the same time theres something in your eyesAre you very fond of your friend
Hes all Ive got in the world
I suppose its his being sick that makes you look and act so queer
I dont know whats the matter with me she said slowly
Idont know
I want to see you againsoon
Whats your address
I havent any
Ive got to look for a place to live
Well you can give me the place you did live
Ill write you there Lorna
You didnt ask me my name when I asked you yours
Youve hardly said anything
Are you always quiet like this
Nonot always
At Least I havent been
No
You werent part of the time this afternoonat the restaurant
Tell me what are you thinking about all the time
Youre very secretive
Why dont you tell me
Dont you know I like you
I dont know said the girl in a slow dazed way
Idontknow
I wouldnt take your time for nothing he went on after a pause
My father doesnt give me much money but I think Ill have some more day after tomorrow
Can I see you then
I dont know
He laughed
You said that before
Day after tomorrow afternoonin the same place
No matter if its raining
Ill be there firstat three
Will you come
If I can
She made a movement to go
But still he detained her
He colored high again in the struggle between the impulses of his generous youth and the fear of being absurd with a girl he had picked up in the street
He looked at her searchingly wistfully
I know its your life butI hate to think of it he went on
Youre far too nice
I dont see how you happened to be inin this line
Still what else is there for a girl when shes up against it
Ive often thought of those thingsand I dont feel about them as most people do



Im curious about you
Youll pardon me wont you
Im afraid Ill fall in love with you if I see you often
You wont fail to come day after tomorrow
If I can
Dont you want to see me again
She did not speak or lift her eyes
You like me dont you
Still no answer
You dont want to be questioned
No said the girl
Where are you going now
To the hospital
May I walk up there with you
I live in Clifton
I can go home that way
Id rather you didnt
Thengoodbytill day after tomorrow at three
He put out his hand he had to reach for hers and take it
Youre notnot angry with me
No
His eyes lingered tenderly upon her
You are so sweet
You dont know how I want to kiss you
Are you sorry to gosorry to leave mejust a little


I forgot
You dont like to be questioned
Well goodby dear
Goodby she said and still without lifting her gaze from the ground she turned away walked slowly westward
She had not reached the next street to the north when she suddenly felt that if she did not sit she would drop
She lifted her eyes for an instant to glance furtively round
She saw a house with stone steps leading up to the front doors there was a for rent sign in one of the closeshuttered parlor windows
She seated herself supported the upper part of her weary body by resting her elbows on her knees
Her bundle had rolled to the sidewalk at her feet
A passing man picked it up handed it to her with a polite bow
She looked at him vaguely took the bundle as if she were not sure it was hers
Heat been too much for you miss
asked the man
She shook her head
He lingered talking volublyabout the weatherthen about how cool it was on the hilltops
We might go up to the Bellevue he finally suggested if youve nothing better to do
No thank you she said
Ill go anywhere you like
Ive got a little money that I dont care to keep
She shook her head
I dont mean anything bad he hastened to suggestbecause that would bring up the subject in discussable form
I cant go with you said the girl drearily
Dont bother me please
Ohexcuse me
And the man went on
Susan turned the bundle over in her lap thrust her fingers slowly and deliberately into the fold of the soiled blouse which was on the outside
She drew out the money
A ten and two fives
Enough to keep his room at the hospital for two weeks
No for she must live herself
Enough to give him a room one week longer and to enable her to live two weeks at least



And day after tomorrowmore
Perhaps soonenough to see him through the typhoid
She put the money in her bosom rose and went on toward the hospital
She no longer felt weary and the sensation of a wound that might ache if she were not so numb passed away
A clerk she had not seen before was at the barrier desk
I came to ask how Mr Burlingham is said she
The clerk yawned drew a large book toward him
BurlinghamBBuBur he said half to himself turning over the leaves
Yeshere he is
He looked at her
You his daughter
No Im a friend
Ohthenhe died at five oclockan hour ago
He looked upsaw her eyesonly her eyes
They were a deep violet now large shining with tragic softnesslike the eyes of an angel that has lost its birthright through no fault of its own
He turned hastily away awed terrified ashamed of himself
CHAPTER XVIII THE next thing she knew she felt herself seized strongly by the arm
She gazed round in a dazed way
She was in the streethow she got there she had no idea
The grip on her armit was the young doctor Hamilton
I called you twice explained he but you didnt hear
He is dead said she
Hamilton had a clear view of her face now
There was not a trace of the child left
He saw her eyesquiet lonely violet stars
You must go and rest quietly  he said with gentleness
You are worn out
Susan took from her bosom the twenty dollars handed it to him
It belongs to him said she
Give it to them to bury him
And she started on
Where are you going
asked the young man
Susan stopped looked vaguely at him
Goodby she said
Youve been very kind
Youve found a boarding place
Oh Im all right
You want to see him
No
Then hell always be alive to me
You had better keep this money
The city will take care of the funeral
It belong to him
I couldnt keep it for myself
I must be going
Shant I see you again
Ill not trouble you
Let me walk with you as far as your place
Im not feelingjust right
If you dont mindpleaseId rather be alone
I dont mean to intrude but Im all right said the girl
Dont worry about me
But you are too young Ive been married



Thank you butgoodby
He could think of no further excuse for detaining her
Her manner disquieted him yet it seemed composed and natural
Probably she had run away from a good home was now sobered and chastened was eager to separate herself from the mess she had got into and return to her own sort of people
It struck him as heartless that she should go away in this fashion but on second thought he could not associate heartlessness with her
Also he saw how there might be something in what she had said about not wishing to have to think of her friend as dead
He stood watching her straight narrow young figure until it was lost to view in the crowd of people going home from work
Susan went down Elm Street to Garfield Place seated herself on one of the benches
She was within sight of the unobtrusive little house with the awnings but she did not realize it
She had no sense of her surroundings of the passing of time felt no grief no sensation of any kind
She simply sat her little bundle in her lap her hands folded upon it
A man in uniform paused before her
Closingup time he said sharply but in the impartial official way
Im going to lock the gates
She looked at him
In a softer apologetic tone he said Ive got to lock the gates
Thats the law miss
She did not clearly understand but rose and went out into Race Street
She walked slowly along not knowing or caring where
She walkedwalkedwalked
Sometimes her way lay through crowded streets again through streets deserted
Now she was stumbling over the uneven sidewalks of a poor quarter again it was the smooth flagstones of the shopping or wholesale districts
Several times she saw the river with its multitude of boats great and small several times she crossed the canal
Twice she turned back because the street was mounting the hills behind the citythe hills with the cars swiftly ascending and descending the inclined planes and at the crests gayly lighted pavilions where crowds were drinking and dancing
Occasionally some man spoke to her but desisted as she walked straight on apparently not hearing
She rested from time to time on a stoop or on a barrel or box left out by some shopkeeper or leaning upon the rail of a canal bridge
She was walking with a purposeto try to scatter the dense fog that had rolled in and enveloped her mind and then to try to think
She sat or rather dropped down from sheer fatigue in that cool hour which precedes the dawn
It happened to be the steps of a church
She fell into a doze was startled back to consciousness by the deep boom of the bell in the steeple it made the stone vibrate under her
Onetwothreefour
Toward the east there shone a flush of light not yet strong enough to dim the stars
The sky above her was clear
The pall of smoke rolled away
The air felt clean and fresh even had in it a reminiscence of the green fields whence it had come
She began to revive like a sleeper shaking off drowsiness and the spell of a bad dream and looking forward to the new day
The fog that had swathed and stupefied her brain seemed to have lifted
At her heart there was numbness and a dull throbbing an ache but her mind was clear and her body felt intensely hopelessly alive and ready clamorously ready for food
A movement across the narrow street attracted her attention
A cellar door was risingthrust upward by the shoulders of a man
It fell full open with a resounding crash the man revealed by the light from beneatha white blouse a white cap
Toward her wafted the delicious odor of baking bread
She rose hesitated only an instant crossed the street directly toward the baker who had come up to the surface for cool air
I am hungry said she to him
Cant you let me have something to eat
The manhe had a large smooth florid face eyed her in amused astonishment
Whered you jump from
he demanded
I was resting on the church steps over there
The smell came to me andI couldnt stand it
I can pay
Oh thats all right said the man with a strong German accent
Come down
And he descended the steps she following
It was a large and lofty cellar paved with cement floor ceilings walls were whitened with flour
There were long clean tables for rolling the dough big wooden bowls farther back the ovens and several bakers at work adding to the huge piles of loaves the huge baskets of rolls
Susans eyes glistened her white teeth showed in a delightful smile of hunger about to be satisfied
Do you want bread or rolls
asked the German
Then without waiting for her to answer I guess some of the sweet rolls we call em would about suit a lady
Yesthe sweet rolls said the girl
The baker fumbled about behind a lot of empty baskets found a sewing basket filled it with small rollssome crescent in shape some like lady fingers some oval some almost like biscuit all with pulverized sugar powdered on them thick as a frosting
He set the little basket upon an empty kneading table
Wait yet a minute he commanded and bustled up a flight of stairs
He reappeared with a bottle of milk and a piece of fresh butter
He put these beside the basket of rolls drew a stool up before them
Hows that
asked he his hands on his hips his head on one side and his big jolly face beaming upon her
Pretty good dont it
Susan was laughing with pleasure
He pointed to the place well down in the bottle of milk where the cream ended
Thats the way it should be alwaysnot so
said he
She nodded
Then he shook the bottle to remix the separated cream and milk
So
he cried
Then Ach dummer Esel he muttered striking his brow a resounding thwack with the flat of his hand
A knife
And he hastened to repair that omission
Susan sat at the table took one of the fresh rolls spread butter upon it
The day will never come for her when she cannot distinctly remember the first bite of the little sweet buttered roll eaten in that air perfumed with the aroma of baking bread
The milk was as fine as it promised to be she drank it from the bottle
The German watched her a while then beckoned to his fellow workmen
They stood round reveling in the joyful sight of this pretty hungry girl eating so happily and so heartily
The pie whispered one workman to another
They brought a small freshly baked peach pie light and crisp and brown
Susans beautiful eyes danced
But she said to her first friend among the bakers Im afraid I cant afford it
At this there was a loud chorus of laughter
Eat it said her friend
And when she had finished her rolls and butter she did eat it
I never tasted a pie like that declared she
And I like pies and can make them too
Once more they laughed as if she had said the wittiest thing in the world
As the last mouthful of the pie was disappearing her friend said Another
Goodness no
cried the girl
I couldnt eat a bite more
But its an apple pie
And he brought it holding it on his big florid fat hand and turning it round to show her its full beauty
She sighed regretfully
I simply cant she said
How much is what Ive had
Her friend frowned
Vot you take me forhey
demanded he with a terrible frownso terrible he felt it to be that fearing he had frightened her he burst out laughing to reassure
Oh but I must pay she pleaded
I didnt come begging
Not a cent
said her friend firmly
Im the boss
I wont take it
She insisted until she saw she was hurting his feelings
Then she tried to thank him but he would not listen to that either
Goodbygoodby he said gruffly
I must get to work once
But she understood and went with a light heart up into the world again
He stood waist deep in the cellar she hesitated upon the sidewalk
Goodby she said with swimming eyes
You dont know how good youve been to me
All right
Luck
He waved his hand half turned his back on her and looked intently up the street his eyes blinking
She went down the street turned the first corner dropped on a doorstep and sobbed and cried out of the fullness of her heart
When she rose to go on again she felt stronger and gentler than she had felt since her troubles began with the quarrel over Sam Wright
A little further on she came upon a florists shop in front of which a wagon was unloading the supply of flowers for the days trade
She paused to look at the roses and carnations the lilies and dahlias the violets and verbenas and geraniums
The fast brightening air was scented with delicate odors
She was attracted to a small geranium with many buds and two fullblown crimson flowers
How much for that
she asked a young man who seemed to be in charge
He eyed her shrewdly
Well I reckon about fifteen cents replied he
She took from her bosom the dollar bill wrapped round the eighty cents gave him what he had asked
No you neednt tie it up said she as he moved to take it into the store
She went back to the bakeshop
The cellar door was open but no one was in sight
Stooping down she called Mr Baker
Mr
Baker
The big smooth face appeared below
She set the plant down on the top step
For you she said and hurried away
On a passing street car she saw the sign Eden Park
She had heard of itof its beauties of the wonderful museum there
She took the next car of the same line
A few minutes and it was being drawn up the inclined plane toward the lofty hilltops
She had thought the air pure below
She was suddenly lifted through a dense vaporthe cloud that always lies over the lower part of the city
A moment and she was above the cloud was being carried through the wide clean treelined avenue of a beautiful suburb
On either side lawns and gardens and charming houses a hush brooding over them
Behind these walls in comfortable beds amid the surroundings that come to mind with the word home lay many girls such as shehappy secure sheltered
Girls like herself
A wave of homesickness swept over her daunting her for a little while
But she fought it down watched what was going on around her
I mustnt look backI mustnt
Nothing there for me
At the main gateway of the park she descended
There indeed was the to her vast building containing the treasures of art but she had not come for that
She struck into the first bypath sought out a grassy slope thickly studded with bushes and laid herself down
She spread her skirts carefully so as not to muss them
She put her bundle under her head
When she awoke the moon was shining upon her faceshining from a starry sky
She sat up looked round in wonder
Yesit was night againvery still very beautiful and warm with the air fragrant and soft
She felt intensely awake entirely restedand full of hope
It was as if during that long dreamless sleep her whole being had been renewed and magically borne away from the lands of shadow and pain where it had been wandering to a land of bright promise
Oh youth youth that bears so lightly the burden of the past that faces so confidently the mystery of the future
She listenedheard a faint sound that moved her to investigate
Peering through the dense bushes she discovered on the grass in the shadow of the next clump a ragged dirty man and woman both sound asleep and snoring gently
She watched them spellbound
The mans face was deeply shaded by his battered straw hat
But she could see the womans face plainlythe thin white hair the sunken eyes and mouth the skeleton look of old features over which the dry skin of age is tightly drawn
She gazed until the man moving in his sleep kicked out furiously and uttered a curse
She drew back crawled away until she had put several clumps of bushes between her and the pair
Then she sped down and up the slopes and did not stop until she was where she could see far below the friendly lights of the city blinking at her through the smoky mist
She had forgotten her bundle
She did not know how to find the place where she had left it and had she known she would not have dared return
This loss however troubled her little
Not in vain had she dwelt with the philosopher Burlingham
She seated herself on a bench and made herself comfortable
But she no longer needed sleep
She was awakewide awakein every atom of her vigorous young body
The minutes dragged
She was impatient for the dawn to give the signal for the future to roll up its curtain
She would have gone down into the city to walk about but she was now afraid the police would take her inand that probably would mean going to a reformatory for she could not give a satisfactory account of herself
True her older way of wearing her hair and some slight but telling changes in her dress had made her look less the child
But she could not hope to pass for a woman full grown
The moon set the starlight was after a long long time succeeded by the dawn of waking birds and of waking city toofor up from below rose an ever louder roar like a rising storm
In her restless rovings she came upon a fountain she joined the birds making a toilet in its basin and patterned after themwashed her face and hands dried them on a handkerchief she by great good luck had put into her stocking smoothed her hair her dress
And still the sense of unreality persisted cast its friendly spell over this childwoman suddenly caught up from the quietest of quiet lives and whirled into a dizzy vortex of strange events without parallel or similitude even in anything she had ever known
If anyone had suddenly asked her who she was and she had tried to recall she would have felt as if trying to remember a dream
Sutherlanda faint faint dream and the show boat also
Spensera romantic dreamor a first installment of a lovestory read in some stray magazine
Burlinghamthe theatrical agentthe young man of the previous afternoonthe news of the death that left her quite aloneall a dream a tumbled jumbled dream all passed with the night and the awakening
In her youth and perfect health refreshed by the long sleep gladdened by the bright new day she was as irresponsible as the merry birds chattering and flinging the water about at the opposite side of the fountains basin
She was now glad she had lost her bundle
Without it her hands were free both hands free to take whatever might offer next
And she was eager to see what that would be and hopeful about itnomore than hopeful confident
Burlingham aided by those highly favorable surroundings of the show boat and of the vagabond life thereafter had developed in her that gamblers spirit which had enabled him to play year after year of losing hands with unabating couragethe spirit that animates all the brave souls whose deeds awe the docile conventional craven masses of mankind
Leisurely as a truant she tramped back toward the city pausing to observe anything that chanced to catch her eye
At the moment of her discovery of the difference between her and most girls there had begun a cleavage between her and the social system
And now she felt as if she were of one race and the rest of the world of another and hostile race
She did not realize it but she had taken the first great step along the path that leads to distinction or destruction
For the world either obeys or tramples into dust those who in whatever way have a lot apart from the common
She was free from the bonds of conventionfree to soar or to sink
Her way toward the city lay along a slowly descending street that had been not so very long before a country road
Block after block there were grassy fields intersected by streets as if city had attempted a conquest of country and had abandoned it
Again the vacant lots were disfigured with the ruins of a shanty or by dreary dump heaps
For long stretches the way was built up only on one side
The houses were for the most part tenement with small and unprosperous shops or saloons on the ground floor
Toward the foot of the hill where the line of tenements was continuous on either side she saw a sign Restaurant projecting over the sidewalk
When she reached it she paused and looked in
A narrow window and a narrow open door gave a full view of the tiny room with its two rows of plain tables
Near the window was a small counter with a case containing cakes and pies and rolls
With back to the window sat a pretty towheaded girl of about her own age reading
Susan close to the window saw that the book was Owen Merediths Lucile one of her own favorites
She could even read the words The ways they are many and wide and seldom are two ways the same
She entered
The girl glanced up with eyes slowly changing from faraway dreaminess to present and practicalpleasant blue eyes with lashes and brows of the same color as the thick neatly done yellowish hair
Could I get a glass of milk and a roll
asked Susan a modest demand indeed on behalf of a growing girls appetite twentyfour hours unsatisfied
The blonde girl smiled showing a clean mouth with excellent teeth
We sell the milk for five cents the rolls three for a nickel
Then Ill take milk and three rolls said Susan
May I sit at a table
Ill not spoil it
Sure
Sit down
Thats what the tables are for
And the girl closed the book putting a chromo card in it to mark her place and stirred about to serve the customer
Susan took the table nearest the door took the seat facing the light
The girl set before her a plate a knife and fork a little form of butter a tall glass of milk and three small rolls in a large saucer
Youre up and out early
she said to Susan
On one of those inexplicable impulses of frankness Susan replied Ive been sleeping in the park
The girl had made the remark merely to be polite and was turning away
As Susans reply penetrated to her inattentive mind she looked sharply at her eyes opening wonderingly
Did you get lost
Are you a stranger in town
Why didnt you ask someone to take you in
The girl reflected realized
Thats so said she
I never thought of it before



Yes that is so
It must be dreadful not to have any place to go
She gazed at Susan with admiring eyes
Werent you afraidup in the park
No replied Susan
I hadnt anything anybodyd want to steal
But some man might have The girl left it to Susans imagination to finish the sentence
I hadnt anything to steal repeated Susan with a kind of cynical melancholy remotely suggestive of Mabel Connemora
The restaurant girl retired behind the counter to reflect while Susan began upon her meager breakfast with the deliberation of one who must coax a little to go a great ways
Presently the girl said Where are you going to sleep tonight
Oh thats a long ways off replied the apt pupil of the happygolucky houseboat show
Ill find a place I guess
The girl looked thoughtfully toward the street
I was wondering she said after a while what Id do if I was to find myself out in the street with no money and nowhere to go



Are you looking for something to do
Do you know of anything
asked Susan interested at once
Nothing worth while
Theres a box factory down on the next square
But only a girl that lives at home can work there
Pa says the days coming when womenll be like menwork at everything and get the same wages
But it isnt so now
A girls got to get married
Such a strange expression came over Susans face that the waitress looked apologetic and hastened to explain herself I dont much mind the idea of getting married said she
OnlyIm afraid I can never get the kind of a man Id want
The boys round here leave school before the girls so the girls are better educated
And then they feel above the boys of their own classexcept those boys thatre beginning to get up in the worldand those kind of boys want some girl whos above them and can help them up
Its dreadful to be above the people you know and not good enough for the people youd like to know
Susan was not impressed she could not understand why the waitress spoke with so much feeling
Well said she pausing before beginning on the last roll I dont care so long as I find something to do
Theres another thing complained the waitress
If you work in a store you cant get wages enough to live on and you learn things and want to live better and better all the time
It makes you miserable
And you cant marry the men who work at nice refined labor because they dont make enough to marry on
And if you work in a factory or as a servant why all but the commonest kind of men look down on you
You may get wages enough to live on but you cant marry or get up in the world
Youre very ambitious arent you
Indeed I am
I dont want to be in the working class
She was leaning over the counter now and her blond face was expressing deep discontent and scorn
I hate working people
All of them who have any sense look down on themselves and wish they could get something respectable to do
Oh you dont mean that protested Susan
Any kind of works respectable if its honest
You can say that retorted the girl
You dont belong in our class
You were brought up different
You are a lady
Susan shrank and grew crimson
The other girl did not see
She went on crossly Upperclass people always talk about how fine it is to be an honest workingman
But thats all rot
Let em try it a while
And pa says itll never be straightened out till everybody has to work
Whatwhat does your father do
He was a cabinetmaker
Then one of the other men tipped over a big chest and his right hand was crushedsmashed to pieces so he wasnt able to work any more
But hes mighty smart in his brains
Its the kind you cant make any money out of
He has read most everything
The trouble with pa was he had too much heart
He wasnt mean enough to try and get ahead of the other workmen and rise to be a boss over them and grind them down to make money for the proprietor
So he stayed on at the benchhe was a firstclass cabinetmaker
The better a man is as a workman and the nicer he is as a man the harder it is for him to get up
Pa was too good at his tradeand too softhearted
Wont you have another glass of milk
Nothank you said Susan
She was still hungry but it alarmed her to think of taking more than ten cents from her hoard
Are you going to ask for work at the box factory
Im afraid they wouldnt take me
I dont know how to make boxes
Oh thats nothing assured the restaurant girl
Its the easiest kind of work
But then an educated person can pick up most any trade in a few days well enough to get along
Theyll make you a paster at first
How much does that pay
Hell offer you two fifty a week but you must make him give you three
Thats right for beginners
Then if you stay on and work hard youll be raised to four after six months
The highest pays five
Three dollars said Susan
How much can I rent a room for
The restaurant girl looked at her pityingly
Oh you cant afford a room
Youll have to club in with three other girls and take a room together and cook your meals yourselves turn about
Susan tried not to show how gloomy this prospect seemed
Ill try said she
She paid the ten cents her new acquaintance went with her to the door pointed out the huge bare wooden building displaying in great letters J C Matson Paper Boxes
You apply at the office said the waitress
Therell be a fat blackcomplected man in his shirt with his suspenders let down off his shoulders
Hell be fresh with you
He used to be a working man himself so he hasnt any respect for working people
But he doesnt mean any harm
He isnt like a good many he lets his girls alone
Susan had not got far when the waitress came running after her
Wont you come back and let me know how you made out
she asked a little embarrassed
I hope you dont think Im fresh
Ill be glad to come Susan assured her
And their eyes met in a friendly glance
If you dont find a place to go why not come in with me
Ive got only a very little bit of a room but its as big and a lot cleaner than any youll find with the factory girls
But I havent any money said Susan regretfully
And I couldnt take anything without paying
You could pay two dollars and a half a week and eat in with us
We couldnt afford to give you much for that but itd be better than what youd get the other way
But you cant afford to do that
The restaurant girls mind was aroused was working fast and well
You can help in the restaurant of evenings she promptly replied
Ill tell ma youre so pretty youll draw trade
And Ill explain that you used to go to school with meand have lost your father and mother
My names Etta Brashear
MinesLorna Sackville said Susan blushing
Ill come after a while and well talk about what to do
I may not get a place
Oh youll get it
He has hard work finding girls
Factories usually pay more than stores because the works more looked down onthough Lord knows its hard to think how anything could be more looked down on than a saleslady
I dont see why you bother about those things
What do they matter
Why everybody bothers about them
But you dont understand
You were born a lady and youll always feel youve got social standing and peoplell feel that way too
But I wasnt said Susan earnestly
Indeed I wasnt
I was bornaa nobody
I cant tell you but Im just nobody
I havent even got a name
Etta as romantic as the next young girl was only the more fascinated by the now thrillingly mysterious strangerso pretty so sweet with such beautiful manners and strangely outcast no doubt from some family of high folks
Youll be sure to come
You wont disappoint me
Susan kissed Etta
Etta embraced Susan her cheeks flushed her eyes brilliant
Ive taken an awful fancy to you she said
I havent ever had an intimate lady friend
I dont care for the girls round here
Theyre so fresh and common
Ma brought me up refined shes not like the ordinary workingclass woman
It hurt Susan deeplywhy she could not have quite explainedto hear Etta talk in this fashion
And in spite of herself her tone was less friendly as she said Ill come when I find out
CHAPTER XIX IN the office of the factory Susan found the man Etta described
He was seated or rather was sprawled before an open and overflowing rolltop desk his collar and cuffs off and his coat and waistcoat also
His feetbroad thick feet with knots at the great toe joints bulging his shoeswere hoisted upon the leaf of the desk
Susans charms of person and manners so wrought upon him that during the exchange of preliminary questions and answers he slowly took down first one foot then the other and readjusted his once muscular but now loose and pudgy body into a less loaferish posture
He was as unconscious as she of the cause and meaning of these movements
Had he awakened to what he was doing he would probably have been angered against himself and against her and the direction of Susan Lenoxs life would certainly have been changed
Those who fancy the human animal is in the custody of some conscious and predetermining destiny think with their vanity rather than with their intelligence
A careful look at any day or even hour of any life reveals the inevitable influence of sheer accidents most of them trivial
And these accidents often the most trivial most powerfully determine not only the direction but also the degree and kind of forcewhat characteristics shall develop and what shall dwindle
You seem to have a nut on you said the box manufacturer at the end of the examination
Ill start you at three
Susan thus suddenly placed in the world and ticketed with a real value was so profoundly excited that she could not even make a stammering attempt at expressing gratitude
Do your work well continued Matson and youll have a good steady job with me till you get some nice young fellow to support you
Stand the boys off
Dont let em touch you till youre engagedand not much then till the preachers said the word
Thank you said Susan trying to look grave
She was fascinated by his curious habit of scratching himself as he talkedhead ribs arm legs the backs of his red hairy hands
Stand em off pursued the boxmaker scratching his ribs and nodding his huge head vigorously
Thats the way my wife got me
Its pull Dick pull devil with the gals and the boys
And the gal thats stiff with the men gets a home while her that aint goes to the streets
I always gives my gals a word of good advice
And many a one Ive saved
Theres mighty few preachers does as much good as me
When can you go to work
Susan reflected
With heightened color and a slight stammer she said Ive got something to do this afternoon if youll let me
Can I come in the morning
Seven sharp
We take off a cent a minute up to a quarter of an hour
If youre later than that you get docked for the day
And no excuses
I didnt climb to the top from spittoon cleaner in a saloon fifteen years ago by being an easy mark for my hands
Ill come at seven in the morning said Susan
Do you live far
Im going to live just up the street
Thats right
It adds ten cents a day to your wagesthe ten youll save in carfare
Sixty cents a week
And Matson beamed and scratched as if he felt he had done a generous act
Who are you livin with
Respectable I hope
With Miss BrashearI think
Oh yesTom Brashears gal
Theyre nice people
Toms an honest fellowused to make good money till he had his hard luck
Him and me used to work together
But he never could seem to learn that it aint workin for yourself but makin others work for you that climbs a man up
I never was much as a worker
I was always thinkin out ways of makin people work for me
And here I am at the top
And wheres Tom
Wellrun along nowwhats your name
Lorna Sackville
Lorny
He burst into a loud guffaw
Lord what a name
Sounds like a theayter
Seven sharp Lorny
So long
Susan nodded with laughing eyes thanked him and departed
She glanced up the street saw Etta standing in the door of the restaurant
Etta did not move from her own doorway though she was showing every sign of anxiety and impatience
I cant leave even for a minute so near the dinner hour she explained when Susan came or Id a been outside the factory
And mas got to stick to the kitchen
I see you got a job
How much
Three replied Susan
He must have offered it to you said Etta laughing
I thought about it after you were gone and I knew youd take whatever he said first
Oh Ive been so scared somethingd happen
I do want you as my lady friend
Was he fresh
Not a bit
He wasvery nice
Well he ought to be niceas pa says getting richer and richer and driving the girls he robs to marry men they hate or to pick up a living in the gutter
Susan felt that she owed her benefactor a strong protest
Maybe Im foolish said she but Im awful glad hes got that place and can give me work
Etta was neither convinced nor abashed
You dont understand things in our class replied she
Pa says it was the kind of grateful thinking and talking youve just done thats made him poor in his old age
He says youve either got to whip or be whipped rob or be robbedand that the really good honest people are the fools who take the losing side
But he says too hed rather be a fool and a failure than stoop to stamping on his fellowbeings and robbing them
And I guess hes rightthere Etta laughedthough Ill admit Id hate to be tempted with a chance to get up by stepping on somebody
She sighed
And sometimes I cant help wishing pa had done some tramping and stamping
Why not
Thats all most people are fit forto be tramped and stamped on
Now dont look so shocked
You dont understand
Wait till youve been at work a while
Susan changed the subject
Im going to work at seven in the morning



I might as well have gone today
I had a kind of an engagement I thought I was going to keep but Ive about decided I wont
Etta watched with awe and delight the mysterious look in Susans suddenly flushed face and abstracted eyes
After a time she ventured to interrupt with Youll try living with us
If youre quite suredid you talk to your mother
Motherll be crazy about you
She wants anything thatll make me more contented
Oh I do get so lonesome
Mrs Brashear a spare woman much bent by monotonous workwhich however had not bent her courage or her cheerfulnessmade Susan feel at home immediately in the little flat
The tenement was of rather a superior class
But to Susan it seemed full of noisome smells and she was offended by the halls littered with evidences of the uncleanness of the tenants
She did not then realize that the apparent superior cleanness and neatness of the betteroff classes was really in large part only affected that their secluded back doors and back ways gave them opportunity to hide their uncivilized habits from the world that saw only the front
However once inside the Brashear flat she had an instant rise of spirits
Isnt this nice
exclaimed she as Etta showed her at a glance from the sittingroom the five small but scrupulously clean rooms
Ill like it here
Etta reddened glanced at her for signs of mockery saw that she was in earnest
Im afraid its better to look at than to live in she began then decided against saying anything discouraging
It seems cramped to us said she after the house we had till a couple of years ago
I guess well make out somehow
The family paid twenty dollars a month for the flat
The restaurant earned twelve to fifteen a week and the son Ashbel stocky powerful and stupid had a steady job as porter at ten a week
He gave his mother seven as he had a room to himself and an enormous appetite
He talked of getting married if he did marry the family finances would be in disorder
But his girl had high ideas being the daughter of a grocer who fancied himself still an independent merchant though he was in fact the even more poorly paid selling agent of the various food products trusts
She had fixed twenty a week as the least on which she would marry his prospects of any such raise wereluckily for his familyextremely remote for he had nothing but physical strength to sell and the price of physical strength alone was going down under immigrant competition not only in actual wages like any other form of wage labor but also in nominal wages
Altogether the Brashears were in excellent shape for a tenement family were better off than upwards of ninety per cent of the families of prosperous and typical Cincinnati
While it was true that old Tom Brashear drank it was also true that he carefully limited himself to two dollars a week
While it was true that he could not work at his trade and apparently did little but sit round and talkusually high above his audiencenevertheless he was the actual head of the family and its chief breadwinner
It was his savings that were invested in the restaurant he bought the supplies and was shrewd and intelligent about that vitally important department of the businessthe department whose mismanagement in domestic economy is next to drink the main cause of failure and pauperism of sickness of premature disability of those profound discouragements that lead to despair
Also old Brashear had the sagacity and the nagging habit that are necessary to keeping people and things up to the mark
He had ideaspractical ideas as well as idealsfar above his station
But for him the housekeeping would have been in the familiar tenement fashion of slovenliness and filth and the family would have been neat only on Sundays and only on the surface then
Because he had the habit of speaking of himself as useless as done for as a drag as one lingering on when he ought to be dead his family and all the neighborhood thought of him in that way
Although intelligence indeed virtue of every kind is expected of tenement house peopleand is needed by them beyond any other condition of humanitythey are unfortunately merely human are tainted of all human weaknesses
They lack for instance discrimination
So it never occurred to them that Tom Brashear was the sole reason why the Brashears lived better than any of the other families and yielded less to the ferocious and incessant downward pressure
But for one thing the Brashears would have been going up in the world
That thing was old Toms honesty
The restaurant gave good food and honest measure
Therefore the margin of profit was narrowtoo narrow
He knew what was the matter
He mocked at himself for being such a weak fool when everybody else with the opportunity and the intelligence was getting on by yielding to the compulsion of the iron rule of dishonesty in business
But he remained honesttherefore remained in the working class instead of rising among its exploiters
If I didnt drink Id kill myself said old Tom to Susan when he came to know her well and to feel that from her he could get not the mere blind admiration the family gave him but understanding and sympathy
Whenever anybody in the working class has any imagination he explained he either kicks his way out of it into capitalist or into criminalor else he takes to drink
I aint mean enough to be either a capitalist or a criminal
So Ive got to drink
Susan only too soon began to appreciate from her own experience what he meant
In the first few days the novelty pleased her made her think she was going to be contented
The new friends and acquaintances different from any she had known the new sights the new way of livingall this interested her even when it shocked one or many of her senses and sensibilities
But the novelty of folding and pasting boxes of the queer new kind of girls who worked with her hardly survived into the second week
She saw that she was among a people where the highest known standardthe mode of life regarded by them as the acme of elegance and blissthe best they could conceive was far far below what she had been brought up to believe the scantest necessities of respectable and civilized living
She saw this life from the inside nowas the comfortable classes never permit themselves to see it if they can avoid
She saw that to be a contented working girl to look forward to the prospect of being a workingmans wife a tenement housekeeper and mother a woman must have been born to itand born with little brainsmust have been educated for it and for nothing else
Etta was bitterly discontented yet after all it was a vague endurable discontent
She had simply heard of and dreamed of and from afar offchiefly through novels and poems and the theaterhad glimpsed a life that was broader that had comfort and luxury people with refined habits and manners
Susan had not merely heard of such a life she had lived itit and no other
Always of the thoughtful temperament she had been rapidly developed first by Burlingham and now by Tom Brashearhad been taught not only how to think but also how to gather the things to think about
With a few exceptions the girls at the factory were woefully unclean about their persons
Susan did not blame them she only wondered at Etta the more and grew to admire herand the father who held the whole family up to the mark
For in spite of the difficulties of getting clean without bathtub without any but the crudest and cheapest appliances for cleanliness without any leisure time Etta kept herself in perfect order
The show boat and the quarters at the hotel had been trying to Susan
But they had seemed an adventure a temporary passing phase a sort of somewhat prolonged campingout lark
Now she was settled down to live apparently for the rest of her life with none of the comforts with few of the decencies
What Etta and her people using all their imagination would have pictured as the pinnacle of luxury would have been for Susan a small and imperfect part of what she had been bred to regard as living decently
She suspected that but for Ettas example she would be yielding at least in the matter of cleanliness when the struggle against dirt was so unequal was thankless
Discouragement became her frequent mood she wondered if the time would not come when it would be her fixed habit as it was with all but a handful of those about her
Sometimes she and Etta walked in the quarter at the top of the hill where lived the families of prosperous merchantsestablishments a little larger a little more pretentious than her Uncle Georges in Sutherland but on the whole much like itthe houses of the solid middle class which fancies itself grandly luxurious where it is in fact merely comfortable in a crude unimaginative way
Susan was one of those who are born with the instinct and mental bent for luxurious comfort also she had the accompanying peculiar talent for assimilating ideas about food and dress and surroundings from books and magazines from the study of welldressed people in the street from glances into luxurious interiors through windows or open doors as she passed by
She saw with even quicker and more intelligently critical eyes the new thing the good idea the improvement on what she already knew
Ettas excitement over these commonplace rich people amused her
She herself on the wings of her daring young fancy could soar into a realm of luxury of beauty and exquisite comfort that made these selfcomplacent mansions seem very ordinary indeed
It was no drag upon her fancy but the reverse that she was sharing a narrow bed and a narrow room in a humble and tiny tenement flat
On one of these walks Etta confided to her the only romance of her life therefore the real cause of her deep discontent
It was a young man from one of these housesa flirtation lasting about a year
She assured Susan it was altogether innocent
Susanperhaps chiefly because Etta protested so insistently about her unsullied purityhad her doubts
Then said Etta when I saw that he didnt care anything about me except in one wayI didnt see him any more
IIve been sorry ever since
Susan did not offer the hopedfor sympathy
She was silent
Did you ever have anything like that happen to you
inquired Etta
Yes said Susan
Something like that
And what did you do
I didnt want to see him any more
Why
I dont knowexactly
And you like him
I think I would have liked him
Youre sorry you stopped
Sometimes replied she hesitatingly
She was beginning to be afraid that she would soon be sorry all the time
Every day the war within burst forth afresh
She reproached herself for her growing hatred of her life
Ought she not to be grateful that she had so muchthat she was not one of a squalid quartette in a foul vermininfested back bedroominfested instead of only occasionally visitedthat she was not a streetwalker diseased prowling in all weathers the prey of the coarse humors of contemptuous and usually drunken beasts that she was not living where everyone about her would by pity or out of spitefulness tear open the wounds of that hideous brand which had been put upon her at birth
Above all she ought to be thankful that she was not Jeb Fergusons wife
But her efforts to make herself resigned and contented to kill her doubts as to the goodness of goodness were not successful
She had Tom Brashears ungrateful naturethe nature that will not let a man or a woman stay in the class of hewers of wood and drawers of water but drives him or her out of itand up or down
Youre one of those that things happen to the old cabinetmaker said to her on a September evening as they sat on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant
The tenements had discharged their swarms into the hot street and there was that lively panorama of dirt and disease and depravity which is fascinatingto unaccustomed eyes
Yes said Tom thingsll happen to you
Whatfor instance
she asked
God only knows
Youll up and do something some day
Youre settin here just to grow wings
Some dayswishand off youll soar
Its a pity you was born female
Stilltheres a lot of females that gets up
Come to think of it I guess sex dont matter
Its havin the souland mighty few of either sex has it
Oh Im like everybody else said the girl with an impatient sigh
I dream butit doesnt come to anything
No you aint like everybody else retorted he with a positive shake of his finely shaped head thatched superbly with white hair
You aint afraid for instance
Thats the principal sign of a great soul I guess
Oh but I am afraid cried Susan
Ive only lately found out what a coward I am
You think you are said the cabinetmaker
Theres them thats afraid to do and dont do
Then theres them thats afraid to do but goes ahead and does anyhow
Thats you
I dont know where you came fromoh I heard Ettas accountin for you to her ma but thats neither here nor there
I dont know where you come from and I dont know where youre going
Butyou aint afraidand you have imaginationand those two signs means something doing
Susan shook her head dejectedly it had been a cruelly hard day at the factory and the odors from the girls working on either side of her had all but overwhelmed her
Old Tom nodded with stronger emphasis
Youre too young yet he said
And not licked into shape
But wait a while
Youll get there
Susan hoped so but doubted it
There was no time to work at these large problems of destiny when the daily grind was so compelling so wearing when the problems of bare food clothing and shelter took all there was in her
For example there was the matter of clothes
She had come with only what she was wearing
She gave the Brashears every Saturday two dollars and a half of her three and was ashamed of herself for taking so much for so little when she learned about the cost of living and how different was the food the Brashears had from that of any other family in those quarters
As soon as she had saved four dollars from her wagesit took nearly two monthsshe bought the necessary materials and made herself two plain outer skirts three blouses and three pairs of drawers
Chemises and corset covers she could not afford
She bought a pair of shoes for a dollar two pairs of stockings for thirty cents a corset for eighty cents an umbrella for half a dollar two underwaists for a quarter
She bought an untrimmed hat for thirtyfive cents and trimmed it with the cleaned ribbon from her summer sailor and a left over bit of skirt material
She also made herself a jacket that had to serve as wrap tooand the materials for this took the surplus of her wages for another month
The cold weather had come and she had to walk fast when she was in the open air not to be chilled to the bone
Her Aunt Fanny had been one of those women not too common in America who understand and practice genuine economy in the householdnot the shabby stinginess that passes for economy but the laying out of money to the best advantage that comes only when one knows values
This training stood Susan in good stead now
It saved her from disasterfrom disintegration
She and Etta did some washing every night hanging the things on the fire escape to dry
In this way she was able to be clean but in appearance she looked as poor as she was
She found a cobbler who kept her shoes in fair order for a few cents but nothing was right about them soonexcept that they were not down at the heel
She could recall how she had often wondered why the poor girls at Sutherland showed so little taste looked so dowdy
She wondered at her own stupidity at the narrowness of an education such as hers had been an education that left her ignorant of the conditions of life as it was lived by all but a lucky few of her fellow beings
How few the lucky
What an amazing worldwhat a strange creation the human race
How was it possible that the lucky few among whom she had been born and bred should know so little really nothing about the lot of the vast mass of their fellows living all around them close up against them
If I had only known
she thought
And then she reflected that if she had known pleasure would have been impossible
She could see her bureau drawers her closets at home
She had thought herself not any too well off
Now how luxurious how stuffed with shameful wasteful unnecessaries those drawers and closets seemed
And merely to keep herself in underclothes that were at least not in tatters she had to spend every cent over and above her board
If she had had to pay carfare ten cents a day sixty cents a weekas did many of the girls who lived at home she would have been ruined
She understood now why every girl without a family back of her and without good prospect of marriage was revolving the idea of becoming a streetwalkernot as a hope but as a fear
As she learned to observe more closely she found good reasons for suspecting that from time to time the girls who became too hard pressed relieved the tension by taking to the streets on Saturday and Sunday nights
She read in the Commercial one noonMr Matson sometimes left his paper where she could glance through itshe read an article on working girls how they were seduced to lives of shameby love of finery
Then she read that those who did not fall were restrained by religion and innate purity
There she laughedbitterly
Fear of disease fear of maternity yes
But where was this religion
Who but the dullest fools in the throes of that bare and tortured life ever thought of God
As for the puritywhat about the obscene talk that made her shudder because of its sheer filthy stupiditywhat about the frank shamelessness of the efforts to lure their steadies into speedy matrimony by using every charm of caress and of person to inflame passion without satisfying it
She had thought she knew about the relations of the sexes when she came to live and work in that tenement quarter
Soon her knowledge had seemed ignorance beside the knowledge of the very babies
It was a sad sad puzzle
If one ought to be goodchaste and clean in mind and bodythen why was there the most tremendous pressure on all but a few to make them as foul as the surroundings in which they were compelled to live
If it was wiser to be good then why were most people imprisoned in a life from which they could escape only by being bad
What was this thing comfortable people had set up as good anyhowand what was bad
She found no answer
How could God condemn anyone for anything they did in the torments of the hell that life revealed itself to her as being after a few weeks of its moral mental and physical horrors
Ettas father was right those who realized what life really was and what it might be those who were sensitive took to drink or went to pieces some other way if they were gentle and if they were cruel committed any brutality any crime to try to escape
In former days Susan thought well of charity as she had been taught
Old Tom Brashear gave her a different point of view
One day he insulted and drove from the tenement some pious charitable people who had come down from the fashionable hilltop to be good and gracious to their less fashionable fellowbeings
After they had gone he explained his harshness to Susan Thats the only way you can make them slickedup brutes feel said he theyre so thick in the hide and satisfied with themselves
What do they come here for
To do good
Yesto themselves
To make themselves feel how generous and sweet they was
Well theyd better go home and read their Russialeather covered Bibles
Theyd find out that when God wanted to really do something for man he didnt have himself created a king or a plutocrat or a fat slimy church deacon in a fashionable church
No he had himself born a bastard in a manger
Susan shivered for the truth thus put sounded like sacrilege
Then a glowa glow of pride and of hopeswept through her
If you ever get up into another class went on old Tom dont come hangin round the common people youll be livin off of and helpin to grind down stick to your own class
Thats the only place anybody can do any goodany real helpin and lovin man to man and woman to woman
If you want to help anybody thats down pull him up into your class first
Stick to your class
Youll find plenty to do there
What for instance
asked Susan
She understood a little of what he had in mind but was still puzzled
Them stallfed fakers I just threw out the old man went on
They come here actin as if this was the Middle Ages and the lord of the castle was doin a fine thing when he went down among the low peasants whod been made by God to work for the lords
But this aint the Middle Ages
Whats the truth about it
I dont know confessed Susan
Why the big lower class is poor because the little upper class takes away from em and eats up all they toil and slave to make
Oh it aint the upper classs fault
They do it because theyre ignorant moren because theyre bad just as what goes on down here is ignorance moren badness
But they do it all the same
And theyre ignorant and need to be told
Supposin you saw a big girl out yonder in the street beatin her baby sister
What would you do
Would you go and hold out little pieces of candy to the baby and say how sorry you was for her
Or would you first grab hold of that big sister and throw her away from beatin of the baby
I see said Susan
Thats it exactly exclaimed the old man in triumph
And I say to them pious charity fakers Git the hell out of here where you cant do no good
Git back to yer own class that makes all this misery makes it fastern all the religion and charity in the world could help it
Git back to yer own class and work with them and teach them and make them stop robbin and beatin the baby
Yes said the girl you are right
I see it now
But Mr Brashear they meant well
The hell they did retorted the old man
If theyd a had love in their hearts theyd have seen the truth
Loves one of the greatest teachers in the world
If theyd a meant well theyd a been goin round teachin and preachin and prayin at their friends and fathers and brothers the plutocrats
Theyd never a come down here pretendin they was doin good killin one bedbug out of ten million and offerin one pair of good pants where a hundred thousand pairs is needed
Theyd better go read about themselves in their Biblewhat Jesus says
He knew em
He belonged to usand they crucified him
The horrors of that by no means lowest tenement region its horrors for a girl bred as Susan had been
Horrors moral horrors mental horrors physicalabove all the physical horrors for worse to her than the dull wits and the lack of education worse than vile speech and gesture was the hopeless battle against dirt against the vermin that could crawl everywhereand did
She envied the ignorant and the insensible their lack of consciousness of their own plightlike the disemboweled horse that eats tranquilly on
At first she had thought her unhappiness came from her having been used to better things that if she had been born to this life she would have been content gay at times
Soon she learned that laughter does not always mean mirth that the ignorant do not lack the power to suffer simply because they lack the power to appreciate that the diseases the bent bodies the harrowed faces the drunkenness quarreling fighting were safer guides to the real conditions of these people than their occasional guffaws and fits of horseplay
A woman from the hilltop came in a carriage to see about a servant
On her way through the hall she cried out Gracious
Why dont these lazy creatures clean up when soap costs so little and water nothing at all
Susan heard was moved to face her fiercely but restrained herself
Of what use
How could the woman understand if she heard But you fool where are we to get the time to clean upand where the courageand would soap enough to clean up and keep clean cost so little when every penny means a drop of blood
If they only couldnt drink so much
said Susan to Tom
What then
retorted he
Why pretty soon wagesd be cut faster than they was when street carfares went down from ten cents to five
Whenever the workin people arrange to live cheaper and to try to save something down goes wages
No they might as well drink
It helps em bear it and winds em up sooner
I tell you it aint the workin peoples faultits the bosses now
Its the systemthe system
A new form of slavery this here wage systemand its got to golike the slaveholder that looked so copperriveted and Biblebacked in its day
That idea of the system was beyond Susan
But not what her eyes saw and her ears heard and her nose smelled and her sense of touch shrank from
No ambition and no reason for ambition
No real knowledge and no chance to get anyneither the leisure nor the money nor the teachers
No hope and no reason for hope
No Godand no reason for a God
Ideas beyond her years beyond her comprehension were stirring in her brain were making her grave and thoughtful
She was accumulating a store of knowledge about life she was groping for the clew to its mystery for the missing fact or facts which would enable her to solve the puzzle to see what its lessons were for her
Sometimes her heavy heart told her that the mystery was plain and the lesson easyhopelessness
For of all the sadness about her of all the tragedies so sordid and unromantic the most tragic was the hopelessness
It would be impossible to conceive people worse off it would be impossible to conceive these people better off
They were such a multitude that only they could save themselvesand they had no intelligence to appreciate no desire to impel
If their miseriesmiseries to which they had fallen heir at birthhad made them what they were it was also true that they were what they werehopeless down to the babies playing in the filth
An unscalable cliff at the top in pleasant lands lived the comfortable classes at the bottom lived the massesand while many came whirling down from the top how few found their way up
On a Saturday night Ashbel came home with the news that his wages had been cut to seven dollars
And the restaurant had been paying steadily less as the hard times grew harder and the cost of unadulterated and wholesome food mounted higher and higher
As the family sat silent and stupefied old Tom looked up from his paper fixed his keen mocking eyes on Susan
I see here said he that we are so rich that they want to raise the Presidents salary so as he can entertain decentlyand to build palaces at foreign courts so as our representativesll live worthy of us
CHAPTER XX ON Monday at the lunch houror rather halfhourSusan ventured in to see the boss
Matson had too recently sprung from the working class and was too ignorant of everything outside his business to have made radical changes in his habits
He smoked fivecent cigars instead of twofurs he ate larger quantities of food did not stint himself in beer or in treating his friends in the evenings down at Wielerts beer garden
Also he wore a somewhat better quality of clothing but he looked precisely what he was
Like all the working class above the pauper line he made a Sunday toilet the chief features of which were the weekly bath and the weekly clean white shirt
Thus it being only Monday morning he was looking notably clean when Susan enteredand was morally wound up to a higher key than he would be as the week wore on
At sight of her his feet on the leaf of the desk wavered then became inert it would not do to put on manners with any of the hands
Thanks to the bath he was not exuding his usual odor that comes from bolting much strong cheap food
Well Lornywhats the kick
inquired he with his amiable grin
His rise in the world never for an instant ceased to be a source of delight to him itand a perfect digestionkept him in a good humor all the time
I want to know stammered Susan if you cant give me a little more money
He laughed eyeing her approvingly
Her clothing was that of the working girl but in her face was the look never found in those born to the modern form of slaverywage servitude
If he had been cultured he might have compared her to an enslaved princess though in fact that expression of her courageous violetgray eyes and sensitive mouth could never have been in the face of princess bred to the enslaving routine of the most conventional of conventional lives it could come only from sheer erectness of spirit the exclusive birthright of the sons and daughters of democracy
More money
he chuckled
You have got a nervewhen factories are shutting down everywhere and working people are tramping the streets in droves
I do about onefourth more than the best hands youve got replied Susan made audacious by necessity
And Ill agree to throw in my lunch time
Let me see how much do you get
Three dollars
And you arent living at home
You must have a hard time
Not much over for diamonds eh
You want to hustle round and get married Lorny
Looks dont last long when a gal works
But youre holdin out bettern them that gads and dances all night
I help at the restaurant in the evening to piece out my board
Im pretty tired when I get a chance to go to bed
Ill bet


So you want more money
Ive been watchin you
I watch all my galsI have to to keep weedin out the fast ones
I wont have no bad examples in my place
As soon as I ketch a gal livin beyond her wages I give her the bounce
Susan lowered her eyes and her cheeks burnednot because Matson was frankly discussing the frivolous subject of sex
Another girl might have affected the air of distressed modesty but it would have been affectation pure and simple as in those regions all were used to hearing the frankest vilest thingsand we do not blush at what we are used to hearing
Still the tenement female sex is as full of affectation as is the sex elsewhere
But Susan the curiously selfunconscious was incapable of affectation
Her indignation arose from her sense of the hideous injustice of Matsons discharging girls for doing what his meager wages all but compelled
Yes Ive been watching you he went on with a kind of a sort of a notion of makin you a forelady
Thatd mean six dollars a week
But you aint fit
Youve got the brainsplenty of em
But you wouldnt be of no use to me as forelady
Why not
asked Susan
Six dollars a week
Affluence
Wealth
Matson took his feet down relit his cigar and swung himself into an oracular attitude
Ill show you
Whats manufacturin
Right down at the bottom I mean
He looked hard at the girl
She looked receptively at him
Why its gettin work out of the hands
New ideas is nothin
You can steal em the minute the other fellow uses em
No its all in gettin work out of the hands
Susans expression suggested one who sees light and wishes to see more of it
He proceeded You work for mefor instance now if every day you make stuff theres a profit of five dollars on I get five dollars out of you
If I can push you to make stuff theres a profit of six dollars on I get six dollarsa dollar more
Clear extra gain isnt it
Now multiply a dollar by the number of hands and youll see what it amounts to
I see said Susan nodding thoughtfully
Well
How did I get up
Because as a foreman I knew how to work the hands
I knew how to get those extra dollars
And how do I keep up
Because I hire forepeople that get work out of the hands
Susan understood
But her expression was a comment that was not missed by the shrewd Matson
Now listen to me Lorny
I want to give you a plain straight talk because Id like to see you climb
Ever since youve been here Ive been laughin to myself over the way your foreladyshes a fox she ismakes you the pacemaker for the other girls
She squeezes at least twentyfive cents a day over what she used to out of each hand in your room because youre above the rest of them dirty shiftless muttonheads
Susan flushed at this fling at her fellowworkers
Dirty shiftless muttonheads repeated Matson
Aint I right
Aint they dirty
Aint they shiftlessso noaccount that if they wasnt watched every minute theyd lay downand let me and the factory that supports em go to rack and ruin
And aint they muttonheads
Do you ever find any of em saying or doing a sensible thing
Susan could not deny
She could think of excusesperfect excuses
But the facts were about as he brutally put it
Oh I know em
Ive dealt with em all my life pursued the box manufacturer
Now Lorny you ought to be a forelady
Youve got to toughen up and stop bein so polite and helpful and all that
Youll never get on if you dont toughen up
Business is business
Be as sentimental as you like away from business and after youve clum to the top
But not in business or while youre kickin and scratchin and clawin your way up
Susan shook her head slowly
She felt painfully young and inexperienced and unfit for the ferocious struggle called life
She felt deathly sick
Of course its a hard world said Matson with a wave of his cigar
But did I make it
No admitted Susan as his eyes demanded a reply
Sure not said he
And hows anybody to get up in it
Is there any other way but by kickin and stampin eh
None that I see conceded Susan reluctantly
None that is declared he
Them that says theres other ways either lies or dont know nothin about the practical game
Well then
Matson puffed triumphantly at the cigar
Such bein the caseand as long as the crowd down belows got to be kicked in the face by them thats on the way up why shouldnt I do the kickinwhich is goin to be done anyhowinstead of gettin kicked
Aint that sense
Yes admitted Susan
She sighed
Yes she repeated
Welltoughen up
Meanwhile Ill raise you to spur the others on
Ill give you four a week
And he cut short her thanks with an Oh dont mention it
Im only doin whats squarewhat helps me as well as you
I want to encourage you
You dont belong down among them cattle
Toughen up Lorny
A girl with a bank account gets the pick of the beaux
And he nodded a dismissal
Matson and his hands bosses and workers brutal brutalizing each other more and more as they acted and reacted upon each other
Where would it end
She was in dire need of underclothes
Her undershirts were full of holes from the rubbing of her cheap rough corset her drawers and stockings were patched in several placesin fact she could not have worn the stockings had not her skirt now been well below her shoetops
Also her shoes in spite of the money she had spent upon them were about to burst round the edges of the soles
But she would not longer accept from the Brashears what she regarded as charity
You more than pay your share what with the work you do protested Mrs Brashear
Ill not refuse the extra dollar because Ive simply got to take it
But I dont want to pertend
The restaurant receipts began to fall with the increasing hardness of the times among the working people
Soon it was down to practically no profit at allthat is nothing toward the rent
Tom Brashear was forced to abandon his policy of honesty to do as all the other purveyors were doingto buy cheap stuff and to cheapen it still further
He broke abruptly with his tradition and his past
It aged him horribly all in a few weeksbut at least ruin was put off
Mrs Brashear had to draw twenty of the sixtythree dollars which were in the savings bank against sickness
Funerals would be taken care of by the burial insurance each member of the family including Susan had a policy
But sickness had to have its special fund and it was frequently drawn upon as the Brashears knew no more than their neighbors about hygiene and were constantly catching the colds of foolish exposure or indigestion and letting them develop into fevers bad attacks of rheumatism stomach trouble backache all regarded by them as by their neighbors as a necessary part of the routine of life
Those tenement people had no more notion of selfrestraint than had the better classes whose selfindulgences maintain the vast army of doctors and druggists
The only thing that saved Susan from all but an occasional cold or sore throat from wet feet was eating little through being unable to accustom herself to the fare that was the best the Brashears could now affordcheap food in cheap lard coarse and poisonous sugar vilely adulterated coffee doctored meat and vegetablesthe food which the poor in their ignorance buyand for which they in their helplessness pay actually higher prices than do intelligent welltodo people for the better qualities
And not only were the times hard but the winter also
Snowsleetrainthawslushnoisome diseaseladen vaporand of course sickness everywherewith occasional relief in death relief for the one who died relief for the living freed from just so much of the burden
The sickness on every hand appalled Susan
Surely she said to old Brashear the like had never been before on the contrary said he the amount of illness and death was if anything less than usual because the hard times gave people less for eating and drinking
These ghastly creatures crawling toward the hospital or borne out on stretchers to the ambulancethese yet ghastlier creatures tottering feebly homeward discharged as curedthese corpses of men of women of boys and girls of babiesoh how many corpses of babiesthese corpses borne away for burial usually to the public burying groundall these stricken ones in the battle ever waging with curses with hoarse loud laughter with shrieks and moans with dull drawn faces and jaws setall these stricken ones were but the ordinary losses of the battle
And in the churches said old Tom Brashear they preach the goodness and mercy of God
And in the papers they talk about how rich and prosperous we are
I dont care to live
It is too horrible cried the girl
Oh you mustnt take things so to heart counseled he
Us that live this life cant afford to take it to heart
Leave that to them who come down here from the good houses and look on us for a minute and enjoy themselves with a little weepin and sighin as if it was in the theater
It seems worse every day she said
I try to fool myself because Ive got to stay and Oh no you havent interrupted he
Susan looked at him with a startled expression
It seemed to her that the old man had seen into her secret heart where was daily raging the struggle against taking the only way out open to a girl in her circumstances
It seemed to her he was hinting that she ought to take that way
If any such idea was in his mind he did not dare put it into words
He simply repeated You wont stay
Youll pull out
How
she asked
Somehow
When the way opens youll see it and take it
There had long since sprung up between these two a sympathy a mutual understanding beyond any necessity of expression in words or looks
She had never had this feeling for anyone not even for Burlingham
This feeling for each other had been like that of a father and daughter who love each other without either understanding the other very well or feeling the need of a sympathetic understanding
There was a strong resemblance between Burlingham and old Tom
Both belonged to the familiar philosopher type
But unlike the actormanager the old cabinetmaker had lived his philosophy and a very gentle and tolerant philosophy it was
After she had looked her request for light upon what way she was to take they sat silent neither looking at the other yet each seeing the other with the eye of the mind
She said I may not dare take it
You wont have no choice replied he
Youll have to take it
And youll get away from here
And you mustnt ever come backor look back
Forget all this misery
Rememberin wont do us no good
Itd only weaken you
I shant ever forget cried the girl
You must said the old man firmly
He added And you will
Youll have too much else to think abouttoo much that has to be attended to
As the first of the year approached and the small shopkeepers of the tenements like the big ones elsewhere were casting up the years balances and learning how far toward or beyond the verge of ruin the hard times had brought them the sound of the fire enginesand of the ambulancesbecame a familiar part of the daily and nightly noises of the district
Desperate shopkeepers careless of their neighbors lives and property in fiercely striving for themselves and their familiesworkingmen out of a job and deep in debtlandlords with too heavy interest falling dueall these were trying to save themselves or to lengthen the time the fact of ruin could be kept secret by setting fire to their shops or their flats
The Brashears had been burned out twice in their wandering tenement house life so old Tom was sleeping little was constantly prowling about the halls of all the tenements in that row and into the cellars
He told Susan the open secret of the meaning of most of these fires
And after he had cursed the fire fiends he apologized for them
Its the curse of the system explained he
Its all the curse of the system
These here storekeepers and the farmers the same waythey think theyre independent but really theyre nothin but fooled slaves of the big blood suckers for the upper class
But these here little storekeepers theyre tryin to escape
How does a man escape
Why by gettin some hands together to work for him so that he can take it out of their wages
When you get together enough to hire helpthats when you pass out of slavery into the master classmaster of slaves
Susan nodded understandingly
Now how can these little storekeepers like me get together enough to begin to hire slaves
By a hundred tricks every one of them wicked and mean
By skimpin and slavin themselves and their families by sellin short weight by sellin rotten food by sellin poison by burnin to get the insurance
And at last if they dont die or get caught and jailed they get together the money to branch out and hire help and begin to get prosperous out of the blood of their help
These here arson fellowstheyre on the first rung of the ladder of success
You heard about that beautiful ladder in Sunday school didnt you
Yes said Susan that and a great many other lies about God and man
Susan had all along had great difficulty in getting sleep because of the incessant and discordant noises of the district
The unhappy people added to their own misery by disturbing each others restand no small part of the bad health everywhere prevailing was due to this inability of anybody to get proper sleep because somebody was always singing or quarreling shouting or stamping about
But Susan being young and as yet untroubled by the indigestion that openly or secretly preyed upon everyone else did at last grow somewhat used to noise did contrive to get five or six hours of broken sleep
With the epidemic of fires she was once more restless and wakeful
Every day came news of fire somewhere in the tenement districts of the city with one or more perhaps a dozen roasted to death or horribly burned
A few weeks however and even that peril became so familiar that she slept like the rest
There were too many actualities of discomfort of misery to harass her all day long every time her mind wandered from her work
One night she was awakened by a scream
She leaped from bed to find the room filling with smoke and the street bright as day but with a flickering evil light
Etta was screaming Ashbel was bawling and roaring like a tortured bull
Susan completely dazed by the uproar seized Etta and dragged her into the hall
There were Mr and Mrs Brashear he in his nightdress of drawers and undershirt she in the short flannel petticoat and sacque in which she always slept
Ashbel burst out of his room kicking the door down instead of turning the knob
Lorny cried old Tom you take mother and Etta to the escape
And he rushed at his powerful stupid son and began to strike him in the face with his one good fist shrieking Shut up you damn fool
Shut up
Dragging Etta and pushing Mrs Brashear Susan moved toward the end of the hall where the fire escape passed their windows
All the way down the landings were littered with bedding pots pans drying clothes fire wood boxes all manner of rubbish the overflow of the crowded little flats
Over these obstructions and down the ladders were falling and stumbling men women children babies in all degrees of nudityfor many of the big families that slept in one room with windows tight shut so that the stove heat would not escape and be wasted when fuel was so dear slept stark naked
Susan contrived to get Etta and the old woman to the street not far behind them came Tom and Ashbel the sons face bleeding from the blows his father had struck to quiet him
It was a penetrating cold night with an icy drizzle falling
The street was filled with engines hose all manner of ruined household effects firemen shouting the tenement people huddling this way and that barefooted nearly or quite naked silent stupefied
Nobody had saved anything worth while
The entire block was ablaze was burning as if it had been saturated with coal oil
The owners done this said old Tom
I heard he was in trouble
But though hes a church member and what they call a philanthropist I hardly thought hed stoop to hirin this done
If anybodys caught itll be some fellow that dont know who he did it for
About a hundred families were homeless in the street
Half a dozen patrol wagons and five ambulances were taking the people away to shelter women and babies first
It was an houran hour of standing in the street with bare feet on the ice under the ankledeep slushbefore old Tom and his wife got their turn to be taken
Then Susan and Etta and Ashbel escorted by a policeman set out for the station house
As they walked along someone called out to the policeman Anybody killed at the fire officer
Six jumped and was smashed replied the policeman
I seen three dead babies
But they wont know for several days how many itll total
And all her life long whenever Susan Lenox heard the clang of a fire engine there arose before her the memory picture of that fire in all the horror of detail
A fire bell to her meant wretched families flung into the night shrieks of mangled and dying moans of babies with life oozing from their blue lips columns of smoke ascending through icy soaking air and a vast glare of wicked light with flame demons leaping for joy in the measureless woe over which they were presiding
As the little party was passing the fire lines Ashbels foot slipped on a freezing ooze of blood and slush and he fell sprawling upon a human body battered and trampled until it was like an overturned basket of butchers odds and ends
The station house was eleven long squares away
But before they started for it they were already at the lowest depth of physical wretchedness which human nerves can register thus they arrived simply a little more numb
The big room heated by a huge redhot stove to the point where the sweat starts was crowded with abject and pitiful human specimens
Even Susan the most sensitive person there gazed about with stolid eyes
The nakedness of unsightly bodies gross with fat or wasted to emaciation the dirtiness of limbs and torsos long long unwashed the foul steam from it all and from the watersoaked rags the groans of some the silent staring misery of others and most horrible of all the laughter of those who yielded like animals to the momentary sense of physical wellbeing as the heat thawed them outthese sights and sounds together made up a truly infernal picture
And like all the tragedies of abject poverty it was wholly devoid of that dignity which is necessary to excite the deep pity of respect was sordid and squalid moved the sensitive to turn away in loathing rather than to advance with brotherly sympathy and love
Ashbel his animal instinct roused by the sight of the stove thrust the throng aside rudely as he pushed straight for the radiating center
Etta and Susan followed in his wake
The fierce heat soon roused them to the sense of their plight
Ashbel began to curse Etta to weep
Susans mind was staring without hope but also without despair at the walls of the trap in which they were all caughtwas seeking the spot where they could begin to burrow through and escape
Beds and covers were gathered in by the police from everywhere in that district were ranged upon the floor of the four rooms
The men were put in the cells downstairs the women and the children got the cots
Susan and Etta lay upon the same mattress a horse blanket over them
Etta slept Susan wide awake lived in brain and nerves the heartbreaking scenes through which she had passed numb and stolid
About six oclock a breakfast of coffee milk and bread was served
It was evident that the police did not know what to do with these outcasts who had nothing and no place to gofor practically all were out of work when the blow came
Ashbel demanded shoes pants and a coat
Ive got to get to my job shouted he or else Ill lose it
Then where in the helld we be
His blustering angered the sergeant who finally told him if he did not quiet down he would be locked in a cell
Susan interrupted explained the situation got Ashbel the necessary clothes and freed Etta and herself of his worse than useless presence
At Susans suggestion such other men as had jobs were also fitted out after a fashion and sent away
You can take the addresses of their families if you send them anywhere during the day and these men can come back here and find out where theyve gone this was the plan she proposed to the captain and he adopted it
As soon as the morning papers were about the city aid of every kind began to pour in with the result that before noon many of the families were better established than they had been before the fire
Susan and Etta got some clothing enough to keep them warm on their way through the streets to the hospital to which Brashear and his wife had been taken
Mrs Brashear had died in the ambulanceof heart disease the doctors said but Susan felt it was really of the sense that to go on living was impossible
And fond of her though she was she could not but be relieved that there was one less factor in the unsolvable problem
Shes better off she said to Etta in the effort to console
But Etta needed no consolation
Ever so much better off she promptly assented
Mother hasnt cared about living since we had to give up our little home and become tenement house people
And she was right
As to Brashear they learned that he was ill but they did not learn until evening that he was dying of pneumonia
The two girls and Ashbel were admitted to the ward where he layone of a long line of sufferers in bare clean little beds
Screens were drawn round his bed because he was dying
He had been suffering torments from the savage assaults of the pneumonia but the pain had passed away now so he said though the dreadful sound of his breathing made Susans heart flutter and her whole body quiver
Do you want a preacher or a priest
asked the nurse
Neither replied the old man in gasps and whispers
If there is a God hell never let anybody from this hell of a world into his presence
They might tell him the truth about himself
Oh father father
pleaded Etta and Ashbel burst into a fit of hysterical and terrified crying
The old man turned his dying eyes on Susan
He rested a few minutes fixing her gaze upon his with a hypnotic stare
Then he began again Youve got somethin moren a turnip on your shoulders
Listen to me
There was a man named Jesus oncegaspgaspYouve heard about him but you dont know about himgaspgaspIll tell youlisten
He was a low fellowa workin mansame trade as mineborn without a fatherborn in a horse troughin a stablegaspgasp Susan leaned forward
Born without a father she murmured her eyes suddenly bright
Thats him
ListengaspgaspgaspHe was a big fellerbig brainbig heartthe biggest man that ever livedgaspgaspgaspgasAnd he looked at this here hell of a world from the outside he being an outcast and a lowdown common workingman
And he sawhe did Yes he saw
gaspgaspgaspAnd he said all men were brothersand that theyd find it out some day
He saw that this world was put together for the strong and the cruelthat they could win outand make the rest of us work for em for what they chose to givelike they work a poor ignorant horse for his feed and stall in a dirty stablegaspgaspgasp For the strong and the cruel said Susan
And this feller Jesushe set round the saloons and such placespublicans they called emgaspgaspgaspAnd he says to all the poor ignorant slaves and such cattle he says Youre all brothers
Love one anothergaspgaspgasp Love one another he says and learn to help each other and stand up for each other he says and hate war and fightin and money grabbingaspgaspgaspPeace on earth he says Know the truth and the truth shall make you freeand he saw thered be a timethe old man raised himself on one elbowYes by Godthere will bea time when menll learn not to be beasts andll be menmen little gal
Men echoed Susan her eyes shining her bosom heaving
It aint sense and it aint right that everything should be for the fewfor them with brainsand that the restthe millionsshould be tramped down just because they aint so cruel or so cutethey and their children tramped down in the dirt
And that feller Jesus saw it
Yesyes cried Susan
He saw it
Ill tell you what he was said old Tom in a hoarse whisper
He wasnt no god
He was biggern thatbiggern that little gal
He was the first man that ever lived
He said Give the weak a chance so as they kin git strong
He says The dying man fell back exhausted
His eyes rolled wildly closed his mouth twitched fell wide open there came from his throat a sound Susan had never heard before but she knew what it was what it meant
Etta and Ashbel were overwhelmed afresh by the disgrace of having their parents buried in Potters Fieldfor the insurance money went for debts
They did not understand when Susan said I think your fatherd have liked to feel that he was going to be buried therebecause then hell be withwith his Friend
You know He was buried in Potters Field
However their grief was shortlived there is no time in the lives of working people for such luxuries as griefno more time than there is at sea when all are toiling to keep afloat the stormracked sinking ship and one sailor is swept overboard
In comfortable lives a bereavement is a contrast in the lives of the wretched it is but one more in the assailing army of woes
Etta took a job at the box factory at three dollars a week she and Susan and Ashbel moved into two small rooms in a flat in a tenement opposite the factorya cheaper and therefore lower house than the one that had burned
They bought on the installment plan nine dollars worth of furniturethe scant minimum of necessities
They calculated that by careful saving they could pay off the debt in a year or sounless one or the other fell ill or lost work
That means said Etta eyeing their flimsy and all but downright worthless purchases that means well still be paying when this furniturell be gone to pieces and fit only for kindling
Its the best we can do replied Susan
Maybe one of usll get a better job
You could Im sure if you had the clothes said Etta
But not in those rags
If I had the clothes
Where
At Shillitos or one of the other department stores
Theyd give us both places in one of the mens departments
They like pretty girls for those placesif theyre not giddy and dont waste time flirting but use flirtation to sell goods
But whats the sense in talking about it
You havent got the clothes
A salesladys got to be counterdressed
She can look as bad as she pleases round the skirt and the feet
But from the waist up she has to look natty if she wants wages
Susan had seen these girls she understood now why they looked as if they were the put together upper and lower halves of two different persons
She recalled that even though they went into other business they still retained the habit wore toilets that were counterbuilt
She revolved the problem of getting one of these toilets and of securing a store job
But she soon saw it was hopeless for the time
Every cent the three had was needed to keep from starving and freezing
Alsothough she did not realize ither young enthusiasm was steadily being sapped by the life she was leading
It may have been this rather than natural gentlenessor perhaps it was as much the one as the otherthat kept Susan from taking Matsons advice and hardening herself into a forelady
The ruddy glow under her skin had given place to the roundness of her form had gone and its pallor beauty remained only because she had a figure which not even emaciation could have deprived of lines of alluring grace
But she was no longer quite so straight and her hair which it was a sheer impossibility to care for was losing its soft vitality
She was still pretty but not the beauty she had been when she was ejected from the class in which she was bred
However she gave the change in herself little thought it was the rapid decline of Ettas prettiness and freshness that worried her most
Not many weeks after the fire and the deeper plunge she began to be annoyed by Ashbel
In his clumsy clownish way he was making advances to her
Several times he tried to kiss her
Once when Etta was out he opened the door of the room where she was taking a bath in a washtub she had borrowed of the janitress leered in at her and very reluctantly obeyed her sharp order to close the door
She had long known that he was in reality very different from the silent restrained person fear of his father made him seem to be
But she thought even the reality was far above the rest of the young men growing up among those degrading influences
The intrusion into her room was on a Sunday on the following Sunday he came back as soon as Etta went out
Look here Lorny said he with blustering tone and gesture I want to have a plain talk with you
Im sick and tired of this
Theres got to be a change
Sick of what
asked Susan
Of the way you stand me off
He plumped himself sullenly down on the edge of hers and Ettas bed
I cant afford to get married
Ive got to stick by you two
It strikes me Ashbel we all need each other
Whod marry you on seven a week
She laughed goodhumoredly
Anyhow you wouldnt support a wife
It takes the hardest kind of work to get your share of the expenses out of you
You always try to beat us down to letting you off with two fifty a week
Thats about all Etta pays
Its about all she gets
And I pay three fiftyand she and I do all the workand give you two meals and a lunch to take with youand youve got a room aloneand your mending done
I guess you know when youre well off
But I aint well off he cried
Im a grownup manand Ive got to have a woman
Susan had become used to tenement conditions
She said practically Welltheres your left over four dollars a week
Huh
retorted he
Think Im goin to run any risks
Im no fool
I take care of my health
Welldont bother me with your troublesat least troubles of that sort
Yes but I will
shouted he in one of those sudden furies that seize upon the stupid ignorant
You neednt act so nifty with me
Im as good as you are
Im willing to marry you
No thanks said Susan
Im not free to marryeven if I would
Ohyou aint
For an instant his curiosity as she thus laid a hand upon the curtain over her past distracted his uncertain attention
But her expression reserved cold maddeningly reminding him of a class distinction of which he was as sensitively conscious as she was unconsciousher expression brought him back with a jerk
Then youll have to live with me anyhow
I cant stand it and Im not goin to
If you want me to stay on here and help out youve got to treat me right
Other fellows that do as Im doing get treated right
And Ive got to be tooor Ill clear out
And he squirmed and waggled his head and slapped and rubbed his heavy powerful legs
Why Ashbel said Susan patting him on the shoulder
You and I are like brother and sister
You might as well talk this way to Etta
He gave her a brazen look uttered a laugh that was like the flinging out of a bucket of filth
Why not
Other fellows that have to support the family and cant afford to marry gets took care of
Susan shrank away
But Ashbel did not notice it
It aint a question of Etta he went on
Theres youand I dont need to look nowhere else
Susan had long since lost power to be shocked by any revelation of the doings of people lashed out of all civilized feelings by the incessant brutal whips of poverty and driven back to the state of nature
She had never happened to hear definitely of this habiteven customof incestuous relations now that she heard she instantly accepted it as something of which she had really known for some time
At any rate she had no sense of shock
She felt no horror no deep disgust simply the distaste into which her original sense of horror had been thinned down by constant contact with povertys conditionsjust as filth no longer made her shudder so long as it did not touch her own person
Youd better go and chase yourself round the square a few times said she turning away and taking up some mending
You see there aint no way out of it pursued he with an insinuating grin
Susan gave him a steady straight look
Dont ever speak of it again said she quietly
You ought to be ashamedand you will be when you think it over
He laughed loudly
Ive thought it over
I mean what I say
If you dont do the square thing by me you drive me out
He came hulking up to her tried to catch her in his big powerful arms
She put the table between him and her
He kicked it aside and came on
She saw that her move had given him a false impressiona notion that she was afraid of him was coquetting with him
She opened the door leading into the front part of the flat where the Quinlan family lived
If you dont behave yourself Ill call Mr Quinlan said she not the least bluster or fear or nervousness in her tone
Whatd be the use
Hed only laugh
Why the same things going on in their family
Still hed lynch you if I told him what you were trying to do
Even Ashbel saw this familiar truth of human nature
The fact that Quinlan was guilty himself far from staying him from meting out savage justice to another would make him the more relentless and eager
All right said he
Then you want me to git out
I want you to behave yourself and stay on
Go take a walk Ashbel
And Ashbel went
But his expression was not reassuring Susan feared he had no intention of accepting his defeat
However she reasoned that numbskull though he was he yet had wit enough to realize how greatly to his disadvantage any change he could make would be
She did not speak of the matter to Etta who was therefore taken completely by surprise when Ashbel after a silent supper that evening burst out with his grievance Im going to pack up said he
Ive found a place where Ill be treated right
He looked haughtily at Susan
And the daughters a good looker too
Shes got some weight on her
She aint like a washed out string
Etta understood at once
What a lowdown thing you are
she cried
Just like the rest of these filthy tenement house animals
I thought you had some pride
Oh shut up
bawled Ashbel
Youre not such a much
Whatre we anyhow to put on airs
Were as common as dirtyes and that sniffy lady friend of yours too
Whered she come from anyhow
Some dung pile Ill bet
He went into his room reappeared with his few belongings done into a bundle
So long said he stalking toward the hall door
Etta burst into tears caught him by the arm
You aint goin are you Ashy
cried she
Bet your life
Let me loose
And he shook her off
Im not goin to be saddled with two women that aint got no gratitude
My God Lorna
wailed Etta
Talk to him
Make him stay
Susan shook her head went to the window and gazed into the snowy dreary prospect of tenement house yards
Ashbel who had been hesitating through hope vented a jeering laugh
Aint she the insultinest airiest lady
sneered he
Well so long
But Ashy you havent paid for last week yet pleaded Etta clinging to his arm
You kin have my share of the furniture for that
The furniture
Oh my God
shrieked Etta releasing him to throw out her arms in despair
Howll we pay for the furniture if you go
Ask your high and mighty lady friend said her brother
And he opened the door passed into the hall slammed it behind him
Susan waited a moment for Etta to speak then turned to see what she was doing
She had dropped into one of the flimsy chairs was staring into vacancy
Well have to give up these rooms right away said Susan
Etta roused herself looked at her friend
And Susan saw what Etta had not the courage to expressthat she blamed her for not having made the best of it and kept Ashbel
And Susan was by no means sure that the reproach in Ettas eyes and heart were not justified
I couldnt do it Etta she said with a faint suggestion of apology
Men are that way said Etta sullenly
Oh I dont blame him protested Susan
I understand
ButI cant do it EttaI simply cant
No said Etta
You couldnt
I could but you couldnt
Im not as far down as Ashbel
Im betwixt and between so I can understand you both
You go and make up with him and let me look after myself
Ill get along
Etta shook her head
No said she without any show of sentiment but like one stating an unalterable fact
Ive got to stay on with you
I cant live without you
I dont want to go down
I want to go up
Up
Susan smiled bitterly
Silence fell between them and Susan planned for the new conditions
She did not speak until Etta said What ever will we do
Weve got to give up the furniture
Thank goodness weve paid only twofifty on it
Yes its got to go said Etta
And weve got to pay Mrs Quinlan the six we owe her and get out tonight
Well go up to the top floorup to Mrs Cassatt
She takes sleepers
Thenwell see
An hour later they had moved for Mrs Quinlan was able to find two lodgers to take the rooms at once
They were established with Mrs Cassatt had a foul and foulsmelling bed and onehalf of her back room the other half barely contained two even dirtier and more malodorous cots in one of which slept Mrs Cassatts sixteenyearold daughter Kate in the other her fourteenyearold son Dan
For these new quarters and the right to cook their food on the Cassatt stove the girls agreed to pay three dollars and a half a weekwhich left them three dollars and a half a week for food and clothingand for recreation and for the exercise of the virtue of thrift which the comfortable so assiduously urge upon the poor
CHAPTER XXI EACH girl now had with her at all times everything she possessed in the worlda toothbrush a cake of castile soap the little money left out of the weeks wages these three items in the pocket of her one skirt a cheap dark blue cloth much wrinkled and patched a twentyfive cent felt hat Susans adorned with a blue ribbon Ettas with a bunch of faded roses a blue cotton blouse patched under the arms with stuff of a different shade an old misshapen corset that cost fortynine cents in a bargain sale a suit of gray shoddyandwool underwear a pair of fifteencent stockings Susans brown Ettas black a pair of worn and torn ties scuffed and down at the heel bought for a dollar and nine cents a dirtstained dark blue jacket Susans lacking one button Ettas lacking three and having a patch under the right arm
Yet they often laughed and joked with each other with their fellowworkers
You might have said their hearts were light for so eager are we to believe our fellowbeings comfortable a smile of povertys face convinces us straightway that it is as happy as we if not happier
There would have been to their mirth a little more than mere surface and youthful ability to find some jest in the most crushing tragedy if only they could have kept themselves clean
The lack of sufficient food was a severe trial for both had voracious appetites Etta was tormented by visions of quantity Susan by visions of quality as well as of quantity
But only at meal times or when they had to omit a meal entirely were they keenly distressed by the food question
The cold was a still severer trial but it was warm in the factory and it was warm in Mrs Cassatts flat whose windows were never opened from closing in of winter until spring came round
The inability to keep clean was the trial of trials
From her beginning at the box factory the physical uncleanness of the other girls had made Susan suffer keenly
And her suffering can be understood only by a clean person who has been through the same ordeal
She knew that her fellowworkers were not to blame
She even envied them the ignorance and the insensibility that enabled them to bear what she was convinced could never be changed
She wondered sometimes at the strength and grip of the religious belief among the girlseven or rather especially among those who had strayed from virtue into the path their priests and preachers and rabbis told them was the most sinful of all strayings
But she also saw many signs that religion was fast losing its hold
One day a Lutheran girl Emma Schmeltz said during a Monday morning lunch talk Well anyhow I believe its all a probation and everythingll be made right hereafter
I believe my religion I do
Yes well be rewarded in the hereafter
BeckyRebecca Lichtenspiellaughed as did most of the girls
Said Becky And there aint no hereafter
Did you ever see a corpse
Aint they the dead ones
Dont talk to me about no hereafter
Everybody laughed
But this was a Monday morning conversation high above the average of the girls talk in intelligence and liveliness
Their minds had been stimulated by the Sunday rest from the dreary and degenerating drudgery of honest toil
It was the physical contacts that most preyed upon Susan
She was too gentle too considerate to show her feelings in her determined and successful effort to conceal them she at times went to the opposite extreme and not only endured but even courted contacts that were little short of loathsome
Tongue could not tell what she suffered through the persistent affectionateness of Letty Southard a sweet and pretty young girl of wretchedly poor family who developed an enormous liking for her
Letty dirty and clad in noisome undergarments beneath soiled rags and patches was always hugging and kissing herand not to have submitted would have been to stab poor Letty to the heart and humiliate all the other girls
So no one not even Etta suspected what she was going through
From her coming to the factory in the morning to hang her hat and jacket in the only possible place along with the soiled and smelling and often vermininfected wraps of the othersfrom early morning until she left at night she was forced into contacts to which custom never in the least blunted her
However so long as she had a home with the Brashears there was the nightly respite
But now There was little water and only a cracked and filthy basin to wash in
There was no chance to do laundry work for their underclothes must be used as night clothes also
To wash their hair was impossible
Does my hair smell as bad as yours
said Etta
You neednt think yours is clean because it doesnt show the dirt like mine
Does my hair smell as bad as the rest of the girls
said Susan
Not quite was Ettas consoling reply
By making desperate efforts they contrived partially to wash their bodies once a week not without interruptions of privacyto which however they soon grew accustomed
In spite of efforts which were literally heroic they could not always keep free from parasites for the whole tenement and all persons and things in it were infectedand how could it be otherwise where no one had time or money or any effective means whatsoever to combat natures inflexible determination to breed wherever there is a breeding spot
The last traces of civilization were slipping from the two girls they were sinking to a state of nature
Even personal pride powerful in Susan and strong in Etta through Susans example was deserting them
They no longer minded Dans sleeping in their room
They saw him his father the other members of the family in all stages of nudity and at the most private acts and they were seen by the Cassatts in the same way
To avoid this was impossible as impossible as to avoid the parasites swarming in the bed in the woodwork in cracks of ceiling walls floor
The Cassatts were an example of how much the people who live in the sheltered and more or less sunny nooks owe to their shelter and how little to their own boasted superiority of mind and soul
They had been a high class artisan family until a few months before
The hard times struck them a series of quick savage blows such as are commonplace enough under our social system intricate because a crude jumble of makeshifts and easily disordered because intricate
They were swept without a breathing pause down to the bottom
Those who have always been accustomed to prosperity have no reserve of experience or courage to enable them to recuperate from sudden and extreme adversity
In an amazingly short time the Cassatts had become demoralizeda familiar illustration of how civilization is merely a waferthin veneer over most human beings as yet
Over how many is it more
They fought after a fashion they fought valiantly
But how would it have been possible not steadily to yield ground against such a pitiless powerful foe as poverty
The man had taken to drink to blunt outraged selfrespect and to numb his despair before the spectacle of his familys downfall
Mrs Cassatt was as poor a manager as the average woman in whatever walk of life thanks to the habit of educating woman in the most slipshod fashion if at all in any other part of the business but sextrickery
Thus she was helpless before the tenement conditions
She gave up went soddenly about in rags with an incredibly greasy and usually dangling tail of hair
Why dont you tie up that tail ma
said the son Dan who had ideas about neatness
Whats the use
said Mrs Cassatt
Whats the use of anything
Ma dont want to look stylish and stuck up said the daughter
Mrs Cassatts haunting terror was lest someone who had known them in the days of their prosperity with a decently furnished little house of their own should run into one of the family now
Kate the sixteenyearold had a place as saleslady in a big shop in Fifth Street her six dollars a week was the familys entire steady income
She had formerly possessed a good deal of finery for a girl in her position though really not much more than the daughter of the average prosperous artisan or small shopkeeper expects and is expected to have
Being at the shop where finery was all the talk and sight and thought from opening until closing had developed in her a greedy taste for luxury
She pilfered from the stocks of goods within her reach and exchanged her stealings for the stealings of girls who happened to be able to get things more to her liking or need
But now that the family savingsbank account was exhausted all these pilferings had to go at once to the pawnshop
Kate grew more and more illtempered as the family sank
Formerly she had been noted for her amiability for her vanity easily pleased with a careless compliment from no matter whoma jocose halfdrunken ash man halfjeering halfadmiring from his cart seat quite as satisfactory as anybody
But poverty was bringing out in her all those meanest and most selfish and most brutish instinctsthose primal instincts of human nature that civilization has slowly been subjecting to the process of atrophy which has lost us such other primal attributes as for example prehensile toes and a covering of hair
Well I for one dont have to stay in this slop barrel Kate was always saying
Some fine morning Ill turn up missingand youll see me in my own turnout
She was torturing her mother and father with the dread that she would leave the family in the lurch and enter a house of prostitution
She recounted with the utmost detail how the madam of a house in Longworth Street came from time to time to her counter in the perfumery and soap departmentand urged her to stop making a fool of yourself and come get good money for your looks before you lose em drudging behind a counter
The idea grew less abhorrent took on allurement as the degradation of tenement life ate out respect for conventional restraintsfor modesty for virtue for cleanness of speech and the rest
More and more boldly Kate was announcing that she wasnt going to be a fool much longer
Dan the fourteenyearold boy had attracted the attention of what Cassatt called a fancy lady who lived two floors below them
She made sometimes as much as nine or ten dollars a week and slept all day or lounged comfortably about in showy tawdry stuff that in those surroundings seemed elegant luxury
She was caught by the boys young beauty and strength and was rapidly training him in every vice and was fitting him to become a professional seducer and lover
Said Mrs Cassatt in one of her noisy wailing appeals to Dan You better keep away from that there soiled dove
They tell me shes a thiefhas done timehas robbed drunken men in dark hallways
Dan laughed impudently
Shes a cute one
What diff does it make how she gets the goods as long as she gets it
Mrs Cassatt confided to everybody that she was afraid the woman would make a thief of her boyand there was no disputing the justice of her forebodings
Foul smells and sights everywhere and foul language no privacy no possibility of modesty where all must do all in the same room vermin parasites bad food vilely cookedin the midst of these and a multitude of similar ills how was it possible to maintain a human standard even if one had by chance acquired a knowledge of what constituted a human standard
The Cassatts were sinking into the slime in which their neighbors were already wallowing
But there was this difference
For the Cassatts it was a descent for many of their neighbors it was an ascentfor the immigrants notably who had been worse off in their European homes in this land not yet completely in the grip of the capitalist or wage system they were now getting the first notions of decency and development the first views and hope of rising in the world
The Cassatts though they had always lived too near the slime to be nauseated by it still found it disagreeable and in spots disgusting
Their neighbors One of the chief reasons why these people were rising so slowly where they were rising at all was that the slime seemed to them natural and to try to get clean of it seemed rather a foolish finicky waste of time and effort
People who have come upby accident or by their own force or by the force of some at once shrewd and brutal member of the familyhave to be far and long from the slums before they lose the sense that in conforming to the decencies of life they are making absurd effeminate concessions
When they go to buy a toothbrush they blush and stammer
Look at Lorna and Etta Mrs Cassatt was always saying to Kate
Well I see em Kate would reply
And I dont see much
Aint you ashamed of yourself
cried the mother
Them two lives straight and decent
And youre better off than they are
Dont preach to me ma sneered Kate
When I get ready Illstop making a damn fool of myself
But the example of the two girls was not without its effect
They struggling on in chastity against appalling odds became the models not only to Mrs Cassatt but all the mothers of that row held up to their daughters
The mothersall of them by observation not a few by experienceknew what the fancy ladys life really meant
And they strove mightily to keep their daughters from it
Not through religion or moral feeling though many pretendedperhaps fanciedthat this was their reason but through the plainest kind of practical sensethe kind that in the broad determines the actions of human beings of whatever class however lofty the idealistic pretenses may be
These mothers knew that the profession of the pariah meant a short life and a wretched one meant disease lower and ever lower wages the scale swiftly descending meant all the miseries of respectability plus a heavy burden of miseries of its own
There were many other girls besides Susan and Etta holding up their headsgirls with prospects of matrimony girls with fairly good wages girls with fathers and brothers at work and able to provide a home
But Susan and Etta were peculiarly valuable as examples because they were making the fight alone and unaided
Thus they were watched closely
In those neighborhoods everyone knows everyones else business down to how the last cent is got and spent
If either girl had appeared in a new pair of shoes a new hat a new garment of any kind at once the report would have sped that the wearer had taken a turn in the streets
And the scandal would have been justified for where could either have respectably got the money for the smallest and cheapest addition to her toilet
Matson too proudly pointed them out as giving the lie to the talk about working girls not getting living wages to the muttering against him and his fellow employers as practically procurers for the pavement and the dive for the charity hospitals most dreadful wards for the Morgues most piteous boxes and slabs
As their strength declined as their miseries ate in and in the two girls ceased talking together they used to chatter much of the time like two birds on a leafy sunny bough
Now they walked ate their scanty repulsive meals dressed worked all in silence
When their eyes met both glanced guiltily away each fearing the other would discover the thought she was revolvingthe thought of the streets
They slept badlyEtta sometimes Susan every night
For a long time after she came to the tenements she had not slept well despite her youth and the dull toil that wore her out each day
But after many months she had grown somewhat used to the noisinessto fretting babies to wailing children the mixed ale parties the quarrelings of the ill and the drunk the incessant restlessness wherever people are huddled so close together that repose is impossible
And she had gradually acquired the habit of sleeping wellthat is well for the tenement region where no one ever gets the rest without which health is impossible
Now sleeplessness came againhours on hours of listening to the hateful and maddening discords of densely crowded humanity hours on hours of thinkingthinkingin the hopeless circles like those of a caged animal treading with soft swift step round and round nose to the iron wall eyes gleaming with despairing pain
One Saturday evening after a supper of scorched cornmeal which had been none too fresh when they got it at the swindling grocers on the street floor Etta put on the tattered patched old skirt at which she had been toiling
I cant make it fit to wear said she
Its too far gone I thinkher eyelids flutteredIll go see some of the girls
Susan who was darningseated on the one chairyes it had once been a chairdid not look up or speak
Etta put on her hatslowly
Then with a stealthy glance at Susan she moved slidingly toward the door
As she reached it Susans hands dropped to her lap so tense were Ettas nerves that the gesture made her startle
Etta
said Susan in an appealing voice
Ettas hand dropped from the knob
Wellwhat is it Lorna
she asked in a low nervous tone
Look at me dear
Etta tried to obey could not
Dont do ityet said Susan
Waita few more days
Wait for what
I dont know
Butwait
You get four I get only threeand theres no chance of a raise
I work slower instead of faster
Im going to be discharged soon
Im in rags underneath



Ive got to go before I get sickand wont have anything toto sell
Susan did not reply
She stared at the remains of a cheap stocking in her lap
Yes there was no doubt about it Ettas health was going
Etta was strong but she had no such store of strength to draw upon as had accumulated for Susan during the seventeen years of simple regular life in healthful surroundings
A little while and Etta would be illwould perhapsprobablyalmost certainlydie Dan Cassatt came in at the other door sat on the edge of his bed and changed his trousers for what he was pleased to imagine a less disreputable pair
Midway the boy stopped and eyed Susans bare leg and foot a grin of pleasure and amusement on his precociously and viciously mature face
My but you keep clean he cried
And youve got a mighty pretty foot
Minnies is ugly as hell
Minnie was the fancy lady on the floor belowmy skirt he called her
Susan evidently did not hear his compliment
Dan completed his sporting toilet with a sleeking down of his long greasy hair took himself away to his girl
Susan was watching a bug crawl down the wall toward their bed with its stained and malodorous covers of rag
Etta was still standing by the door motionless
She sighed once more put her hand on the knob
Susans voice came again
Youve never been out have you
No replied Etta
Susan began to put on her stocking
Ill go said she
Ill goinstead
No
cried Etta sobbing
It dont matter about me
Im bound to be sucked under
Youve got a chance to pull through
Not a ghost of a chance answered Susan
Ill go
Youve never been
I know but Youve never been continued Susan fastening her shoe with its ragged string
Youve never been
WellI have
You
exclaimed Etta horrified though unbelieving
Oh no you havent
Yes said Susan
And worse
And worse
repeated Etta
Is that what the look I sometimes see in your eyeswhen you dont know anyones seeingis that what it means
I suppose so
Ill go
You stay here
And youout there
It doesnt mean much to me
Etta looked at her with eyes as devoted as a dogs
Then well go together she said
Susan pinning on her weatherstained hat reflected
Very well she said finally
Theres nothing lower than this
They said no more they went out into the clear cold winter night out under the brilliant stars
Several handsome theater buses were passing on their way from the fashionable suburb to the theater
Etta looked at them at the splendid horses at the men in top hats and fur coatsclean looking fine looking amiable looking menat the beautiful fur wraps of the delicate womenwhat complexionswhat lovely hairwhat jewels
Etta her heart bursting her throat choking glanced at Susan to see whether she too was observing
But Susans eyes were on the tenement they had just left
What are you looking atso queer
asked Etta
I was thinking that well not come back here
Etta started
Not come back home Susan gave a strange short laugh
Home


No well not come back home
Theres no use doing things halfway
Weve made the plunge
Well gothe limit
Etta shivered
She admired the courage but it terrified her
Theres somethingsomethingawful about you Lorna she said
Youve changed till youre like a different person from what you were when you came to the restaurant
Sometimesthat look in your eyeswell it takes my breath away
It takes my breath away too
Come on
At the foot of the hill they took the shortest route for Vine Street the highway of the citys night life
Though they were so young and walked briskly their impoverished blood was not vigorous enough to produce a reaction against the sharp wind of the zero night which nosed through their few thin garments and bit into their bodies as if they were naked
They came to a vast department store
Each of its great showwindows flooded with light was a fascinating display of clothing for women upon wax modelscostly jackets and cloaks of wonderful furs white brown gray rich and glossy black underclothes fine and soft with ribbons and flounces and laces silk stockings and graceful shoes and slippers dresses for street for ball for afternoon dresses with form with lines dresses elegantly plain dresses richly embroidered
Despite the cold the two girls lingered going from window to window their freezing faces pinched and purple their eyes gazing hungrily
Now that weve tried em all on said Susan with a short and bitter laugh lets dress in our dirty rags again and go
Oh I couldnt imagine myself in any of those thingscould you
cried Etta
Yes answered Susan
And better
You were brought up to have those things I know
Susan shook her head
But Im going to have them
When
said Etta scenting romance
Soon
As soon as I learn was Susans absent unsatisfactory reply
Etta had gone back to her own misery and the contrasts to it
I get mad through and through she cried when I think how all those things go to some womenwomen that never did work and never could
And they get them because they happen to belong to rich fathers and husbands or whoever protects them
It isnt fair
It makes me crazy
Susan gave a disdainful shrug
Whats the use of that kind of talk
said she
No use at all
The thing is we havent got what we want and weve got to get itand so weve got to learn how
I cant think of anything but the cold said Etta
My God how cold I am
There isnt anything I wouldnt do to get warm
There isnt anything anybody wouldnt do to get warm if they were as cold as this
Its all very well for warm people to talk Oh Im sick of all the lying and faking anyhow
Do you believe in hell Lorna
Not in a hot one said Susan
Soon they struck into Vine Street bright as day almost and lined with beer halls concert gardens restaurants
Through the glass fronts crowds of men and women were visiblecontented faces wellfed bodies food on the tables or invitinglooking drink
Along the sidewalk poured an eager throng all the conspicuous faces in it notable for the expectancy of pleasure in the eyes
Isnt this different
exclaimed Etta
My God how cold I amand how warm everybody else is but us
The sights the sounds of laughter of gay music acted upon her like an intoxicant
She tossed her head in a reckless gesture
I dont care what becomes of me said she
Im ready for anything except dirt and starvation
Nevertheless they hurried down Vine Street avoiding the glances of the men and behaving as if they were two working girls in a rush to get home
As they walked Susan to delude herself into believing that she was not hesitating with fainting courage talked incessantly to Ettatold her the things Mabel Connemora had explained to herabout how a woman could and must take care of her health if she were not to be swept under like the great mass of the ignorant careless women of the pariah class
Susan was astonished that she remembered all the actress had told herremembered it easily as if she had often thought of it had used the knowledge habitually
They arrived at Fountain Square tired from the long walk
They were both relieved and depressed that nothing had happened
We might go round the fountain and then back suggested Susan
They made the tour less rapidly but still keeping their heads and their glances timidly down
They were numb with the cold now
To the sharp agony had succeeded an ache like the steady grinding pain of rheumatism
Etta broke the silence with Maybe we ought to go into a house
A house
Ohyou mean aa sporting house
At that time professional prostitution had not become widespread among the working class stationary or falling wages advancing cost of food and developing demand for comfort and luxury had as yet only begun to produce their inevitable results
Thus prostitution as an industry was in the main segregated in certain streets and certain houses and the prostitutes were a distinct class
You havent been
inquired Etta
No said Susan
Dan Cassatt and Kate told me about those places Etta went on
Kate says theyre fine and the girls make fifty and sometimes a hundred dollars a week and have everythingservants to wait on them good food bathrooms lovely clothes and can drive out
But II think Id stay in the house
I want to be my own boss said Susan
Theres another side than what Kate says continued Etta as consecutively as her chattering teeth would permit
She heard from a madam that wants her to come
But Dan heard from Minnieshe used to be in oneand she says the girls are slaves that theyre treated like dogs and have to take anything
She says its something dreadful the way men acteven the gentlemen
She says the madam fixes things so that every girl always owes her money and dont own a stitch to her back and so couldnt leave if she wanted to
That sounds more like the truth said Susan
But we may have to go pleaded Etta
Its awful coldand if we went at least wed have a warm place
If we wanted to leave why we couldnt be any worse off for clothes than we are
Susan had no answer for this argument
They went several squares up Vine Street in silence
Then Etta burst out again Im frozen through and through Lorna and Im dead tiredand hungry
The winds cutting the flesh off my bones
What in the hell does it matter what becomes of us
Lets get warm for Gods sake
Lets go to a house
Theyre in Longworth Streetthe best ones
And she came to a halt forcing Susan to halt also
It happened to be the corner of Eighth Street
Susan saw the iron fence the leafless trees of Garfield Place
Lets go down this way said she
I had luck here once
Luck
said Etta her curiosity triumphant over all
Susans answer was a strange laugh
Ahead of them a woman warmly and showily dressed was sauntering along
Thats one of them said Etta
Lets see how she does it
Weve got to learn quick
I cant stand this cold much longer
The two girls their rags fluttering about their miserable bodies kept a few feet behind the woman watched her with hollow eyes of envy and fear
Tears of anguish from the cold were streaming down their cheeks
Soon a man alonea youngish man with a lurching stepcame along
They heard the woman say Hello dear
Dont be in a hurry
He tried to lurch past her but she seized him by the lapel of his overcoat
Lemme go said he
Youre old enough to be a grandmother you old hag
Susan and Etta halted and watching so interestedly that they forgot themselves heard her laugh at his insult heard her say wheedlingly Come along dearie Ill treat you right
Youre the kind of a lively joky fellow I like
Go to hell granma said the man roughly shaking her off and lurching on toward the two girls
He stopped before them eyed them by the light of the big electric lamp grinned goodnaturedly
Whatve we got here
said he
This looks better
The woman rushed toward the girls pouring out a stream of vileness
You git out of here
she shrilled
You chippies git off my beat
Ill have you pinchedI will
Shut up
cried the drunken man lifting his fist
Ill have you pinched
Let these ladies alone theyre friends of mine
Do you want me to call the cop
The woman glanced toward the corner where a policeman was standing twirling his club
She turned away cursing horribly
The man laughed
Dirty old hagisnt she
said he
Dont look so scared birdies
He caught them each by an arm stared woozily at Etta
Youre a good little looker you are
Come along with me
Theres three in it
II cant leave my lady friend Etta succeeded in chattering
Please really I cant
Your lady friend
He turned his drunken head in Susans direction squinted at her
He was rather goodlooking
Ohshe means you
Fact is Im so soused I thought I was seein double
Why youre a peach
Ill take you
And he released his hold on Etta to seize her
Come right along my loveydovey dear
Susan drew away she was looking at him with terror and repulsion
The icy blast swept down the street sawed into her flesh savagely
Ill give you five said the drunken man
Come along
He grabbed her arm waved his other hand at Etta
So long blondie
Nother time
Good luck
Susan heard Ettas gasp of horror
She wrenched herself free again
I guess Id better go with him said she to Etta
Etta began to sob
Oh Lorna
she moaned
Its awful
You go into the restaurant on the corner and get something to eat and wait for me
We can afford to spend the money
And youll be warm there
Here
Here
cried the tipsy man
Whatre you two whispering about
Come along skinny
No offense
I like em slim
And he made coarse and pointed remarks about the sluggishness of fat women laughing loudly at his own wit
The two girls did not hear
The wind straight from the Arctic was plying its hideous lash upon their defenseless bodies
Come on lovey
cried the man
Lets go in out of the cold
Oh Lorna
You cant go with a drunken man
IllIll take him
I can stand it bettern you
You can go when theres a gentleman  You dont know said Susan
Didnt I tell you Id been through the worst
Are you coming
broke in the man shaking his head to scatter the clouds over his sight
The cold was lashing Susans body and she was seeing the tenement she had leftthe vermin crawling the filth everywhere the meal bugs in the rotting corn mealand Jeb Ferguson
Wait in the restaurant said she to Etta
Didnt I tell you Im a nobody
This is whats expected of me
The wind clawed and tore at her quivering flesh
Its cold Etta
Go get warm
Goodby
She yielded to the tipsy mans tugging at her arm
Etta stood as if paralyzed watching the two move slowly westward
But cold soon triumphed over horror
She retraced her steps toward Vine Street
At the corner stood an elderly man with an irongray beard
She merely glanced at him in passing and so was startled when he said in a low voice Go back the way you came
Ill join you
She glanced at him again saw a gleam in his eyes that assured her she had not imagined the request
Trembling and all at once hot she kept on across the street
But instead of going into the restaurant she walked past it and east through dark Eighth Street
A few yards and she heard a quiet step behind her
A few yards more and the lights of Vine Street threw a mans shadow upon the sidewalk beside her
From sheer fright she halted
The man faced hera man old enough to be her father a most respectable clean looking man with a certain churchly though hardly clerical air about him
Good evening miss said he
Good evening she faltered
Im a strangerin town to buy goods and have a little fun stammered he with a grotesque attempt to be easy and familiar
I thought maybe you could help me
A little fun
Ettas lips opened but no words came
The cold was digging its needleknives into flesh into bone into nerve
Through the mans thick beard and mustache came the gleam of large teeth the twisting of thick raw lips
A little fun
Would it continued the man nervously would it be very dear
II dont know faltered Etta
I could affordsay he looked at her dresssaytwo dollars
II And again Etta could get no further
The roomd be a dollar pleaded the man
Thatd make it three
IIcant burst out Etta hysterical
Oh please let me alone
IIm a good girl but I do need money
But II cant
Oh for Gods sakeIm so coldso cold
The man was much embarrassed
Oh Im sorry he said feelingly
Thats rightkeep your virtue
Go home to your parents
He was at ease now his voice was greasy and his words sleek with the unction of an elder
I thought you were a soiled dove
Im glad you spoke outglad for my sake as well as your own
Ive got a daughter about your age
Go home my dear and stay a good girl
I know its hard sometimes but never give up your puritynever
And he lifted his squaretopped hard hat and turned away
Suddenly Etta felt again the fury of the winter night and icy wind
As that wind flapped her thin skirt and tortured her flesh she cried Waitplease
I was justjust fooling
The man had halted but he was looking at her uncertainly
Etta put her hand on his arm and smiled pertly up at himsmiled as she had seen other street girls smile in the days when she despised them
Ill goif youll give me three
II dont think I care to go now
You sort of put me out of the humor
Welltwo then
She gave a reckless laugh
God how cold it is
Anybodyd go to hell to get warm a night like this
You are a very pretty girl said the man
He was warmly dressed his was not the thin blood of poverty
He could not have appreciated what she was feeling
Youre sure you want to go
Youre sure its youryour business
Yes
Im strange in this part of town
Do you know a place
An hour later Etta went into the appointed restaurant
Her eyes searched anxiously for Susan but did not find her
She inquired at the counter
No one had asked there for a young lady
This both relieved her and increased her nervousness Susan had not come and gonebut would she come
Etta was so hungry that she could hold out no longer
She sat at a table near the door and took up the large sheet on which was printed the bill of fare
She was almost alone in the place as it was between dinner and supper
She read the bill thoroughly then ordered black bean soup a sirloin steak and German fried potatoes
This she had calculated would cost altogether a dollar undoubtedly an extravagance but everything at that restaurant seemed dear in comparison with the prices to which she had been used and she felt horribly empty
She ordered the soup to stay her while the steak was broiling
As soon as the waiter set down bread and butter she began upon it greedily
As the soup came in walked Susancalm and selfpossessed Etta saw at first glance
Ive been so frightened
Youll have a plate of soup
asked Etta trying to look and speak in unconcerned fashion
No thank you replied Susan seating herself opposite
Theres a steak cominga goodsized one the waiter said itd be
Very well
Susan spoke indifferently
Arent you hungry
I dont know
Ill see
Susan was gazing straight ahead
Her eyes were distinctly graygray and as hard as Susan Lenoxs eyes could be
Whatre you thinking about
I dont know she laughed queerly
Wasitdreadful
A pause then Nothing is going to be dreadful to me any more
Its all in the game as Mr Burlingham used to say
Burlinghamwhos he
It was Ettas first faint clew toward that mysterious past of Susans into which she longed to peer
Oha man I knew
Hes dead
A long pause Etta watching Susans unreadable face
At last she said You dont seem a bit excited
Susan came back to the present
Dont I
Your soups getting cold
Etta ate several spoonfuls then said with an embarrassed attempt at a laugh II went too
Susan slowly turned upon Etta her gazethe gaze of eyes softening becoming violet
Ettas eyes dropped and the color flooded into her fair skin
He was an old manforty or maybe fifty she explained nervously
He gave me two dollars
I nearly didnt get him
I lost my nerve and told him I was good and was only starting because I needed money
Never whine said Susan
Its no use
Take what comes and wait for a winning hand
Etta looked at her in a puzzled way
How queer you talk
Not a bit like yourself
You sound so much older



And your eyesthey dont look natural at all
Indeed they looked supernatural
The last trace of gray was gone
They were of the purest deepest violet luminous mysterious with that aweinspiring expression of utter aloneness
But as Etta spoke the expression changed
The gray came back and with it a glance of irony
Said she Ohnonsense
Im all right
I didnt mind nearly as much as I thought I would
Yes Ill get used to it
You mustnt said Susan
But Ive got to
Weve got to do it but we havent got to get used to it replied Susan
Etta was still puzzling at this when the dinner now camea fine thick broiled steak the best steak Susan had ever seen and the best food Etta had ever seen
They had happened upon one of those famous Cincinnati chop houses where in plain surroundings the highest quality of plain food is served
You are hungry arent you Lorna
said Etta
YesIm hungry declared Susan
Cut itquick
Draught beer or bottled
asked the waiter
Bring us draught beer said Etta
I havent tasted beer since our restaurant burned
I never tasted it said Susan
But Ill try it tonight
Etta cut two thick slices from the steak put them on Susans plate with some of the beautifully browned fried potatoes
Gracious they have good things to eat here
she exclaimed
Then she cut two thick slices for herself and filled her mouth
Her eyes glistened the color came into her pale cheeks
Isnt it grand
she cried when there was room for words to pass out
Grand agreed Susan a marvelous change of expression in her face also
The beer came
Etta drank a quarter of the tall glass at once
Susan tasted rather liked the fresh bittersweet odor and flavor
Is itvery intoxicating
she inquired
If you drink enough said Etta
But not one glass
Susan took quite a drink
I feel a lot less tired already declared she
Me too said Etta
My what a meal
I never had anything like this in my life
When I think what weve been through
Lorna will it last
We mustnt think about that said Susan
Tell me what happened to you
Nothing
He gave me the money that was all
Then weve got seven dollarsseven dollars and twenty cents with what we brought away from home with us
Seven dollarsand twenty cents repeated Susan thoughtfully
Then a queer smile played around the corners of her mouth
Seven dollarsthats a weeks wages for both of us at Matsons
But Id go back to honest work tomorrowif I could find a good job Etta said eagerlytoo eagerly
Wouldnt you Lorna
I dont know replied Susan
She had the inability to make pretenses either to others or to herself which characterizes stupid people and also the large simple natures
Oh you cant mean that
protested Etta
Instead of replying Susan began to talk of what to do next
We must find a place to sleep and we must buy a few things to make a better appearance
I dont dare spend anything yet said Etta
Ive got only my two dollars
Not that when this meals paid for
Were going to share even said Susan
As long as either has anything it belongs to both
The tears welled from Ettas eyes
You are too good Lorna
You mustnt be
It isnt the way to get on
Anyhow I cant accept anything from you
You wouldnt take anything from me
Weve got to help each other up insisted Susan
We share evenand lets not talk any more about it
Now what shall we get
How much ought we to lay out
The waiter here interrupted
Beg pardon young ladies said he
Over yonder at the table four down theres a couple of gents thatd like to join you
I seen one of em flash quite a roll and they acts too like easy spenders
As Susan was facing that way she examined them
They were young men rather blond with smooth faces goodnatured eyes and mouths they were well dressedone the handsomer notably so
Susan merely glanced both men at once smiled at her with an unimpertinent audacity that probably came out of the champagne bottle in a silver bucket of ice on their table
Shall I tell em to come over
said the waiter
Yes replied Susan
She was calm but Etta twitched with nervousness saying I wish Id had your experience
I wish we didnt look so dreadfulme especially
Im not pretty enough to stand out against these awful clothes
The two men were pushing eagerly toward them the taller and less handsome slightly in advance
He said his eyes upon Susan We were lonesome and you looked a little that way too
Were much obliged
He glanced at the waiter
Another bottle of the same
I dont want anything to drink said Susan
Nor I chimed in Etta
No thank you
The young man waved the waiter away with Get it for my friend and me then
He smiled agreeably at Susan
You wont mind my friend and me drinking
Oh no 
And maybe youll change your mind said the shorter man to Etta
You see if we all drink well get acquainted faster
Dont you like champagne
I never tasted it Etta confessed
Neither did I admitted Susan
Youre sure to like it said the taller man to Susanhis friend presently addressed him as John
Noththingsic equal to it for making friends
I like it for itself and I like it for the friends it has made me
Champagne was not one of the commonplaces of that modest chop house
So the waiter opened the bottle with much ceremony
Susan and Etta startled when the cork popped ceilingward in the way that in such places is still regarded as fashionable
They watched with interested eyes the pouring of the beautiful pale amber liquid were fascinated when they saw how the bubbles surged upward incessantly imprisoned joys thronging to escape
And after the first glass the four began to have the kindliest feelings for each other
Sorrow and shame poverty and foreboding took wings unto themselves and flew away
The girls felt deliciously warm and contented and thought the young men charminga splendid change from the coarse badly dressed youths of the tenement with their ignorant speech and rough misshapen hands
They were ashamed of their own hands were painfully selfconscious whenever lifting the glass to the lips brought them into view
Ettas hands in fact were not so badly spoiled as might have been expected considering her long years of rough work the nails were in fairly good condition and the skin was rougher to the touch than to the sight
Susans hands had not really been spoiled as yet
She had been proud of them and had taken care of them still they were not the hands of a lady but of a working girl
The young men had gentlemens handsstrong evidently exercised only at sports not at degrading and deforming toil
The shorter and handsomer youth who answered to the name of Fatty for obvious but not too obvious reasons addressed himself to Etta
Johnwho it came out was a Chicagoan visiting Fattyfell to Susan
The champagne made him voluble he was soon telling all about himselfa senior at Ann Arbor as was Fatty also he intended to be a lawyer he was fond of a good time was fond of the girlsliked girls who were gay rather than respectable onesbecause with the prim girls you have to quit just as the fun ought really to begin
After two glasses Susan warned by a slight dizziness stopped drinking Etta followed her example
But the boys kept on ordered a second bottle
This is the fourth weve had tonight said Fatty proudly when it came
Dont it make you dizzy
asked Etta
Not a bit Fatty assured her
But she noticed that his tongue now swung trippingly loose
You havent been atat thislong have you
inquired John of Susan
Not long replied she
Etta somewhat giddied overheard and put in We began tonight
We got tired of starving and freezing
John looked deepest sympathy into Susans calm violetgray eyes
I dont blame you said he
A woman does have aa hades of a time
We were going out to buy some clothes when you came proceeded Etta
Were in an awful state
I wondered how two girls with faces like yours said John came to be dressed soso differently
That was what first attracted us
Then as Etta and Fatty were absorbed in each other he went on to Susan And your eyesI mustnt forget them
You certainly have got a beautiful face
And your mouthso sweet and sadbut what a lovely lovely smile
At this Susan smiled still more broadly with pleasure
Im glad youre pleased said she
Why if you were dressed up Youre not a working girl by birth are you
I wish I had been said Susan
Oh I think a girls got as good a right as a man to have a good time lied John
Dont say things you dont believe said Susan
It isnt necessary
I can hand that back to you
You werent frank yourself when you said you wished youd been born in the class of your friendand of my friend Fatty too
Susans laugh was confession
The champagne was dancing in her blood
She said with a reckless toss of the head I was born nothing
So Im free to become anything I please anything except respectable
Here Fatty broke in
Ill tell you what lets do
Lets all go shopping
We can help you girls select your things
Susan laughed
Were going to buy about three dollars worth
There wont be any selecting
Well simply take the cheapest
Thenlets go shopping said John and you two girls can help Fatty and me select clothes for you
Thats the talk
cried Fatty
And he summoned the waiter
The bill said he in the manner of a man who likes to enjoy the servility of servants
We hadnt paid for our supper said Susan
How much was it Etta
A dollar twentyfive
Were going to pay for that said Fatty
What dye take us for
Oh no
We must pay it said Susan
Dont be foolish
Of course Ill pay
No said Susan quietly ignoring Ettas wink
And from her bosom she took a crumpled fivedollar bill
I should say you were new laughed John
You dont even know where to carry your money yet
And they all laughed Susan and Etta because they felt gay and assumed the joke whatever it was must be a good one
Then John laid his hand over hers and said Put your money away
Susan looked straight at him
I cant allow it she said
Im not that pooryet
John colored
I beg your pardon he said
And when the bill came he compelled Fatty to let her pay a dollar and a quarter of it out of her crumpled five
The two girls were fascinated by the large roll of billsfives tens twentieswhich Fatty took from his trousers pocket
They stared openeyed when he laid a twenty on the waiters plate along with Susans five
And it frightened them when he after handing Susan her change had left only a twodollar bill four silver quarters and a dime
He gave the silver to the waiter
Was that for a tip
asked Susan
Yes said Fatty
I always give about ten per cent of the bill unless it runs over ten dollars
In that casea quarter a person as a rule
Of course if the bill was very large Id give more
He was showing his amusement at her inquisitiveness
I wanted to know explained she
Im very ignorant and Ive got to learn
Thats right said John admiringlywith a touch of condescension
Dont be afraid to confess ignorance
Im not replied Susan
I used to be afraid of not being respectable and that was all
Now I havent any fear at all
You are a queer one
exclaimed John
You oughtnt to be in this life
Where then
asked she
I dont know he confessed
Neither do I
Her expression suddenly was absent with a quaint slight smile hovering about her lips
She looked at him merrily
You see its got to be something that isnt respectable
What do you mean
demanded he
Her answer was a laugh
Fatty declared it too cold to chase about afootAnyhow its latenearly eleven and unless were quick all the storesll be closed
The waiter called them a carriage its driver promised to take them to a shop that didnt close till midnight on Saturdays
Said Fatty as they drove away Well I suppose Etta youll say youve never been in a carriage before
Oh yes I have cried Etta
Twiceat funerals
This made everyone laughthis and the champagne and the air which no longer seemed cruel to the girls but stimulating a grateful change from the close warmth of the room
As the boys were smoking cigarettes they had the windows down
The faces of both girls were flushed and lively and their cheeks seemed already to have filled out
The four made so much noise that the crowds on the sidewalk were looking at themlooking smilingly delighted by the sight of such gayety
Susan was even gayer than Etta
She sang she took a puff at Johns cigarette then laughed loudly when he seized and kissed her laughed again as she kissed him and she and John fell into each others arms and laughed uproariously as they saw Fatty and Etta embracing
The driver kept his promise eleven oclock found them bursting into Sternbergs over the Rhinea famous department store for Germans of all classes
They had an hour and they made good use of it
Etta was for yielding to Fattys generous urgings and buying right and left
But Susan would not have it
She told the men what she and Etta would takea simple complete outfit and no more
Etta wanted furs and finery
Susan kept her to plain serviceable things
Only once did she yield
When Etta and Fatty begged to be allowed a big showy hat Susan yieldedbut gave John leave to buy her only the simplest of simple hats
You neednt tell me any yarns about your birth and breeding said he in a low tone so that Etta should not hear
But that subject did not interest Susan
Lets forget it said she almost curtly
Ive cut out the pastand the future
Todays enough for me
And for me too protested he
I hope youre having as good fun as I am
This is the first time Ive really laughed in nearly a year said she
You dont know what it means to be poor and hungry and coldworst of all cold
You unhappy child said John tenderly
But Susan was laughing again and making jokes about a wonderful German party dress all covered with beads and lace and ruffles and embroidery
When they reached the shoe department Susan asked John to take Fatty away
He understood that she was ashamed of their patched and holed stockings and hastened to obey
They were making these their last purchases when the big bell rang for the closing
Im glad these poor tired shopgirls and clerks are set free said John
It was one of those wellmeaning but worthless commonplaces of wordkindness that get for their utterance perhaps exaggerated credit for good heart
Susan consciencestricken halted
And I never once thought of them
she exclaimed
It just shows
Shows what
Oh nothing
Come on
I must forget that for I cant be happy again till I do
I understand now why the comfortable people can be happy
They keep from knowing or they make themselves forget
Why not
said John
Whats the use in being miserable about things that cant be helped
No use at all replied the girl
She laughed
Ive forgotten
The carriage was so filled with their bundles that they had some difficulty in making room for themselvesfinally accomplished it by each girl sitting on her young mans lap
They drove to a quietly placed scrupulously clean little hotel overlooking Lincoln Park
Were going to take rooms here and dress explained Fatty
Then well wander out and have some supper
By this time Susan and Etta had lost all sense of strangeness
The spirit of adventure was rampant in them as in a dreaming child
And the life they had been livingwhat they had seen and heard and grown accustomed tomade it easy for them to strike out at once and briskly in the new road so different from the dreary and cruel path along which they had been plodding
They stood laughing and joking in the parlor while the boys registered then the four went up to two small but comfortable and fascinatingly clean rooms with a large bathroom between
Fatty and I will go down to the bar while you two dress said John
Not on your life
exclaimed Fatty
Well have the bar brought up to us
But John fortified by Susans look of gratitude for his tactfulness whispered to his friendwhat Susan could easily guess
And Fatty said Oh I never thought of it
Yes well give em a chance
Dont be long girls
Thank you said Susan to John
Thats all right
Take your time
Susan locked the hall door behind the two men
She rushed to the bathroom turned on the hot water
Oh Etta
she cried tears in her eyes a hysterical sob in her throat
A bathtub again
Etta too was enthusiastic but she had not that intense hysterical joy which Susan felta joy that can be appreciated only by a person who clean by instinct and by lifelong habit has been shut out from thorough cleanliness for long months of dirt and foul odors and cold
It was no easy matter to become clean again after all those months
But there was plenty of soap and brushes and towels and at last the thing was accomplished
Then they tore open the bundles and arrayed themselves in the fresh new underclothes in the simple attractive costumes of jacket blouse and skirt
Susan had returned to her class and had brought Etta with her
What shall we do with these
asked Etta pointing disdainfully with the toe of her new boot to the scatter of the garments they had cast off
Susan looked down at it in horror
She could not believe that she had been wearing such stuffthat it was the clothing of all her associates of the past six monthswas the kind of attire in which most of her fellowbeings went about the beautiful earth She shuddered
Isnt life dreadful
she cried
And she kicked together the tattered patched stained trash kicked it on to a large piece of heavy wrapping paper she had spread out upon the floor
Thus without touching her discarded self she got it wrapped up and bound with a strong string
She rang for the maid gave her a quarter and pointed to the bundle
Please take that and throw it away she said
When the maid was gone Etta said Im mighty glad to have it out of the room
Out of the room
cried Susan
Out of my heart
Out of my life
They put on their hats admired themselves in the mirror and descendedSusan remembering halfway that they had left the lights on and going back to turn them off
The door boy summoned the two young men to the parlor
They entered and exclaimed in real amazement
For they were facing two extremely pretty young women one dark the other fair
The two faces were wreathed in pleased and grateful smiles
Dont we look nice
demanded Etta
Nice
cried Fatty
We sure did draw a pair of first prizesdidnt we Johnny
John did not reply
He was gazing at Susan
Etta had young beauty but it was of the commonplace kind
In Susans face and carriage there was far more than beauty
Where did you come from
said John to her in an undertone
And where are you going
Out to supper I hope laughed she
Your eyes changedont they
I thought they were violet
Now I see theyre graygray as can be
CHAPTER XXII AT lunch well toward the middle of the following afternoon Fattyhis proper name was August Gulicksaid John and I dont start for Ann Arbor until a week from today
That means seven clear days
A lot can be done in that time with a little intelligent hustling
What do you say girls
Do you stick to us
As long as youll let us said Etta who was delighting Gulick with her frank and wondering and grateful appreciation of his munificence
Never before had his own private opinion of himself received such a flatteringly sweeping indorsementfrom anyone who happened to impress him as worth while
In the last phrase lies the explanation of her success through a policy that is always dangerous and usually a failure
So it was settled that with the quiet little hotel as headquarters the four would spend a week in exploring Cincinnati as a pleasure ground
Gulick knew the town thoroughly
His father was a brewer whose name was on many a huge beer wagon drawn about those streets by showy Clydesdales
Also he had plenty of money and while Redmondfor his friend was the son of Redmond well known as a lawyerpolitician in Chicagohad nothing like so much as Gulick still he had enough to make a passable pretense at keeping up his end
For Etta and Susan the city had meant shabby to filthy tenements toil and weariness and sorrow
There was opened to their ravished young eyes the citywhat reveals itself to the pleasureseeker with pocket well filledwhat we usually think of when we pronounce its name forgetting what its reality is for all but a favored few of those within its borders
It was a week of music and of laughtermusic especiallymusic whenever they ate or drank music to dance by music in the beer gardens where they spent the early evenings music at the road houses where they arrived in sleighs after the dances to have supperunless you choose to call it breakfast
You would have said that Susan had slipped out of the tenement life as she had out of its garments that she had retained not a trace of it even in memory
Butin those days began her habit of never passing a beggar without giving something
Within three or four days this life brought a truly amazing transformation in the two girls
You would not have recognized in them the pale and wan and ragged outcasts of only the Saturday night before
Arent you happy
said Etta to Susan in one of the few moments they were alone
But I dont need to ask
I didnt know you could be so gay
I had forgotten how to laugh replied Susan
I suppose I ought to be ashamed pursued Etta
Why
inquired Susan
Oh you know why
You know how peopled talk if they knew
What people
said Susan
Anyone whos willing to give you anything
No admitted Etta
But There she halted
Susan went on I dont propose to be bothered by the other kind
They wouldnt do anything for me if they could except sneer and condemn
Still you know it isnt right what were doing
I know it isnt coldor hungeror rags and dirtand bugs replied Susan
Those few words were enough to conjure even to Ettas duller fancy the whole picture to its last detail of loathsome squalor
Into Ettas face came a dazed expression
Was that really us Lorna
No said Susan with a certain fierceness
It was a dream
But we must take care not to have that dream again
Id forgotten how cold I was said Etta hadnt you
No said Susan I hadnt forgotten anything
Yes I suppose it was all worse for you than for me
You used to be a lady
Dont talk nonsense said Susan
I dont regret what Im doing Etta now declared
It was Gus that made me think about it
She looked somewhat sheepish as she went on to explain
I had a little too much to drink last night
And when Gus and I were alone I criedfor no reason except the drink
He asked me why and I had to say something and it popped into my head to say I was ashamed of the life I was leading
As things turned out Im glad I said it
He was awfully impressed
Of course said Susan
You never saw anything like it continued Etta with an expression suggesting a feeling that she ought to be ashamed but could not help being amused
He acted differently right away
Why dont you try it on John
What for
Oh itll make himmake him have moremore respect for you
Perhaps said Susan indifferently
Dont you want John toto respect you
Ive been too busy having a good time to think much about himor about anything
Im tired of thinking
I want to rest
Last night was the first time in my life I danced as much as I wanted to
Dont you like John
Certainly
He does know a lot doesnt he
Hes like you
He reads and and thinksand Hes away ahead of Fatty except You dont mind my having the man with the most money
Not in the least laughed Susan
Moneys another thing Im glad to rest from thinking about
But thisll last only a few days longer
AndIf you managed John Redmond right Lorna Nowyou must not try to make me think
Lornaare you really happy
Cant you see I am
Yeswhen were all together
But whenwhen youre alone with him Susans expression stopped her
It was a laughing expression and yetSaid Susan I am happy dearvery happy
I eat and drink and sleepand I am oh so glad to be alive
Isnt it good to be aliveif youve got plenty exclaimed Etta
I never knew before
This is the dream Lornaand I think Ill kill myself if I have to wake
On Saturday afternoon the four were in one of the rooms discussing where the farewell dinner should be held and what they would eat and drink
Etta called Susan into the other room and shut the door between
Fatty wants me to go along with him and live in Detroit said she blurting it out as if confessing a crime
Isnt that splendid
cried Susan kissing her
I thought he would
He fell in love with you at first sight
Thats what he says
But LornaII dont know what to do
Do
Why go
What else is there
Go of course
Oh no Lorna protested Etta
I couldnt leave you
I couldnt get along without you
But you must go
Dont you love him
Etta began to weep
Thats the worst of it
I do love him so
And I think he loves meand might marry me and make me a good woman again



You mustnt ever tell John or anybody about thatthat dreadful man I went withwill you dear
What do you take me for
said Susan
Ive told Fatty I was a good girl until I met him
You havent told John about yourself
Susan shook her head
I suppose not
Youre so secretive
You really think I ought to go
I know it
Etta was offended by Susans positive practical tone
I dont believe you care
Yes I care said Susan
But youre right to follow the man you love
Besides theres nothing so good in sight here
Whatll you do
Oh I cant go Lorna
Now Etta said Susan calmly dont talk nonsense
Ill get along all right
You come to Detroit
You could find a job there and we could live together
Would Fatty like that
Etta flushed and glanced away
Young Gulick had soon decided that Susan was the strongertherefore the less womanlyof the two girls and must be the evil influence over her whom he had appeared just in time to save
When he said this to Etta she protestednot very vigorously because she wished him to think her really almost innocent
She wasnt quite easy in her mind as to whether she had been loyal to Lorna
But being normally human she soon almost convinced herself that but for Lorna she never would have made the awful venture
Anyhow since it would help her with Gulick and wouldnt do Lorna the least mite of harm why not let him think he was right
Said Susan Hasnt he been talking to you about getting away fromfrom all this
But I dont care cried Etta moved to an outburst of frankness by her sense of security in Susans loyalty and generosity
He doesnt understand
Men are fools about women
He thinks he likes in me what I havent got at all
As a matter of fact if I had been what he made me tell him I was why wed never have metor got acquainted in the way that makes us so fond of each other
And I owe it all to you Lorna
I dont care what he says Lornaor does
I want you
Cant go said Susan not consciousyet not unaware eitherof the curious mixture of heart and art in Ettas outburst of apparent eagerness to risk everything for love of her
Cant possibly go
Ive made other plans
The thing for you is to be straightget some kind of a job in Detroitmake Fatty marry youquick
He would but his fatherd throw him out
Not if you were an honest working girl
But Etta was silent and reflective for a moment
Men are so queer she finally said
If Id been an honest working girl hed never have noticed me
Its because I am what I am that Ive been able to get acquainted with him and fascinate him
And he feels its a sporty thing to doto marry a fast girl
If I was to settle down to work be a regular working girlwhy Im afraid hehed stop loving me
Then too he likes to believe hes rescuing me from a life of shame
Ive watched him close
I understand him
No doubt said Susan drily
Oh I know you think Im deceitful
But a womans got to be with a man
And I care a lot about himaside from the fact that he can make me comfortable andand protect me fromfrom the streets
If you cared for a manNo I guess you wouldnt
You oughtnt to be soso honest Lorna
Itll always do you up
Susan laughed shrugged her shoulders
I am what I am said she
I cant be any different
If I tried Id only fail worse
You dont love Johndo you
I like him
Then you wouldnt have to do much pretending urged Etta
And what does a little pretending amount to
Thats what I say to myself replied Susan thoughtfully
It isnt nearly as bad asas what we started out to do
Susan laughed at Ettas little hypocrisy for her respectabilitys comfort
As what we didand are doing corrected she
Burlingham had taught her that it only makes things worse and more difficult to lie to oneself about them
Johns crazy about you
But he hasnt money enough to ask you to come along
And Etta hesitated eyed Susan doubtfully
Youre sure you dont love him
No
I couldnt love him any more thanthan I could hate him
Susans strange look drifted across her features
Its very queer how I feel toward men
ButI dont love him and I shant pretend
I want to but somehowI cant
Etta felt that she could give herself the pleasure of unburdening herself of a secret
Then I may as well tell you hes engaged to a girl he thinks he ought to marry
I suspected so
And you dont mind
inquired Etta unable to read Susans queer expression
Except for himand hera little replied Susan
I guess thats why I havent liked him betterhavent trusted him at all
Arent men dreadful
And he is so nice in many ways



Lorna Etta was weeping again
I cant goI cant
I mustnt leave you
Dont be absurd
Youve simply got to do it
And I do love him said Etta calmed again by Susans calmness
And if he married meOh how grateful Id be
I should say
exclaimed Susan
She kissed Etta and petted her
And hell have a mighty good wife
Do you think I can marry him
If you love himand dont worry about catching him
Etta shook her head in rejection of this piece of idealistic advice
But a girls got to be shrewd
You ought to be more so Lorna
That depends on what a girl wants said Susan absently
Upon what she wants she repeated
What do you want
inquired Etta curiously
I dont know Susan answered slowly
I wish I knew what was going on in your head
exclaimed Etta
So do I said Susan smiling
Do you really mind my going
Reallyhonestly
There wasnt a flaw in Susans look or tone
If you tried to stay with me Id run away from you
And if I do get him I can help you
Once hes mine Etta rounded out her sentence with an expression of countenance which it was well her adoring rescuer did not see
Not that it lacked womanliness womanly is the word that most exactly describes itand always will exactly describe such expressionsand the thoughts behindso long as men compel women to be just women under penalty of refusing them support if they are not so
Redmond came in and Etta left him alone with Susan
Well has Etta told you
he asked
Yes replied the girl
She looked at himsimply a look but the violetgray eyes had an unusual seeming of seeing into minds and hearts an expression that was perhaps the more disquieting because it was sympathetic rather than critical
His glance shifted
He was a notably handsome young fellowtoo young for any display of character in his face or for any development of it beyond the amiable free and easy lover of a jolly good time that is the type repeated over and over again among the youth of the comfortable classes that send their sons to college
Are you going with her
he asked
No said Susan
Redmonds face fell
I hoped you liked me a little better than that said he
It isnt a question of you
But its a question of you with me he cried
Im in love with you Lorna
ImIm tempted to say all sorts of crazy things that I think but havent the courage to act on
He kneeled down beside her put his arms round her waist
Im crazy about you Lorna



Tell meWere youHad you beenbefore we met
Yes said Susan
Why dont you deny it
he exclaimed
Why dont you fool me as Etta fooled Gus
Ettas story is different from mine said Susan
Shes had no experience at all compared to me
I dont believe it declared he
I know shes been stuffing Fatty has made him think that you led her away
But I can soon knock those silly ideas out of his silly head Its the truth interrupted Susan calmly
No matter
You could be a good woman
Impulsively If youll settle down and be a good woman Ill marry you
Susan smiled gently
And ruin your prospects
I dont care for prospects beside you
You are a good womaninside
The better I know you the less like a fast woman you are
Wont you go to work Lorna and wait for me
Her smile had a little mockery in it nowperhaps to hide from him how deeply she was moved
No matter what else I did Id not wait for you Johnny
Youd never come
Youre not a Johnnyonthespot
You think Im weakdont you
he said
Then as she did not answer Well I am
But I love you all the same
For the first time he felt that he had touched her heart
The tears sprang to her eyes which were not at all gray now but all violet as was their wont when she was deeply moved
She laid her hands on his shoulders
Oh its so good to be loved
she murmured
He put his arms around her and for the moment she rested there contentyes content as many a woman who needed love less and craved it less has been content just with being loved when to make herself content she has had to ignore and forget the personality of the man who was doing the lovingand the kind of love it was
Said he Dont you love me a little enough to be a good woman and wait till I set up in the law
She let herself play with the idea to prolong this novel feeling of content
She asked How long will that be
Ill be admitted in two years
Ill soon have a practice
My fathers got influence
Susan looked at him sadly slowly shook her head
Two yearsand then several years more
And I working in a factoryor behind a counterfrom dawn till after darkpoor hungryhalfnakedwearing my heart outwearing my body away She drew away from him laughed
I was fooling Johnabout marrying
I liked to hear you say those things
I couldnt marry you if I would
Im married already
You
She nodded
Tell me about itwont you
She looked at him in astonishment so amazing seemed the idea that she could tell anyone that experience
It would be like voluntarily showing a hideous repulsive scar or wound for sometimes it was scar and sometimes open wound and always the thing that made whatever befell her endurable by comparison
She did not answer his appeal for her confidence but went on Anyhow nothing could induce me to go to work again
You dont realize what work meansthe only sort of work I can get to do
Itsits selling both body and soul
I prefer He kissed her to stop her from finishing her sentence
Dontplease he pleaded
You dont understand
In this life youll soon grow hard and coarse and lose your beauty and your healthand become a moral and physical wreck
She reflected the grave expression in her eyesthe expression that gave whoever saw it the feeling of dread as before impending tragedy
YesI suppose so she said
ButAny sooner than as a working girl living in a dirty hole in a tenement
Nonot so soon
And in this life Ive got a chance if Im careful of my health andand dont let things touch me
In that othertheres no chancenone
What chance have you got in this life
I dont know exactly
Im very ignorant yet
At worst its simply that Ive got no chance in either lifeand this life is more comfortable
Comfortable
With men you dont like frightful men Were you ever cold
asked Susan
But it made no impression upon him who had no conception of the cold that knows not how it is ever to get warm again
He rushed on Lorna my God
He caught hold of her and strained her to his breast
You are lovely and sweet
Its frightfulyou in this life
Her expression made the sobs choke up into his throat
She said quietly Not worse than dirt and vermin and freezing cold and long long dulloh so dull hours of working among human beings that dont ever washbecause they cant
She pushed him gently away
You dont understand
You havent been through it
Comfortable people talk like fools about those things



Do you remember my hands that first evening
He reddened and his eyes shifted
Im absurdly sensitive about a womans hands he muttered
She laughed at him
Oh I sawhow you couldnt bear to look at themhow they made you shiver
Well the hands were nothingnothingbeside what you didnt see
Lorna do you love someone else
His eyes demanded an honest answer and it seemed to her his feeling for her deserved it
But she could not put the answer into words
She lowered her gaze
Then why he began impetuously
But there he halted for he knew she would not lift the veil over herself over her past
Im very very fond of you she said with depressing friendliness
Then with a sweet laugh You ought to be glad Im not able to take you at your word
And you will be glad soon
She sighed
What a good time weve had
If I only had a decent allowance like Fatty
he groaned
No use talking about that
Its best for us to separate best for us both
Youve been good to meyoull never know how good
And I cant play you a mean trick
I wish I could be selfish enough to do it but I cant
You dont love me
Thats the reason
Maybe it is
Yes I guess thats why Ive got the courage to be square with you
Anyhow John you cant afford to care for me
And if I cared for you and put off the partingwhy itd only put off what Ive got to go through with before She did not finish her eyes became dreamy
Before what
he asked
I dont know she said returning with a sigh
Something I seeyet dont see in the darkness ahead of me
I cant make you out cried he
Her expression moved him to the same awe she inspired in Ettaa feeling that gave both of them the sense of having known her better of having been more intimate with her when they first met her than they ever had been since or ever would be again
When Redmond embraced and kissed her for the last time he was in another and less sympathetic mood was busy with his own wounds to vanity and perhaps to heart
He thought her heartlessgood and sweet and friendly but without sentiment
She refused to help him make a scene she refused to say she would write to him and asked him not to write to her
You know well probably see each other soon
Not till the long vacationnot till nearly July
Only three months
Oh if you look at it that way
said he piqued and sullen
Girls had always been more than kind more than eager when he had shown interest
Etta leaving on a later train was even more depressed about Susans heart
She wept hysterically wished Susan to do the same but Susan stood out firmly against a scene and would not have it that Etta was shamefully deserting her as Etta tearfully accused herself
Youre going to be happy she said
And Im not so selfish as to be wretched about it
And dont you worry a minute on my account
Im better off in every way than Ive ever been
Ill get on all right
I know you gave up John to help me with August
I know you mean to break off everything
Oh Lorna you mustntyou mustnt
Dont talk nonsense was Susans unsatisfactory reply
When it came down to the last embrace and the last kiss Etta did feel through Susans lips and close encircling arms a something that dried up her hysterical tears and filled her heart with an awful aching
It did not last long
No matter how wildly shallow waters are stirred they soon calm and murmur placidly on again
The three who had left her would have been amazed could they have seen her a few minutes after Ettas train rolled out of the Union Station
The difference between strong natures and weak is not that the strong are free from cowardice and faintheartedness from doubt and foreboding from love and affection but that they do not stay down when they are crushed down stagger up and on
Susan hurried to the room they had helped her find the day beforea room in a house where no questions were asked or answered
She locked herself in and gave way to the agonies of her loneliness
And when her grief had exhausted her she lay upon the bed staring at the wall with eyes that looked as though her soul had emptied itself through them of all that makes life endurable even of hope
For the first time in her life she thought of suicidenot suicide the vague possibility not suicide the remote way of escape but suicide the close and intimate friend the healer of all woes the solace of all griefssuicide the speedy accurate solver of the worst problem destiny can put to man
She saw her pocketbook on the floor where she had dropped it
Ill wait till my moneys gone thought she
Then she remembered Ettahow gentle and loving she was how utterly she gave herselffor Susan was still far from the profound knowledge of character that enables us to disregard outward signs in measuring actualities
If I really werent harder than Etta her thoughts ran on reproachfully Id not wait until the money went
Id kill myself now and have it over with
The truth was that if the position of the two girls had been reversed and Susan had loved Gulick as intensely as Etta professed and believed she loved him still Susan would have given him up rather than have left Etta alone
And she would have done it without any sense of sacrifice
And it must be admitted that whether or not there are those who deserve credit for doing right certainly those who do right simply because they cannot do otherwisethe only trustworthy peopledeserve no credit for it
She counted her moneytwentythree dollars in bills and some change
Redmond had given her fifty dollars each time they had gone shopping and had made her keep the balancehis indirect way of adjusting the financial side
Twentythree dollars meant perhaps two weeks living
Well she would live those two weeks decently and comfortably and thenbid life adieu unless something turned upfor back to the streets she would not go
With Etta gone with not a friend anywhere on earth life was not worth the price she had paid for Etta and herself to the drunken man
Her streak of good fortune in meeting Redmond had given her no illusions from Mabel Connemora from what she herself had heard and seenand experiencedshe knew the street womans life and she could not live that life for herself alone
She could talk about it to Redmond tranquilly
She could think about it in the abstract could see how other women did it and how those who had intelligence might well survive and lift themselves up in it
But do it she could not
So she resolved upon suicide firmly believing in her own resolve
And she was not one to deceive herself or to shrink from anything whatsoever
Except the insane only the young make these resolves and act upon them for the young have not yet learned to value life have not yet fallen under lifes sinister spell that makes human beings cling more firmly and more cravenly to it as they grow older
The young must have somethingsome hope however fanatic and falseto live for
They will not tarry just to live
And in that hour Susan had lost hope
She took off her street dress and opened her trunk to get a wrapper and bedroom slippers
As she lifted the lid she saw an envelope addressed Lorna she remembered that Redmond had locked and strapped the trunk
She tore the end from the envelope looked in
Some folded bills nothing more
She sat on the floor and counted two twenties five tens two fivesa hundred dollars
She looked dazedly at the moneygave a cry of delightsprang to her feet with a change like the startling shift from night to day in the tropics
I can pay
she cried
I can pay
Bubbling over with smiles and with little laughs gay as even champagne and the release from the vile prison of the slums had made her she with eager hands took from the trunk her best clothesthe jacket and skirt of dark gray check she had bought for thirty dollars at Shillitos and had had altered to her figure and her taste the blouse of good quality linen with rather a fancy collar the gray leather belt with a big oxidized silver buckle her only pair of silk stockings the pair of highheeled patent leather shoesthe large black hat with a gray feather curling attractively round and over its brim
The hat had cost only fourteen dollars because she had put it together herself if she had bought it made she would have paid not less than thirty dollars
All these things she carefully unpacked and carefully laid out
Then she thoroughly brushed her hair and did it up in a graceful pompadour that would go well with the hat
She washed away the traces of her outburst of grief went over her finger nails now almost recovered from the disasters incident to the life of manual labor
She went on to complete her toilet all with the same attention to detaila sure indication in one so young of a desire to please some specific person
When she had the hat set at the satisfactory angle and the veil wound upon it and draped over her fresh young face coquettishly she took from her slender store of gloves a fresh gray pair and as she put them on stood before the glass examining herself
There was now not a trace of the tenement working girl of a week and a day before
Here was beauty in bloom fresh and alluring from head to narrow wellbooted feet
More than a hint of a fine color sensethat vital quality if fashion the conventional is to be refined and individualized into style the raremore than a hint of color sense showed in the harmony of the pearl gray in the big feather the pearl gray in the collar of the blouse and the pearl white of her skin
Susan had indeed returned to her own class
She had left it a smalltown girl with more than a suggestion of the child in eyes and mouth she had returned to it a young woman of the city with that look in her face which only experience can giveexperience that has resulted in growth
She locked all her possessions away in her trunkall but her money that she put in her stockingsseventyfive dollars well down in the right leg the rest of the bills well down in the left leg the two dollars or so in change was all she intrusted to the pocketbook she carried
She cast a coquettish glance down at her charmingly arrayed feeta harmless glance of coquetry that will be condemned by those whose physical vanity happens to center elsewhere
After this glance she dropped her skirtsand was ready
By this time dusk had fallen and it was nearly six oclock
As she came out of the house she glanced toward the westthe instinctive gesture of people who live in rainy climates
Her face brightened she saw an omen in the long broad streak of reddened evening sky
CHAPTER XXIII SHE went down to Fourth Street along it to Race to the Commercial building
At the entrance to the corridor at the far side of which were elevator and stairway she paused and considered
She turned into the business office
Is Mr Roderick Spenser here
she asked of a heavily built graybearded man in the respectable black of the oldfashioned financial employee showing the sobriety and stolidity of his character in his dress
He works upstairs replied the old man beaming approvingly upon the pretty stylish young woman
Is he there now
Ill telephone
He went into the rear office presently returned with the news that Mr Spenser had that moment left was probably on his way down in the elevator
And youll catch him if you go to the office entrance right away
Susan the inexperienced in the city ways of men with women did not appreciate what a tribute to her charms and to her character as revealed in the honest grave eyes was the old mans unhesitating assumption that Spenser would wish to see her
She lost no time in retracing her steps
As she reached the office entrance she saw at the other end of the long hall two young men coming out of the elevator
After the habit of youth she had rehearsed speech and manner for this meeting but at sight of him she was straightway trembling so that she feared she would be unable to speak at all
The entrance light was dim but as he glanced at her in passing he saw her looking at him and his hand moved toward his hat
His face had not changedthe same frank careless expression the same sympathetic understanding look out of the eyes
But he was the city man in dress nownotably the city man
Mr Spenser said she shyly
He halted his companion went on
He lifted his hat looked inquiringly at herthe look of the enthusiast and connoisseur on the subject of pretty women when he finds a new specimen worthy of his attention
Dont you know me
His expression of puzzled and flirtatious politeness gradually cleared away
The lighting up of his eyes the smile round his mouth delighted her and she grew radiant when he exclaimed eagerly Why its the little girl of the rock again
How youve grownin a yearless than a year
Yes I suppose I have said she thinking of it for the first time
Then to show him at once what a good excuse she had for intruding again she hastened to add Ive come to pay you that money you loaned me
He burst out laughing drew her into the corridor where the light was brighter
And youve gone back to your husband he saidshe noted the quick sharp change in his voice
Why do you think that
she said
The way his eyes lingered upon the charming details toilet that indicated anything but poverty might of a have given her a simple explanation
He offered another
I cant explain
Its your different expressiona kind of experienced look
The color flamed and flared in Susans face
You arehappy
he asked
Ive not seenhim evaded she
Ever since I left Carrollton Ive been wandering about
Wandering about
he repeated absently his eyes busy with her appearance
And now she went on nervous and hurried Im here in townfor a while
Then I may come to see you
Id be glad
Im alone in a furnished room Ive takenout near Lincoln Park
Alone
You dont mean youre still wandering
Still wandering
He laughed
Well it certainly is doing you no harm
The reverse
An embarrassed pause then he said with returning politeness Maybe youll dine with me this evening
She beamed
Ive been hoping youd ask me
It wont be as good as the one on the rock
There never will be another dinner like that declared she
Your leg is well
Her question took him by surprise
In his interest and wonder as to the new mystery of this mysterious young person he had not recalled the excuses he made for dropping out of the entanglement in which his impulses had put him
The color poured into his face
Ages ago he replied hurriedly
Id have forgotten it if it hadnt been for you
Ive never been able to get you out of my head
And as a matter of truth she had finally dislodged his cousin Nellwithout lingering long or vividly herself
Young Mr Spenser was too busy and too selfabsorbed a man to bother long about any one flower in a world that was one vast field abloom with openpetaled flowers
Nor I you said she as pleased as he had expected and showing it with a candor that made her look almost the child he had last seen
You see I owed you that money and I wanted to pay it
Ohthat was all
exclaimed he half jokingly
Wait here a minute
And he went to the door looked up and down the street then darted across it and disappeared into the St Nicholas Hotel
He was not gone more than half a minute
I had to see Bayne and tell him he explained when he was with her again
I was to have dined with him and some othersover in the cafe
Instead you and I will dine upstairs
You wont mind my not being dressed
It seemed to her he was dressed well enough for any occasion
Id rather you had on the flannel trousers rolled up to your knees said she
But I can imagine them
What a dinner that was
cried he
And the ride afterward with an effort at ease that escaped her bedazzled eyes
Why didnt you ever write
He expected her to say that she did not know his address and was ready with protests and excuses
But she replied I didnt have the money to pay what I owed you
They were crossing Fourth Street and ascending the steps to the hotel
Then tooafterwardwhen I got to know a little more about life IOh no matter
Really the money was the only reason
But he had stopped short
In a tone so correctly sincere that a suspicious person might perhaps have doubted the sincerity of the man using it he said What was in your mind
What did you think
What did yoususpect me of
For I see in that honest telltale face of yours that it was a suspicion
I didnt blame you protested the girl even if it was so
I thought maybe you got to thinking it overanddidnt want to be bothered with anyone so troublesome as I had made myself
How could you suspect me of such a thing
Oh I really didnt declared she with all the earnestness of a generous nature for she read into his heightened color and averted eyes the feelings she herself would have had before an unjust suspicion
It was merely an idea
And I didnt blame younot in the least
It would have been the sensible Next thing this childwoman this mysterious mind of mixed precocity and innocence would be showing that she had guessed a Cousin Nell
You are far too modest interrupted he with a flirtatious smile
You didnt realize how strong an impression you made
No I really broke my leg
Dont you suppose I knew the twentyfive in the pocketbook wouldnt carry you far
He sawand naturally misunderstoodher sudden change of expression as he spoke of the amount
He went on apologetically I intended to bring more when I came
I was afraid to put money in the note for fear itd never be delivered if I did
And didnt I tell you to writeand didnt I give you my address here
Would I have done that if I hadnt meant to stand by you
Susan was convinced was shamed by these smooth plausible assertions and explanations
Your fathers houseits a big brick with stone trimmings standing all alone outside the little townisnt it
Spenser was again coloring deeply
Yes admitted he uneasily
But Susan didnt notice
I saw the doctorand your familyon the veranda she said
He was now so nervous that she could not but observe it
They gave out that it was only a sprain said he because I told them I didnt want it known
I didnt want the people at the office to know I was going to be laid up so long
I was afraid Id lose my job
I didnt hear anything about it said she
I only saw as I was going by on a boat
He looked disconcertedbut not to her eyes
Wellits far in the past now said he
Lets forgetall but the fun
Yesall but the fun
Then very sweetly But Ill never forget what I owe you
Not the moneynot that hardly at allbut what you did for me
It made me able to go on
Dont speak of it cried he flushed and shamefaced
I didnt do half what I ought
Like most human beings he was aware of his more obviousif less dangerousfaults and weaknesses
He liked to be called generous but always had qualms when so called because he knew he was in fact of the familiar type classed as generous only because human beings are so artless in their judgments as to human nature that they cannot see that quick impulses quickly die
The only deep truth is that there are no generous natures but just naturesand they are rarely classed as generous because their slowly formed resolves have the air of prudence and calculation
In the hotel she went to the dressingroom took twentyfive dollars from the money in her stocking
As soon as they were seated in the restaurant she handed it to him
But this makes it you who are having me to dinnerand more he protested
If you knew what a weight its been on me youd not talk that way said she
Her tone compelled him to accept her view of the matter
He laughed and put the money in his waistcoat pocket saying Then Ill still owe you a dinner
During the past week she had been absorbing as only a young woman with a good mind and a determination to learn the business of living can absorb
The lessons before her had been the life that is lived in cities by those who have money to spend and experience in spending it she had learned out of all proportion to opportunity
At a glance she realized that she was now in a place far superior to the Bohemian resorts which had seemed to her inexperience the best possible
From earliest childhood she had shown the delicate sense of good taste and of luxury that always goes with a practical imaginationpractical as distinguished from the idealistic kind of imagination that is vague erratic and fond of the dreams which neither could nor should come true
And the reading she had donethe novels the memoirs the books of travel the fashion and home magazineshad made deep and distinct impressions upon her had prepared heras they have prepared thousands of Americans in secluded towns and rural regions where luxury and even comfort are very crude indeedfor the possible rise of fortune that is the universal American dream and hope
She felt these new surroundings exquisitelythe subdued coloring the softened lights the thick carpets the quiet elegance and comfort of the furniture
She noted the good manners of the welltrained waiter she listened admiringly and memorizingly as Spenser ordered the dinnera dinner of French good tastesmall but fine oysters a thick soup a guinea hen en casserole a fruit salad fresh strawberry ice cream dry champagne
She saw that Spenser knew what he was about and she was delighted with him and proud to be with him and glad that he had tastes like her ownthat is tastes such as she proposed to learn to have
Of the men she had known or known about he seemed to her far and away the best
It isnt necessary to explain into what an attitude of mind and heart this feeling of his high superiority immediately put hercertainly not for the enlightenment of any woman
What are you thinking
he askedthe question that was so often thrust at her because when she thought intensely there was a curiositycompelling expression in her eyes
Ohabout all this replied she
I like this sort of thing so much
I never had it in my life yet now that I see it I feel as if I were part of it as if it must belong to me
Her eyes met his sympathetic gaze
You understand dont you
He nodded
And I was wonderingshe laughed as if she expected even him to laugh at herI was wondering how long it would be before I should possess it
Do you think Im crazy
He shook his head
Ive got that same feeling said he
Im poordont dare do this oftenhave all I can manage in keeping myself decently
Yet I have a conviction that I shallshall win
Dont think Im dreaming of being richnot at all
II dont care much about that if I did go into business
But I want all my surroundings to be right
Her eyes gleamed
And youll get it
And so shall I I know it sounds improbable and absurd for me to say that about myself
ButI know it
I believe you said he
Youve got the look in your facein your eyes



Ive never seen anyone improve as you have in this less than a year
She smiled as she thought in what surroundings she had apparently spent practically all that time
If you could have seen me
she said
Yes I was learning and I know it
I led a sort of double life
I she hesitated gave up trying to explain
She had not the words and phrases the clearcut ideas to express that inner life led by people who have real imagination
With most human beings their immediate visible surroundings determine their life with the imaginative few their horizon is always the whole wide world
She sighed But Im ignorant
I dont know how or where to take hold
I cant help you there yet said he
When we know each other better then Ill know
Not that you need me to tell you
Youll find out for yourself
One always does
She glanced round the attractive room again then looked at him with narrowed eyelids
Only a few hours ago I was thinking of suicide
How absurd it seems nowIll never do that again
At least Ive learned how to profit by a lesson
Mr Burlingham taught me that
Whos he
Thats a long story
I dont feel like telling about it now
But the mere suggestion had opened certain doors in her memory and crowds of sad and bitter thoughts came trooping in
Are you in some sort of trouble
said he instantly leaning toward her across the table and all aglow with the impulsive sympathy that kindles in impressionable natures as quickly as fire in dry grass
Such natures are as perfect conductors of emotion as platinum is of heatinstantly absorbing it instantly throwing it off to return to their normal and metallic chilland capacity for receptiveness
Anything you can tell me about
Oh nonothing especial replied she
Just loneliness and a feeling ofof discouragement
Strongly Just a mood
Im never really discouraged
Something always turns up
Please tell me what happened after I left you at that wretched hotel
I cant she said
At least not now
There is He looked sympathetically at her as if to assure her that he would understand no matter what she might confess
There issomeone
No
Im all alone
Imfree
It was not in the least degree an instinct for deception that made her then convey an impression of there having been no one
She was simply obeying her innate reticence that was part of her unusual selfunconsciousness
And youre not worried aboutabout money matters
he asked
You see Im enough older and more experienced to give me excuse for asking
Besides unless a woman has money she doesnt find it easy to get on
Ive enough for the present she assured him and the stimulus of the champagne made her lookand feelmuch more selfconfident than she really was
More than Ive ever had before
So Im not worried
When anyone has been through what I have they arent so scared about the future
He looked the admiration he feltand there was not a little of the enthusiasm of the champagne both in the look and in the admirationI see youve already learned to play the game without losing your nerve
I begin to hope so said she
Yesyouve got the signs of success in your face
Curious about those signs
Once you learn to know them you never miss in sizing up people
The dinner had come
Both were hungry and it was as good a dinner as the discussion about it between Spenser and the waiter had forecast
As they ate the wellcooked wellserved food and drank the delicately flavored champagne mellow as the gorgeous autumn its color suggested there diffused through them an extraordinary feeling of quiet intense happinesshappiness of mind and body
Her face took on a new and finer beauty into his face came a tenderness that was most becoming to its rather rugged features
And he had not talked with her long before he discovered that he was facing not a child not a childwoman but a woman grown one who could understand and appreciate the things men and women of experience say and do
Ive always been expecting to hear from you every day since we separated he saidand he was honestly believing it now
Ive had a feeling that you hadnt forgotten me
It didnt seem possible I could feel so strongly unless there was real sympathy between us
I came as soon as I could
He reflected in silence a moment then in a tone that made her heart leap and her blood tingle he said You say youre free
Free as air
OnlyI couldnt fly far
He hesitated on an instinct of prudence then ventured
Far as New York
What is the railroad fare
Oh about twentyfive dollarswith sleeper
YesI can fly that far
Do you mean to say youve no ties of any kind
None
Not one
Her eyes opened wide and her nostrils dilated
Free
You love itdont you
Dont you
Above everything
he exclaimed
Only the free live
She lifted her head higher in a graceful attractive gesture of confidence and happiness
WellI am ready to live
Im afraid you dont realize he said hesitatingly
People wouldnt understand
Youve your reputation to think of you know
She looked straight at him
Nonot even that
Im even free from reputation
Then as his face saddened and his eyes glistened with sympathy You neednt pity me
See where its brought me
Youre a strong swimmerarent you
he said tenderly
But then there isnt any safe and easy crossing to the isles of freedom
Its no wonder most people dont get further than gazing and longing
Probably I shouldnt confessed Susan if I hadnt been thrown into the water
It was a case of swim or drown
But most who try are drownednearly all the women
Oh I guess there are more survive than is generally supposed
So much lying is done about that sort of thing
What a shrewd young lady it is
At any rate you have reached the islands
But Im not queen of them yet she reminded him
Im only a poor naked outofbreath castaway lying on the beach
He laughed appreciatively
Very clever this extremely pretty young woman
Yesyoull win
Youll be queen
He lifted his champagne glass and watched the little bubbles pushing gayly and swiftly upward
Soyouve cast over your reputation
I told you I had reached the beach naked
A reckless light in her eyes now
Fact is I had none to start with
Anybody has a reason for startingor for being started
That was mine I guess
Ive often thought about that matter of reputationin a man or a womanif theyre trying to make the bold strong swim
To care about ones reputation means fear of what the world says
Its important to care about ones characterfor without character no one ever got anywhere worth getting to
But its very very dangerous to be afraid for ones reputation
AndI hate to admit it because Im hopelessly conventional at bottom but its truereputationfear of what the world sayshas sunk more swimmers has wrecked more characters than it ever helped
Sothe strongest and best swimmers swim naked
Susan was looking thoughtfully at him over the rim of her glass
She took a sip of the champagne said If I hadnt been quite naked Id have sunkId have been at the bottomwith the fishes Dont
he cried
Thank God you did whatever youve doneyes I mean thatwhatever youve done since it enabled you to swim on
He added And I know it wasnt anything badanything unwomanly
I did the best I couldnothing Im ashamed ofor proud of either
Justwhat I had to do
But you ought to be proud that you arrived
Noonly glad said she
Soso frightfully glad
In any event their friendship was bound to flourish aided by that dinner and that wine it sprang up into an intimacy a feeling of mutual trust and of sympathy at every point
Like all women she admired strength in a man above everything else
She delighted in the thick obstinate growth of his fair hair in the breadth of the line of his eyebrows in the aggressive thrust of his large nose and long jawbone
She saw in the way his mouth closed evidence of a will against which opposition would dash about as dangerously as an egg against a stone wall
There was no question of his having those birthmarks of success about which he talked
She saw themsaw nothing of the less obtrusivebut not less importantmarks of weakness which might have enabled an expert in the reading of faces to reach some rather depressing conclusion as to the nature and the degree of that success
Finally he burst out with Yes Ive made up my mind
Ill do it
Im going to New York
Ive been fooling away the last five years here learning a lot but still idlingdrinkingamusing myself in all kinds of ways
And about a month agoone night as I was rolling home toward dawnthrough a driving sleet stormdo you remember a line in Paradise Lost I never read it interrupted Susan
Wellits where the devils have been kicked out of Heaven and are lying in agony flat on the burning lakeand Satan rises upand marches haughtily out among themand calls out Awake
Arise
Or forever more be damned
Thats what has happened to me several times in my life
When I was a boy idling about the farm and wasting myself that voice came to meAwake
Arise
Or forever more be damned
And I got a move on me and insisted on going to college
Againat collegeI became a dawdlerpokerdrinkdancesall the rest of it
And suddenly that voice roared in my ears made me jump like a rabbit when a gun goes off
And last month it came again
I went to workfinished a play Ive been pottering over for three years
But somehow I couldnt find thethewhatever I neededto make me break away
Wellyouve given me that
Ill resign from the Commercial and with all Ive got in the worldthree hundred dollars and a trunk full of good clothes Ill break into Broadway
Susan had listened with bright eyes and quickened breath as intoxicated and as convinced as was he by his eloquence
Isnt that splendid
she exclaimed in a low voice
And you
he said meaningly
I
she replied fearing she was misunderstanding
Will you go
Do you want me
she asked low and breathlessly
With a reluctance which suggestedbut not to herthat his generosity was winning a hardfought battle with his vanity he replied I need you
I doubt if Id dare without you to back me up
Ive got a trunk full of fairly good clothes and about a hundred dollars
But I havent got any playor any artor any trade even
Of course Ill go
Then she hastily added Ill not be a drag on you
I pay my own way
But you mustnt be suspicious in your independence he warned her
You mustnt forget that Im older than you and more experienced and that its far easier for a man to get money than for a woman
To get it without lowering himself
Ah
he exclaimed looking strangely at her
You mean without bowing to some boss
Without selling his soul
I had no idea you were so much of a woman when I met you that day
I wasntthen replied she
And I didnt know where Id got till we began to talk this evening
And youre very young
Oh but Ive been going to a school where they make you learn fast
Indeed I do need you
He touched his glass to hers
On to Broadway
he cried
Broadway
echoed she radiant
Togethereh
She nodded
But as she drank the toast a tear splashed into her glass
She was remembering how some mysterious instinct had restrained her from going with John Redmond though it seemed the only sane thing to do
What if she had disobeyed that instinct
And thenthrough her mind in swift ghostly marchpast trailed the persons and events of the days just gonejust gone yet seeming as far away as a former life in another world
Redmond and GulickEttayes Etta tooall past and goneforever gone What are you thinking about
She shook her head and the spectral procession vanished into the glooms of memorys vistas
Thinkingof yesterday
I dont understand myselfhow I shake off and forget whats past
Nothing seems real to me but the future
Not even the present
said he with a smile
Not even the present she answered with grave candor
Nothing seems to touch methe real me
Its likelike looking out of the window of the train at the landscape running by
Im a traveler passing through
I wonder if itll always be that way
I wonder if Ill ever arrive where Ill feel that I belong
I think soand soon
But she did not respond to his confident smile
II hope so she said with sad wistful sweetness
Then againarent there some people who dont belong anywherearent allowed to settle down and be happy but have to keep goingon and onuntil Until they pass out into the dark he finished for her
Yes
He looked at her in a wondering uneasy way
You do suggest that kind said he
But smilingly to hide his earnestness Ill try to detain you
Please do she said
I dont want to go onalone
He dropped into silence puzzled and in a way awed by the mystery enveloping hera mystery of aloofness and stoniness of complete separation from the contact of the worldthe mystery that incloses all whose real life is lived deep within themselves
CHAPTER XXIV LIKE days later on the Eastern Express they were not so confident as they had been over the St Nicholas champagne
As confident about the remoter future it was that annoying little stretch near at hand which gave them secret uneasiness
There had been nothing but dreaming and sentimentalizing in those four daysand that disquietingly suggested the soldier who with an impressive flourish highly resolves to give battle then sheathes his sword and goes away to a revel
Also like all idlers they had spent moneyfar more money than total net cash resources of less than five hundred dollars warranted
Weve spent an awful lot of money said Susan
She was quick to see the faint frown the warning that she was on dangerous ground
Said he Do you regret
No indeedno
cried she eager to have that cloud vanish but honest too
She no more than he regretted a single moment of the dreaming and lovemaking a single penny of the eighty and odd dollars that had enabled them fittingly to embower their romance to twine myrtle in their hair and to provide Cupids torchbowls with fragrant incense
Stillwith the battle not begun there gaped that deep wide hollow in the war chest
Spensers newspaper connection got them passes over one of the cheaper lines to New Yorkand he tried to console himself by setting this down as a saving of forty dollars against the eighty dollars of the debit item
But he couldnt altogether forget that they would have traveled on passes anyhow
He was not regretting that he had indulged in the extravagance of a stateroombut he couldnt deny that it was an extravagance
However he had only to look at her to feel that he had done altogether well in providing for her the best and to believe that he could face with courage any fate so long as he had her at his side
Yes I can face anything with you he said
What I feel for you is the real thing
The real thing at last
She had no disposition to inquire curiously into this
Her reply was a flash of a smile that was like a flash of glorious light upon the crest of a wave surging straight from her happy heart
They were opposite each other at breakfast in the restaurant car
He delighted in her frank delight in the novelty of travelswift and luxurious travel
He had never been East before himself but he had had experience of sleepers and diners she had not and every moment she was getting some new sensation
She especially enjoyed this sitting at breakfast with the express train rushing smoothly along through the mountainsthe first mountains either had seen
At times they were so intensely happy that they laughed with tears in their eyes and touched hands across the table to get from physical contact the reassurances of reality
How good to eat everything is
she exclaimed
Youll think me very greedy Im afraid
But if youd eaten the stuff I have since we dined on the rock
They were always going back to the rock and neither wearied of recalling and reminding each other of the smallest details
It seemed to them that everything even the least happening at that sacred spot must be remembered must be recorded indelibly in the book of their romance
Im glad we were happy together in such circumstances she went on
It was a testwasnt it Rod
If two people dont love each other enough to be happy anywhere they could be happy nowhere declared he
So well not mind being very very careful about spending money in New York she venturedfor she was again bringing up the subject she had been privately revolving ever since they had formed the partnership
In her wanderings with Burlingham in her sojourn in the tenements she had learned a great deal about the care and spending of moneyhad developed that instinct for forehandedness which nature has implanted in all normal women along with the maternal instinctand as a necessary supplement to it
This instinct is more or less futile in most women because they are more or less ignorant of the realities as to wise and foolish expenditure
But it is found in the most extravagant women no less than in the most absurdly and meanly stingy
Of course we must be careful assented Rod
But I cant let you be uncomfortable
Now dear she remonstrated you mustnt treat me that way
Im better fitted for hardship than you
Id mind it less
He laughed she looked so fine and delicate with her transparent skin and her curves of figure he felt that anything so nearly perfect could not but easily be spoiled
And there he showed how little he appreciated her iron strength her almost exhaustless endurance
He fancied he was the stronger because he could have crushed her in his muscular arms
But exposures privations dissipations that would have done for a muscularly stronger man than he would have left no trace upon her after a few days of rest and sleep
Its the truth she insisted
I could prove it but I shant
I dont want to remember vividly
Rod we must live cheaply in New York until you sell a play and I have a place in some company
Yes he conceded
But Susie not too cheap
A cheap way of living makes a cheap mangives a man a cheap outlook on life
Besides dont forgetif the worst comes to the worst I can always get a job on a newspaper
She would not have let him see how uneasy this remark made her
However she could not permit it to pass without notice
Said she a little nervously But youve made up your mind to devote yourself to playsto stand or fall by that
He remembered how he had thrilled her and himself with brave talk about the necessity of concentrating of selecting a goal and moving relentlessly for it letting nothing halt him or turn him aside
For his years Rod Spenser was as wise in the philosophy of success as Burlingham or Tom Brashear
But he had done that brave and wise talking before he loved her as he now didbefore he realized how love can be in itself an achievement and a possession so great that other ambitions dwarf beside it
True away back in his facile fickle mind behind the region where selfexcuse and somebodyelsealwaystoblame reigned supreme a somethingthe something that had set the marks of success so strongly upon his facewas whispering to him the real reason for his now revolving a New York newspaper job
Real reasons as distinguished from alleged reasons and imagined reasons from the reasons selfdeception invents and vanity gives outreal reasons are always interesting and worth noting
What was Rods
Not his love for her nothing so superior so superhuman as that
No it was weak and wobbly misgivings as to his own ability to get on independently the misgivings that menace every man who has never worked for himself but has always drawn paythe misgivings that paralyze most men and keep them wage or salary slaves all their lives
Rod was no better pleased at this sly unwelcome revelation of his real self to himself than the next human being is in similar circumstances
The whispering was hastily suppressed love for her desire that she should be comfortablethose must be the real reasons
But he must be careful lest she the sensitive should begin to brood over a fear that she was already weakening him and would become a drag upon himthe fear that he knew would take shape in his own mind if things began to go badly
You may be sure dearest he said Ill do nothing that wont help me on
He tapped his forehead with his finger
This is a machine for making plays
Everything thats put into it will be grist for it
She was impressed but not convinced
He had made his point about concentration too clear to her intelligence
She persisted But you said if you took a place on a newspaper it would make you fight less hard
I say a lot of things he interrupted laughingly
Dont be frightened about me
What Im most afraid of is that youll desert me
That would be a real knockout blow
He said this smilingly but she could not bear jokes on that one subject
What do you mean Rod
Now dont look so funereal Susie
I simply meant that I hate to think of your going on the stageor at anything else
I want you to help me
Selfish isnt it
But dear heart if I could feel that the plays were ours that we were both concentrated on the one careerdarling
To love each other to work togethernot separately but togetherdont you understand
Her expression showed that she understood but was not at all in sympathy
Ive got to earn my living Rod she objected
I shant care anything about what Ill be doing
Ill do it simply to keep from being a burden to you A burden Susie
You
Why youre my wings that enable me to fly
Its selfish but I want all of you
Dont you think dear that if it were possible it would be better for you to make us a home and hold the fort while I go out to give battle to managersand bind up my wounds when I come backand send me out the next day well again
Dont you think we ought to concentrate
The picture appealed to her
All she wanted in life now was his success
But she objected its useless to talk of that until we get on our feetperfectly useless
Its true he admitted with a sigh
And until we do we must be economical
What a persistent lady it is laughed he
I wish I were like that
In the evenings gathering dusk the train steamed into Jersey City and Spenser and Susan Lenox with the adventurers mingling hope and dread confidence and doubt courage and fear followed the crowd down the long platform under the vast train shed went through the huge thronged waitingroom and aboard the giant ferryboat which filled both with astonishment because of its size and luxuriousness
I am a jay
said she
I can hardly keep my mouth from dropping open
You havent any the advantage of me he assured her
Are you trembling all over
Yes she admitted
And my hearts like lead
I suppose there are thousands on thousands like us from all over the countrywho come here every dayfeeling as we do 
Lets go out on the front deckwhere we can see it
They went out on the upper front deck and leaning against the forward gates with their traveling bags at their feet they stood dumb before the most astounding and most splendid scene in the civilized world
It was not quite dark yet the air was almost July hot as one of those prematurely warm days New York so often has in March
The sky a soft and delicate blue shading into opal and crimson behind them displayed a bright crescent moon as it arched over the fairyland in the dusk before them
Straight ahead across the broad swift sparkling riverthe broadest water Susan had ever seenrose the mighty the majestic city
It rose direct from the water
Endless stretches of ethereallooking structure reaching higher and higher in masses like mountain ranges in peaks in towers and domes
And millions of lights like fairy lamps like resplendent jewels gave the city a glory beyond that of the stars thronging the heavens on a clear summer night
They looked toward the north on and on to the far horizons edge stretched the broad river and the lovely city that seemed the newborn offspring of the waves on and on the myriad lights in masses in festoons in great gleaming globes of fire from towers rising higher than Susans and Rods native hills
They looked to the south
There too rose city mile after mile and then beyond it the expanse of the bay and everywhere the lights the beautiful soft starlike lights shedding a radiance as of heaven itself over the whole scene
Majesty and strength and beauty
I love it
murmured the girl
Already I love it
I never dreamed it was like this said Roderick in an awed tone
The City of the Stars said she in the caressing tone in which a lover speaks the name of the beloved
They moved closer together and clasped hands and gazed as if they feared the whole thingriver and magic city and their own selveswould fade away and vanish forever
Susan clutched Rod in terror as she saw the vision suddenly begin to move to advance toward her like apparitions in a dream before they vanish
Then she exclaimed Why we are moving
The big ferryboat swift steady as land noiseless had got under way
Upon them from the direction of the distant and hidden sea blew a cool fresh breeze
Never before had either smelled that perfume strong and keen and clean which comes straight from the unbreathed air of the ocean to bathe New York to put life and hope and health into its people
Rod and Susan turned their faces southward toward this breeze drank in great draughts of it
They saw a colossal statue vivid as life in the dusk in the hand at the end of the highflung arm a torch which sent a blaze of light streaming out over land and water
That must be Liberty said Roderick
Susan slipped her arm through his
She was quivering with excitement and joy
RodRod
she murmured
Its the isles of freedom
Kiss me
And he bent and kissed her and his cheek felt the tears upon hers
He reached for her hand with an instinct to strengthen her
But when he had it within his its firm and vital grasp sent a thrill of strength through him
A few minutes and they paused at the exit from the ferry house
They almost shrank back so dazed and helpless did they feel before the staggering billows of noise that swept savagely down upon themroar and crash shriek and snort the air was shuddering with it the ground quaking
The beauty had vanishedthe beauty that was not the city but a glamour to lure them into the citys grasp now that city stood revealed as a monster about to seize and devour them
God
He shouted in her ear
Isnt this frightful She was recovering more quickly than he
The faces she saw reassured her
They were human faces and while they were eager and restless as if the souls behind them sought that which never could be found they were sane and kind faces too
Where others of her own race lived and lived without fear she too could hope to survive
And already she who had loved this mighty offspring of the sea and the sky at first glance saw and felt another magicthe magic of the peopled solitude
In this vast this endless solitude she and he would be free
They could do as they pleased live as they pleased without thought of the opinion of others
Here she could forget the bestial horrors of marriage here she would fear no scornful pointing at her birthbrand of shame
She and Rod could be poor without shame they could make their fight in the grateful darkness of obscurity
Scared
he asked
Not a bit was her prompt answer
I love it more than ever
Well it frightens me a little
I feel helplesslost in the noise and the crowd
How can I do anything here
Others have
Others do
Yesyes
Thats so
We must take hold
And he selected a cabman from the shouting swarm
We want to go with two trunks to the Hotel St Denis said he
All right sir
Gimme the checks please
Spenser was about to hand them over when Susan said in an undertone You havent asked the price
Spenser hastened to repair this important omission
Ten dollars replied the cabman as if ten dollars were some such trifle as ten cents
Spenser laughed at the first experience of the famous New York habit of talking in a faint careless way of large sums of moneyother peoples money
You did save us a swat he said to Susan and beckoned another man
The upshot of a long and arduous discussion noisy and profane was that they got the carriage for six dollarsa price which the policeman who had been drawn into the discussion vouched for as reasonable
Spenser knew it was too high knew the policeman would get a dollar or so of the profit but he was weary of the wrangle and he would not listen to Susans suggestion that they have the trunks sent by the express company and themselves go in a street car for ten cents
At the hotel they got a large comfortable room and a bath for four dollars a day
Spenser insisted it was cheap Susan showed her alarmless than an hour in New York and ten dollars gone not to speak of she did not know how much change
For Roderick had been scattering tips with what is for some mysterious reason called a princely hand though princes know too well the value of money and have too many extravagant tastes ever to go far in sheer throwing away
They had dinner in the restaurant of the hotel and set out to explore the land they purposed to subdue and to possess
They walked up Broadway to Fourteenth missed their way in the dazzle and glare of south Union Square discovered the wandering highway again after some searching
After the long rather quiet stretch between Union Square and Thirtyfourth Street they found themselves at the very heart of the citys night life
They gazed in wonder upon the elevated road with its trains thundering by high above them
They crossed Greeley Square and stood entranced before the spectaclea street bright as day with electric signs of every color shape and size sidewalks jammed with people most of them dressed with as much pretense to fashion as the few best in Cincinnati one theater after another and at Fortysecond Street theaters in every direction
Surelysurelythere would be small difficulty in placing his play when there were so many theaters all eager for plays
They debated going to the theater decided against it as they were tired from the journey and the excitement of crowding new sensations
Ive never been to a real theater in my life said Susan
I want to be fresh the first time I go
Yes cried Rod
Thats right
Tomorrow night
That will be an experience
And they read the illuminated signs inspected the show windows and slowly strolled back toward the hotel
As they were recrossing Union Square Spenser said Have you noticed how many street girls there are
We must have passed a thousand
Isnt it frightful
Yes said Susan
Rod made a gesture of disgust and said with feeling How low a woman must have sunk before she could take to that life
Yes said Susan
So low that there couldnt possibly be left any shred of feeling or decency anywhere in her
Susan did not reply
Its not a question of morals but of sensibility pursued he
Some day Im going to write a play or a story about it
A woman with anything to her who had to choose between that life and death wouldnt hesitate an instant
She couldnt
A streetwalker
And again he made that gesture of disgust
Before you write said Susan in a queer quiet voice youll find out all about it
Maybe some of these girlsmost of themall of themare still human beings
Its not fair to judge people unless you know
And its so easy to say that someone else ought to die rather than do this or that
You cant imagine yourself doing such a thing urged he
Susan hesitated thenYes she said
Her tone irritated him
Oh nonsense
You dont know what youre talking about
Yes said Susan
Susie
he exclaimed looking reprovingly at her
She met his eyes without flinching
Yes she said
I have
He stopped short and his expression set her bosom to heaving
But her gaze was steady upon his
Why did you tell me
he cried
Oh it isnt soit cant be
You dont mean exactly that
Yes I do said she
Dont tell me
I dont want to know
And he strode on she keeping beside him
I cant let you believe me different from what I am replied she
Not you
I supposed you guessed
Now Ill always think of itwhenever I look at you



I simply cant believe it



You spoke of it as if you werent ashamed
Im not ashamed she said
Not before you
There isnt anything Ive done that I wouldnt be willing to have you know
Id have told you except that I didnt want to recall it
You know that nobody can live without getting dirty
The thing is to want to be cleanand to try to get clean afterwardisnt it
Yes he admitted as if he had not been hearing
I wish you hadnt told me
Ill always see it and feel it when I look at you
I want you to said she
I couldnt love you as I do if I hadnt gone through a great deal
But it must have left its stains upon you said he
Again he stopped short in the street faced her at the curb with the crowd hurrying by and jostling them
Tell me about it
he commanded
She shook her head
I couldnt
To have told would have been like tearing open closed and healed wounds
Also it would have seemed whiningand she had utter contempt for whining
Ill answer any question but I cant just go on and tell
You deliberately went and didthat
Yes
Havent you any excuse any defense
She might have told him about Burlingham dying and the need of money to save him
She might have told him about Ettaher health goingher mind made up to take to the streets with no one to look after her
She might have made it all a moving and a true taleof selfsacrifice for the two people who had done most for her
But it was not in her simple honest nature to try to shift blame
So all she said was No Rod
And you didnt want to kill yourself first
No
I wanted to live
I was dirtyand I wanted to be clean
I was hungryand I wanted food
I was coldthat was the worst
I was cold and I wanted to get warm
AndI had been marriedbut I couldnt tell even you about thatexceptafter a womans been through what I went through then nothing in life has any real terror or horror for her
He looked at her long
I dont understand he finally said
Come on
Lets go back to the hotel
She walked beside him making no attempt to break his gloomy silence
They went up to their room and she sat on the lounge by the window
He lit a cigarette and half sat half lay upon the bed
After a long time he said with a bitter laugh And I was so sure you were a good woman
I dont feel bad she ventured timidly
Am I
Do you mean to tell me he cried sitting up that you dont think anything of those things
Life can be so hard and cruel can make one do so many But dont you realize that what youve done is the very worst thing a woman can do
No said she
I dont



Im sorry you didnt understand
I thought you didnot the details but in a general sort of way
I didnt mean to deceive you
That would have seemed to me much worse than anything I did
I might have known
I might have known
he criedrather theatrically though sincerely withalfor Mr Spenser was a diligent worker with the tools of the playmaking trade
I learned who you were as soon as I got home the night I left you in Carrolton
They had been telephoning about you to the village
So I knew about you
About my mother
asked she
Is that what you mean
Oh you need not look so ashamed said he graciously pityingly
I am not ashamed said she
But she did not tell him that her look came from an awful fear that he was about to make her ashamed of him
No I suppose you arent he went on incensed by this further evidence of her lack of a good womans instincts
I really ought not to blame you
You were born wrongborn with the moral sense left out
Yes I suppose so said she wearily
If only you had lied to metold me the one lie
cried he
Then you wouldnt have destroyed my illusion
You wouldnt have killed my love
She grew deathly white that was all
I dont mean that I dont love you still he hurried on
But not in the same way
Thats killed forever
Are there different ways of loving
she asked
How can I give you the love of respect and trustnow
Dont you trust meany more
I couldnt
I simply couldnt
It was hard enough before on account of your birth
But nowTrust a woman who had been a aI cant speak the word
Trust you
You dont understand a man
No I dont
She looked round drearily
Everything in ruins
Alone again
Outcast
Nowhere to go but the streetsthe life that seemed the only one for such as she
I dont understand people at all



Do you want me to go
She had risen as she asked this
He was beside her instantly
Go
he cried
Why I couldnt get along without you
Then you love me as I love you Said she putting her arms round him
And thats all I want
I dont want what you call respect
I couldnt ever have hoped to get that being born as I wascould I
Anyhow it doesnt seem to me to amount to much
I cant help it Rodthats the way I feel
So just love medo with me whatever you will so long as it makes you happy
And I dont need to be trusted
I couldnt think of anybody but you
He felt sure of her again reascended to the peak of the moral mountain
You understand we can never get married
We can never have any children
I dont mind
I didnt expect that
We can lovecant we
He took her face between his hands
What an exquisite face it is he said soft and smooth
And what clear honest eyes
Where is it Where is it
It must be there
What Rod
Thethe dirt
She did not wince but there came into her young face a deeper pathosand a wan deprecating pleading smile
She said Maybe love has washed it awayif it was there
It never seemed to touch meany more than the dirt when I had to clean up my room
You mustnt talk that way
Why you are perfectly calm
You dont cry or feel repentant
You dont seem to care
Its soso pastand dead
I feel as if it were another person
And it was Rod
He shook his head frowning
Lets not talk about it he said harshly
If only I could stop thinking about it
She effaced herself as far as she could living in the same room with him
She avoided the least show of the tenderness she felt of the longing to have her wounds soothed
She lay awake the whole night suffering now and then timidly and softly caressing him when she was sure that he slept
In the morning she pretended to be asleep let him call her twice before she showed that she was awake
A furtive glance at him confirmed the impression his voice had given
Behind her pale unrevealing face there was the agonized throb of an aching heart but she had the confidence of her honest utter love he would surely soften would surely forgive
As for herselfshe had through loving and feeling that she was loved almost lost the sense of the unreality of past and present that made her feel quite detached and apart from the life she was leading from the events in which she was taking part from the persons most intimately associated with her
Now that sense of isolation of the mere spectator or the traveler gazing from the windows of the hurrying trainthat sense returned
But she fought against the feeling it gave her
That evening they went to the theaterto see Modjeska in Magda
Susan had never been in a real theater
The only approach to a playhouse in Sutherland was Masonic Hall
It had a sort of stage at one end where from time to time wandering players gave poor performances of poor plays or a minstrel show or a low vaudeville
But none of the best people of Sutherland wentat least none of the women
The notion was strong in Sutherland that the theater was of the Devilnot so strong as in the days before they began to tolerate amateur theatricals but still vigorous enough to give Susan now as she sat in the big brilliant auditorium a pleasing sense that she an outcast was at last comfortably at home
Usually the first sight of anything one has dreamed about is pitifully disappointing
Neither nature nor life can build so splendidly as a vivid fancy
But Susan in some sort prepared for the shortcomings of the stage was not disappointed
From rise to fall of curtain she was so fascinated so absolutely absorbed that she quite forgot her surroundings even Rod
And between the acts she could not talk for thinking
Rod deceived by her silence was chagrined
He had been looking forward to a great happiness for himself in seeing her happy and much profit from the study of the viewpoint of an absolutely fresh mind
It wasnt until they were leaving the theater that he got an inkling of the true state of affairs with her
Lets go to supper said he
If you dont mind replied she Id rather go home
Im very tired
You were sound asleep this morning
So you must have slept well said he sarcastically
Its the play said she
Why didnt you like it
he asked irritated
She looked at him in wonder
Like what
The play
She drew a long breath
I feel as if it had almost killed me
He understood when they were in their room and she could hardly undress before falling into a sleep so relaxed so profound that it made him a little uneasy
It seemed to him the exhaustion of a child worn out with the excitement of a spectacle
And her failure to go into ecstasies the next day led him further into the same error
Modjeska is very good as Magda said he carelessly as one talking without expecting to be understood
But they say theres an Italian womanDusewho is the real thing
ModjeskaDuseSusan seemed indeed not to understand
I hated her father she said
He didnt deserve to have such a wonderful daughter
Spenser had begun to laugh with her first sentence
At the second he frowned said bitterly I might have known
You get it all wrong
I suppose you sympathize with Magda
I worshiped her  said Susan her voice low and tremulous with the intensity of her feeling
Roderick laughed bitterly
Naturally he said
You cant understand
An obvious case thought he
She was indeed one of those instances of absolute lack of moral sense
Just as some people have the misfortune to be born without arms or without legs so others are doomed to live bereft of a moral sense
A sweet disposition a beautiful body but no soul not a stained soul but no soul at all
And his whole mental attitude toward her changed or rather it was changed by the iron compulsion of his prejudice
The only change in his physical attitudethat is in his treatment of herwas in the direction of bolder passion
of complete casting aside of all the restraint a conventional respecter of conventional womanhood feels toward a woman whom he respects
So naturally Susan eager to love and to be loved and easily confusing the not easily distinguished spiritual and physical was reassured
Once in a while a look or a phrase from him gave her vague uneasiness but on the whole she felt that in addition to clear conscience from straightforwardness she had a further reason for being glad Chance had forced upon her the alternative of telling him or lying
She did not inquire into the realities beneath the surface of their lifeneither into what he thought of her nor into what she thought of himthought in the bottom of her heart
She continued to fight against to ignore her feeling of aloneness her feeling of impending departure
She was aided in this by her anxiety about their finances
In his efforts to place his play he was spending what were for them large sums of moneytreating this man and that to dinners to suppersinviting men to lunch with him at expensive Broadway restaurants
She assumed that all this was necessary he said so and he must know
He was equally openhanded when they were alone insisting on ordering the more expensive dishes on having suppers they really did not need and drink which she knew she would be better off withoutand she suspected he also
It simply was not in him she saw to be careful about money
She liked it as a trait for to her as to all the young and the unthinking carelessness about money seems a sure perhaps the surest sign of generositywhen in fact the two qualities are in no way related
Character is not a collection of ignorant impulses but a solidly woven fabric of deliberate purposes
Carelessness about anything most often indicates a tendency to carelessness about everything
She admired his openhanded way of scattering she wouldnt have admired it in herself would have thought it dishonest and selfish
But Rod was different
He had the artistic temperament while she was a commonplace nobody who ought to beand wasgrateful to him for allowing her to stay on and for making such use of her as he saw fit
Still even as she admired she saw danger grave danger a disturbingly short distance ahead
He described to her the difficulties he was having in getting to managers in having his play read and the absurdity of the reasons given for turning it down
He made light of all these the next manager would see would give him a big advance would put the play onand then Easy Street
But experience had already killed what little optimism there was in her temperamentand there had not been much because George Warham was a successful man in his line and successful men do not create or permit optimistic atmosphere even in their houses
Nor had she forgotten Burlinghams lectures on the subject with illustrations from his own spoiled career she understood it all nowand everything else he had given her to store up in her memory that retained everything
With that philippic against optimism in mind she felt what Spenser was rushing toward
She made such inquiries about work for herself as her inexperience and limited opportunities permitted
She asked she begged him to let her try to get a place
He angrily ordered her to put any such notion out of her head
After a time she nerved herself again to speak
Then he frankly showed her why he was refusing
No said he peremptorily I couldnt trust you in those temptations
You must stay where I can guard you
A woman who had deliberately taken to the streetswhy she thought nothing of virtue she would be having lovers with the utmost indifference and while she was not a liar yetat least I think nothow long would that last
With virtue gone virtue the foundation of womans characterthe rest could no more stand than a house set on sand
As long as you want me to love you youve got to stay with me he declared
If you persist Ill know youre simply looking for a chance to go back to your old ways
And though she continued to think and cautiously to inquire about work she said no more to him
She spent not a penny discouraged him from throwing money awayas much as she could without irritating himand waited for the cataclysm
Waited not in gloom and tears but as normal healthy youth awaits any adversity not definitely scheduled for an hour close at hand
It would be far indeed from the truth to picture Susan as ever for long a melancholy figure to the eye or even wholly melancholy within
Her intelligence and her too sympathetic heart were together a strong force for sadness in her life as they cannot but be in any life
In this world to understand and to sympathize is to be saddened
But there was in her a force stronger than either or both
She had superb health
It made her beautiful strong body happy and that physical happiness brought her up quickly out of any depthsmade her gay in spite of herself caused her to enjoy even when she felt that it was almost like hardheartedness to be happy
She loved the sun and in this city where the sun shone almost all the days sparkling gloriously upon the tiny salt particles filling the air and making it delicious to breathe and upon the skinin this City of the Sun as she called it she was gay even when she was heavyhearted
Thus she was no repellent aggravating companion to Rod as she awaited the cataclysm
It came in the third week
He spent the entire day away from her toward midnight he returned flushed with liquor
She had gone to bed
Get up and dress said he with an irritability toward her which she had no difficulty in seeing was really directed at himself
Im hungryand thirsty
Were going out for some supper
Come kiss me first said she stretching out her arms
Several times this device had shifted his purpose from spending money on the needless and expensive suppers
He laughed
Not a kiss
Were going to have one final blowout
I start to work tomorrow
Ive taken a place on the Heraldon space guaranty of twentyfive a week good chance to average fifty or sixty
He said this hurriedly carelessly gaylyguiltily
She showed then and there what a surpassing wise young woman she was for she did not exclaim or remind him of his high resolve to do or die as a playwright
Ill be ready in a minute was all she said
She dressed swiftly he lounging on the sofa and watching her
He loved to watch her dress she did it so gracefully and the motions brought out latent charms of her supple figure
Youre not so surefingered tonight as usual said he
I never saw you make so many blundersand youve got one stocking on wrong side out
She smiled into the glass at him
The skirtll cover that
I guess I was sleepy
Never saw your eyes more wideawake
Whatre you thinking about
About supper declared she
Im hungry
I didnt feel like eating alone
I cant be here always said he crosslyand she knew he was suspecting what she really must be thinking
I wasnt complaining replied she sweetly
You know I understand about business
Yes I know said he with his air of generosity that always made her feel grateful
I always feel perfectly free about you
I should say
laughed she
You know I dont care what happens so long as you succeed
Since their talk in Broadway that first evening in New York she had instinctively never said we
When they were at the table at Rectors and he had taken a few more drinks he became voluble and plausible on the subject of the trifling importance of his setback as a playwright
It was the worst possible time of year the managers were stocked up his play would have to be rewritten to suit some particular star a place on a newspaper especially such an influential paper as the Herald would be of use to him in interesting managers
She listened and looked convinced and strove to convince herself that she believed
But there was no gray in her eyes only the deepest hue of violets
Next day they took a suite of two rooms and a bath in a pretentious old house in West Fortyfourth Street near Long Acre Square
She insisted that she preferred another much sunnier and quieter suite with no bath but only a stationary washstand it was to be had for ten dollars a week
But he laughed at her as too economical in her ideas and decided for the eighteendollar rooms
Also he went with her to buy clothes made her spend nearly a hundred dollars where she would have spent less than twentyfive
I prefer to make most of my things declared she
And Ive all the time in the world
He would not have it
In her leisure time she must read and amuse herself and keep herself up to the mark especially physically
Im proud of your looks said he
They belong to me dont they
Well take care of my property Miss
She looked at him vaguelya look of distance of parting of pain
Then she flung herself into his arms with a hysterical cryand shut her eyes tight against the beckoning figure calling her away
No
No
she murmured
I belong herehere What are you saying
he asked
Nothingnothing she replied
CHAPTER XXV AT the hotel they had been Mr and Mrs Spenser
When they moved he tried to devise some way round this but it was necessary that they have his address at the office and Mrs Pershall with the glistening oldfashioned false teeth who kept the furnishedroom house was not one in whose withered bosom it would be wise to raise a suspicion as to respectability
Only in a strenuously respectable house would he live in the other sort what might not untrustworthy Susan be up to
So Mr and Mrs Spenser they remained and the truth was suspected by only a few of their acquaintances was known by two or three of his intimates whom he told in those bursts of confidence to which voluble careless men are givenand for which they in resolute selfexcuse unjustly blame strong drink
One of his favorite remarks to hersometimes made laughingly again ironically again angrily again insultingly was in this strain Your face is demure enough
But you look too damned attractive about those beautiful feet of yours to be respectable at heartand trustable
That matter of her untrustworthiness had become a fixed idea with him
The more he concentrated upon her physical loveliness the more he revolved the dangers the possibilities of unfaithfulness for a physical infatuation is always jealous
His work on the Herald made close guarding out of the question
The best he could do was to pop in unexpectedly upon her from time to time to rummage through her belongings to check up her statements as to her goings and comings by questioning the servants and most important of all each day to put her through searching and skillfully planned crossexamination
She had to tell him everything she didevery little thingand he calculated the time to make sure she had not found half an hour or so in which to deceive him
If she had sewed he must look at the sewing if she had read he must know how many pages and must hear a summary of what those pages contained
As she would not and could not deceive him in any matter however small she was compelled to give over a plan quietly to look for work and to fit herself for some occupation that would pay a living wageif there were such for a beginning woman worker
At first he was covert in this detective work being ashamed of his own suspicions
But as he drank as he associated again with the same sort of people who had wasted his time in Cincinnati he rapidly became franker and more inquisitorial
And she dreaded to see the look she knew would come into his eyes the cruel tightening of his mouth if in her confusion and eagerness she should happen not instantly to satisfy the doubt behind each question
He tormented her he tormented himself
She suffered from humiliation but she suffered more because she saw how his suspicions were torturing him
And in her humility and helplessness and inexperience she felt no sense of right to resist no impulse to resist
And she forced herself to look on his spasms of jealousy as the occasional storms which occur even in the best climates
She reminded herself that she was secure of his love secure in his love and in her sad mood she reproached herself for not being content when at bottom everything was all right
After what she had been through to be sad because the man she loved loved her too well
It was absurd ungrateful
He pried into every nook and corner of her being with that ingenious and tireless persistence human beings reserve for searches for what they do not wish to find
At last he contrived to find or to imagine he had found something that justified his labors and vindicated his disbelief in her
They were walking in Fifth Avenue one afternoon at the hour when there is the greatest press of equipages whose expensively and showily dressed occupants are industriously engaged in the occupation of imagining they are doing something when in fact they are doing nothing
What a world
What a grotesque confusing of motion and progress
What fantastic delusions that one is busy when one is merely occupied
They were between Fortysixth Street and Fortyseventh on the west side when a small victoria drew up at the curb and a woman descended and crossed the sidewalk before them to look at the display in a milliners window
Susan gave her the swift seeing glance which one woman always gives anotherthe glance of competitors at each others offerings
Instead of glancing away Susan stopped short and gazed
Forgetting Rod she herself went up to the millinery display that she might have a fuller view of the woman who had fascinated her
Whats the matter
cried Spenser
Come on
You dont want any of those hats
But Susan insisted that she must see made him linger until the woman returned to her carriage and drove away
She said to Rod Did you see her
Yes
Rather prettynothing to scream about
But her style cried Susan
Oh she was nicely dressedin a quiet way
Youll see thousands a lot more exciting after youve been about in this town a while
Ive seen scores of beautifully dressed women hereand in Cincinnati too replied Susan
But that womanshe was perfect
And thats a thing Ive never seen before
Im glad you have such quiet tastesquiet and inexpensive
Inexpensive
exclaimed Susan
I dont dare think how much that womans clothes cost
You only glanced at her Rod you didnt look
If you had youd have seen
Everything she wore was just right
Susans eyes were brilliant
Oh it was wonderful
The colorsthe fitthe stylethe makingevery big and little thing
She was a work of art Rod
Thats the first woman Ive seen in my life that I through and through envied
Rods look was interested now
You like that sort of thing a lot
he inquired with affected carelessness
Every woman does replied she unsuspicious
But I carewell not for merely fine clothes
But for thethe kind that show what sort of person is in them
She sighed
I wonder if Ill ever learnand have money enough to carry out
Itll take so muchso much
She laughed
Ive got terribly extravagant ideas
But dont be alarmedI keep them chained up
He was eying her unpleasantly
Suddenly she became confused
He thought it was because she was seeing and understanding his look and was frightened at his having caught her at last
In fact it was because it all at once struck her that what she had innocently and carelessly said sounded like a hint or a reproach to him
He sneered So youre crazy about fineryeh
Oh Rod
she cried
You know I didnt mean it that way
I long for and dream about a whole lot of beautiful things but nothing else in the worlds in the same class withwith what weve got
You neednt try to excuse yourself said he in a tone that silenced her
She wished she had not seen the woman who had thus put a cloud over their afternoons happiness
But long after she had forgotten his queerness about what she said she continued to remember that perfect womanto see every detail of her exquisite toilet so rare in a world where expensivelooking finery is regarded as the chief factor in the art of dress
How much she would have to learn before she could hope to dress like thatlearn not merely about dress but about the whole artistic side of life
For that woman had happened to cross Susans vision at just the right momentin development and in moodto reveal to her clearly a world into which she had never penetrateda world of which she had vaguely dreamed as she read novels of life in the lands beyond the seas the life of palaces and pictures and statuary of opera and theater of equipages and servants and food and clothing of rare quality
She had rather thought such a life did not exist outside of novels and dreams
What she had seen of New Yorkthe profuse the gigantic but also the undiscriminatinghad tended to strengthen the suspicion
But this woman proved her mistaken
Our great forward strides are made unconsciously are the results of apparently trivial often unnoted impulses
Susan like all our race had always had vague secret dreams of ambitionso vague thus far that she never thought of them as impelling purposes in her life
Her first long forward stride toward changing these dreams from the vague to the definite was when Rod before her on the horse on the way to Brooksburg talked over his shoulder to her of the stage and made her feel that it was the life for her the only life open to her where a woman could hope to be judged as human being instead of as mere instrument of sex
Her second long forward movement toward sharply defined ambition dated from the sight of the woman of the milliners windowthe woman who epitomized to Susan the whole art side of life that always gives its highest expression in some personal achievementthe perfect toilet the perfect painting or sculpture the perfect novel or play
But Rod saw in her enthusiasm only evidence of a concealed longing for the money to indulge extravagant whims
With his narrowing interest in womennarrowed now almost to sexhis contempt for them as to their minds and their hearts was so far advancing that he hardly took the trouble to veil it with remnants of courtesy
If Susan had clearly understoodeven if she had let herself understand what her increasing knowledge might have enabled her to understandshe would have hated him in spite of the hold gratitude and habit had given him upon her loyal natureand despite the fact that she had as far as she could see no alternative to living with him but the tenements or the streets
One day in midsummer she chanced to go into the Hotel Astor to buy a magazine
As she had not been there before she made a wrong turning and was forced to cross one of the restaurants
In a far corner half hidden by a group of palms she saw Rod at a small table with a strikingly pretty woman whose expression and dress and manner most energetically proclaimed the actress
The woman was leaning toward him was touching his hand and looking into his eyes with that show of enthusiasm which raises doubts of sincerity in an experienced man and sets him to keeping an eye or a handor bothupon his money
Real emotion even a professional expert at display of emotion is rarely so adept at exhibiting itself
It may have been jealousy that guided her to this swift judgment upon the character of the emotion correctly and charmingly expressing itself
If so jealousy was for once a trustworthy guide
She turned swiftly and escaped unseen
The idea of trapping him of confronting him never occurred to her
She felt ashamed and selfreproachful that she had seen
Instead of the anger that fires a vain woman whether she cares about a man or not there came a profound humiliation
She had in some way fallen short she had not given him all he needed it must be that she hadnt it to give since she had given him all she had
He must not knowhe must not
For if he knew he might dislike her might leave herand she dared not think what life would be without him her only source of companionship and affection her only means of support
She was puzzled that her discovery not of his treacheryhe had so broken her spirit with his suspicions and his insulting questions that she did not regard herself as of the rank and dignity that has the right to exact fidelitybut of his no longer caring enough to be content with her alone had not stunned her with amazement
She did not realize how completely the instinct that he was estranged from her had prepared her for the thing that always accompanies estrangement
Between the perfect accord that is the never realized ideal for a man and a woman living together and the intolerable discord that means complete repulse there is a vast range of states of feeling imperceptibly shading into each other
Most couples constantly move along this range now toward the one extreme now toward the other
As human kings are not given to selfanalysis and usually wander into grotesque error whenever they attempt it no couple knows precisely where it is upon the range until something crucial happens to compel them to know
Susan and Rod had begun as all couples beginwith an imaginary ideal accord based upon their ignorance of each other and their misunderstanding of what qualities they thought they understood in each other
The delusion of accord vanished that first evening in New York
What remained
What came in the place
They knew no more about that than does the next couple
They were simply living along
A crisis drawing them close together or flinging them forever apart or forcing them to live together he frankly as keeper and she frankly as kept might come any day any hour
Again it might never come
After a few weeks the matter that had been out of her mind accidentally and indirectly came to the surface in a chance remark
She said Sometimes I half believe a man could be untrue to a woman even though he loved her
She did not appreciate the bearings of her remark until it was spoken
With a sensation of terror lest the dreaded crisis might be about to burst she felt his quick nervous glance
She breathed freely again when she felt his reassurance and relief as she successfully withstood
Certainly he said with elaborate carelessness
Men are a rotten promiscuous lot
Thats why its necessary for a woman to be good and straight
All this time his crossexamination had grown in severity
Evidently he was fearing that she might be having a recurrence of the moral disease which was fatal in womankind though only mild indiscretion in a man if not positively a virtue an evidence of possessing a normal masculine nature
Her mind began curiouslysadlyto revolve the occasional presentsof money of books of things to wearwhich he gave always quite unexpectedly
At first unconsciously but soon consciously she began to associate these gifts given always in an embarrassed shamefaced way with certain small but significant indications of his having strayed
And it was not long before she understood she was receiving his expiations for his indiscretions
Like an honest man and a loyalmasculinely loyallover he was squaring accounts
She never read the books she owed to these twinges it was thus that she got her aversion to Thackerayone of his expiations was a set of Thackeray
The things to wear she contrived never to use
The conscience money she either spent upon him or put back into his pocket a little at a time sure that he the most careless of men about money would never detect her
His work forced him to keep irregular hours thus she could pretend to herself that his absences were certainly because of office duty
Still whenever he was gone overnight she became unhappynot the crying kind of unhappiness to that she was little givenbut the kind that lies awake and aches and with morbid vivid fancy paints the scenes suspicion suggests and stares at them not in anger but in despair
She was always urging herself to content herself with what she was getting
She recalled and lived again the things she had forgotten while Roderick was wholly hersthe penalties of the birth brand of shameher wedding nightthe miseries of the last period of her wanderings with Burlinghamher tenement daysthe dirt the nakedness the brutal degradation the vermin the savage cold
And the instant he returned no matter how lowspirited she had been she was at once gay often deliriously gayuntil soon his awakened suspicion as to what she had been up to in his absence quieted her
There was little forcing or pretense in this gayety it bubbled and sparkled from the strong swift current of her healthy passionate young life which suspended in the icy clutch of fear when he was away from her flowed as freely as the brooks in spring as soon as she realized that she still had him
Did she really love him
She believed she did
Was she right
Love is of many degreesand kinds
And strange and confused beyond untangling is the mixture of motives and ideas in the mind of any human being as to any other being with whom his or her relations are many sided
Anyone who had not been roughly seized by destiny and forced to fight desperately weaponless might have found it difficult to understand how this intelligent highspirited girl could be so reasonablecoarsely practical many people would have said
A brave soultruly brave with the unconscious courage that lives heroically without any taint of heroicssuch a soul learns to accept the facts of life to make the best of things to be grateful for whatever sunshine may be and not to shriek and gesticulate at storm
Suffering had given this sapling of a girl the strong fiber that enables a tree to push majestically up toward the open sky
Because she did not cry out was no sign that she was not hurt and because she did not wither and die of her wounds was only proof of her strength of soul
The weak wail and the weak succumb the strong persistand a world of wailers and weaklings calls them hard insensible coarse
Spenser was fond of exhibiting to his men friendsto some of themthis treasure to which he always returned the more enamoured for his vagary and its opportunity of comparison
Women he would not permit
In general he held that all women the respectable no less than the other kind put mischief in each others heads and egged each other on to carry out the mischief already there in embryo
In particular he would have felt that he was committing a gross breach of the proprieties not to say the decencies had he introduced a woman of Susans origin history and present status to the wives and sisters of his friends and for reasons which it was not necessary even to pretend to conceal from her he forbade her having anything to do with the kinds of woman who would not have minded had they known all about her
Thus her only acquaintances her only associates were certain carefully selected men
He asked to dinner or to the theater or to supper at Jacks or Rectors only such men as he could trust
And trustworthy meant physically unattractive
Having small and dwindling belief in the mentality of women and no belief whatever in mentality as a force in the relations of the sexes he was satisfied to have about her any man however clever provided he was absolutely devoid of physical charm
The friend who came oftenest was Drumley an editorial writer who had been his chum at college and had got him the place on the Herald
Drumley he would have trusted alone with her on a desert island for several reasons all of his personal convenience it pleased him that Susan liked Drumley and was glad of his company no matter how often he came or how long he stayed
Drumley was an emaciated Kentucky giant with grotesquely sloping shoulders which not all the ingenious padding of his tailor could appreciably mitigate
His spare legs were bowed in the calves
His skin looked rough and tough like sandpaper and emery board
The thought of touching his face gave one the same sensation as a too deeply cut nail
His neck was thin and long and he wore a low collarthrough that interesting passion of the vain for seeing a defect in themselves as a charm and calling attention to it
The lower part of his sallow face suggested weaknessthe weakness so often seen in the faces of professional men and explaining why they chose passive instead of active careers
His forehead was really fine but the development of the rest of the cranium above the protuberant little ears was not altogether satisfying to a claim of mental powers
Drumley was a good sortnot so much through positive virtue as through the timidity which too often accounts for goodness that is for the meek conformity which passes as goodness
He was an insatiable reader had incredible stores of knowledge and as he had a large vocabulary and a ready speech he could dole out of those reservoirs an agreeable treacle of commonplace philosophy or commentthus he had an ideal equipment for editorial writing
He was absolutely without physical magnetism
The most he could ever expect from any woman was respect and that woman would have had to be foolish enough not to realize that there is as abysmal a difference between knowledge and mentality as there is between reputation and character
Susan liked him because he knew so much
She had developed still further her innate passion for educating herself
She now wanted to know all about everything
He told her what to read set her in the way to discovering and acquiring the art of readingan art he was himself capable of acquiring only in its rudimentsan art the existence of which is entirely unsuspected by most persons who regard themselves and are regarded as readers
He knew the histories and biographies that are most amusing and least shallow and mendacious
He instructed her in the great playwrights and novelists and poets and gaveas his ownthe reasons for their greatness assigned by the worlds foremost critical writers
He showed her what scientific books to readthose that do not bore and do not hide the simple fascinating facts about the universe under pretentious collegeprofessor phraseology
He was a pedant but his pedantry was disguised therefore mitigated by his having associated with men of the world instead of with the pale and pompous capons of the students closet
His favorite topic was beauty and uglinessand his abhorrence for anyone who was not good to look at
As he talked this subject his hearers were nervous and embarrassed
He was a drastic cure for physical vanity
If this man could so far deceive himself that he thought himself handsome who in all the world could be sure he or she was not the victim of the same incredible delusion
It was this hallucination of physical beauty that caused Rod to regard him as the safest of the safe
For it made him pitiful and ridiculous
At first he came only with Spenser
Afterward Spenser used to send him to dine with Susan and to spend the evenings with her when he himself had to beor wished to be elsewhere
When she was with Drumley he knew she was not up to any of her old tricks
Drumley fell in love with her but as in his experience the female sex was coldly chaste he never developed even the slight hope necessary to start in a mans mind the idea of treachery to his friend about a woman
Whenever Drumley heard that a woman other than the brazenly out and out disreputables was loose or was inclined that way he indignantly denied it as a libel upon the empedestaled sex
If proofs beyond dispute were furnished he raved against the man with all the venom of the unsuccessful hating the successful for their success
He had been sought of women of course for he had a comfortable and secure position and money put by
But the serious women who had set snares for him for the sake of a home had not attracted him as for the better looking and livelier women who had come acourting with alimony in view they had unwisely chosen the method of approach that caused him to set them down as nothing but professional loose characters
Thus his high ideal of feminine beauty and his lofty notion of his own deserts on the one hand and his reverence for womanly propriety on the other hand had kept his charms and his income unshared
Toward the end of Spensers first year on the Heraldit was early summerhe fell into a melancholy so profound and so prolonged that Susan became alarmed
She was used to his having those fits of the blues that are a part of the nervous morbidly sensitive nature and in the unhealthfulness of an irregular and dissipated life recur at brief intervals
He spent more and more time with her became as ardent as in their first days together with an added desperation of passionate clinging that touched her to the depths
She had early learned to ignore his moods to avoid sympathy which aggravates and to meet his blues with a vigorous counterirritant of liveliness
After watching the course of this acute attack for more than a month she decided that at the first opportunity she would try to find out from Drumley what the cause was
Perhaps she could cure him if she were not working in the dark
One June evening Drumley came to take her to dinner at the Casino in Central Park
She hesitated
She still liked Drumleys mind but latterly he had fallen into the way of gazing furtively with a repulsive tremulousness of his loose eyelids at her form and at her anklesespecially at her anklesespecially at her ankles
This furtive debauch gave her a shivery sense of intrusion
She distinctly liked the candid even the not too coarse glances of the usual man
But not this shy peeping
However as there were books she particularly wished to talk about with him she accepted
It was an excursion of which she was fond
They strolled along Seventh Avenue to the Park entered and followed the lovely walk quiet and green and odorous to the Mall
They sauntered in the fading light up the broad Mall with its roof of boughs of majestic trees with its pale blue vistas of wellkept lawns
At the steps leading to the Casino they paused to delight in the profusely blooming wistaria and to gaze away northward into and over what seemed an endless forest with towers and cupolas of castle and fortress and cathedral rising serene and graceful here and there above the sea of green
There was the sound of tinkling fountains the musical chinkchink of harness chains of elegant equipages on the Mall hundreds of children were playing furiously to enjoy to the uttermost the last few moments before being snatched away to bedand the birds were in the same hysterical state as they got ready for their evening song
The air was saturated with the fresh odors of spring and early summer flowers
Susan walking beside the homely Drumley was a charming and stylish figure of girlish womanhood
The year and three months in New York had wrought the same transformations in her that are so noticeable whenever an intelligent and observant woman with taste for the luxuries is dipped in the magic of city life
She had grown was now perhaps a shade above the medium height for women looked even taller because of the slenderness of her arms of her neck of the lines of her figure
There was a deeper melancholy in her violetgray eyes
Experience had increased the allure of her wide beautifully curved mouth
They took a table under the trees with beds of blooming flowers on either hand
Drumley ordered the sort of dinner she liked and a bottle of champagne and a bottle of fine burgundy to make his favorite drinkchampagne and burgundy half and half
He was running to poetry that eveningKeats and Swinburne
Finally after some hesitation he produced a poem by DowsonI ran across it today
Its the only thing of his worth while I believeand its so fine that Swinburne must have been sore when he read it because he hadnt thought to write it himself
Its moral tone is not high but its so beautiful Mrs Susan that Ill venture to show it to you
It comes nearer to expressing what men mean by the man sort of constancy than anything I ever read
Listen to this I cried for madder music and for stronger wine But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire Then falls thy shadow Cynarathe night is thine And I am desolate and sick of an old passion Yea hungry for the lips of my desire I have been faithful to thee Cynara in my fashion
Susan took the paper read the four stanzas several times handed it back to him without a word
Dont you think it fine
asked he a little uneasilyhe was always uneasy with a woman when the conversation touched the relations of the sexesuneasy lest he might say or might have said something to send a shiver through her delicate modesty
Fine Susan echoed absently
And true



I suppose it is the best a woman can expectto be the one he returns to
Andisnt that enough
You are very different from any woman I ever met said Drumley
Very different from what you were last fallwonderfully different
But you were different then too
Id have been a strange sort of person if it werent so
Ive led a different life
Ive learnedbecause Ive had to learn
Youve been through a great dealsuffered a great deal for one of your age
Susan shrugged her shoulders slightly
She had her impulses to confide but she had yet to meet the person who seriously tempted her to yield to them
Not even Rod no least of all Rod
You arehappy
Happyand more
Im content
The reply was the truth as she saw the truth
Perhaps it was also the absolute truth for when a woman has the best she has ever actually possessed and when she knows there is nowhere else on earth for her she is likely to be content
Their destiny of subordination has made philosophers of women
Drumley seemed to be debating how to disclose something he had in mind
But after several glances at the sweet delicate face of the girl he gave it over
In the subdued light from the shaded candles on their table she looked more childlike than he had ever seen
Perhaps her big paleblue hat and graceful paleblue summer dress had something to do with it also
How old are you
he asked abruptly
Nearly nineteen
I feel like saying So much
and also So little
How long have you been married
Why all these questions
demanded she smiling
He colored with embarrassment
I didnt mean to be impertinent said he
It isnt impertinenceis itto ask a woman how long shes been married
But she did not go on to tell him instead she pretended to have her attention distracted by a very old man and a very young girl behaving in most loverlike fashion the girl outdoing the man in enthusiastic determination to convince
She was elegantly and badly dressed in new clothesand she seemed as new to that kind of clothes as those particular clothes were new to her
After dinner they walked down through the Park by the way they had come it did not look like the same scene now with the moonlight upon it with soft shadows everywhere and in every shadow a pair of lovers
They had nearly reached the entrance when Drumley said Lets sit on this bench here
I want to have a serious talk with you
Susan seated herself and waited
He lit a cigar with the deliberation of one who is striving to gain time
The bench happened to be one of those that are divided by iron arms into individual seats
He sat with a compartment between them
The moonbeams struck across his profile as he turned it toward her they shone full upon her face
He looked hastily glanced away
With a gruffness as if the evening mist had got into his throat he said Lets take another bench
Why
objected she
I like this beautiful light
He rose
Please let me have my way
And he led her to a bench across which a tree threw a deep shadow as they sat there neither could see the others face except in dimmest outline
After a brief silence he began You love Roddont you
She laughed happily
Above everything on earth
Or in heaven
Youd do anything to have him succeed
No one could prevent his succeeding
Hes got it in him
Its bound to come out
So Id have saiduntil a year agothat is about a year ago
As her face turned quickly toward him he turned profile to her
What do you mean
said she quickly almost imperiously
YesI mean you replied he
You mean you think Im hindering him
When Drumleys voice finally came it was funereally solemn
You are dragging him down
You are killing his ambition
You dont understand she protested with painful expression
If you did you wouldnt say that
You mean because he is not true to you
Isnt he
said she loyally trying to pretend surprise
If thats so youve no right to tell meyou his friend
If it isnt you In either case Id be beneath contemptunless I knew that you knew already
Oh Ive known a long time that you knewever since the night you looked away when he absentmindedly pulled a womans veil and gloves out of his pocket
Ive watched you since then and I know
You are a very dear friend Mr Drumley said she
But you must not talk of him to me
I must he replied
And he hastened to make the selffooled hypocrites familiar move to the safety of dutys skirts
It would be a crime to keep silent
She rose
I cant listen
It may be your duty to speak
Its my duty to refuse to hear
He is overwhelmed with debt
He is about to lose his position
It is all because he is degradedbecause he feels he is entangled in an intrigue with a woman he is ashamed to lovea woman he has struggled in vain to put out of his heart
Susan suddenly weak had seated herself again
From his first words she had been prey to an internal struggleher heart fighting against understanding things about her relations with Rod about his feeling toward her which she had long been contriving to hide from herself
When Drumley began she knew that the end of selfdeception was at handif she let him speak
But the instant he had spoken the struggle ended
If he had tried to stop she would have compelled him to go on
That woman is you he continued in the same solemn measured way
Rod will not marry you
He cannot leave you
And you are dragging him down
You are young
You dont know that passionate love is a mans worst enemy
It satisfies his ambitionwhy struggle when one already has attained the climax of desire
It saps his strength takes from him the energy without which achievement is impossible
Passion dies poisoned of its own sweets
But passionate love killsat least it kills the man
If you did not love him Id not be talking to you now
But you do love him
So I say you are killing him



Dont think he has told me  I know he didnt she interrupted curtly
He does not whine
She hadnt a doubt of the truth of her loyal defense
And Drumley could not have raised a doubt even if she had been seeing the expression of his face
His long practice of the modern editorial art of clearness and brevity and compact statement had enabled him to put into those few sentences more than another might have been unable to express in hours of explanation and appeal
And the ideas were not new to her
Rod had often talked them in a general way and she had thought much about them
Until now she had never seen how they applied to Rod and herself
But she was seeing and feeling it now so acutely that if she had tried to speak or to move she could not have done so
After a long pause Drumley said Do you comprehend what I mean
She was silentso it was certain that she comprehended
But you dont believe


He began to borrow money almost immediately on his arrival here last summer
He has been borrowing ever sincefrom everybody and anybody
He owes now as nearly as I can find out upwards of three thousand dollars
Susan made a slight but sharp movement
You dont believe me
Yes
Go on
He has it in him Im confident to write playsstrong plays
Does he ever write except ephemeral space stuff for the paper
No
And he never will so long as he has you to go home to
He lives beyond his means because he will have you in comfortable surroundings and dressed to stimulate his passion
If he would marry you it might be a little betterthough still he would never amount to anything as long as his love lastedthe kind of love you inspire
But he will never marry you
I learned that from what I know of his ideas and from what Ive observed as to your relationsnot from anything he ever said about you
If Susan had been of the suspicious temperament or if she had been a few years older the manner of this second protest might have set her to thinking how unlike Drumley the inexpert in matters of love and passion it was to analyze thus and to form such judgments
And thence she might have gone on to consider that Drumleys speeches sounded strangely like paraphrases of Spensers eloquent outbursts when he got going
But she had not a suspicion
Besides her whole being was concentrated upon the idea Drumley was trying to put into words
She asked Why are you telling me
Because I love him replied Drumley with feeling
Were about the same age but hes been like my son ever since we struck up a friendship in the first term of Freshman year
Is that your only reason
On my honor
And so firmly did he believe it he bore her scrutiny as she peered into his face through the dimness
She drew back
Yes she said in a low voice half to herself
Yes I believe it is
There was silence for a long time then she asked quietly What do you think I ought to do
Leave himif you love him replied Drumley
What else can you do


Stay on and complete his ruin
And if I gowhat
Oh you can do any one of many things
You can I meanwhat about him
He will be like a crazy man for a while
Hell make that a fresh excuse for keeping on as hes going now
Then hell brace up and Ill be watching over him and Ill put him to work in the right direction
He cant be saved he cant even be kept afloat as long as you are with him or within reach
With you gone out of his lifehis strength will return his selfrespect can be roused
Ive seen the same thing in other cases again and again
I could tell you any number of stories of He does not care for me
In one way a great deal
But youre like drink like a drug to him
It is strange that a woman such as you devoted singlehearted utterly loving should be an influence for bad
But its true of wives also
The best wives are often the worst
The philosophers are right
A man needs tranquillity at home
I understand said she
I understandperfectly 
And her voice was unemotional as always when she was so deeply moved that she dared not release anything lest all should be released
She was like a seated statue
The moon had moved so that it shone upon her face
He was astonished by its placid calm
He had expected her to rave and weep to protest and pleadbefore denouncing him and bidding him mind his own business
Instead she was making it clear that after all she did not care about Roderick probabLy she was wondering what would become of her now that her love was ruined
Well wasnt it natural
Wasnt it altogether to her creditwasnt it additional proof that she was a fine pure woman
How could she have continued deeply to care for a man scandalously untrue and drunk much of the time
Certainly it was in no way her fault that Rod made her the object and the victim of the only kind of socalled love of which he was capable
No doubt one reason he was untrue to her was that she was too pure for his debauched fancy
Thus reasoned Drumley with that mingling of truth and error characteristic of those who speculate about matters of which they have small and unfixed experience
About yourself he proceeded
I have a choice of professions for youone with a company on the roadon the southern circuitwith good prospects of advancement
I know from what I have seen of you and from talks we have had that you would do well on the stage
But the life might offend your sensibilities
I should hesitate to recommend it to a delicate finefibered woman like you
The other position is a clerkship in a business office in Philadelphiawith an increase as soon as you learn stenography and typewriting
It is respectable
It is sheltered
It doesnt offer anything brilliant
But except the stage and literature nothing brilliant offers for a woman
Literature is out of the question I thinkcertainly for the present
The stage isnt really a place for a woman of ladylike instincts
So I should recommend the office position
She remained silent
While my main purpose in talking to you he continued was to try to save him I can honestly say that it was hardly less my intention to save you
But for that Id not have had the courage to speak
He is on the way down
Hes dragging you with him
What future have you with him
You would go on down and down as low as he should sink and lower
Youve completely merged yourself in himwhich might do very well if you were his wife and a good influence in his life or a mere negation like most wives
But in the circumstances it means ruin to you
Dont you see that
What did you say
I was talking about youyour future your Oh I shall do well enough
She rose
I must be going
Her short indifferent dismissal of what was his real object in speakingthough he did not permit himself to know itcut him to the quick
He felt a sickening and to him inexplicable sense of defeat and disgrace
Because he must talk to distract his mind from himself he began afresh by saying Youll think it over
I am thinking it over



I wonder that With the fingers of one hand she smoothed her glove on the fingers of the otherI wonder that I didnt think of it long ago
I ought to have thought of it
I ought to have seen
I cant tell you how I hate to have been the Please dont say any more she requested in a tone that made it impossible for a man so timid as he to disobey
Neither spoke until they were in Fiftyninth Street then he unable to stand the strain of a silent walk of fifteen blocks suggested that they take the car down
She assented
In the car the stronger light enabled him to see that she was pale in a way quite different from her usual clear healthy pallor that there was an unfamiliar look about her mouth and her eyesa look of strain of repression of resolve
These signs and the contrast of her mute motionlessness with her usual vivacity of speech and expression and gesture made him uneasy
Id advise said he that you reflect on it all carefully and consult with me before you do anythingif you think you ought to do anything
She made no reply
At the door of the house he had to reach for her hand and her answer to his good night was a vague absent echo of the word
Ive only done what I saw was my duty said he appealingly
Yes I suppose so
I must go in
And youll talk with me before you The door had closed behind her she had not known he was speaking
When Spenser came about two hours later and turned on the light in their bedroom she was in the bed apparently asleep
He stood staring with theatric selfconsciousness at himself in the glass for several minutes then sat down before the bureau and pulled out the third drawerwhere he kept collars ties handkerchiefs gloves and a pistol concealed under the handkerchiefs
With the awful solemnity of the youth who takes himselfand the theaterseriously he lifted the pistol eyed it critically turning it this way and that as if interested in the reflections of light from the bright cylinder and barrel at different angles
He laid it noiselessly back covered it over with the handkerchiefs sat with his fingers resting on the edge of the drawer
Presently he moved uneasily as a manon the stage or in its amusing imitation called civilized life among the selfconscious classesmoves when he feels that someone is behind him in a crucial moment
He slowly turned round
She had shifted her position so that her face was now toward him
But her eyes were closed and her face was tranquil
Still he hoped she had seen the little episode of the pistol which he thought fine and impressive
With his arm on the back of the chair and supporting that resolutelooking chin of his he stared at her face from under his thick eyebrows so thick that although they were almost as fair as his hair they seemed dark
After a while her eyelids fluttered and lifted to disclose eyes that startled him so intense so sleepless were they
Kiss me she said in her usual sweet tender waya little shyness much of passions sparkle and allure
Kiss me
Ive often thought said he what would I do if I should go smash reach the end of my string
Would I kill you before taking myself off
Or would that be cowardly
She had not a doubt that he meant this melodramatic twaddle
It did not seem twaddle or melodramatic to heror for that matter to him
She clasped him more closely
Whats the matter dear
she asked her head on his breast
Oh Ive had a row at the Herald and have quit
But Ill get another place tomorrow
Of course
I wish youd fix up that play the way Drumley suggested
Maybe I shall
Well see
Anything else wrong
Only the same old trouble
I love you too much
Too damn much he added in a tone not intended for her ears
Weak foolthats what I am
Weak fool
Ive got you anyhow
Havent I
Yes she said
Id do anything for youanything
As long as I keep my eyes on you said he half mockingly
Im weak but youre weaker
Arent you
I guess so
I dont know
And she drew a long breath nestled into his arms and upon his breast with her perfumed hair drowsing his senses
He soon slept when he awoke toward noon he did not disturb her
He shaved and bathed and dressed and was about to go out when she called him
Oh I thought you were asleep said he
I cant wait for you to get breakfast
I must get a move on
Still blue
No indeed
But his face was not convincing
So long pet
Arent you going to kiss me goodby
He laughed tenderly yet in bitter selfmockery too
And waste an hour or so
Not much
What a siren you are
She put her hand over her face quickly
Now perhaps I can risk one kiss
He bent over her his lips touched her hair
She stretched out her hand laid it against his cheek
Dearest she murmured
I must go
Just a minute
No dont look at me
Turn your face so that I can see your profileso
She had turned his head with a hand that gently caressed as it pushed
I like that view best
Yes you are strong and brave
You will succeed
NoIll not keep you a minute
She kissed his hand rested her head for an instant on his lap as he sat on the edge of the bed suddenly flung herself to the far side of the bed with her face toward the wall
Go to sleep again lazy
cried he
Ill try to be home about dinnertime
See that you behave today
Good lord how hard it is to leave you
Having you makes nothing else seem worth while
Goodby
And he was off
She started to a sitting posture listened to the faint sound of his descending footsteps
She darted to the window leaned out watched him until he rounded the corner into Broadway
Then she dropped down with elbows on the window sill and hands pressing her cheeks she stared unseeingly at the opposite house at a gilt cage with a canary hopping and chirping within
And once more she thought all the thoughts that had filled her mind in the sleepless hours of that night and morning
Her eyes shifted in color from pure gray to pure violetback and forth as emotion or thought dominated her mind
She made herself coffee in the French machine heated the milk she brought every day from the dairy drank her cafe au lait slowly reading the newspaper advertisements for help wantedfemalea habit she had formed when she first came to New York and had never altogether dropped
When she finished her coffee she took the scissors and cut out several of the demands for help
She bathed and dressed
She moved through the routine of lifeprecisely as we all do whatever may be in our minds and hearts
She went out crossed Long Acre and entered the shop of a dealer in womens castoff clothes
She reappeared in the street presently with a fat sloppy looking woman in black
She took her to the rooms offered for sale her entire wardrobe except the dress she had on and one other the simply trimmed sailor upon her head the ties on her feet and one pair of boots and a few small articles
After long haggling the woman made a final priceninetyfive dollars for things most of them almost new which had cost upwards of seven hundred
Susan accepted the offer she knew she could do no better
The woman departed returned with a porter and several huge sweets of wrapping paper
The two made three bundles of the purchases the money was paid over they and Susans wardrobe departed
Next Susan packed in the traveling bag she had brought from Cincinnati the between seasons dress of brown serge she had withheld and some such collection of bare necessities as she had taken with her when she left George Warhams
Into the bag she put the pistol from under Spensers handkerchiefs in the third bureau drawer
When all was ready she sent for the maid to straighten the rooms
While the maid was at work she wrote this note DEARESTMr Drumley will tell you why I have gone
You will find some money under your handkerchiefs in the bureau
When you are on your feet again I may comeif you want me
It wont be any use for you to look for me
I ought to have gone before but I was selfish and blind
Goodby dear loveI wasnt so bad as you always suspected
I was true to you and for the sake of what you have been to me and done for me I couldnt be so ungrateful as not to go
Dont worry about me
I shall get on
And so will you
Its best for us both
Goodby dear heartI was true to you
Goodby
She sealed this note addressed it fastened it over the mantel in the sittingroom where they always put notes for each other
And after she had looked in each drawer and in the closet at all his clothing and had kissed the pillow on which his head had lain she took her bag and went
She had left for him the ninetyfive dollars and also eleven dollars of the money she had in her purse
She took with her two fivedollar bills and a dollar and forty cents in change
The violet waned in her eyes and in its stead came the gray of thought and action
THE END OF VOLUME I SUSAN LENOX HER RISE AND FALL by David Graham Phillips Volume II WITH A PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR D APPLETON AND COMPANY NEW YORK LONDON 1917 COPYRIGHT 1917 BY D APPLETON AND COMPANY  COPYRIGHT 19151916 BY THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE COMPANY Printed in the United States of America I SUSANS impulse was toward the stage
It had become a definite ambition with her the stronger because Spensers jealousy and suspicion had forced her to keep it a secret to pretend to herself that she had no thought but going on indefinitely as his obedient and devoted mistress
The hardiest and best growths are the growths inwardwhere they have sun and air from without
She had been at the theater several times every week and had studied the performances at a point of view very different from that of the audience
It was there to be amused she was there to learn
Spenser and such of his friends as he would let meet her talked plays and acting most of the time
He had forbidden her to have women friends
Men dont demoralize women women demoralize each other was one of his axioms
But such women as she had a bowing acquaintance with were all on the stagein comic operas or musical farces
She was much alone that meant many hours every day which could not but be spent by a mind like hers in reading and in thinking
Only those who have observed the difference aloneness makes in mental development where there is a good mind can appreciate how rapidly how broadly Susan expanded
She read plays more than any other kind of literature
She did not read them casually but was always thinking how they would act
She was soon making in imagination stage scenes out of dramatic chapters in novels as she read
More and more clearly the characters of play and novel took shape and substance before the eyes of her fancy
But the stage was clearly out of the question
While the idea of a stage career had been dominant she had thought in other directions also
Every Sunday indeed almost every day she found in the newspapers articles on the subject of work for women
Why do you waste time on that stuff
said Drumley when he discovered her taste for it
Oh a woman never can tell what may happen replied she
Shell never learn anything from those fool articles answered he
You ought to hear the people who get them up laughing about them
I see now why they are printed
Its good for circulation catches the womeneven women like you
However she persisted in reading
But never did she find an article that contained a really practical suggestionthat is one applying to the case of a woman who had to live on what she made at the start who was without experience and without a family to help her
All around her had been women who were making their way but few indeed of themeven of those regarded as successfulwere getting along without outside aid of some kind
So when she read or thought or inquired about work for women she was sometimes amused and oftener made unhappy by the truth as to the conditions that when a common worker rises it is almost always by the helping hand of a man and rarely indeed a generous handa painful and shameful truth which a society resolved at any cost to think well of itself fiercely conceals from itself and hypocritically lies about
She felt now that there was hope in only one directionhope of occupation that would enable her to live in physical moral and mental decency
She must find some employment where she could as decently as might be realize upon her physical assets
The stage would be bestbut the stage was impossible at least for the time
Later on she would try for it there was in her mind not a doubt of that for unsuspected of any who knew her there lay beneath her sweet and gentle exterior beneath her appearance of having been created especially for love and laughter and sympathy tenacity of purpose and daring of ambition that wererarelyhinted at the surface in her moments of abstraction
However just now the stage was impossible
Spenser would find her immediately
She must go into another part of town must work at something that touched his life at no point
She had often been told that her figure would be one of her chief assets as a player
And readymade clothes fitted her with very slight alterationsshowing that she had a model figure
The advertisements she had cut out were for cloak models
Within an hour after she left Fortyfourth Street she found at Jeffries and Jonas in Broadway a few doors below Houston a vacancy that had not yet been filledthough as a rule all the help needed was got from the throng of applicants waiting when the store opened
Come up to my office said Jeffries who happened to be near the door as she entered
Well see how you shape up
We want something extrasomething dainty and catchy
He was a short thick man with flat feet a flat face and an almost bald head
In his flat nostrils in the hollows of his great forward bent ears and on the lobes were bunches of coarse stiff gray hairs
His eyebrows bristled his small sly brown eyes twinkled with good nature and with sensuality
His skin had the pallor that suggests kidney trouble
His words issued from his thick mouth as if he were tasting each beforehandand liked the flavor
He led Susan into his private office closed the door took a tape measure from his desk
Now my dear said he eyeing her form gluttonously well size you upeh
Youre exactly the build I like
And under the pretense of taking her measurements he fumbled and felt pinched and stroked every part of her person laughing and chuckling the while
My but you are sweet
And so firm
What flesh
Solidsolid
Mighty healthy
You are a good girleh
I am a married woman
But youve got no ring
Ive never worn a ring
Wellwell
I believe that is one of the new wrinkles but I dont approve
Im an oldfashioned family man
Let me see again
Now dont mind a poor old man like me my dear
Ive got a wifethe best woman in the world and Ive never been untrue to her
A look over the fence occasionallybut not an inch out of the pasture
Dont stiffen yourself like that
I cant judge when you do
Not too much hipsneither sides nor back
Fine
Fine
And the thigh slenderyesquite lovely my dear
Thick thighs spoil the hang of garments
Yesyesa splendid figure
Ill bet the bosom is a corkerfine skin and nice ladylike size
You can have the place
What does it pay
she asked
Ten dollars to start with
Splendid wages
I started on two fifty
But I forgotyou dont know the business
Nonothing about it was her innocent honest answer
Ahwell thennine dollarseh
Susan hesitated
You can make quite a neat little bunch on the outsideyou can
We cater only to the best trade and the buyers who come to us are big easy spenders
But Im supposed to know nothing about that
Youll find out from the other girls
He chuckled
Oh its a nice soft life except for a few weeks along at this part of the yearand again in winter
Wellten dollars then
Susan accepted
It was more than she had expected to get it was less than she could hope to live on in New York in anything approaching the manner a person of any refinement or tastes or customs of comfort regards as merely decent
She must descend again to the tenements must resume the fight against that physical degradation which sooner or later imposesupon those descending to ita degradation of mind and heart deeper more saturating more putrefying than any that ever originated from within
Not so long as her figure lasted was she the worse off for not knowing a trade
Jeffries was telling the truth she would be getting splendid wages not merely for a beginner but for any woman of the working class
Except in rare occasional instances wages and salaries for women were kept down below the standard of decency by womans peculiar positionby such conditions as that most women took up work as a temporary makeshift or to piece out a familys earnings and that almost any woman could supplementand so many did supplementtheir earnings at labor with as large or larger earnings in the stealthy shameful way
Where was there a trade that would bring a girl ten dollars a week at the start
Even if she were a semiprofessional a stenographer and typewriter it would take expertness and long service to lift her up to such wages
Thanks to her figureto its chancing to please old Jeffries tasteshe was better off than all but a few working women than all but a few workingmen
She was of the labor aristocracy and if she had been one of a family of workers she would have been counted an enviable favorite of fortune
Unfortunately she was alone unfortunately for herself not at all from the standpoint of the tenement class she was now joining
Among them she would be a person who could afford the luxuries of life as life reveals itself to the tenements
Tomorrow morning at seven oclock said Jeffries
You have lost your husband
Yes
I saw youd had great grief
No insurance I judge
Wellyou will find anothermaybe a rich one
Noyoull not have to sleep alone long my dear
And he patted her on the shoulder gave her a parting fumble of shoulders and arms
She was able to muster a grateful smile for she felt a rare kindness of heart under the familiar animalism to which goodlooking wellformed women who go about much unescorted soon grow accustomed
Also experience had taught her that as things go with girls of the working class his treatment was courteous considerate chivalrous almost
With men in absolute control of all kinds of work with women stimulating the sex appetite by openly or covertly using their charms as female to assist them in the cruel struggle for existencewhat was to be expected
Her way to the elevator took her along aisles lined with tables hidden under masses of cloaks jackets dresses and materials for making them
They exuded the odors of the factoryfaint yet pungent odors that brought up before her visions of huge badly ventilated rooms where women aged or ageing swiftly were toiling hour after hour monotonouslyspending half of each day in buying the right to eat and sleep unhealthily
The odorsor rather the visions they evokedmade her sick at heart
For the moment she came from under the spell of her peculiar traither power to do without whimper or vain gesture of revolt the inevitable thing whatever it was
She paused to steady herself half leaning against a lofty uppiling of winter cloaks
A girl young at first glance not nearly so young thereafter suddenly appeared before hera girl whose hair had the sheen of burnished brass and whose soft smooth skin was of that frogbelly whiteness which suggests an inheritance of some bleaching and blistering disease
She had small regular features eyes that at once suggested looseness goodnatured yet mercenary too
She was dressed in the sleek tightfitting tryingon robe of the professional model and her figure was superb in its firm luxuriousness
Sick
asked the girl with real kindliness
Noonly dizzy for the moment
I suppose youve had a hard day
It might have been easier Susan replied attempting a smile
Its no fun looking for a job
But youve caught on
Yes
He took me
I made a bet with myself that he would when I saw you go in
The girl laughed agreeably
He picked you for Gideon
What department is that
The girl laughed again with a cynical squinting of the eyes
Oh Gideons our biggest customer
He buys for the largest house in Chicago
Im looking for a place to live said Susan
Some place in this part of town
How much do you want to spend
Im to have ten a week
So I cant afford more than twelve or fourteen a month for rent can I
If you happen to have to live on the ten was the reply with a sly merry smile
Its all Ive got
Again the girl laughed the goodhumored mercenary eyes twinkling rakishly
Wellyou cant get much for fourteen a month
I dont care so long as its clean
Gee youre reasonable aint you
cried the girl
Clean
I pay fourteen a week and all kinds of things come through the cracks from the other apartments
You must be a stranger to little old New Yorkbugtown a lady friend of mine calls it
Alone
Yes
Um The girl shook her head dubiously
Rents are mighty steep in New York and going up all the time
You see the rich people that own the lands and houses here need a lot of money in their business
Youve got either to take a room or part of one in with some tenement family respectable but noisy and dirty and not at all refined or else youve got to live in a house where everything goes
You want to live respectable I judge
Yes
Thats the way with me
Do what you please I say but for Gods sake dont make yourself common Youll want to be free to have your gentlemen friends comeand at the same time a room youll not be ashamed for em to see on account of dirt and smells and common people around
I shant want to see anyone in my room
The young woman winced then went on with hasty enthusiasm
I knew you were refined the minute I looked at you
I think you might get a room in the house of a lady friend of mine Mrs Tucker up in Clinton Place near University Placean elegant neighborhoodthat is the north side of the street
The south sides kind o low on account of dagoes having moved in there
They live like verminbut then all tenement people do
Theyve got to said Susan
Yes thats a fact
Aint it awful
Ill write down the name and address of my lady friend
Im Miss Mary Hinkle
My name is Lorna Sackville said Susan in response to the expectant look of Miss Hinkle
My what a swell name
Youve been sick havent you
No Im never sick
Me too
My mother taught me to stop eating as soon as I felt bad and not to eat again till I was all right
I do that too said Susan
Is it good for the health
It starves the doctors
Youve never worked before
Oh yesIve worked in a factory
Miss Hinkle looked disappointed
Then she gave Susan a side glance of incredulity
Id never a thought it
But I can see you werent brought up to that
Ill write the address
And she went back through the showroom presently to reappear with a card which she gave Susan
Youll find Mrs Tucker a perfect ladytoo much a lady to get on
I tell her shell go to ruinand she will
Susan thanked Miss Hinkle and departed
A few minutes walk brought her to the old highstooped brownstone where Mrs Tucker lived
The dents scratches and old paint scales on the door the duststreaked windows the slovenly hang of the imitation lace window curtains proclaimed the cheap middleclass lodging or boarding house of the humblest grade
Respectable undoubtedly for the fitfully prosperous offenders against laws and morals insist upon better accommodations
Susans heart sank
She saw that once more she was clinging at the edge of the precipice
And what hope was there that she would get back to firm ground
Certainly not by honest labor
Back to the tenement
Yes Im on the way back she said to herself
However she pulled the loose bellknob and was admitted to a dingy dusty hallway by a maid so redolent of stale perspiration that it was noticeable even in the halls strong saturation of smells of cheap cookery
The parlor furniture was rapidly going to pieces the chromos and prints hung crazily awry dust lay thick upon the center table upon the chimneypiece upon the picture frames upon the carving in the rickety old chairs
Only by standing did Susan avoid service as a dust rag
It was typical of the profound discouragement that blights or blasts all but a small area of our modern civilizationa discouragement due in part to ignorancebut not at all to the cause usually assignedto natural shiftlessness
It is chiefly due to an unconscious instinctive feeling of the hopelessness of the average lot
While Susan explained to Mrs Tucker how she had come and what she could afford she examined her with results far from disagreeable
One glance into that homely wrinkled face was enough to convince anyone of her goodness of heartand to Susan in those days of aloneness of uncertainty of the feeling of hopelessness goodness of heart seemed the supreme charm
Such a woman as a landlady and a landlady in New York was pathetically absurd
Even to still rather simpleminded Susan she seemed an invitation to the swindler to the sponger with the hardluck story to the sinking who clutch about desperately and drag down with them everyone who permits them to get a hold
Ive only got one room said Mrs Tucker
Thats not any too nice
I did rather calculate to get five a week for it but you are the kind I like to have in the house
So if you want it Ill let it to you for fourteen a month
And I do hope youll pay as steady as you can
Theres so many in such hard lines that I have a tough time with my rent
Ive got to pay my rent you know
Ill go as soon as I cant pay replied Susan
The landladys apologetic tone made her sick at heart as a sensitive human being must ever feel in the presence of a fellowbeing doomed to disaster
Thank you said Mrs Tucker gratefully
I do wish She checked herself
No I dont mean that
They do the best they canand Ill botch along somehow
I look at the bright side of things
The incurable optimism of the smile accompanying these words moved Susan abnormally bruised and tender of heart that morning almost to tears
A woman with her own way to make and always looking at the bright side
How long have you had this house
Only five months
My husband died a year ago
I had to give up our little business six months after his death
Such a nice little stationery store but I couldnt seem to refuse credit or to collect bills
Then I came here
This looks like losing too
But Im sure Ill come out all right
The Lord will provide as the Good Book says
I dont have no trouble keeping the house full
Only they dont seem to pay
You want to see your room
She and Susan ascended three flights to the top storyto a closet of a room at the back
The walls were newly and brightly papered
The sloping roof of the house made one wall a ceiling also and in this two small windows were set
The furniture was a tiny bed white and clean as to its linen a table two chairs a small washstand with a little bowl and a less pitcher a soap dish and a mug
Along one wall ran a row of hooks
On the floor was an old and incredibly dirty carpet mitigated by a strip of clean matting which ran from the door between washstand and bed to one of the windows
Susan glanced rounda glance was enough to enable her to see allall that was there all that the things there implied
Back to the tenement life
She shuddered
It aint much said Mrs Tucker
But usually rooms like these rents for five a week
The sun had heated the roof scorching hot the air of this room immediately underneath was like that of a cellar where a furnace is in full blast
But Susan knew she was indeed in luck
Its clean and nice here said she to Mrs Tucker and Im much obliged to you for being so reasonable with me
And to clinch the bargain she then and there paid half a months rent
Ill give you the rest when my week at the stores up
No hurry said Mrs Tucker who was handling the money and looking at it with glistening grateful eyes
Us poor folks oughtnt to be hard on each otherthough Lord knows if we was I reckon wed not be quite so poor
Its them that has the streak of hard in em what gets on
But the Bible teaches us thats what to expect in a world of sin
I suppose you want to go now and have your trunk sent
This is all Ive got said Susan indicating her bag on the table
Into Mrs Tuckers face came a look of terror that made Susan realize in an instant how hardpressed she must be
It was the kind of look that comes into the eyes of the deer brought down by the dogs when it sees the hunter coming up
But Ive a good place Susan hastened to say
I get ten a week
And as I told you before when I cant pay Ill go right away
Ive lost so much in bad debts explained the landlady humbly
I dont seem to see which way to turn
Then she brightened
Itll all come out for the best
I work hard and I try to do right by everybody
Im sure it will said Susan believingly
Often her confidence in the moral ideals trained into her from childhood had been sorely tried
But never had she permitted herself more than a hasty ashamed doubt that the only way to get on was to work and to practice the Golden Rule
Everyone who was prosperous attributed his prosperity to the steadfast following of that way as for those who were not prosperous they were either lazy or badhearted or would have been even worse off had they been less faithful to the creed that was best policy as well as best for peace of mind and heart
In trying to be as inexpensive to Spenser as she could contrive and also because of her passion for improving herself Susan had explored far into the almost unknown art of living on its shamefully neglected material side
She had cultivated the habit of spending much time about her purchases of every kindhad spent time intelligently in saving money intelligently
She had gone from shop to shop comparing values and prices
She had studied quality in food and in clothing and thus she had discovered what enormous sums are wasted through ignorancewasted by poor even more lavishly than by rich or welltodo because the shops where the poor dealt had absolutely no check on their rapacity through the occasional canny customer
She had learned the fundamental truth of the material art of living only when a good thing happens to be cheap is a cheap thing good
Spenser crossexamining her as to how she passed the days found out about this education she was acquiring
It amused him
A waste of time
he used to say
Pay what they ask and dont bother your head with such petty matters
He might have suspected and accused her of being stingy had not her generosity been about the most obvious and incessant trait of her character
She was now reduced to an income below what life can be decently maintained uponthe life of a citydweller with normal tastes for cleanliness and healthfulness
She proceeded without delay to put her invaluable education into use
She must fill her mind with the present and with the future
She must not glance back
She must ignore her woundstheir aches their clamorous throbs
She took off her clothes as soon as Mrs Tucker left her alone brushed them and hung them up put on the thin wrapper she had brought in her bag
The fierce heat of the little packingcase of a room became less unendurable also she was saving the clothes from useless wear
She sat down at the table and with pencil and paper planned her budget
Of the ten dollars a week three dollars and thirty cents must be subtracted for rentfor shelter
This left six dollars and seventy cents for the other two necessaries food and clothingthere must be no incidental expenses since there was no money to meet them
She could not afford to provide for carfare on stormy days a rain coat overshoes and umbrella more expensive at the outset were incomparably cheaper in the long run
Her washing and ironing she would of course do for herself in the evenings and on Sundays
Of the two items which the six dollars and seventy cents must cover food came first in importance
How little could she live on
That stifling hot room
She was as wet as if she had come undried from a bath
She had thought she could never feel anything but love for the sun of her City of the Sun
But this undreamedof heatlike the cruel caresses of a too impetuous lover How little could she live on
Dividing her total of six dollars and seventy cents by seven she found that she had ninetyfive cents a day
She would soon have to buy clothes however scrupulous care she might take of those she possessed
It was modest indeed to estimate fifteen dollars for clothes before October
That meant she must save fifteen dollars in the remaining three weeks of June in July August and Septemberin one hundred and ten days
She must save about fifteen cents a day
And out of that she must buy soap and tooth powder outer and under clothes perhaps a hat and a pair of shoes
Thus she could spend for food not more than eighty cents a day as much less as was consistent with buying the best qualityfor she had learned by bitter experience the ravages poor quality food makes in health and looks had learned why girls of the working class go to pieces swiftly after eighteen
She must fight to keep healthsick she did not dare be
She must fight to keep looksher figure was her income
Eighty cents a day
The outlook was not so gloomy
A cup of cocoa in the morningmade at home of the best cocoa the kind that did not overheat the blood and disorder the skinit would cost her less than ten cents
She would carry lunch with her to the store
In the evening she would cook a chop or something of that kind on the gas stove she would buy
Some days she would be able to save twenty or even twentyfive cents toward clothing and the like
Whatever else happened she was resolved never again to sink to dirt and rags
Never againnever
She had passed through that experience once without loss of selfrespect only because it was by way of education
To go through it again would be yielding ground in the fightthe fight for a destiny worth while which some latent but mighty instinct within her never permitted her to forget
She sat at the table with the shutters closed against the fiery light of the summer afternoon sun
That hideous unacceptable heat
With eyelids droopeddeep and dark were the circles round themshe listened to the roar of the city a savage sound like the clamor of a multitude of famished wild beasts
A city like the City of Destruction in Pilgrims Progressa city where of all the millions but a few thousands were moving toward or keeping in the sunlight of civilization
The rest the swarms of the cheap boarding houses cheap lodging houses tenementsthese myriads were squirming in darkness and squalor ignorant and never to be less ignorant ill fed and never to be better fed clothed in pitiful absurd rags or shoddy vulgar attempts at finery and never to be better clothed
She would not be of those
She would struggle on would sink only to mount
She would work she would try to do as nearly right as she could
And in the end she must triumph
She would get at least a good part of what her soul craved of what her mind craved of what her heart craved
The heat of this tenement room
The heat to which poverty was exposed naked and bound
Would not anyone be justified in doing anythingyes anythingto escape from this fiend
II ELLEN the maid slept across the hall from Susan in a closet so dirty that no one could have risked in it any article of clothing with the least pretension to cleanness
It was no better no worse than the lodgings of more than two hundred thousand New Yorkers
Its one narrow opening beside the door gave upon a shaft whose odors were so foul that she kept the window closed preferring heat like the inside of a steaming pan to the only available outside air
This in a civilized city where hundreds of dogs with jeweled collars slept in luxurious rooms on downiest beds and had servants to wait upon them
The morning after Susans coming Ellen woke her as they had arranged at a quarter before five
The night before Susan had brought up from the basement a large bucket of water for she had made up her mind to take a bath every day at least until the cold weather set in and rendered such a luxury impossible
With this water and what she had in her little pitcher Susan contrived to freshen herself up
She had bought a gas stove and some indispensable utensils for three dollars and seventeen cents in a Fourteenth Street store a pound of cocoa for seventy cents and ten cents worth of rollsthree rolls well baked of first quality flour and with about as good butter and other things put into the dough as one can expect in bread not made at home
These purchases had reduced her cash to fortythree centsand she ought to buy without delay a clock with an alarm attachment
And pay daySaturdaywas two days away
She made a cup of cocoa drank it slowly eating one of the rollsall in the same methodical way like a machine that continues to revolve after the power has been shut off
It was then even more than during her first evening alone even more than when she from time to time startled out of troubled sleepit was then as she forced down her lonely breakfast that she most missed Rod
When she had finished she completed her toilet
The final glance at herself in the little mirror was depressing
She looked fresh for her new surroundings and for her new class
But in comparison with what she usually looked already there was a distinct an ominous falling off
Im glad Rod never saw me looking like this she said aloud drearily
Taking a roll for lunch she issued forth at halfpast six
The hour and threequarters she had allowed for dressing and breakfasting had been none too much
In the coolness and comparative quiet she went down University Place and across Washington Square under the old trees all alive with song and breeze and flashes of early morning light
She was soon in Broadways deep canyon was drifting absently along in the stream of cross mussylooking workers pushing southward
Her heart ached her brain throbbed
It was horrible this loneliness and every one of the wounds where she had severed the ties with Spenser was bleeding
She was astonished to find herself before the building whose upper floors were occupied by Jeffries and Jonas
How had she got there
Where had she crossed Broadway
Good morning Miss Sackville
It was Miss Hinkle just arriving
Her eyes were heavy and there were the crisscross lines under them that tell a story to the expert in the different effects of different kinds of dissipation
Miss Hinkle was showing her ageand she was no spring chicken
Susan returned her greeting gazing at her with the dazed eyes and puzzled smile of an awakening sleeper
Ill show you the ropes said Miss Hinkle as they climbed the two flights of stairs
Youll find the job dead easy
Theyre mighty nice people to work for Mr Jeffries especially
Not easy fruit of course but nice for people that have got on
You didnt sleep well
YesI think so
I didnt have a chance to drop round last night
I was out with one of the buyers
How do you like Mrs
Tucker
Shes very good isnt she
Shell never get along
She works hard toobut not for herself
In this world you have to look out for Number One
I had a swell dinner last night
LobsterI love lobsterand elegant champagneup to Murrayssuch a refined placeall fountains and mirrorsreally quite artistic
And my gentleman friend was so nice and respectful
You know we have to go out with the buyers when they ask us
It helps the house sell goods
And we have to be careful not to offend them
Miss Hinkles tone in the last remark was so significant that Susan looked at herand looking understood
Sometimes pursued Miss Hinkle eyes carefully averted sometimes a new girl goes out with an important customer and he gets fresh and she kicks and complains to Mr Jeffriesor Mr Jonasor Mr Ratney the head man
They always sympathize with herbutwell Ive noticed that somehow she soon loses her job
What do you do whenwhen a customer annoys you
I
Miss Hinkle laughed with some embarrassment
Oh I do the best I can
A swift glance of the cynical laughing fast eyes at Susan and away
The best I canfor the houseand for myself



I talk to you because I know youre a lady and because I dont want to see you thrown down
A woman thats living quietly at homelike a ladyshe can be squeamish
But out in the world a woman cant afford to beno nor a man neither
You dont find this set down in the books and they dont preach it in the churchesleastways they didnt when I used to go to church
But its true all the same
They were a few minutes early so Miss Hinkle continued the conversation while they waited for the opening of the room where Susan would be outfitted for her work
I called you Miss Sackville said she but youve been marriedhavent you
Yes
I can always tellor at least I can see whether a womans had experience or not
Well Ive never been regularly married and I dont expect to unless something pretty good offers
Think Id marry one of these rotten little clerks
Miss Hinkle answered her own question with a scornful sniff
They can hardly make a living for themselves
And a man who amounts to anything he wants a refined lady to help him on up not a working girl
Of course therere exceptions
But as a rule a girl in our position either has to stay single or marry beneath hermarry some mechanic or such like
Well I aint so lazy or so crazy about being supported that Id sink to be cook and slopcarrierand worsefor a carpenter or a bricklayer
Going out with the buyersthe gentlemanly oneshas spoiled my taste
I cant stand a coarse mancoarse dress and hands and manners
Can you
Susan turned hastily away so that her face was hidden from Miss Hinkle
Ill bet you wasnt married to a coarse man
Id rather not talk about myself said Susan with an effort
Its not pleasant
Her manner of checking Miss Hinkles friendly curiosity did not give offense it excited the experienced working womans sympathy
She went on Well I feel sorry for any woman that has to work
Of course most women doand at worse than anything in the stores and factories
As between being a drudge to some dirty common laborer like most women are and working in a factory even give me the factory
Yes give me a job as a pot slinger even low as that is
Oh I hate working people
I love refinement
Up to Murrays last night I sat there eating my lobster and drinking my wine and I pretended I was a ladyand my how happy I was
The stockroom now opened
Susan with the help of Miss Hinkle and the stock keeper dressed in one of the tightfitting satin slips that revealed every curve and line of her form made every motion however slight every breath she drew a gesture of sensuousness
As she looked at herself in a long glass in one of the showparlors her face did not reflect the admiration frankly displayed upon the faces of the two other women
That satin slip seemed to have a moral quality an immoral character
It made her feel nakedno as if she were naked and being peeped at through a crack or keyhole
Youll soon get used to it Miss Hinkle assured her
And youll learn to show off the dresses and cloaks to the best advantage
She laughed her insinuating little laugh again amused cynical reckless
You know the buyers are men
Gee what awful jay things we work off on them sometimes
They cant see the dress for the figure
And youve got such a refined figure Miss Sackvillethe kind Id be crazy about if I was a man
But I must say here she eyed herself in the glass complacentlymost men prefer a figure like mine
Dont they Miss Simmons
The stock keeper shook her fat shoulders in a gesture of indifferent disdain
They take whatevers handiestthats my experience
About halfpast nine the first customer appearedMr Gideon it happened to be
He was making the rounds of the big wholesale houses in search of stock for the huge Chicago department store that paid him fifteen thousand a year and expenses
He had been contemptuous of the offerings of Jeffries and Jonas for the winter season had praised with enthusiasm the models of their principal rival Icklemeier Schwartz and Company
They were undecided whether he was really thinking of deserting them or was feeling for lower prices
Mr Jeffries bustled into the room where Susan stood waiting his flat face quivered with excitement
Gids come
he said in a hoarse whisper
Everybody get busy
Well try Miss Sackville on him
And he himself assisted while they tricked out Susan in an afternoon costume of pale gray putting on her head a big pale gray hat with harmonizing feathers
The model was offered in all colors and also in a modified form that permitted its use for either afternoon or evening
Susan had received her instructions so when she was dressed she was ready to sweep into Gideons presence with languid majesty
Jeffries eyes glistened as he noted her walk
She looks as if she really was a lady
exclaimed he
I wish I could make my daughters move around on their trotters like that
Gideon was enthroned in an easy chair smoking a cigar
He was a spare man of perhaps fortyfive with no intention of abandoning the pretensions to youth for many a year
In dress he was as spick and span as a tailor at the trades annual convention
But he had evidently been going some for several days the sour worn haggard face rising above his elegantly fitting collar suggested a motheaten jaguar that has been for weeks on short rations or none
Whats the matter
he snapped as the door began to open
I dont like to he kept waiting
In swept Susan and Jeffries rubbing his thick hands said fawningly But I think Mr Gideon youll say it was worth waiting for
Gideons angry arrogant eyes softened at first glimpse of Susan
Um
he grunted some such sound as the jaguar aforesaid would make when the first chunk of food hurtled through the bars and landed on his paws
He sat with cigar poised between his long white fingers while Susan walked up and down before him displaying the dress at all angles Jeffries expatiating upon it the while
Dont talk so damn much Jeff
he commanded with the insolence of a customer containing possibilities of large profit
I judge for myself
Im not a damn fool
I should say not cried Jeffries laughing the merchants laugh for a customers pleasantry
But I cant help talking about it Gid its so lovely
Jeffries shrewd eyes leaped for joy when Gideon got up from his chair and under pretense of examining the garment investigated Susans figure
As his gentle insinuating hands traveled over her his eyes sought hers
Excuse me said Jeffries
Ill see that they get the other things ready
And out he went winking at Mary Hinkle to follow himan unnecessary gesture as she was already on her way to the door
Gideon understood as well as did they why they left
I dont think Ive seen you before my dear said he to Susan
I came only this morning replied she
I like to know everybody I deal with
We must get better acquainted
Youve got the best figure in the businessthe very best
Thank you said Susan with a grave distant smile
Got a date for dinner tonight
inquired he and assuming that everything would yield precedence to him he did not wait for a reply but went on Tell me your address
Ill send a cab for you at seven oclock
Thank you said Susan but I cant go
Gideon smiled
Oh dont be shy
Of course youll go
Ask Jeffries
Hell tell you its all right
There are reasons why Id rather not be seen in the restaurants
Thats even better
Ill come in the cab myself and well go to a quiet place
His eyes smiled insinuatingly at her
Now that she looked at him more carefully he was unusually attractive for a man of his typehad strength and intelligence in his features had a suggestion of mastery of one used to obedience in his voice
His teeth were even and sound his lips firm yet not too thin
Come said he persuasively
Ill not eat you up with a gay and gracious smileat least Ill try not to
Susan remembered what Miss Hinkle had told her
She saw that she must either accept the invitation or give up her position
She said Very well and gave him her address
Back came Jeffries and Miss Hinkle carrying the first of the wraps
Gideon waved them away
Youve shown em to me before said he
I dont want to see em again
Give me the evening gowns
Susan withdrew soon to appear in a dress that left her arms and neck bare
Gideon could not get enough of this
Jeffries kept her walking up and down until she was ready to drop with weariness of the monotony of the distasteful play of Gideons fiery glance upon her arms and shoulders and throat
Gideon tried to draw her into conversation but she wouldindeed couldgo no further than direct answers to his direct questions
Never mind said he to her in an undertone
Ill cheer you up this evening
I think I know how to order a dinner
Her instant conquest of the difficult and valuable Gideon so elated Jeffries that he piled the work on her
He used her with every important buyer who came that day
The temperature was up in the high nineties the hot moist air stood stagnant as a barnyard pool the winter models were cruelly hot and heavy
All day long with a pause of half an hour to eat her roll and drink a glass of water Susan walked up and down the show parlors weighted with dresses and cloaks furs for arctic weather
The other girls even those doing almost nothing were all but prostrated
It was little short of intolerable this struggle to gain the honest selfrespecting living by honest work that there was so much talk about
Toward five oclock her nerves abruptly and completely gave way and she faintedfor the first time in her life
At once the whole establishment was in an uproar
Jeffries cursed himself loudly for his shortsightedness for his overestimating her young strength
Shell look like hell this evening he wailed wringing his hands like a distracted peasant woman
Maybe she wont be able to go out at all
She soon came round
They brought her whiskey and afterward tea and sandwiches
And with the power of quick recuperation that is the most fascinating miracle of healthy youth she not only showed no sign of her breakdown but looked much better
And she felt better
We shall some day understand why it is that if a severe physical blow follows upon a mental blow recovery from the physical blow is always accompanied by a relief of the mental strain
Susan came out of her fit of faintness and exhaustion with a different point of viewas if time had been long at work softening her grief
Spenser seemed part of the present no longer but of the pasta past far more remote than yesterday
Mary Hinkle sat with her as she drank the tea
Did you make a date with Gid
inquired she
Her tone let Susan know that the question had been prompted by Jeffries
He asked me to dine with him and I said I would
Have you got a nice dressdinner dress I mean
The linen one Im wearing is all
My other dress is for cooler weather
Then Ill give you one out of stockI mean Ill borrow one for you
This dinners a house affair you knowto get Gids order
Itll be worth thousands to them
There wouldnt be anything to fit me on such short notice said Susan casting about for an excuse for not wearing borrowed finery
Why youve got a model figure
Ill pick you out a white dressand a black and white hat
I know em all and I know one thatll make you look simply lovely
Susan did not protest
She was profoundly indifferent to what happened to her
Life seemed a show in which she had no part and at which she sat a listless spectator
A few minutes and in puffed Jeffries solicitous as a fussy old bird with a new family
Youre a lot better aint you
cried he before he had looked at her
Oh yes youll be all right
And youll have a lovely time with Mr Gideon
Hes a perfect gentlemanknows how to treat a lady



The minute I laid eyes on you I said to myself said I Jeffries shes a mascot
And you are my dear
Youll get us the order
But you mustnt talk business with him you understand
Yes said Susan wearily
Hes a gentleman you know and it dont do to mix business and social pleasures
You string him along quiet and ladylike and elegant as if there wasnt any such things as cloaks or dresses in the world
Hell understand all right



If you land the order my dear Ill see that you get a nice present
A nice dressthe one were going to lend youif he gives us a slice
The dress and twentyfive in cash if he gives us all
Hows that
Thank you said Susan
Ill do my best
Youll land it
Youll land it
I feel as if we had it with his O K on it
Susan shivered
Dontdont count on me too much she said hesitatingly
Im not in very good spirits Im sorry to say
A little pressed for money
Jeffries hesitated made an effort blurted out what was for him the business man a giddy generosity
On your way out stop at the cashiers
Hell give you this weeks pay in advance
Jeffries hesitated decided against dangerous liberality
Not ten you understand but say six
You see you wont have been with us a full week
And he hurried away frightened by his prodigality by these hysterical impulses that were rushing him far from the course of sound business sense
As Jones says Im a generous old fool he muttered
My soft heartll ruin me yet
Jeffries sent Mary Hinkle home with Susan to carry the dress and hat to help her make a toilet and to start her off right
In the hour before they left the store there was offered a typical illustration of why and how business is able to suspend the normal moral sense and to substitute for it a highly ingenious counterfeit of supreme moral obligation to it
The hysterical Jeffries had infected the entire personnel with his excitement with the sense that a great battle was impending and that the cause of the house which was the cause of everyone who drew pay from it had been intrusted to the young recruit with the fascinating figure and the sweet sad face
And Susans sensitive nature was soon vibrating in response to this feeling
It terrified her that she the inexperienced had such grave responsibility
It made her heart heavy to think of probable failure when the house had been so good to her had taken her in had given her unusual wages had made it possible for her to get a start in life had intrusted to her its cause its chance to retrieve a bad season and to protect its employees instead of discharging a lot of them
Have you got long white gloves
asked Mary Hinkle as they walked up Broadway she carrying the dress and Susan the hat box
Only a few pairs of short ones
You must have long white glovesand a pair of white stockings
I cant afford them
Oh Jeffries told me to ask youand to go to work and buy them if you hadnt
They stopped at Wanamakers
Susan was about to pay when Mary stopped her
If you pay said she maybe youll get your money back from the house and maybe you wont
If I pay theyll not make a kick on giving it back to me
The dress Mary had selected was a simple white batiste cut out at the neck prettily and with the elbow sleeves that were then the fashion
Your arms and throat are lovely said Mary
And your hands are mighty nice toothats why Im sure youve never been a real working girlleastways not for a long time
When you get to the restaurant and draw off your gloves in a slow careless ladylike kind of way and put your elbows on the tablemy how he will take on
Mary looked at her with an intense but not at all malignant envy
If you dont land high itll be because youre a fool
And you aint that
Im afraid I am replied Susan
Yes I guess Im whats called a foolwhat probably is a fool
You want to look out then warned Miss Hinkle
You want to go to work and get over that
Beauty dont count unless a girls got shrewdness
The streets are full of beauties sellin out for a bare living
They thought they couldnt help winning and they got left and the plain girls who had to hustle and manage have passed them
Go to Dels or Rectors or the Waldorf or the Madrid or any of those hightoned places and see the women with the swell clothes and jewelry
The married ones and the other kind both
Are they raving tearing beauties
Not often



The trouble with me is Ive been too goodhearted and too soft about being flattered
I was too good looking and a small easy living came too easy
YouId say you werethat you had brains but were shy about using them
Whats the good of having them
Might as well be a boob
Then too youve got to go to work and look out about being too refined
The refined nice ones goes the lowestif they get pushedand this is a pushing world
Youll get pushed just as far as youll let em
Take it from me
Ive been down the line
Susans low spirits sank lower
These disagreeable truthsfor observation and experience made her fear they were truthsfilled her with despondency
What was the matter with life
As between the morality she had been taught and the practical morality of this world upon which she had been cast which was the right
How take hold
How avert the impending disaster
What of the good shouldmustshe throw away
What shouldmustshe cling to
Mary Hinkle was shocked by the poor little room
This is no place for a lady
cried she
But it wont last longnot after tonight if you play your cards halfway right
Im very well satisfied said Susan
If I can only keep this
She felt no interest in the toilet until the dress and hat were unpacked and laid out upon the bed
At sight of them her eyes became a keen and lively graynever violet for that kind of emotionand there surged up the love of finery that dwells in every normal womanand in every normal manthat is put there by a heredity dating back through the ages to the very beginning of conscious lifeand does not leave them until life gives up the battle and prepares to vacate before death
Ellen the maid passing the door saw and entered to add her ecstatic exclamations to the excitement
Down she ran to bring Mrs Tucker who no sooner beheld the glory displayed upon the humble bed than she too was in a turmoil
Susan dressed with the aid of three maids as interested and eager as ever robed a queen for coronation
Ellen brought hot water and a larger bowl
Mrs Tucker wished to lend a highly scented toilet soap she used when she put on gala attire but Susan insisted upon her own plain soap
They all helped her bathe they helped her select the best underclothes from her small store
Susan would put on her own stockings but Ellen got one foot into one of the slippers and Mrs Tucker looked after the other foot
Aint they lovely
said Ellen to Mrs Tucker as they knelt together at their task
I never see such feet
Not a lump on em but like feet in a picture
It takes a mighty good leg to look good in a white stocking observed Mary
But yours is so nice and long and slim that theyd stand most anything
Mrs Tucker and Ellen stood by with no interference save suggestion and comment while Mary who at one time worked for a hairdresser did Susans thick dark hair
Susan would permit no elaborations much to Miss Hinkles regret
But the three agreed that she was right when the simple sweep of the vital blueblack hair was finished in a loose and graceful knot at the back and Susans small healthily pallid face looked its loveliest with the violetgray eyes soft and sweet and serious
Mrs Tucker brought the hat from the bed and Susan put it ona large black straw of a most becoming shape with two pure white plumes curling round the crown and a third not so long rising gracefully from the big buckle where the three plumes met
And now came the putting on of the dress
With as much care as if they were handling a rare and fragile vase Mary and Mrs Tucker held the dress for Susan to step into it
Ellen kept her petticoat in place while the other two escorted the dress up Susans form
Then the three worked together at hooking and smoothing
Susan washed her hands again refused to let Mrs Tucker run and bring powder produced from a drawer some prepared chalk and with it safeguarded her nose against shine she tucked the powder rag into her stocking
Last of all the gloves went on and a small handkerchief was thrust into the palm of the left glove
How do I look
asked Susan
LovelyFineJust grand exclaimed the three maids
I feel awfully dressed up said she
And its so hot
You must go right downstairs where its cool and you wont get wilted cried Mrs Tucker
Hold your skirts close on the way
The steps and walls aint none too clean
In the bathroom downstairs there was a long mirror built into the wall a relic of the old houses long departed youth of grandeur
As the tenantMr Jessopwas out Mrs Tucker led the way into it
There Susan had the first satisfactory look at herself
She knew she was a pretty woman she would have been weakminded had she not known it
But she was amazed at herself
A touch here and there a sinuous shifting of the body within the garments and the suggestion of dressed up vanished before the reflected eyes of her agitated assistants who did not know what had happened but only saw the results
She hardly knew the tall beautiful woman of fashion gazing at her from the mirror
Could it be that this was her hairthese eyes hersand the mouth and nose and the skin
Was this long slender figure her very own
What an astounding difference clothes did make
Never before had Susan worn anything nearly so fine
This is the way I ought to look all the time thought she
And this is the way I will look
Only bettermuch better
Already her true eye was seeing the defects the chances for improvementhow the hat could be rebent and retrimmed to adapt it to her features how the dress could be altered to make it more tasteful more effective in subtly attracting attention to her figure
How much do you suppose the dress cost Miss Hinkle
asked Ellenthe question Mrs Tucker had been dying to put but had refrained from putting lest it should sound unrefined
It costs ninety wholesale said Miss Hinkle
Thatd mean a hundred and twentyfivea hundred and fifty maybe if you was to try to buy it in a department store
And the hatwell Lichtensteind ask fifty or sixty for it and never turn a hair
Goshee
exclaimed Ellen
Did you ever hear the like
Im not surprised said Mrs Tucker who in fact was flabbergasted
Wellits worth the money to them that can afford to buy it
The good Lord put everything on earth to be used I reckon
And Miss Sackville is the build for things like that
Now itd be foolish on me with a stomach and sitter that wont let no skirt hang fit to look at
The bell rang
The excitement died from Susans face leaving it pale and cold
A wave of nausea swept through her
Ellen peeped out Mrs Tucker and Miss Hinkle listening with anxious faces
Its him
whispered Ellen and theres a taxi too
It was decided that Ellen should go to the door that as she opened it Susan should come carelessly from the back room and advance along the hall
And this program was carried out with the result that as Gideon said Is Miss Sackville here
Miss Sackville appeared before his widening wondering admiring eyes
He was dressed in the extreme of fashion and costliness in good taste while it would have been impossible for him to look distinguished he did look what he wasa prosperous business man with prospects
He came perfumed and rustling
But he felt completely outclasseduntil he reminded himself that for all her brave show of fashionable lady she was only a model while he was a fifteenthousandayear man on the way to a partnership
Dont you think we might dine on the veranda at Sherrys
suggested he
Itd be cool there
At sight of him she had nerved herself had keyed herself up toward recklessness
She was in for it
She would put it through
No futile cowardly shrinking and whimpering
Why not try to get whatever pleasure there was a chance for
ButSherryswas it safe
Yes almost any of the Fifth Avenue placesexcept the Waldorf possiblywas safe enough
The circuit of Spenser and his friends lay in the more Bohemian Broadway district
He had taken her to Sherrys only once to see as part of a New York education the Sunday night crowd of fashionable people
If you like said she
Gideon beamed
He would be able to show off his prize
As they drove away Susan glanced at the front parlor windows saw the curtains agitated felt the three friendly excited faces palpitating
She leaned from the cab window waved her hand smiled
The three faces instantly appeared and immediately hid again lest Gideon should see
But Gideon was too busy planning conversation
He knew Miss Sackville was as common as the rest of emand an old hand at the business no doubt
But he simply could not abruptly break through the barrier he must squirm through gradually
Thats a swell outfit youve got on he began
Yes replied Susan with her usual candor
Miss Hinkle borrowed it out of the stock for me to wear
Gideon was confused
He knew how she had got the hat and dress but he expected her to make a pretense
He couldnt understand her not doing it
Such candorany kind of candorwasnt in the game of men and women as women had played it in his experience
The womenall sorts of womenlied and faked at their business just as men did in the business of buying and selling goods
And her voiceand her way of speakingthey made him feel more than ever out of his class
He must get something to drink as soon as it could be served that would put him at his ease
Yesa drinkthat would set him up again
And a drink for herthat would bring her down from this queer new kind of high horse
I guess she must be a top notcherthe real thing come down in the worldand not out of the near silks
But shell be all right after a drink
One drink of liquor makes the whole world kin
That last thought reminded him of his own cleverness and he attacked the situation afresh
But the conversation as they drove up the avenue was on the whole constrained and intermittentchiefly about the weather
Susan was observingand feelingand enjoying
Up bubbled her young spirits perpetually renewed by her healthy vital youth of body
She was seeing her beloved City of the Sun again
As they turned out of the avenue for Sherrys main entrance Susan realized that she was in Fortyfourth Street
The street where she and Spenser had livedhad lived only yesterday
Nonot yesterdayimpossible
Her eyes closed and she leaned back in the cab
Gideon was waiting to help her alight
He saw that something was wrong it stood out obviously in her ghastly face
He feared the carriage men round the entrance would catch on to the fact that he was escorting a girl so unused to swell surroundings that she was ready to faint with fright
Dont be foolish he said sharply
Susan revived herself descended and with head bent low and trembling body entered the restaurant
In the agitation of getting a table and settling at it Gideon forgot for the moment her sickly pallor
He began to order at once not consulting herfor he prided himself on his knowledge of cookery and assumed that she knew nothing about it
Have a cocktail
asked he
Yes of course you will
You need it bad and you need it quick
She said she preferred sherry
She had intended to drink nothing but she must have aid in conquering her faintness and overwhelming depression
Gideon took a dry martini ordered a second for himself when the first came and had them both down before she finished her sherry
Ive ordered champagne said he
I suppose you like sweet champagne
Most ladies do but I cant stand seeing it served even
NoI like it very dry said Susan
Gideon glinted his eyes gayly at her showed his white jaguar teeth
So youre acquainted with fizz are you
He was feeling his absurd notion of inequality in her favor dissipate as the fumes of the cocktails rose straight and strong from his empty stomach to his brain
Do you know Ive a sort of feeling that were going to like each other a lot
I think we make a handsome coupleehwhats your first name
Lorna
Lorna then
My names Ed but everybody calls me Gid
As soon as the melon was served he ordered the champagne opened
To our better acquaintance said he lifting his glass toward her
Thank you said she in a suffocated voice touching her glass to her lips
He was too polite to speak even in banter of what he thought was the real cause of her politeness and silence
But he must end this state of overwhelmedness at grand surroundings
Said he Youre kind o shy arent you Lorna
Or is that your game
I dont know
Youve had a very interesting life havent you
Wont you tell me about it
Ohjust ordinary replied he with a proper show of modesty
And straightway as Susan had hoped he launched into a minute account of himselfthe familiar story of the energetic aggressive man twisting and kicking his way up from two or three dollars a week
Susan seemed interested but her mind refused to occupy itself with a narrative so commonplace
After Rod and his friends this boastful business man was dull and tedious
Whenever he laughed at an account of his superior crafthow he had bluffed this man how he had euchered that oneshe smiled
And so in one more case the common masculine delusion that women listen to them on the subject of themselves with interest and admiration as profound as their own was not impaired
But he wound up Ive stayed plain Ed Gideon
I never have let prosperity swell my head
And anyone that knows mell tell you Im a regular fool for generosity with those that come at me right



Ive always been a favorite with the ladies
As he was pausing for comment from her she said I can believe it
The word generosity kept echoing in her mind
Generositygenerosity
How much talk there was about it
Everyone was forever praising himself for his generosity was reciting acts of the most obvious selfishness in proof
Was there any such thing in the whole world as real generosity
They like a generous man pursued Gid
Im tight in businessI can see a dollar as far as the next man and chase it as hard and grab it as tight
But when it comes to the ladies why Im openhanded
If they treat me right I treat them right
Then fearing that he had tactlessly raised a doubt of his invincibility he hastily added But they always do treat me right
While he had been talking on and on Susan had been appealing to the champagne to help her quiet her aching heart
She resolutely set her thoughts to wandering among the couples at the other tables in that subdued softening lightthe beautifully dressed women listening to their male companions with close attentionwere they too being bored by such trash by way of talk
Were they too simply listening because it is the man who pays because it is the man who must be conciliated and put in a good humor with himself if dinners and dresses and jewels are to be bought
That tenement atticthat hot moist workroompovertyprivationhonest works dread rewards Now what kind of a man would you say I was
Gideon was inquiring
How do you mean
replied Susan with the dexterity at vagueness that habitually selfveiling people acquire as an instinct
Why as a man
How do I compare with the other men youve known
And he shot his cuffs with a gesture of careless elegance that his cuff links might assist in the picture of the swell dresser he felt he was posing
Ohyouyourevery different
I am different swelled Gideon
You see its this way And he was off again into another eulogy of himself it carried them through the dinner and two quarts of champagne
He was much annoyed that she did not take advantage of the pointed opportunity he gave her to note the total of the bill he was even uncertain whether she had noted that he gave the waiter a dollar
He rustled and snapped it before laying it upon the tray but her eyes looked vague
Well said he after a comfortable pull at an expensivelooking cigar sixteen seventyfive is quite a lively little peeloff for a dinner for only two
But it was worth it dont you think
It was a splendid dinner said Susan truthfully
Gideon beamed in intoxicated good humor
I knew youd like it
Nothing pleases me better than to take a nice girl who isnt as well off as I am out and blow her off to a crackerjack dinner
Now you may have thought a dollar was too much to tip the waiter
A dollar isa dollar isnt it
said Susan
Gideon laughed
I used to think so
And most men wouldnt give that much to a waiter
But I feel sorry for poor devils who dont happen to be as lucky or as brainy as I am
What do you say to a turn in the Park
Well take a hansom and kind of jog along
And well stop at the Casino and at Gabes for a drink
I have to get up so early  began Susan
Oh thats all right
He slowly winked at her
Youll not have to bump the bumps for being late tomorrowif you treat me right
He carried his liquor easily
Only in his eyes and in his ever more slippery smile that would slide about his face did he show that he had been drinking
He helped her into a hansom with a flourish and overruling her protests bade the driver go to the Casino
Once under way she was glad her hot skin and her weary heart were grateful for the air blowing down the avenue from the Parks expanse of green
When Gideon attempted to put his arm around her she moved close into the corner and went on talking so calmly about calm subjects that he did not insist
But when he had tossed down a drink of whiskey at the Casino and they resumed the drive along the moonlit shady roads he tried again
Please said she dont spoil a delightful evening
Now look here my dearhavent I treated you right
Indeed you have Mr
Gideon
Oh dont be so damned formal
Forget the difference between our positions
Tomorrow Im going to place a big order with your house if you treat me right
Im dead stuck on youand thats a Gods fact
Youve taken me clean off my feet
Im thinking of doing a lot for you
Susan was silent
What do you say to throwing up your job and coming to Chicago with me
How much do you get
Ten
Why you cant live on that
Ive lived on lessmuch less
Do you like it
Naturally not
You want to get ondont you
I must
Youre down in the heart about something
Love
Susan was silent
Cut love out
Cut it out my dear
That aint the way to get on
Loves a good consolation prize if you aint going to get anywhere and know you aint
And its a good first prize after youve arrived and can afford the luxuries of life
But for a manor a womanthats pushing up its sheer ruination
Cut it out
I am cutting it out said Susan
But that takes time
Not if youve got sense
The way to cut anything out iscut it outa quick slashjust cut
If you make a dozen little slashes each of them hurts as much as the one big slashand the dozen hurt twelve times as muchbleed twelve times as muchput off the cure a lot more than twelve times as long
He had Susans attention for the first time
Do you know why women dont get on
Tell me said she
Thats what I want to hear
Because they dont play the game under the rules
Now what does a man do
Why he stakes everything hes gotdoes whatevers necessary dont stop at nothing to help him get there
How is it with women
Some try to be virtuouswhen their bodies are their best assets
God
I wish Id a had your looks and your advantages as a woman to help me
Id be a millionaire this minute with a house facing this Park and a yacht and all the rest of it
A woman thats squeamish about her virtue cant hope to winunless shes in a position to make a good marriage
As for the loose ones they are as big fools as the virtuous ones
The virtuous ones lock away their best asset the loose ones throw it away
Neither one use it
Do you follow me
I think so
Susan was listening with a mind made abnormally acute by the champagne she had freely drunk
The coarse bluntness and directness of the man did not offend her
It made what he said the more effective producing a rude arresting effect upon her nerves
It made the man himself seem more of a person
Susan was beginning to have a kind of respect for him to change her first opinion that he was merely a vulgar pushing commonplace
Never thought of that before
YesIve thought of it
But She paused
Butwhat
Oh nothing
Never mind
Some womanish heart nonsense I suppose
Do you see the application of what Ive said to you and me
Go on
She was leaning forward her elbows on the closed doors of the hansom her eyes gazing dreamily into the moonlit dimness of the cool woods through which they were driving
You dont want to stick at ten per
No
Itll be less in a little while
Models dont last
The works too hard
I can see that
And anyhow it means tenement house
Yes
Tenement house
Wellwhat then
Whats your plan
I havent any
Havent a planyet want to get on
Is that good sense
Did ever anybody get anywhere without a plan
Im willing to work
Im going to work
I am working
Work of course
Nobody can keep alive without working
You might as well say youre going to breathe and eatWork dont amount to anything for getting on
Its the kind of workworking in a certain directionworking with a plan
Ive got a plan
But I cant begin at it just yet
Will it take money
Some
Have you got it
No replied Susan
Ill have to get it
As an honest working girl
said he with goodhumored irony
Susan laughed
It does sound ridiculous doesnt it
said she
Heres another thing that maybe you havent counted in
Looking as you do do you suppose men that run thingsll let you get past without paying toll
Not on your life my dear
If you was ugly you might after several years get twenty or twentyfive by working hardunless you lost your figure first
But the men wont let a good looker rise that way
Do you follow me
Yes
Im not talking theory
Im talking life
Take you and me for example
I can help youhelp you a lot
In fact I can put you on your feet
And Im willing
If you was a man and I liked you and wanted to help you Id make you help me too
Id make you do a lot of things for memaybe some of em not so very nicemaybe some of em downright dirty
And youd do em as all young fellows struggling up have to
But youre a woman
So Im willing to make easier terms
But I cant help you with you not showing any appreciation
That wouldnt be good businesswould itto get no return but Oh thank you so much Mr Gideon
So sweet of you
Ill remember you in my prayers
Would that be sensible
No said Susan
Well then
If I do you a good turn youve got to do me a good turnnot one that I dont want done but one I do want done
Aint I right
Do you follow me
I follow you
Some vague accent in Susans voice made him feel dissatisfied with her response
I hope you do he said sharply
What Im saying is dresses on your back and dollars in your pocketand getting on in the worldif you work it right
Getting on in the world said Susan pensively
I suppose thats a sneer
Oh no
I was only thinking
About love being all a woman needs to make her happy I suppose
No
Love isWell it isnt happiness
Because you let it run you instead of you running it
Eh
Perhaps
Sure
Now let me tell you Lorna dear
Comfort and luxury money in bank property a good solid positionthats the foundation
Build on that and youll build solid
Build on love and sentiment and youre building upside down
Youre putting the gingerbread where the rock ought to be
Follow me
I see what you mean
He tried to find her hand
What do you say
Ill think of it
Well think quick my dear
Opportunity doesnt wait round in anybodys outside office 


Maybe you dont trust medont think Ill deliver the goods
No
I think youre honest
Youre right I am
I do what I say Ill do
Thats why Ive got on
Thats why Ill keep on getting on
Lets drive to a hotel
She turned her head and looked at him for the first time since he began his discourse on making ones way in the world
Her look was calm inquiringwould have been chilling to a man of sensibilitythat is of sensibility toward an unconquered woman
I want to give your people that order and I want to help you
I want them to get the order
I dont care about the rest she replied dully
Put it any way you like
Again he tried to embrace her
She resisted firmly
Wait said she
Let me think
They drove the rest of the way to the upper end of the Park in silence
He ordered the driver to turn
He said to her Well do you get the sack or does the house get the order
She was silent
Shall I drive you home or shall we stop at Gabes for a drink
Could I have champagne
said she
Anything you like if you choose right
I havent any choice said she
He laughed put his arm around her kissed her unresponsive but unresisting lips
Youre right you havent said he
Its a fine sign that you have the sense to see it
Oh youll get on
You dont let trifles stand in your way
III AT the lunch hour the next day Mary Hinkle knocked at the garret in Clinton Place
Getting no answer she opened the door
At the table close to the window was Susan in a nightgown her hair in disorder as if she had begun to arrange it and had stopped halfway
Her eyes turned listlessly in Marys directiondull eyes gray heavily circled
You didnt answer Miss Sackville
So I thought Id come in and leave a note explained Mary
Her glance was avoiding Susans
Come for the dress and hat
said Susan
There they are
And she indicated the undisturbed bed whereon hat and dress were carelessly flung
My but its hot in this room
exclaimed Mary
You must move up to my place
Theres a room and bath vacantonly seven per
Susan seemed not to hear
She was looking dully at her hands upon the table before her
Mr Jeffries sent me to ask you how you were
He was worried because you didnt come
With a change of voice Mr Gideon telephoned down the order a while ago
Mr Jeffries says you are to keep the dress and hat
No said Susan
Take them away with you
Arent you coming down this afternoon
No replied Susan
Ive quit
Quit
cried Miss Hinkle
Her expression gradually shifted from astonishment to pleased understanding
Oh I see
Youve got something better
No
But Ill find something
Mary studied the situation using Susans expressionless face as a guide
After a time she seemed to get from it a clew
With the air of friendly experience bent on aiding helpless inexperience she pushed aside the dress and made room for herself on the bed
Dont be a fool Miss Sackville said she
If you dont like that sort of thingyou know what I meanwhy you can live six monthsmaybe a yearon the reputation of what youve done and their hope that youll weaken down and do it again
Thatll give you time to look round and find something else
For pitys sake dont turn yourself loose without a job
You got your place so easy that you think you can get one any old time
Theres where youre wrong
Believe me you played in luckand luck dont come round often
I know what Im talking about
So I say dont be a fool
I am a fool said Susan
Wellget over it
And dont waste any time about it either
I cant go back said Susan stolidly
I cant face them
Face who
cried Mary
Business is business
Everybody understands that
All the people down there are crazy about you now
You got the house a hundredthousanddollar order
You dont suppose anybody in business bothers about how an orders gotdo you
Its the way I feelnot the way they feel
As for the women down thereof course theres some that pretend they wont do that sort of thing
Look at emat their faces and figuresand youll see why they dont
Of course a girl keeps straight when theres nothing in not being straightleastways unless shes a fool
She knows that if the best she can do is marry a fellow of her own class why shed only get left if she played any tricks with them cheap skates that have to get married or go without because theyre too poor to pay for anythingand by marrying can get that and a cook and a washwoman and mender besidesand maybe too somebody who can go out and work if theyre laid up sick
But if a girl sees a chance to get ondont be a fool Miss Sackville
Susan listened with a smile that barely disturbed the stolid calm of her features
Im not going back she said
Mary Hinkle was silenced by the quiet finality of her voice
Studying that delicate face she felt behind its pallid impassiveness behind the refusal to return a reason she could not comprehend
She dimly realized that she would respect it if she could understand it for she suspected it had its origin somewhere in Susans refined ladylike nature
She knew that once in a while among the women she was acquainted with there did happen one who preferred death in any form of misery to leading a lax lifeand indisputable facts had convinced her that not always were these women just stupid ignorant fools
She herself possessed no such refinement of nerves or of whatever it was
She had been brought up in a loose family and in a loose neighborhood
She was in the habit of making all sorts of pretenses because that was the custom while being candid about such matters was regarded as bad form
She was not fooled by these pretenses in other girls though they often did fool each other
In Susan she instinctively felt it was not pretense
It was something or other elseit was a dangerous reality
She liked Susan in her intelligence and physical charm were the possibilities of getting far up in the world it seemed a pity that she was thus handicapped
Still perhaps Susan would stumble upon some worth while man who attempting to possess her without marriage and failing would pay the heavy price
There was always that chancea small chance smaller even than finding by loose living a worth while man who would marry you because you happened exactly to suit himto give him enough only to make him feel that he wanted more
Still Susan was unusually attractive and luck sometimes did come a poor persons waysometimes
Im overdue back said Mary
You want me to tell em that
Yes
Youll have hard work finding a job at anything like as much as ten per
Ive got two trades and I couldnt at either one
I dont expect to find it
Then what are you going to do
Take what I can getuntil Ive been made hard enoughor strong enoughor whatever it isto stop being a fool
This indication of latent good sense relieved Miss Hinkle
Ill tell em you may be down tomorrow
Think it over for another day
Susan shook her head
Theyll have to get somebody else
And as Miss Hinkle reached the threshold Wait till I do the dress up
Youll take it for me
Why send the things back
urged Mary
They belong to you
God knows you earned em
Susan standing now looked down at the finery
So I did
Ill keep them said she
Theyd pawn for something
With your looks theyd wear for a heap more
But keep em anyhow
And Ill not tell Jeffries youve quit
Itll do no harm to hold your job open a day or so
As you like said Susan to end the discussion
But I have quit
No matter
After youve had something to eat youll feel different
And Miss Hinkle nodded brightly and departed
Susan resumed her seat at the bare wobbly little table resumed her listless attitude
She did not move until Ellen came in holding out a note and saying A boy from your store brung thishere
Thank you said Susan taking the note
In it she found a twentydollar bill and a five
On the sheet of paper round it was scrawled Take the day off
Heres your commission
Well raise your pay in a few weeks L L J
So Mary Hinkle had told them either that she was quitting or that she was thinking of quitting and they wished her to stay had used the means they believed she could not resist
In a dreary way this amused her
As if she cared whether or not life was kept in this worthless body of hers in her tired heart in her disgusted mind
Then she dropped back into listlessness
When she was aroused again it was by Gideon completely filling the small doorway
Hello my dear
cried he cheerfully
Mind my smoking
Susan slowly turned her head toward him surveyed him with an expression but one removed from the blank look she would have had if there had been no one before her
Im feeling fine today pursued Gideon advancing a step and so bringing himself about halfway to the table
Had a couple of pickmeups and a fat breakfast
How are you
Im always well
Thought you seemed a little seedy
His shrewd sensual eyes were exploring the openings in her nightdress
Youll be mighty glad to get out of this hole
Gosh
Its hot
Dont see how you stand it
Im a law abiding citizen but I must say Id turn criminal before Id put up with this
In the underworld from which Gideon had sprungthe underworld where welters the overwhelming mass of the human racethere are three main types
There are the hopeless and spiritlessthe masswho welter passively on breeding and dying
There are the spirited who also possess both shrewdness and calculation they push upward by hook and by crook always mindful of the futility of the struggle of the petty criminal of the slums against the police and the law they arrive and found the aristocracies of the future
The third is the criminal class
It is also made up of the spiritedbut the spirited who having little shrewdness and no calculationthat is no ability to foresee and measure consequenceswage clumsy war upon society and pay the penalty of their fatuity in lives of wretchedness even more wretched than the common lot
Gideon belonged to the second classthe class that pushes upward without getting into jail he was a fair representative of this type neither its best nor its worst but about midway of its range between arrogant alldominating plutocrat and shystering merchant or lawyer or politician who barely escapes the criminal class
You dont ask me to sit down dearie he went on facetiously
But Im not so mad that I wont do it
He took the seat Miss Hinkle had cleared on the bed
His glance wandered disgustedly from object to object in the crowded yet bare attic
He caught a whiff of the odor from across the hallfrom the freshair shaftand hastily gave several puffs at his cigar to saturate his surroundings with its perfume
Susan acted as if she were alone in the room
She had not even drawn together her nightgown
I phoned your store about you resumed Gideon
They said you hadnt showed upwouldnt till tomorrow
So I came round here and your landlady sent me up
I want to take you for a drive this afternoon
We can dine up to Claremont or farther if you like
No thanks said Susan
I cant go
Uptytupty
cried Gideon
Whats the lady so sour about
Im not sour
Then why wont you go
I cant
But well have a chance to talk over what Im going to do for you
Youve kept your word said Susan
That was only part
Besides Id have given your house the order anyhow
Susans eyes suddenly lighted up
You would
she cried
Wella part of it
Not so much of course
But I never let pleasure interfere with business
Nobody that does ever gets very far
Her expression made him hasten to explainwithout being conscious why
I saidpart of the order my dear
They owe to you about half of what theyll make off me



Whats that money on the table
Your commission
Yes
Twentyfive
Um
Gideon laughed
Well I suppose its as generous as Id be in the same circumstances
Encourage your employees but dont swellhead emthats the good rule
Ive seen many a promising young chap ruined by a raise of pay



Now about you and me
Gideon took a roll of bills from his trousers pocket counted off five twenties tossed them on the table
There
One of the bills in falling touched Susans hand
She jerked the hand away as if the bill had been afire
She took all five of them folded them held them out to him
The house has paid me said she
Thats honest said he nodding approvingly
I like it
But in your case it dont apply
These two thus facing a practical situation revealed an important overlooked truth about human morals
Humanity divides broadly into three classes the arrived those who will never arrive and will never try those in a state of flux attempting and either failing or succeeding
The arrived and the inert together preach and to a certain extent practice an idealistic system of morality that interferes with them in no way
It does not interfere with the arrived because they have no need to infringe it except for amusement it does not interfere with the inert but rather helps them to bear their lot by giving them a cheering notion that their insignificance is due to their goodness
This idealistic system receives the homage of lip service from the third and struggling section of mankind but no more for in practice it would hamper them at every turn in their efforts to fight their way up
Susan was at that stage of her career a candidate for membership in the struggling class
Her heart was set firmly against the unwritten unspoken even unwhispered code of practical morality which dominates the struggling class
But life had at least taught her the folly of intolerance
So when Gideon talked in terms of that practical morality she listened without offense and she talked to him in terms of it because to talk the idealistic morality in which she had been bred and before which she bowed the knee in sincere belief would have been simply to excite his laughter at her innocence and his contempt for her folly
I feel that Ive been paid said she
I did it for the housebecause I owed it to them
Only for the house
said he with insinuating tenderness
He took and pressed the fingers extended with the money in them
Only for the house she repeated a hard note in her voice
And her fingers slipped away leaving the money in his hand
At least I suppose it must have been for the house she added reflectively talking to herself aloud
Why did I do it
I dont know
I dont know
They say one always has a reason for what one does
But I often cant find any reason for things I dothat for instance
I simply did it because it seemed to me not to matter much what I did with myself and they wanted the order so badly
Then she happened to become conscious of his presence and to see a look of uneasiness selfcomplacence as if he were thinking that he quite understood this puzzle
She disconcerted him with what vain men call a cruel snub
But whatever the reason it certainly couldnt have been you said she
Now look here Lorna protested Gideon the beginnings of anger in his tone
Thats not the way to talk if you want to get on
She eyed him with an expression which would have raised a suspicion that he was repulsive in a man less selfconfident less indifferent to what the human beings he used for pleasure or profit thought of him
To say nothing of what I can do for you theres the matter of future orders
I order twice a yearin big lots always
Ive quit down there
Oh
Somebody else has given you something goodeh
Thats why youre cocky
No
Then whyve you quit
I wish you could tell me
I dont understand
ButIve done it
Gideon puzzled with this a moment decided that it was beyond him and unimportant anyhow
He blew out a cloud of smoke stretched his legs and took up the main subject
I was about to say Ive got a place for you
Id like to take you to Chicago but theres a Mrs Gas dear sweet good a soul as ever livedjust what a man wants at home with the children and to make things respectable
I wouldnt grieve her for worlds
But I cant live without a little funand Mrs G is a bit slow for me



Still its no use talking about having you out there
She ought to be able to understand that an active man needs two women
One for the quiet side of his nature the other for the lively side
Sometimes I think shelike a lot of wiveswouldnt object if it wasnt that she was afraid the other lady would get me away altogether and shed be left stranded
Naturally said Susan
Not at all
cried he
Dont you get any such notion in that lovely little head of yours my dear
You women dont understand honora mans sense of honor
Naturally repeated Susan
He gave a glance of short disapproval
Her voice was not to his liking
Lets drop Mrs G out of this said he
As I was saying Ive arranged for you to take a place hereeasy worksomething to occupy youand Ill foot the bills over and above He stopped short or rather was stopped by the peculiar smile Susan had turned upon him
Before it he slowly reddened and his eyes reluctantly shifted
He had roused her from listlessness from indifference
The poisons in her blood were burned up by the fresh swiftly flowing currents set in motion by his words by the helpfulness of his expression of his presence
She became again the intensely healthy therefore intensely alive therefore energetic and undaunted Susan Lenox who when still a child had not hesitated to fly from home from everyone she knew into an unknown world
What are you smiling at me that way for
demanded he in a tone of extreme irritation
So you look on me as your mistress
And never in all her life had her eyes been so graythe gray of cruelest irony
Now whats the use discussing those things
You know the world
Youre a sensible woman
Susan made closer and more secure the large loose coil of her hair rose and leaned against the table
You dont understand
You couldnt
Im not one of those respectable women like your Mrs G who belong to men
And Im not one of the other kind who also throw in their souls with their bodies for good measure
Do you think you had me She laughed with maddening gentle mockery went on I dont hate you
I dont despise you even
You mean well
But the sight of you makes me sick
It makes me feel as I do when I think of a dirty tenement I used to have to live in and of the things that I used to have to let crawl over me
So I want to forget you as soon as I canand that will be soon after you get out of my sight
Her blazing eyes startled him
Her voice not lifted above its usual quiet tones enraged him
Youyou
he cried
You must be crazy to talk to me like that
She nodded
Yescrazy said she with the same quiet intensity
For I know what kind of a beast you area clean goodnatured beast but still a beast
And how could you understand
He had got upon his feet
He looked as if he were going to strike her
She made a slight gesture toward the door
He felt at a hopeless disadvantage with herwith this woman who did not raise her voice did not need to raise it to express the uttermost of any passion
His jagged teeth gleamed through his mustache his shrewd little eyes snapped like an angry rats
He fumbled about through the steam of his insane rage for adequate insultsin vain
He rushed from the room and bolted downstairs
Within an hour Susan was out looking for work
There could be no turning back now
Until she went with Gideon it had been as if her dead were still unburied and in the house
Now Never again could she even indulge in dreams of going to Rod
That part of her life was finished with all the finality of the closed grave
Griefyes
But the same sort of grief as when a loved one after a long and painful illness finds relief in death
Her love for Rod had been stricken of a mortal illness the night of their arrival in New York
After lingering for a year between life and death after a long death agony it had expired
The end camethese matters of the exact moment of inevitable events are unimportant but have a certain melancholy interestthe end came when she made choice where there was no choice in the cab with Gideon
For better or for worse she was free
She was ready to begin her career
IV AFTER a few days when she was viewing her situation in a calmer more normal mood with the practical feminine eye she regretted that she had refused Gideons money
She was proud of that within herself which had impelled and compelled her to refuse it but she wished she had it
Taking it she felt would have added nothing to her humiliation in her own sight and for what he thought of her one way or the other she cared not a pin
It is one of the familiar curiosities of human inconsistency which is at bottom so completely consistent that she did not regret having refused his far more valuable offer to aid her
She did not regret even during those few next days of disheartening search for work
We often read how purpose can be so powerful that it compels
No doubt if Susans purpose had been to get temporary reliefor perhaps had it been to get permanent relief by weaving a sex spellshe would in that desperate mood have been able to compel
Unfortunately she was not seeking to be a pauper or a parasite she was trying to find steady employment at living wagesthat is at wages above the market value for female and for most malelabor
And that sort of purpose cannot compel
Our civilization overflows with charitywhich is simply willingness to hand back to labor as generous gracious alms a small part of the loot from the just wages of labor
But of real helpjust wages for honest laborthere is little for real help would disarrange the system would abolish the upper classes
She had some faint hopes in the direction of millinery and dressmaking the things for which she felt she had distinct talent
She was soon disabused
There was nothing for her and could be nothing until after several years of doubtful apprenticeship in the trades to which any female person seeking employment to piece out an income instinctively turned first and offered herself at the employers own price
Day after day from the first moment of the industrial day until its end she huntedwearily yet unweariedlywith resolve living on after the death of hope
She answered advertisements despite the obviously sensible warnings of the working girls she talked with she even consulted and took lists from the religious and charitable organizations patronized by those whose enthusiasm about honest work had never been cooled by doing or trying to do any of it and managed by those who beginning as workers had made all haste to escape from it into positions where they could live by talking about it and lying about itsaying the things comfortable people subscribe to philanthropies to hear
There was work plenty of it
But not at decent wages and not leading to wages that could be earned without viciously wronging those under her in an executive position
But even in those cases the prospect of promotion was vague and remote with illness and failing strength and poor food worse clothing and lodgings as certainties straightway
At some places she was refused with the first glance at her
No goodlooking girls wanted even though they behaved themselves and attracted customers the customers lost sight of matters of merchandise in the allabsorbing matter of sex
In offices a goodlooking girl upset discipline caused the place to degenerate into a deerhaunt in the mating season
No place did she find offering more than four dollars a week except where the dress requirements made the nominally higher wages even less
Everywhere womens wages were based upon the assumption that women either lived at home or made the principal part of their incomes by prostitution disguised or frank
In fact all wages even the wages of men except in a few tradeswere too small for an independent support
There had to be a familyand the whole family had to workand even then the joint income was not enough for decency
She had no family or friends to help herat least no friends except those as poor as herself and she could not commit the crime of adding to their miseries
She had less than ten dollars left
She must get to work at onceand what she earned must supply her with all
A note came from Jeffriesa curt request that she callcurt to disguise the eagerness to have her back
She tore it up
She did not even debate the matter
It was one of her significant qualities that she never had the inclination apparently lacked the power to turn back once she had turned away
Mary Hinkle came urged her
Susan listened in silence merely shook her head for answer changed the subject
In the entrance to the lofts of a tall Broadway building she saw a placard Experienced hands at fancy readytowear hat trimming wanted
She climbed three steep flights and was in a large lowceilinged room where perhaps seventyfive girls were at work
She paused in the doorway long enough to observe the kind of worka purely mechanical process of stitching a few trimmings in exactly the same way upon a cheap hat frame
Then she went to an open window in a glass partition and asked employment of a young Jew with an incredibly long nose thrusting from the midst of a pimply face which seemed merely its too small base
Experienced
asked the young man
I can do what those girls are doing
With intelligent eyes he glanced at her face then let his glance rove contemptuously over the room full of workers
I should hope so said he
Forty cents a dozen
Want to try it
When may I go to work
Right away
Write your name here
Susan signed her name to what she saw at a glance was some sort of contract
She knew it contained nothing to her advantage much to her disadvantage
But she did not care
She had to have worksomething anything that would stop the waste of her slender capital
And within fifteen minutes she was seated in the midst of the sweating almost nauseatingly odorous women of all ages was toiling away at the simple task of making an ugly hat frame still more ugly by the addition of a bit of tawdry cotton ribbon a buckle and a bunch of absurdly artificial flowers
She was soon able to calculate roughly what she could make in six days
She thought she could do two dozen of the hats a day and twelve dozen hats at forty cents the dozen would mean four dollars and eighty cents a week
Four dollars and eighty cents
Less than she had planned to set aside for food alone out of her ten dollars as a model
Next her on the right sat a middleaged woman grossly fat repulsively shapeless piteously homelyone of those luckless human beings who are foredoomed from the outset never to know any of the great joys of life the joys that come through our power to attract our fellowbeings
As this woman stitched away squinting through the steelframed spectacles set upon her snub nose Susan saw that she had not even good health to mitigate her lot for her color was pasty and on her dirty skin lay blotches of dull red
Except a very young girl here and there all the women had poor or bad skins
And Susan was not made disdainful by the odor which is far worse than that of any lower animal however dirty because the human animal must wear clothing
She had lived in wretchedness in a tenement she knew that this odor was an inevitable part of tenement life when one has neither the time nor the means to be clean
Poor food foul air broken sleepbad health disease unsightly faces repulsive bodies
No wonder the common people looked almost like another race in contrast with their brothers and sisters of the comfortable classes
Another race
The race into which she would soon be reborn under the black magic of poverty
As she glanced and reflected on what she saw viewed it in the light of her experience her fingers slackened and she could speed them up only in spurts
If I stay here thought she in a few weeks I shall be like these others
No matter how hard I may fight Ill be dragged down
As impossible to escape the common lot as for a swimmer alone in midocean to keep up indefinitely whether long or brief the struggle could have but the one endto be sunk in merged in the ocean
It took no great amount of vanity for her to realize that she was in every way the superior of all those around herin every way except one
What did she lack
Why was it that with her superior intelligence her superior skill both of mind and of body she could be thus dragged down and held far below her natural level
Why could she not lift herself up among the sort of people with whom she belongedor even make a beginning toward lifting herself up
Why could she not take hold
What did she lack
What must she acquireor what get rid of
At lunch time she walked with the ugly woman up and down the first side street above the building in which the factory was located
She ate a roll she bought from a pushcart man the woman munched an apple with her few remnants of teeth
Most of the girls is always kicking said the woman
But Im mighty satisfied
I get enough to eat and to wear and Ive got a bed to sleep inand what else is there in life for anybody rich or poor
Theres something to be said for that replied Susan marveling to find in this piteous creature the only case of thorough content she had ever seen
I make my four to five per continued the woman
And Ive got only myself
Thank God I was never fool enough to marry
Its marrying that drags us poor people down and makes us miserable
Some says to me Aint you lonesome
And I says to them says I Why Im used to being alone
I dont want anything else
If they was all like me theyd not be fightin and drinkin and makin bad worse
The bosses always likes to give me work
They say Im a model worker and Im proud to say theyre right
Im mighty grateful to the bosses that provide for the like of us
Whatd we do without em
Thats what Id like to know
She had pitied this woman because she could never hope to experience any of the great joys of life
What a waste of pity she now thought
She had overlooked the joy of joysdelusions
This woman was secure for life against unhappiness
A few days and Susan was herself regarded as a model worker
She turned out hats so rapidly that the forewoman urged on by Mr Himberg the proprietor began to nag at the other girls
And presently a notice of general reduction to thirtyfive cents a dozen was posted
There had been a union it had won a strike two years beforeand then had been broken up by shrewd employing of detectives who had got themselves elected officers
With the union out of the way there was no check upon the bosses in their natural and lawful effort to get that profit which is the most high god of our civilization
A few of the youngest and most spirited girlsthose from families containing several workersindignantly quit
A few others murmured but stayed on
The mass dumbly accepted the extra twist in the screw of the mighty press that was slowly squeezing them to death
Neither to them nor to Susan herself did it happen to occur that she was the cause of the general increase of hardship and misery
However to have blamed her would have been as foolish and as unjust as to blame any other individual
The system ordained it all
Oppression and oppressed were both equally its helpless instruments
No wonder all the vast beneficent discoveries of science that ought to have made the whole human race healthy longlived and prosperous are barely able to save the race from swift decay and destruction under the ravages of this modern system of labor worse than slaveryfor under slavery the slave being property whose loss could not be made good without expense was protected in life and in health
Susan soon discovered that she had miscalculated her earning power
She had been deceived by her swiftness in the first days before the monotony of her task had begun to wear her down
Her first weeks earnings were only four dollars and thirty cents
This in her freshness and in the busiest season when wages were at the highest point
In the room next hersthe same perhaps a little dingierlived a man
Like herself he had no tradethat is none protected by a powerful union and by the still more powerfulin fact the only powerful shieldrequirements of health and strength and a certain grade of intelligence that together act rigidly to exclude most men and so to keep wages from dropping to the neighborhood of the line of pauperism
He was the most industrious and in his small way the most resourceful of men
He was insurance agent toilet soap agent piano tuner giver of piano lessons seller of pianos and of music on commission
He worked fourteen and sixteen hours a day
He made nominally about twelve to fifteen a week
Actuallybecause of the poverty of his customers and his too sympathetic nature he made five to six a weekthe most any working person could hope for unless in one of the few favored trades
Barely enough to keep body and soul together
And why should capital that needs so much for fine houses and wines and servants and automobiles and culture and charity and the other luxurieswhy should capital pay more when so many were competing for the privilege of being allowed to work
She gave up her room at Mrs Tuckersafter she had spent several evenings walking the streets and observing and thinking about the miseries of the fast women of the only class she could hope to enter
A woman she decided cant even earn a decent living that way unless she has the money to make the right sort of a start
To him that hath shall be given from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath
Gideon was my chance and I threw it away
Still she did not regret
Of all the horrors the most repellent seemed to her to be dependence upon some one man who could take it away at his whim
She disregarded the advice of the other girls and made the rounds of the religious and charitable homes for working girls
She believed she could endure perhaps better than could girls with more false pride with more awe of snobbish conventionalitiesat least she could try to endurethe superciliousness the patronizing airs the petty restraints and oppressions the nauseating smugness the constant prying and peeping the hypocritical lectures the heavy doses of smug morality
She felt that she could bear with almost any annoyances and humiliations to be in clean surroundings and to get food that was at least not so rotten that the eye could see it and the nose smell it
But she found all the homes full with long waiting lists filled for the most part so the working girls said with professional objects of charity
Thus she had no opportunity to judge for herself whether there was any truth in the prejudice of the girls against these few and feeble attempts to mitigate the miseries of a vast and ever vaster multitude of girls
Adding together all the accommodations offered by all the homes of every description there was a total that might possibly have provided for the homeless girls of a dozen factories or sweatshopsand the number of homeless girls was more than a quarter of a million was increasing at the rate of more than a hundred a day
Charity is so trifling a force that it can and should be disregarded
It serves no good useful service
It enables comfortable people to delude themselves that all that can be done is being done to mitigate the misfortunes which the poor bring upon themselves
It obscures the truth that modern civilization has been perverted into a huge manufacturing of decrepitude and disease of poverty and prostitution
The reason we talk so much and listen so eagerly when our magnificent benevolences are the subject is that we do not wish to be disturbedand that we dearly love the tickling sensation in our vanity of generosity
Susan was compelled to the common lotthe lot that will be the common lot as long as there are people to be made by taking advantage of human necessities to force men and women and children to degrade themselves into machines as wageslaves
At two dollars a week double what her income justifiedshe rented a room in a tenement flat in Bleecker street
It was a closet of a room whose thin dirtadorned walls were no protection against sound or vermin not giving even privacy from prying eyes
She might have done a little better had she been willing to share room and bed with one or more girls but not enough better to compensate for what that would have meant
The young Jew with the nose so impossible that it elevated his countenance from commonplace ugliness to weird distinction had taken a friendly fancy to her
He was Julius Bam nephew of the proprietor
In her third week he offered her the forewomans place
Youve got a few brains in your head said he
Miss Tuohys a boob
Take the job and youll push up
Well start you at five per
Susan thanked him but declined
Whats the use of my taking a job I couldnt keep more than a day or two
explained she
I havent it in me to boss people
Then youve got to get it or youre done for said he
Nobody ever gets anywhere until hes making others work for him
It was the advice she had got from Matson the paper box manufacturer in Cincinnati
It was the lesson she found in all prosperity on every hand
Make others work for youand the harder you made them work the more prosperous you wereprovided of course you kept all or nearly all the profits of their harder toil
Obvious common sense
But how could she goad these unfortunates force their clumsy fingers to move faster make their long and weary day longer and wearierwith nothing for them as the result but duller brain clumsier fingers more wretched bodies
She realized why those above lost all patience with them treated them with contempt
Only as one of them could any intelligent energetic human being have any sympathy for them stupid and incompetent from birth made ever more and more stupid and incapable by the degrading lives they led
She could scarcely conceal her repulsion for their dirty bodies their stained and rotting clothing saturated with stale sweat their coarse flesh reeking coarse food smells
She could not listen to their conversation so vulgar so inane
Yet she felt herselffor the timeone of them and her heart bled for them
And while she knew that only their dullness of wit and ignorance kept them from climbing up and stamping and trampling full as savagely and cruelly as did those on top still the fact remained that they were not stamping and trampling
As she was turning in some work Miss Tuohy said abruptly You dont belong here
You ought to go back
Susan started and her heart beat wildly
She was going to lose her job
The forelady saw and instantly understood
I dont mean that she said
You can stay as long as you likeas long as your health lasts
But isnt there somebody somewhereanybodyyou can go to and ask them to help you out of this
Notheres no one said she
That cant be true insisted the forelady
Everybody has somebodyor can get somebodythat is anyone who looks like you
I wouldnt suggest such a thing to a fool
But you could keep your head
There isnt any other way and you might as well make up your mind to it
To confide is one of the all but universal longingsperhaps needsof human nature
Susans honest sympathetic eyes her look and her habit of reticence were always attracting confidences from such unexpected sources as hard forbidding Miss Tuohy
Susan was not much surprised when Miss Tuohy went on to say I was spoiled when I was still a kidby getting to know well a man who was above my class
I had tastes that way and he appealed to them
After him I couldnt marry the sort of man that wanted me
Then my looks wentlike a flashit often happens that way with us Irish girls
But I can get on
I know how to deal with these peopleand you never could learn
Youd treat em like ladies and theyd treat you as easy fruit
Yes I get along all right and Im happyaway from here
Susans sympathetic glance of inquiry gave the necessary encouragement
Its a baby Miss Tuohy explainedand Susan knew it was for the babys sake that this good heart had hardened itself to the dirty work of forelady
Her eyes shifted as she said A child of my sistersdead in Ireland
How I do love that baby They were interrupted and it so happened that the confidence was never resumed and finished
But Miss Tuohy had made her point with Susanhad set her to thinking less indefinitely
I must take hold
Susan kept saying to herself
The phrase was always echoing in her brain
But howhow And to that question she could find no answer
Every morning she bought a onecent paper whose big circulation was in large part due to its want adsits daily section of closely printed columns of advertisements of help wanted and situations wanted
Susan read the columns diligently
At first they acted upon her like an intoxicant filling her not merely with hope but with confident belief that soon she would be in a situation where the pay was good and the work agreeable or at least not disagreeable
But after a few weeks she ceased from reading
Why
Because she answered the advertisements scores of them more than a hundred before she saw through the trick and gave up
She found that throughout New York all the attractive or even tolerable places were filled by girls helped by their families or in other ways girls working at less than living wages because they did not have to rely upon their wages for their support
And those help wanted advertisements were simply appeals for more girls of that sortfor cheaper girls or they were inserted by employment agencies masquerading in the newspaper as employers and lying in wait to swindle working girls by getting a fee in exchange for a false promise of good work at high wages or they were the nets flung out by crafty employers who speeded and starved their slaves and wished to recruit fresh relays to replace those that had quit in exhaustion or in despair
Why do you always read the want ads
she said to Lany Ricardo who spent all her spare time at those advertisements in two papers she bought and one she borrowed every day
Did you ever get anything good or hear of anybody that did
Oh my no replied Lany with a laugh
I read for the same reason that all the rest do
Its a kind of dope
You read and then you dream about the placeshow grand they are and how well off youll be
But nobodyd be fool enough to answer one of em unless she was out of a job and had to get another and didnt care how rotten it was
No its just dopelike buyin policy numbers or lottery tickets
You know you wont git a prize but you have a lot of fun dreaming about it
As Susan walked up and down at the lunch hour she talked with workers both men and women in all sorts of employment
Some were doing a little better than she othersthe mostwere worse off chiefly because her education her developed intelligence enabled her to ward off savage blowssuch as illness from rotten foodagainst which their ignorance made them defenseless
Whenever she heard a story of someones getting on how grotesquely different it was from the stories she used to get out of the Sunday school library and dream over
These almost actualities of getting on had nothing in them about honesty and virtue
According to them it was always some sort of meanness or trickery and the particular meanness or tricks were in these practical schools of success in session at each lunch hour related in detail as lessons in how to get on
If the success under discussion was a womans it was always how her boss or employer had got stuck on her and had given her an easier job with good pay so that she could wear clothes more agreeable to his eyes and to his touch
Now and then it was a wonderful dazzling successsome girl had got her rich employer so dead crazy about her that he had taken her away from work altogether and had set her up in a flat with a servant and a swell trap there was even talk of marriage
Was it true
Were the Sunday school books through and through liesridiculous misleading lies wicked lieswicked because they hid the shameful truth that ought to be proclaimed from the housetops
Susan was not sure
Perhaps envy twisted somewhat these tales of rare occasional successes told by the workers to each other
But certain it was that wherever she had the opportunity to see for herself success came only by hardness of heart by tricks and cheats
Certain it was also that the general belief among the workers was that success could be got in those ways onlyand this belief made the falsehood if it was a falsehood or the partial truth if it was a twisted truth full as poisonous as if it had been true throughout
Also if the thing were not true how came it that everyone in practical life believed it to be sohow came it that everyone who talked in praise of honesty and virtue looked as he talked as if he were canting and half expected to be laughed at
All about her as badly off as she or worse off
Yet none so unhappy as shenot even the worse off
In fact the worse off as the better off were not so deeply wretched
Because they had never in all their lives known the decencies of life clean lodgings clean clothing food fit to eat leisure and the means of enjoying leisure
And Susan had known all these things
When she realized why her companions in misery so feeble in selfrestraint were able to endure patiently and for the most part even cheerfully how careful she was never to say or to suggest anything that might put ideas of what life might be of what it was for the comfortable few into the minds of these girls who never had known and could only be made wretched by knowing
How fortunate for them she thought that they had gone to schools where they met only their own kind
How fortunate that the devouring monster of industry had snatched them away from school before their minds had been awakened to the realities of life
How fortunate that their imaginations were too dull and too heavy to be touched by the sights of luxury they saw in the streets or by what they read in the newspapers and in the cheap novels
To them as she soon realized their world seemed the only world and the world that lived in comfort seemed a vague unreality as must seem whatever does not come into our own experience
One lunch hour an apostle of discontent preaching some kind of politics or other held forth on the corner above the shop
Susan paused to listen
She had heard only a few words when she was incensed to the depths of her heart against him
He ought to be stopped by the police this scoundrel trying to make these people unhappy by awakening them to the misery and degradation of their lot
He looked like an honest earnest man
No doubt he fancied that he was in some way doing good
These people who were always trying to do the poor goodthey ought all to be suppressed
If someone could tell them how to cease to be poor that would indeed be good
But such a thing would be impossible
In Sutherland where the best off hadnt so painfully much more than the worst off and where everybody but the idle and the drunken and even they most of the time had enough to eat and a decent place to sleep and some kind of Sunday clothesin Sutherland the poverty was less than in Cincinnati infinitely less than in this vast and incredibly rich New York where in certain districts wealth enormous wealth was piled up and up
So evidently the presence of riches did not help poverty but seemed to increase it
No the disease was miserable thought Susan
For most of the human race disease and bad food and vile beds in dingy holes and days of fierce poorly paid toilthat was the law of this hell of a world
And to escape from that hideous tyranny you must be hard you must trample you must rob you must cease to be human
The apostle of discontent insisted that the law could be changed that the tyranny could be abolished
She listened but he did not convince her
He sounded vague and dreamyas fantastically false in his new way as she had found the Sunday school books to be
She passed on
She continued to pay out a cent each day for the newspaper
She no longer bothered with the want ads
Pipe dreaming did not attract her she was too fiercely bent upon escape actual escape to waste time in dreaming of ways of escape that she never could realize
She read the paper because if she could not live in the world but was battered down in its dark and foul and crowded cellar she at least wished to know what was going on up in the light and air
She found every day news of great doings of wonderful rises of rich rewards for industry and thrift of abounding prosperity and of opportunity fairly forcing itself into acceptance
But all this applied only to the few so strangely and so luckily chosen while the mass was rejected
For that mass from earliest childhood until death there was only toil in squalorsqualid food squalid clothing squalid shelter
And when she read one dayin an obscure paragraph in her newspaperthat the income of the average American family was less than twelve dollars a weekless than two dollars and a half a week for each individualshe realized that what she was seeing and living was not New York and Cincinnati but was the common lot country wide no doubt world wide
Must take hold
her mind cried incessantly to her shrinking heart
Somehowanyhowtake holdmustmustmust Those tenement houses
Those tenement streets
Everywhere wandering through the crowds the lonely old womenholding up to the girls the mirror of time and saying Look at my misery
Look at my diseaseblasted body
Look at my toilbent form and toilwrecked hands
Look at my masses of wrinkles at my rags at my leaky and rotten shoes
Think of my alonenessnot a friendfeared and cast off by my relatives because they are afraid they will have to give me food and lodgings
Look at methink of my lifeand know that I am you as you will be a few years from now whether you work as a slave to the machine or as a slave to the passions of one or of many men
I am you
Not one in a hundred thousand escape my fate except by death
SomehowanyhowI must take hold cried Susan to her swooning heart
When her capital had dwindled to three dollars Mrs Tucker appeared
Her face was so beaming bright that Susan despite her being clad in garments on which a pawnshop would advance nothing fancied she had come with good news
Now that Im rid of that there house said she Ill begin to perk up
I aint got nothing left to worry me
Im ready for whatever blessings the dear Masterll provide
My pastor tells me Im the finest example of Christian fortitude he ever Saw
Butand Mrs Tucker spoke with genuine modestyI tell him I dont deserve no credit for leaning on the Lord
If I can trust Him in death why not in life
Youve got a place
The church has Bless you no cried Mrs Tucker
Would I burden em with myself when theres so many that has to be looked after
No I go direct to the Lord
What are you going to do
What place have you got
None as yet
But Hell provide somethingsomething bettern I deserve
Susan had to turn away to hide her pityand her disappointment
Not only was she not to be helped but also she must help another
You might get a job at the hat factory said she
Mrs Tucker was delighted
I knew it
she cried
Dont you see how He looks after me
Susan persuaded Miss Tuohy to take Mrs Tucker on
She could truthfully recommend the old woman as a hard worker
They moved into a room in a tenement in South Fifth Avenue
Susan read in the paper about a model tenement and went to try for what was described as real luxury in comfort and cleanliness
She found that sort of tenements filled with middleclass families on their way down in the world and making their last stand against rising rents and rising prices
The model tenement rents were far far beyond her ability to pay
She might as well think of moving to the Waldorf
She and Mrs Tucker had to be content with a dark room on the fifth floor opening on a damp air shaft whose odor was so foul that in comparison the Clinton Place shaft was as the pure breath of the open sky
For this sheltermore than onehalf the free and proud citizens of prosperous America dwelling in cities occupy its like or worse they paid three dollars a weeka dollar and a half apiece
They washed their underclothing at night slept while it was drying
And Susan who could not bring herself to imitate the other girls and wear a blouse of dark color that was not to be washed rose at four to do the necessary ironing
They did their own cooking
It was no longer possible for Susan to buy quality and content herself with small quantity
However small the quantity of food she could get along on it must be of poor qualityfor good quality was beyond her means
It maddened her to see the better class of working girls
Their fairly good clothing their evidences of some comfort at home seemed to mock at her as a poor fool who was being beaten down because she had not wit enough to get on
She knew these girls were either supporting themselves in part by prostitution or were held up by their families by the pooling of the earnings of several persons
Left to themselves to their own earnings at work they would be no better off than she or at best so little better off that the difference was unimportant
If to live decently in New York took an income of fifteen dollars a week what did it matter whether one got five or ten or twelve
Any wages below fifteen meant a steady downward dragmeant exposure to the dirt and poison of poverty tenementsmeant the steady decline of the power of resistance the steady oozing away of selfrespect of the courage and hope that give the power to rise
To have less than the fifteen dollars absolutely necessary for decent surroundings decent clothing decent foodthat meant one was drowning
What matter whether the death of the soul was quick or slow whether the waters of destruction were twenty feet deep or twenty thousand
Mrs Reardon the servant woman on the top floor was evicted and Susan and Mrs Tucker took her in
She protested that she could sleep on the floor that she had done so a large part of her lifethat she preferred it to most beds
But Susan made her up a kind of bed in the corner
They would not let her pay anything
She had rheumatism horribly some kind of lung trouble and the almost universal and repulsive catarrh that preys upon working people
Her hair had dwindled to a meager wisp
This she wound into a hard little knot and fastened with an imitation tortoiseshell comb huge high and broken set with large pieces of glass cut like diamonds
Her teeth were all gone and her cheeks almost met in her mouth
One day when Mrs Tucker and Mrs Reardon were exchanging eulogies upon the goodness of God to them Susan shocked them by harshly ordering them to be silent
If God hears you she said Hell think youre mocking Him
Anyhow I cant stand any more of it
Hereafter do your talking of that kind when Im not here
Another day Mrs Reardon told about her sister
The sister had worked in a factory where some sort of poison that had a rotting effect on the human body was used in the manufacture
Like a series of others the sister caught the disease
But instead of rotting out a spot a few fingers or part of the face it had eaten away the whole of her lower jaw so that she had to prepare her food for swallowing by first pressing it with her fingers against her upper teeth
Used as Susan was to hearing horrors in this region where disease and accident preyed upon every family she fled from the room and walked shuddering about the streetsthe streets with their incessant march past of blighted and blasted of maimed and crippled and wormeaten
Until that day Susan had been about as unobservant of the obvious things as is the rest of the race
On that day she for the first time noticed the crowd in the street with mind alert to signs of the ravages of accident and disease
Hardly a sound body hardly one that was not piteously and hideously marked
When she returnedand she did not stay out longMrs Tucker was alone
Said she Mrs Reardon says the rotten jaw was sent on her sister as a punishment for marrying a Protestant she being a Catholic
How ignorant some people is
Of course the good Lord sent the judgment on her for being a Catholic at all
Mrs Tucker said Susan did you ever hear of Nero
He burned up Romeand he burned up the Christian martyrs said Mrs Tucker
I had a good schooling
Besides sermons is highly educating
Well said Susan if I had a choice of living under Nero or of living under that God you and Mrs Reardon talk about Id take Nero and be thankful and happy
Mrs Tucker would have fled if she could have afforded it
As it was all she ventured was a sigh and lips moving in prayer
On a Friday in late October at the lunch hour Susan was walking up and down the sunny side of Broadway
It was the first distinctly cool day of the autumn there had been a heavy downpour of rain all morning but the New York sun that is ever struggling to shine and is successful on all but an occasional day was tearing up and scattering the clouds with the aid of a sharp north wind blowing down the deep canyon
She was wearing her summer dress stillold and dingy but clean
That look of neatness about the feetthat charm of a wellshaped foot and a wellturned ankle properly set offhad disappearedwith her the surest sign of the extreme of desperate poverty
Her shoes were much scuffed were even slightly down at the heel her sailor hat would have looked only the worse had it had a fresh ribbon on its crown
This first hint of winter had stung her fast numbing faculties into unusual activity
She was remembering the misery of the cold in Cincinnatithe misery that had driven her into prostitution as a drunken drivers lash makes the frenzied horse rush he cares not where in his desire to escape
This wind of Broadwaythis first warning of winterit was hissing in her ears Take hold
Winter is coming
Take hold
Summer and winterfiery heat and brutal cold
Like the devils in the poem the poorthe masses all but a few of the human racewere hurried from fire to ice to vary their torment and to make it always exquisite
To shelter herself for a moment she paused at a spot that happened to be protected to the south by a projecting sidewalk sign
She was facing with only a tantalizing sheet of glass between a display of winter underclothes on wax figures
To show them off more effectively the sides and the back of the window were mirrors
Susans gaze traveled past the figures to a person she saw standing at full length before her
Who is that pale stooped girl
she thought
How dreary and sad she looks
How hard she is fighting to make her clothes look decent when they arent
She must be something like meonly much worse off
And then she realized that she was gazing at her own image was pitying her own self
The room she and Mrs Tucker and the old scrubwoman occupied was so dark even with its one little gas jet lighted that she was able to get only a faint look at herself in the little cracked and watermarked mirror over its filthy washstandfilthy because the dirt was so ground in that only floods of water and bars of soap could have cleaned down to its original surface
She was having a clear look at herself for the first time in three months
She shrank in horror yet gazed on fascinated
Why her physical charm had gone gone leaving hardly a trace
Those dull hollow eyesthat thin and almost ghastly facethe emaciated formthe once attractive hair now looking poor and stringy because it could not be washed properlyabove all the sad bitter expression about the mouth
Those pale lips
Her lips had been from childhood one of her conspicuous and most tempting beauties and as the sex side of her nature had developed they had bloomed into wonderful freshness and vividness of form and color
Now Those pale pale lips
They seemed to form a sort of climax of tragedy to the melancholy of her face
She gazed on and on
She noted every detail
How she had fallen
Indeed a fallen woman
These others had been born to the conditions that were destroying her they were no worse off in many cases better off
But she born to comfort and custom of intelligent educated associations and associates A fallen woman
Honest work
Even if it were true that this honest work was a sort of probation through which one rose to better thingseven if this were true could it be denied that only a few at best could rise that the mostincluding all the sensitive and most of the childrenmust wallow on must perish
Oh the lies the lies about honest work
Rosa Mohr a girl of her own age who worked in the same room joined her
Admiring yourself
she said laughing
Well I dont blame you
You are pretty
Susan at first thought Rosa was mocking her
But the tone and expression were sincere
It wont last long Rosa went on
I wasnt so bad myself when I quit the high school and took a job because father lost his business and his health
He got in the way of one of those trusts
So of course they handed it to him good and hard
But he wasnt a squealer
He always said theyd done only what hed been doing himself if hed had the chance
I always think of what papa used to say when I hear people carrying on about how wicked this or that somebody else is
Are you going to stay onat this life
asked Susan still looking at her own image
I guess so
What else is there



Ive got a steady
Well get married as soon as he has a raise to twelve per
But Ill not be any better off
My beaus too stupid ever to make much
If you see me ten years from now Ill probably be a fat sloppy old thing warming a window sill or slouching about in dirty rags
Isnt there any way toto escape
It does look as though there ought to bedoesnt it
But Ive thought and thought and I cant see itand Im pretty near straight Jew
They say things are better than they used to be and I guess they are
But not enough better to help me any
Perhaps my childrenif Im fool enough to have anyperhaps theyll get a chance



But I wouldnt gamble on it
Susan was still looking at her ragsat her pale lipswas avoiding meeting her own eyes
Why not try the streets
Nothing in it said Rosa practically
I did try it for a while and quit
Lots of the girls do and only the fools stay at it
Once in a while theres a girl whos lucky and gets a lover thats kind to her or a husband that can make good
But thats luck
For one that wins out a thousand lose
Luck
said Susan
Rosa laughed
Youre right
Its something else besides luck
The trouble is a girl loses her headfalls in lovesupports a mantakes to drinkdont look out for her healthwastes her money
Stillwheres the girl with head enough to get on where theres so many temptations
But theres no chance at all keeping straight you say
The other things worse
The street girlsof our class I meandont average as much as we do
And its an awful business in winter
And they spend so much time in station houses and over on the Island
And gosh
how the men do treat them
You havent any idea
You wouldnt believe the horrible things the girls have to do to earn their moneya quarter or half a dollarand maybe the men dont pay them even that
A girl tries to get her money in advance but often she doesnt
And as they have to dress better than we do and live where they can clean up a little they most starve
Oh that lifes hell
Susan had turned away from her image was looking at Rosa
As for the fast houses Rosa shudderedI was in one for a week
I ran awayit was the only way I could escape
Id never tell any human being what I went through in that house



Never
She watched Susans fine sympathetic face and in a burst of confidence said One night the landlady sent me up with seventeen men
And she kept the seventeen dollars I made and took away from me half a dollar one drunken longshoreman gave me as a present
She said I owed it for board and clothes
In those houses high and low the girls always owes the madam
They havent a stitch of their own to their backs
The two girls stood facing each other each looking past the other into the windswept canyon of Broadwaythe majestic vista of lofty buildings symbols of wealth and luxury so abundant that it flaunted itself overflowed in gaudy extravagance
Finally Susan said Do you ever think of killing yourself
I thought I would replied the other girl
But I guess I wouldnt have
Everybody knows theres no hope yet they keep on hopin
And Ive got pretty good health yet and once in a while I have some fun
You ought to go to dancesand drink
You wouldnt be blue all the time then
If it wasnt for the sun said Susan
The sun
inquired Rosa
Where I came from explained Susan it rained a great deal and the sky was covered so much of the time
But here in New York there is so much sun
I love the sun
I get desperatethen out comes the sun and I say to myself Well I guess I can go on a while longer with the sun to help me
I hadnt thought of it said Rosa but the sun is a help
That indefatigable New York sun
It was like Susans own courage
It fought the clouds whenever clouds dared to appear and contest its right to shine upon the City of the Sun and hardly a day was so stormy that for a moment at least the sun did not burst through for a look at its beloved
For weeks Susan had eaten almost nothing
During her previous sojourn in the slumsthe slums of Cincinnati though they were not classed as slumsthe food had seemed revolting
But she was less discriminating then
The only food she could afford nowthe food that is the best obtainable for a majority of the inhabitants of any citywas simply impossible for her
She ate only when she could endure no longer
This starvation no doubt saved her from illness but at the same time it drained her strength
Her vitality had been going down a little each daylower and lower
The poverty which had infuriated her at first was now acting upon her like a soothing poison
The reason she had not risen to revolt was this slow and subtle poison that explains the inertia of the tenement poor from babyhood
To be spirited one must have health or a nervous system diseased in some of the ways that cause constant irritation
The disease called poverty is not an irritant but an anesthetic
If Susan had been born to that life her naturally vivacious temperament would have made her gay in unconscious wretchedness as it was she knew her own misery and suffered from it keenlyat times hideouslyyet was rapidly losing the power to revolt
Perhaps it was the windyes it must have been the wind with its threat of winterthat roused her sluggish blood that whipped thought into action
Anythinganything would be right if it promised escape
Rightwrong
Hypocritical words for comfortable people
That Friday night after her supper of halfcooked corn meal and tea she went instantly to work at washing out clothes
Mrs Tucker spent the evening gossiping with the janitress came in about midnight
As usual she was full to the brim with news of miseryof jobs lost abandoned wives of abused children of poisoning from rotten fresh food or from embalmed stuff in cans of sickness and yet more sickness of maiming accidents of deathnews that is the commonplace of tenement life
She loved to tell these tales with all the harrowing particulars and to find in each some evidence of the goodness of God to herself
Often Susan could let her run on and on without listening
But not that night
She resisted the impulse to bid her be silent left the room and stood at the hall window
When she returned Mrs Tucker was in bed was snoring in a tranquillity that was the reverse of contagious
With her habitual cheerfulness she had adapted herself to her changed condition without fretting
She had become as ragged and as dirty as her neighbors she so wrought upon Susans sensibilities blunted though they were that the girl would have been unable to sleep in the same bed if she had not always been tired to exhaustion when she lay down
But for that matter only exhaustion could have kept her asleep in that vermininfested hole
Even the fiercest swarms of the insects that flew or ran or crawled and bit even the filthy mice squeaking as they played upon the covers or ran over the faces of the sleepers did not often rouse her
While Mrs Tucker snored Susan worked on getting every piece of at all fit clothing in her meager wardrobe into the best possible condition
She did not once glance at the face of the noisy sleepera face homely enough in Mrs Tuckers waking hours hideous now with the mouth open and a few scattered rotten teeth exposed and the dark yellowblue of the unhealthy gums and tongue
At dawn Mrs Tucker awoke with a snort and a start
She rubbed her eyes with her dirty and twisted and wrinkled fingersthe nails were worn and broken turned up as if warped at the edges blackened with dirt and bruisings
Why are you up already
she said to Susan
Ive not been to bed replied the girl
The woman stretched herself sat up thrust her thick stockinged legs over the side of the bed
She slept in all her clothing but her skirt waist and shoes
She kneeled down upon the bare sprung and slanting floor said a prayer arose with a beaming face
Its nice and warm in the room
How I do dread the winter the cold weatherthough no doubt well make out all right
Everything always does turn out well for me
The Lord takes care of me
I must make me a cup of tea
Ive made it said Susan
The tea was frightful stuffnot tea at all but cheap adulterants colored poisonously
Everything they got was of the same quality yet the prices they paid for the tiny quantities they were able to buy at any one time were at a rate that would have bought the finest quality at the most expensive grocery in New York
Wonder why Mrs Reardon dont come
said Mrs Tucker
Mrs Reardon had as her only work a one night job at scrubbing
She ought to have come an hour ago
Her rheumatism was bad when she started said Susan
I guess she worked slow
When Mrs Tucker had finished her second cup she put on her shoes overskirt and waist made a few passes at her hair
She was ready to go to work
Susan looked at her murmured An honest Godfearing working woman
Huh
said Mrs Tucker
Nothing replied Susan who would not have permitted her to hear
It would be cruel to put such ideas before one doomed beyond hope
Susan was utterly tired but even the strong craving for a stimulant could not draw that tea past her lips
She ate a piece of dry bread washed her face neck and hands
It was time to start for the factory
That daySaturdaywas a halfholiday
Susan drew her weeks earningsfour dollars and ten centsand came home
Mrs Tucker who had drawnthanks to the Lordthree dollars and a quarter was with her
The janitress halted them as they passed and told them that Mrs Reardon was dead
She looked like another scrubwoman living down the street who was known always to carry a sum of money in her dress pocket the banks being untrustworthy
Mrs Reardon passing along in the dusk of the early morning had been hit on the head with a blackjack
The one blow had killed her
Violence tragedy of all kinds were too commonplace in that neighborhood to cause more than a slight ripple
An old scrubwoman would have had to die in some peculiarly awful way to receive the flattery of agitating an agitated street
Mrs Reardon had died what was really almost a natural death
So the faint disturbance of the terrors of life had long since disappeared
The body was at the Morgue of course
Well go up right away said Mrs Tucker
Ive something to do that cant be put off replied Susan
I dont like for anyone as young as you to be so hard reproached Mrs Tucker
Is it hard said Susan to see that death isnt nearly so terrible as life
Shes safe and at peace
Ive got to live
Mrs Tucker eager for an emotional and religious opportunity hastened away
Susan went at her wardrobe ironing darning fixing buttonholes hooks and eyes
She drew a bucket of water from the tap in the hall and proceeded to wash her hair with soap she rinsed it dried it as well as she could with their one small thin towel left it hanging free for the air to finish the job
It had rained all the night beforethe second heavy rain in two months
But at dawn the rain had ceased and the clouds had fled before the sun that rules almost undisputed nine months of the year and wars valiantly to rule the other three monthsnot altogether in vain
A few golden strays found their way into that cavelike room and had been helping her wonderfully
She bathed herself and scrubbed herself from head to foot
She manicured her nails got her hands and feet into fairly good condition
She put on her best underclothes her one remaining pair of undarned stockings the pair of ties she had been saving against an emergency
And once more she had the charm upon which she most prided herselfthe charm of an attractive look about the feet and ankles
She then took up the darkblue hat frameone of a lot of secondsshe had bought for thirtyfive cents at a bargain sale trimmed it with a broad darkblue ribbon for which she had paid sixty cents
She was well pleasedand justly sowith the result
The trimmed hat might well have cost ten or fifteen dollarsfor the largest part of the price of a womans hat is usually the taste of the arrangement of the trimming
By this time her hair was dry
She did it up with a care she had not had time to give it in many a week
She put on the darkblue serge skirt of the between seasons dress she had brought with her from Fortyfourth Street she had not worn it at all
With the feeble aid of the mirror that distorted her image into grotesqueness she put on her hat with the care that important detail of a womans toilet always deserves
She completed her toilet with her one good and unworn blouseplain white the yoke gracefully pointedand with a blue neck piece she had been saving
She made a bundle of all her clothing that was fit for anythingincluding the unworn batiste dress Jeffries and Jonas had given her
And into it she put the pistol she had brought away from Fortyfourth Street
She made a separate bundle of the Jeffries and Jonas hat with its valuable plumes
With the two bundles she descended and went to a pawnshop in Houston Street to which she had made several visits
A dirtylooking man with a short beard fluffy and thick like a yellow hens tail lurked behind the counter in the dark little shop
She put her bundles on the counter opened them
How much can I get for these things
she asked
The man examined every piece minutely
Theres really nothing here but the summer dress and the hat said he
And theyre out of style
I cant give you more than four dollars for the lotand one for the pistol which is good but old style now
Five dollars
Howll you have it
Susan folded the things and tied up the bundles
Sorry to have troubled you she said taking one in either hand
How much did you expect to get lady
asked the pawnbroker
Twentyfive dollars
He laughed turned toward the back of the shop
As she reached the door he called from his desk at which he seemed about to seat himself I might squeeze you out ten dollars
The plumes on the hat will sell for thirty dollars said Susan
You know as well as I do that ostrich feathers have gone up
The man slowly advanced
I hate to see a customer go away unsatisfied said he
Ill give you twenty dollars
Not a cent less than twentyfive
At the next place Ill ask thirtyand get it
I never can stand out against a lady
Give me the stuff
Susan put it on the counter again
Said she I dont blame you for trying to do me
Youre right to try to buy your way out of hell
The pawnbroker reflected could not understand this subtlety went behind his counter
He produced a key from his pocket unlocked a drawer underneath and took out a large tin box
With another key from another pocket he unlocked this threw back the lid revealing a disorder of papers
From the depths he fished a paper bag
This contained a roll of bills
He gave Susan a twenty and a five both covered with dirt so thickly that she could scarcely make out the denominations
Youll have to give me cleaner money than this said she
You are a fine lady grumbled he
But he found cleaner bills
She turned to her room
At sight of her Mrs Tucker burst out laughing with delight
My but you do look like old times
cried she
How neat and tasty you are
I suppose its no need to ask if youre going to church
No said Susan
Ive got nothing to give and I dont beg
Well I aint going there myself latelysomehow
They got so they werent very cordialor maybe it was me thinking that way because I wasnt dressed up like
Still I do wish you was more religious
But youll come to it for youre naturally a good girl
And when you do the Lordll give you a more contented heart
Not that you complain
I never knew anybody especially a young person that took things so quiet



It cant be youre going to a dance
No said Susan
Im going to leavego back uptown
Mrs Tucker plumped down upon the bed
Leave for good
she gasped
Ive got Nelly Lemayer to take my place here if you want her said Susan
Here is my share of the rent for next week and half a dollar for the extra gas Ive burned last night and today
And Mrs Reardon gone too
sobbed Mrs Tucker suddenly remembering the old scrubwoman whom both had forgotten
And up to that there Morgue they wouldnt let me see her except where the light was so poor that I couldnt rightly swear it was her
How brutal everybody is to the poor
If they didnt have the Lord what would become of them
And you leaving me all alone
The sobs rose into hysteria
Susan stood impassive
She had seen again and again how faint the breeze that would throw those shallow waters into commotion and how soon they were tranquil again
It was by observing Mrs Tucker that she first learned an important unrecognized truth about human nature that amiable easily sympathetic and habitually goodhumored people are invariably hard of heart
In this parting she had no sense of loss none of the melancholy that often oppresses us when we separate from someone to whom we are indifferent yet feel bound by the tie of misfortunes borne together
Mrs Tucker fallen into the habits of their surroundings was for her simply part of them
And she was glad she was leaving themforever she hoped
Christian fleeing the City of Destruction had no sterner mandate to flight than her instinct was suddenly urging upon her
When Mrs Tucker saw that her tears were not appreciated she decided that they were unnecessary
She dried her eyes and said Anyhow I reckon Mrs Reardons takingoff was a mercy
Shes better dead said Susan
She had abhorred the old woman even as she pitied and sheltered her
She had a way of fawning and cringing and flatteringno doubt in well meaning attempt to show gratitudebut it was unendurable to Susan
And now that she was dead and gone there was no call for further pretenses
You aint going right away
said Mrs Tucker
Yes said Susan
You ought to stay to supper
Supper
That revolting food
No I must go right away replied Susan
Well youll come to see me
And maybe youll be back with us
You might go farther and do worse
On my way from the morgue I dropped in to see a lady friend on the East Side
I guess the good Lord has abandoned the East Side there being nothing there but Catholics and Jews and no true religion
Its dreadful the way things is over therethe girls are taking to the streets in droves
My lady friend was telling me that some of the mothers is sending their little girls out streetwalking and somes even taking out them thats too young to be trusted to go alone
And no money in it at that
And food and clothing prices going up and up
Meat and vegetables two and three times what they was a few years ago
And rents
Mrs Tucker threw up her hands
I must be going said Susan
Goodby
She put out her hand but Mrs Tucker insisted on kissing her
She crossed Washington Square beautiful in the soft evening light and went up Fifth Avenue
She felt that she was breathing the air of a different world as she walked along the broad clean sidewalk with the handsome old houses on either side with carriages and automobiles speeding past with clean happyfaced well dressed human beings in sight everywhere
It was like coming out of the dank darkness of Dismal Swamp into smiling fields with a pure starspangled sky above
She was freefree
It might be for but a moment still it was freedom infinitely sweet because of past slavery and because of the fear of slavery closing in again
She had abandoned the old toilet articles
She had only the clothes she was wearing the thirtyone dollars divided between her stockings and the twodollar bill stuffed into the palm of her left glove
She had walked but a few hundred feet
She had advanced into a region no more prosperous to the eye than that she had been working in every day
Yet she had changed her worldbecause she had changed her point of view
The strata that form society lie in roughly parallel lines one above the other
The flow of all forms of the currents of life is horizontally along these strata never vertically from one stratum to another
These strata lying apparently in contact one upon another are in fact abysmally separated
There is notand in the nature of things never can be any genuine human sympathy between any two strata
We sympathize in our own stratum or class toward other strataother classesour attitude is necessarily a looking up or a looking down
Susan a bit of flotsam ascending descending ascending across the social layersbelonging nowhere having attachments not sympathies a real settled lot nowhereSusan was once more upward bound
At the corner of Fourteenth Street there was a shop with large mirrors in the show windows
She paused to examine herself
She found she had no reason to be disturbed about her appearance
Her dress and hat looked well her hair was satisfactory the sharp air had brought some life to the pallor of her cheeks and the release from the slums had restored some of the light to her eyes
Why did I stay there so long
she demanded of herself
Then How have I suddenly got the courage to leave
She had no answer to either question
Nor did she care for an answer
She was not even especially interested in what was about to happen to her
The moment she found herself above Twentythird Street and in the old familiar surroundings she felt an irresistible longing to hear about Rod Spenser
She was like one who has been on a far journey leaving behind him everything that has been life to him he dismisses it all because he must until he finds himself again in his own country in his old surroundings
She went into the Hoffman House and at the public telephone got the Herald office
Is Mr Drumley there
No was the reply
Hes gone to Europe
Did Mr Spenser go with him
Mr Spenser isnt herehasnt been for a long time
Hes abroad too
Who is this
Thank you said Susan hanging up the receiver
She drew a deep breath of relief
She left the hotel by the womens entrance in Broadway
It was six oclock
The sky was cleara typical New York sky with air that intoxicated blowing from itair of the seaair of the depths of heaven
A crescent moon glittered above the Diana on the Garden tower
It was Saturday night and Broadway was throngedwith men eager to spend in pleasure part of the weeks wages or salary they had just drawn with women sparklingeyed and odorous of perfumes and eager to help the men
The air was sharpwas the ocean air of New York at its delicious best
And the slim slightly stooped girl with the earnest violetgray eyes and the sad bitter mouth from whose lips the once brilliant color had now fled was ready for whatever might come
She paused at the corner and gazed up brilliantly lighted Broadway
Now
she said half aloud and like an expert swimmer adventuring the rapids she advanced into the swiftmoving crowd of the highway of New Yorks gayety
V AT the corner of Twentysixth Street a man put himself squarely across her path
She was attracted by the twinkle in his goodnatured eyes
He was a youngish man had the stoutness of indulgence in a fondness for eating and drinkingbut the stoutness was still well within the bounds of decency
His clothing bore out the suggestion of his selfassured way of stopping herthe suggestion of a confidencegiving prosperity
You look as if you needed a drink too said he
How about it lady with the lovely feet
For the first time in her life she was feeling on an equality with man
She gave him the same candidly measuring glance that man gives man
She saw goodnature audacity without impudenceat least not the common sort of impudence
She smiled merrily glad of the chance to show her delight that she was once more back in civilization after the long sojourn in the prison workshops where it is manufactured
She said A drink
Thank youyes
Thats a superior quality of smile youve got there said he
That and those nice slim feet of yours ought to win for you anywhere
Lets go to the Martin
Down University Place
The stout young man pointed his slender cane across the street
You must have been away
Yes said the girl
Ive beendead
Id like to try that myselfif I could be sure of coming to life in little old New York
And he looked round with laughing eyes as if the lights the crowds the champagnelike air intoxicated him
At the first break in the thunderous torrent of traffic they crossed Broadway and went in at the Twentysixth Street entrance
The restaurant to the left was empty
Its little tables were ready however for the throng of diners soon to come
Susan had difficulty in restraining herself
She was almost delirious with delight
She was agitated almost to tears by the freshness the sparkle in the glow of the redshaded candles in the colors and odors of the flowers decorating every table
While she had been down there all this had been up herewaiting for her
Why had she stayed down there
But then why had she gone
What folly what madness
To suffer such horrors for no reasonbeyond some vague clinging remnant of a superstitionor had it been just plain insanity
Yes Ive been crazyout of my head
The break withRodupset my mind
Her companion took her into the cafe to the right
He seated her on one of the leather benches not far from the door seated himself in a chair opposite there was a narrow marbletopped table between them
On Susans right sat a too conspicuously dressed but somehow important looking actress on her left a shopkeepers fat wife
Opposite each woman sat the sort of man one would expect to find with her
The face of the actresss man interested her
It was a long pale face the mouth weary in the eyes a strange hot fire of intense enthusiasm
He was youngand oldand neither
Evidently he had lived every minute of every year of his perhaps forty years
He was wearing a quiet suit of blue and his necktie was of a darker shade of the same color
His clothes were draped upon his good figure with a certain fascinating distinction
He was smoking an unusually long and thick cigarette
The slender strong white hand he raised and lowered was the hand of an artist
He might be a bad man a very bad manhis face had an expression of freedom of experience that made such an idea as conventionality in connection with him ridiculous
But however bad he might be Susan felt sure it would be an artistic kind of badness without vulgarity
He might have reached the stage at which morality ceases to be a conviction a matter of conscience and becomes a matter of preference of tastesand he surely had good taste in conduct no less than in dress and manner
The woman with him evidently wished to convince him that she loved him to convince those about her that they were lovers the man evidently knew exactly what she had in mindfor he was polite attentive indifferent andSusan suspectedsecretly amused
Susans escort leaned toward her and said in a low tone The two at the next tablethe womans Mary Rigsdall the actress and the mans Brent the fellow who writes plays
Then in a less cautious tone What are you drinking
What are you drinking
asked Susan still covertly watching Brent
You are going to dine with me
Ive no engagement
Then lets have Martinisand Ill go get a table and order dinner while the waiters bringing them
When Susan was alone she gazed round the crowded cafe at the scores of interesting facesthrillingly interesting to her after her long sojourn among countenances merely expressing crude elemental appetites if anything at all beyond toil anxiety privation and bad health
These were the faces of the triumphant classof those who had wealth or were getting it fame or were striving for it of those born to or acquiring position of some sort among the few thousands who lord it over the millions
These were the people among whom she belonged
Why was she having such a savage struggle to attain it
Then all in an instant the truth she had been so long groping for in vain flung itself at her
None of these women none of the women of the prosperous classes would be there but for the assistance and protection of the men
She marveled at her stupidity in not having seen the obvious thing clearly long ago
The successful women won their success by disposing of their persons to advantageby getting the favor of some man of ability
Therefore she a woman must adopt that same policy if she was to have a chance at the things worth while in life
She must make the best bargainor series of bargainsshe could
And as her necessities were pressing she must lose no time
She understood now the instinct that had forced her to fly from South Fifth Avenue that had overruled her hesitation and had compelled her to accept the goodnatured prosperous mans invitation



There was no other way open to her
She must not evade that fact she must accept it
Other ways there might befor other women
But not for her the outcast without friends or family the woman alone with no one to lean upon or to give her anything except in exchange for what she had to offer that was marketable
She must make the bargain she could not waste time in the folly of awaiting a bargain to her liking
Since she was living in the world and wished to continue to live there she must accept the worlds terms
To be sad or angry either one because the world did not offer her as attractive terms as it apparently offered many other womenthe happy and respected wives and mothers of the prosperous classes for instanceto rail against that was silly and stupid was unworthy of her intelligence
She would do as best she could and move along keeping her eyes open and perhaps some day a chance for much better terms might offerfor the bestfor such terms as that famous actress there had got
She looked at Mary Rigsdall
An expression in her interesting facethe latent rather than the surface expressionset Susan to wondering whether if she knew Rigsdalls whole storyor any womans whole storyshe might not see that the world was not bargaining so hardly with her after all
Or any mans whole story
There her eyes shifted to Rigsdalls companion the famous playwright of whom she had so often heard Rod and his friends talk
She was startled to find that his gaze was upon heran allseeing look that penetrated to the very core of her being
He either did not note or cared nothing about her color of embarrassment
He regarded her steadily until so she felt he had seen precisely what she was had become intimately acquainted with her
Then he looked away
It chagrined her that his eyes did not again turn in her direction she felt that he had catalogued her as not worth while
She listened to the conversation of the two
The woman did the talking and her subject was herselfher ability as an actress her conception of some part she either was about to play or was hoping to play
Susan too young to have acquired more than the rudiments of the difficult art of character study even had she had especial talent for itwhich she had notSusan decided that the famous Rigsdall was as shallow and vain as Rod had said all stage people were
The waiter brought the cocktails and her stout young companion came back beaming at the thought of the dinner he had painstakingly ordered
As he reached the table he jerked his head in selfapproval
Itll be a good one said he
Saturday night dinnerand aftermeans a lot to me
I work hard all week
Saturday nights I cut loose
Sundays I sleep and get ready to scramble again on Monday for the dollars
He seated himself leaned toward her with elevated glass
What name
inquired he
Susan
Thats a good oldfashioned name
Makes me see the hollyhocks and the hens scratching for worms
Mines Howland
Billy Howland
I came from Maryland 


and Im mighty glad I did
I wouldnt be from anywhere else for worlds and I wouldnt be there for worlds
Where do you hail from
The West said Susan
Well the men in your particular corner out yonder must be a pretty poor lot to have let you leave
I spotted you for mine the minute I saw youSusan
I hope youre not as quiet as your name
Another cocktail
Thanks
Like to drink
Im going to do more of it hereafter
Been laying low for a whileeh
Very low said Susan
Her eyes were sparkling now the cocktail had begun to stir her long languid blood
Live with your family
I havent any
Im free
On the stage
Im thinking of going on
And meanwhile
Meanwhilewhatever comes
Billy Howlands face was radiant
I had a date tonight and the lady threw me down
One of those drummers wives that take in washing to add to the family income while hubbys flirting round the country
This hubby came home unexpectedly
Im glad he did
He beamed with such wholesouled goodnature that Susan laughed
Thanks
Same to you said she
Hope youre going to do a lot of that laughing said he
Its the best Ive heardsuch a quiet gay sound
I sure do have the best luck
Until five years ago there was nothing doing for Billyhall bedroomWheeling stogiesone shirt and two pairs of cuffs a weeknot enough to buy a lady an icecream soda
All at oncebang
The hoodoo busted and everything that arrived was for William C Howland
Better get aboard
Here I am
Hold on tight
I pay no attention to the speed laws and round the corners on two wheels
Do you like good things to eat
I havent eaten for six months
You must have been out home
AhTheres the man to tell us dinners ready
They finished the second cocktail
Susan was pleased to note that Brent was again looking at her and she thoughtthough she suspected it might be the cocktailthat there was a question in his looka question about her which he had been unable to answer to his satisfaction
When she and Howland were at one of the small tables against the wall in the restaurant she said to him You know Mr
Brent
The play man
Lord no
Im a plain business dub
He wouldnt bother with me
You like that sort of man
I want to get on the stage if I can was Susans diplomatic reply
Welllets have dinner first
Ive ordered champagne but if you prefer something else Champagne is what I want
I hope its very dry
Howlands eyes gazed tenderly at her
I do like a woman who knows the difference between champagne and carbonated sirup
I think you and Ive got a lot of tastes in common
I like eatingso do you
I like drinkingso do you
I like a good timeso do you
Youre a little bit thin for my taste but youll fatten up
I wonder what makes your lips so pale
Id hate to remind myself by telling you said Susan
The restaurant was filling
Most of the men and women were in evening dress
Each arriving woman brought with her a new exhibition of extravagance in costume diffused a new variety of powerful perfume
The orchestra in the balcony was playing waltzes and the liveliest Hungarian music and the most sensuous strains from Italy and France and Spain
And before her was foodfood againnot horrible stuff unfit for beasts worse than was fed to beasts but human foodgood things well cooked and well served
To have seen her to have seen the expression of her eyes without knowing her history and without having lived as she had lived would have been to think her a glutton
Her spirits giddied toward the ecstatic
She began to talkcommenting on the people about herthe one subject she could venture with her companion
As she talked and drank he ate and drank stuffing and gorging himself but with a frankness of gluttony that delighted her
She found she could not eat much but she liked to see eating she who had so long been seeing only poverty bolting wretched food and drinking the vilest kinds of whiskey and beer of alleged coffee and teashe reveled in Howlands exhibition
She must learn to live altogether in her senses never to think except about an appetite
Where could she find a better teacher



They drank two quarts of champagne and with the coffee she took creme de menthe and he brandy
And as the sensuous temperament that springs from intense vitality reasserted itself the opportunity before her lost all its repellent features became the bright vivid countenance of lusty youth irradiating the joy of living
I hear theres a lively ball up at Terrace Garden said he
Want to go
Thatll be fine
cried she
She saw it would have taken nearly all the money she possessed to have paid that bill
About four weeks wages for one dinner
Thousands of families living for two weeks on what she and he had consumed in two hours
She reached for her half empty champagne glass emptied it
She must forget all those things
Ive played the fool once
Ive learned my lesson
Surely Ill never do it again
As she drank her eyes chanced upon the clock
Halfpast ten
Mrs Tucker had probably just fallen asleep
And Mrs Reardon was going out to scrubgoing out limping and groaning with rheumatism
No Mrs Reardon was lying up at the morgue dead her one chance to live lost forever
Dead
Yet better off than Mrs Tucker lying alive
Susan could see herthe seamed and broken and dirty old remnant of a facecould see the verminand the mice could hear the snoringthe angry grunt and turning over as the insects I want another drinkright away she cried
Sure
said Howland
I need one more too
They drove in a taxi to Terrace Garden he holding her in his arms and kissing her with an intoxicated mans enthusiasm
You certainly are sweet said he
The wine on your breath is like flowers
Gosh but Im glad that husband came home
Like me a little
Im so happy I feel like standing up and screaming declared she
Good idea cried he
Whereupon he released a war whoop and they both went off into a fit of hysterical laughter
When it subsided he said I sized you up as a live wire the minute I saw you
But youre even better than I thought
What are you in such a good humor about
You couldnt understand if I told you replied she
Youd have to go and live where Ive been livinglive there as long as I have
Convent
Worse
Worse than a jail
The ball proved as lively as they hoped
A select company from the Tenderloin was attending and the regulars were all of the gayest crowd among the sons and daughters of artisans and small merchants up and down the East Side
Not a few of the women were extremely pretty
All or almost all were young and those who on inspection proved to be older than eighteen or twenty were acting younger than the youngest
Everyone had been drinking freely and continued to drink
The orchestra played continuously
The air was giddy with laughter and song
Couples hugged and kissed in corners and finally openly on the dancing floor
For a while Susan and Howland danced together
But soon they made friends with the crowd and danced with whoever was nearest
Toward three in the morning it flashed upon her that she had not even seen him for many a dance
She looked roundsearched for himgot a blondbearded man in evening dress to assist her
The last seen of your stout friend this man finally reported he was driving away in a cab with a large lady from Broadway
He was asleep but I guess she wasnt
A sober thought winked into her whirling brainhe had warned her to hold on tight and she had lost her headand her opportunity
A bad starta foolishly bad start
But out winked the glimpse of sobriety and Susan laughed
Thats the last Ill ever see of him said she
This seemed to give BlondBeard no regrets
Said he Lets you and I have a little supper
Id call it breakfast only then we couldnt have champagne
And they had suppersix at the table all uproarious Susan with difficulty restrained from a skirt dance on the table up and down among the dishes and bottles
It was nearly five oclock when she and BlondBeard helped each other toward a cab
Whats your address
said he
The same as yours replied she drowsily
Late that afternoon she established herself in a room with a bath in West Twentyninth Street not far from Broadway
The exterior of the house was dingy and downattheheel
But the interior was new and scrupulously clean
Several other young women lived there alone also none quite so well installed as Susan who had the only private bath and was paying twelve dollars a week
The landlady frizzled and peroxide explainedwithout adding anything to what she already knewthat she could have privileges but cautioned her against noise
I cant stand for it said she
First offenseout you go
This house is for ladies and only gentlemen that know how to conduct themselves as a gentleman should with a lady are allowed to come here
Susan paid a week in advance reducing to thirtyone dollars her capital which BlondBeard had increased to fortythree
The young lady who lived at the other end of the hall smiled at her when both happened to glance from their open doors at the same time
Susan invited her to call and she immediately advanced along the hall in the blue silk kimono she was wearing over her nightgown
My names Ida Driscoll said she showing a double row of charming white teethher chief positive claim to beauty
She was short was plump about the shoulders but slender in the hips
Her reddish brown hair was neatly done over a big rat and was so spread that its thinness was hidden well enough to deceive masculine eyes
Nor would a man have observed that one of her white round shoulders was full two inches higher than the other
Her skin was good her features small and irregular her eyes shrewd but kindly
My namesSusan hesitatedLorna Sackville
I guess Lorna and Idall be enough for us to bother to remember laughed Miss Driscoll
The rests liable to change
Youve just come havent you
About an hour ago
Ive got only a toothbrush a comb a washrag and a cake of soap
I bought them on my way here
Baggage losteh
said Ida amused
No admitted Susan
Im beginning an entire new deal
Ill lend you a nightgown
Im too short for my other things to fit you
Oh I can get along
Whats good for a headache
Im nearly crazy with it
Wine
Yes
Wait a minute
Ida with bedroom slippers clattering hurried back to her room returned with a bottle of bromo seltzer and in the bathroom fixed Susan a dose
Youll feel all right in half an hour or so
Gee but youre swellwith your own bathroom
Susan shrugged her shoulders and laughed
Ida shook her head gravely
You ought to save your money
I do
Laterperhaps
Just nowI must have a fling
Ida seemed to understand
She went on to say I was in millinery
But in this town theres nothing in anything unless you have capital or a backer
I got tired of working for five per with ten or fifteen as the top notch
So I quit kissed my folks up in Harlem goodby and came down to look about
As soon as Ive saved enough Im going to start a business
Thatll be about a couple of yearsmaybe sooner if I find an angel
Im thinking of the stage
Cut it out
cried Ida
Its on the bum
Theres more money and less worry in straight sportingif you keep respectable
Of course theres nothing in out and out sporting
Oh I havent decided on anything
My head is better
Sure
If the dose I gave you dont knock it you can get one at the drug store two blocks up Sixth Avenue thatll do the trick
Got a dinner date
No
I havent anything on hand
I think you and I might work together said Ida
Youre thin and tallish
Im short and fattish
Wed catch em coming and going
That sounds good said Susan
Youre new toto the business
In a wayyes
I thought so
We all soon get a kind of a professional look
You havent got it
Still so many dead respectable women imitate nowadays and paint and use loud perfumes that sporting women arent nearly so noticeable
Seems to me the mens tastes even for what they want at home are getting louder and louder all the time
They hate anything that looks slow
And in our business its harder and harder to please themexcept the yaps from the little towns and the college boys
A woman has to be up to snuff if she gets on
If she looks what she is men wont have hernor if she is what she looks
Susan had not lived where every form of viciousness is openly discussed and practiced without having learned the things necessary to a full understanding of Idas technical phrases and references
The liveliness that had come with the departure of the headache vanished
To change the subject she invited Ida to dine with her
Whats the use of your spending money in a restaurant
objected Ida
You eat with me in my room
I always cook myself something when I aint asked out by some one of my gentleman friends
I can cook you a chop and warm up a can of French peas and some dandy tea biscuits I bought yesterday
Susan accepted the invitation promising that when she was established she would reciprocate
As it was about six they arranged to have the dinner at seven Susan to dress in the meantime
The headache had now gone even to that last heaviness which seems to be an ominous threat of a return
When she was alone she threw off her clothes filled the big bathtub with water as hot as she could stand it
Into this she gently lowered herself until she was able to relax and recline without discomfort
Then she stood up and with the soap and washrag gave herself the most thorough scrubbing of her life
Time after time she soaped and rubbed and scrubbed and dipped herself in the hot water
When she felt that she had restored her body to some where near her ideal of cleanness she let the water run out and refilled the tub with even hotter water
In this she lay luxuriously reveling in the magnificent sensations of warmth and utter cleanliness
Her eyes closed a delicious languor stole over her and through her soothing every nerve
She slept
She was awakened by Ida who had entered after knocking and calling at the outer door in vain
Susan slowly opened her eyes gazed at Ida with a soft dreamy smile
You dont know what this means
It seems to me I was never quite so comfortable or so happy in my life
Its a shame to disturb you said Ida
But dinners ready
Dont stop to dress first
Ill bring you a kimono
Susan turned on the cold water and the bath rapidly changed from warm to icy
When she had indulged in the sense of cold as delightful in its way as the sense of warmth she rubbed her glowing skin with a rough towel until she was rosered from head to foot
Then she put on stockings shoes and the pink kimono Ida had brought and ran along the hall to dinner
As she entered Idas room Ida exclaimed How sweet and pretty you do look
You sure ought to make a hit
I feel like a human being for the first time init seems yearsagesto me
Youve got a swell colorexcept your lips
Have they always been pale like that
No
I thought not
It dont seem to fit in with your style
You ought to touch em up
You look too serious and innocent anyhow
They make a rouge now thatll stick through everythingeating drinkinganything
Susan regarded herself critically in the glass
Ill see she said
The odor of the cooking chops thrilled Susan like music
She drew a chair up to the table sat in happygolucky fashion and attacked the chop the hot biscuit and the peas with an enthusiasm that inspired Ida to imitation
You know how to cook a chop she said to Ida
And anybody who can cook a chop right can cook
Cookings like playing the piano
If you can do the simple things perfectly youre ready to do anything
Wait till I have a flat of my own said Ida
Ill show you what eating means
And Ill have it too before very long
Maybe well live together
I was to a fortune tellers yesterday
Thats the only way I waste money
I go to fortune tellers nearly every day
But then all the girls do
You get your moneys worth in excitement and hope whether theres anything in it or not
Well the fortune teller she said I was to meet a dark slender person who was to change the whole course of my lifethat all my troubles would roll awayand that if any more came theyd roll away too
My but she did give me a swell fortune and only fifty cents
Ill take you to her
Ida made black coffee and the two girls profoundly contented drank it and talked with that buoyant cheerfulness which bubbles up in youth on the slightest pretext
In this case the pretext was anything but slight for both girls had health as well as youth had that freedom from harassing responsibility which is the chief charm of every form of unconventional life
And Susan was still in the first flush of the joy of escape from the noisome prison whose poisons had been corroding her soul and body
No poison is not a just comparison what poison in civilization parallels or even approaches in squalor in vileness of food and air in wretchedness of shelter and clothing the tenement life that is really the typical life of the city
From time to time Susan suffused with the happiness that is too deep for laughter too deep for tears even gazed round like a dreamer at those cheerful comfortable surroundings and drew a long breathstealthily as if she feared she would awaken and be again in South Fifth Avenue of rags and filth of hideous toil without hope
Youd better save your money to put in the millinery business with me Ida advised
I can show you how to make a lot
Sometimes I clear as high as a hundred a week and I dont often fall below seventyfive
So many girls go about this business in a no account way instead of being regular and businesslike
Susan strove to hide the feelings aroused by this practical statement of what lay before her
Those feelings filled her with misgiving
Was the lesson still unlearned
Obviously Ida was right there must be plan calculation a definite line laid out and held to or there could not but be failure and disaster
And yetSusans flesh quivered and shrank away
She struggled against it but she could not conquer it
Experience had apparently been in vain her character had remained unchanged



She must compel herself
She must do what she had to do she must not ruin everything by imitating the people of the tenements with their fatal habit of living from day to day only and taking no thought for the morrow except fatuously to hope and dream that all would be well
While she was fighting with herself Ida had been talking onthe same subject
When Susan heard again Ida was saying Now take me for instance
I dont smoke or drink
Theres nothing in either oneespecially drink
Of course sometimes a girls got to drink
A man watches her too close for her to dodge out
But usually you can make him think youre as full as he is when you really are cold sober
Do the men always drink when theycome withwithus
asked Susan
Most always
They come because they want to turn themselves loose
Thats why a girls got to be careful not to make a man feel nervous or shy
A respectable womans game is to be modest and innocent
With us the opposite
Theyre both games ones just as good as the other
I dont think I could get along at allat this confessed Susan with an effort unless I drank too muchso that I was reckless and didnt care what happened
Ida looked directly into her eyes Susans glance fell and a flush mounted
After a pause Ida went on A girl does feel that way at first
A girl that marries as most of them dobecause the old ones are pushing her out of the nest and shes got no place else to goshe feels the same way till she hardens to it
Of course youve got to get broke into any business
Go on said Susan eagerly
You are so sensible
You must teach me
Common sense is a thing you dont often hearespecially about getting on in the world
But as I was sayingone of my gentlemen friends is a lawyersuch a nice fellowso liberal
Gives me a present of twenty or twentyfive extra you understandevery time he makes a killing downtown
He asked me once how I felt when I started in and when I told him he said Thats exactly the way I felt the first time I won a case for a client I knew was a dirty rascal and in the wrong
But nowI take that sort of thing as easy as you do
He says the thing is to get on no matter how and that one ways as good as another
And hes mighty right
You soon learn that in little old New York where youve got to have the mon
or you get the laugh and the footthe swift hard kick
Clean up after youve arrived he saysand dont try to keep clean while youre workingand dont stop for baths and things while youre at the job
Susan was listening with every faculty she possessed
He says he talks the other sort of thingthe dopethe fake stuffjust as the rest of the hustlers do
He says its necessary in order to keep the people fooledthat if they got wise to the real way to succeed then thered be nobody to rob and get rich off of
Oh hes got it right
Hes a smart one
The sad bitter expression was strong in Susans face
After a pause Ida went on If a girls an ignorant fool or squeamish she dont get up in this business any more than in any other
But if she keeps a cool head and dont take lovers unless they pay their way and dont drink why she can keep her selfrespect and not have to take to the streets
Susan lifted her head eagerly
Dont have to take to the streets
she echoed
Certainly not declared Ida
I very seldom let a man pick me up after darkunless he looks mighty good
I go out in the daytime
I pretend Im an actress out of a job for the time being or a forelady in a big shop whos taking a day or so off or a respectable girl living with her parents
I put a lot of money into clothesquiet ladylike clothes
Mighty good investment
If you aint got clothes in New York you cant do any kind of business
I go where a nice class of men hangs out and I never act bold but just flirt timidly as so many respectable girls or semirespectables do
But when a girl plays that game she has to be careful not to make a man think he aint expected to pay
The towns choked full of men on the lookout for what they call lovewhich means for something cheap or better still free
Men are just crazy about themselves
Nothing easier than to fool emand nothings harder than to make em think you aint stuck on em
I tell you a girl in our life has a chance to learn men
They turn themselves inside out to us
Susan silent her thoughts flowing like a mill race helped Ida with the dishes
Then they dressed and went together for a walk
It being Sunday evening the streets were quiet
They sauntered up Fifth Avenue as far as Fiftyninth Street and back
Idas calm and sensible demeanor gave Susan much needed courage every time a man spoke to them
None of these men happened to be up to Idas standard which was high
No use wasting time on snide people explained she
We dont want drinks and a gush of loose talk and I saw at a glance that was all those chappies were good for
They returned home at halfpast nine without adventure
Toward midnight one of Idas regulars called and Susan was free to go to bed
She slept hardly at all
Ever before her mind hovered a nameless shapeless horror
And when she slept she dreamed of her wedding night woke herself screaming Please Mr
Fergusonplease
Ida had three chief sources of revenue
The best was five menher regular gentleman friendswho called by appointment from time to time
These paid her ten dollars apiece and occasionally gave her presents of money or jewelrynothing that amounted to much
From them she averaged about thirtyfive dollars a week
Her second source was a Mrs Thurston who kept in West Fiftysixth Street near Ninth Avenue a furnishedroom house of the sort that is on the officialand also the revenuelists of the police and the antivice societies
This lady had a list of girls and married women upon whom she could call
Gentlemen using her house for rendezvous were sometimes disappointed by the ladies with whom they were intriguing
Again a gentleman grew a little weary of his perhaps too respectable or too sincerely loving ladylove and appealed to Mrs Thurston
She kept her list of availables most select and passed them off as women of good position willing to supplement a small income or to punish stingy husbands or fathers and at the same time get the money they needed for dress and bridge for matinees and lunches
Mrs Thurston insistedand Ida was inclined to believethat there were genuine cases of this kind on the list
Its mighty hard for women with expensive tastes and small means to keep straight in New York said she to Susan
It costs so much to live and there are so many ways to spend money
And they always have rich lady friends who set an extravagant pace
Theyve got to dressand to kind of keep up their end
So Ida laughed went on Besides the city women are getting so they like a little sporty novelty as much as their brothers and husbands and fathers do
Oh Im not ashamed of my business any more
Were as good as the others and were not hypocrites
As my lawyer friend says everybodys got to make a good living and good livings cant be made on the ways that used to be called on the leveltheyre called damfool ways now
Idas third source of income was to her the most attractive because it had such a large gambling element in it
This was her flirtations as a respectable woman in search of lively amusement and having to take care not to be caught
There are women of all kinds who delight in deceiving men because it gives them a sweet stealthy sense of superiority to the condescending sex
In women of the Ida class this pleasure becomes as much a passion as it is in the respectable woman whom her husband tries to enslave
With Susan another woman and one in need of education Ida was simple and scrupulously truthful
But it would have been impossible for a man to get truth as to anything from her
She amused herself inventing plausible romantic stories about herself that she might enjoy the gullibility of the boastfully superior and patronizing male
She was devoid of sentiment even of passion
Yet at times she affected both in the most extreme fashion
And afterward with peals of laughter she would describe to Susan how the man had acted what an ass she had made of him
Men despise us she said
But its nothing to the way I despise them
The best of them are rotten beasts when they show themselves as they are
And they havent any mercy on us
Its too ridiculous
Men despise a man who is virtuous and a woman who isnt
What rot
She deceived the regulars without taking the trouble to remember her deceptions
They caught her lying so often that she knew they thought her untruthful through and through
But this only gave her an opportunity for additional pleasurethe pleasure of inventing lies that they would believe in spite of their distrust of her
Anyhow said she havent you noticed the liars everybodys on to are always believed and truthful people are doubted
Upon the men with whom she flirted she practiced the highly colored romances it would have been useless to try upon the regulars
Her greatest triumph at this game was a hard luck story she had told so effectively that the man had given her two hundred dollars
Most of her romances turned about her own ruin
As a matter of fact she had told Susan the exact truth when she said she had taken up her mode of life deliberately she had grown weary and impatient of the increasing poverty of a family which like so many of the artisan and small merchant and professional classes in this day of concentrating wealth and spreading tastes for comfort and luxury was on its way down from comfort toward or through the tenements
She was a type of the recruits that are swelling the prostitute class in ever larger numbers and are driving the prostitutes of the tenement class toward starvationwhere they once dominated the profession even to its highest ranks even to the fashionable cocotes who prey upon the second generation of the rich
But Ida never told her lovers her plain and commonplace tale of yielding to the irresistible pressure of economic forces
She had made men weep at her recital of her wrongs
It had even brought her offers of marriagenone however worth accepting
Id be a boob to marry a man with less than fifteen or twenty thousand a year wouldnt I
said she
Why two of the married men who come to see me regularly give me more than they give their wives for pin money
And in a few years Ill be having my own respectable business with ten thousand incomemaybe moreand as well thought of as the next woman
Idas dream was a house in the country a fine flat in town a husband in some refined profession and children at highclass schools
And Ill get there dont you doubt it
exclaimed she
Others haveof course you dont know about themtheyve looked out for that
Yes lots of others havebutwell just you watch your sister Ida
And Susan felt that she would indeed arrive
Already she had seen that there was no difficulty such as she had once imagined about recrossing the line to respectability
The only real problem in that matter was how to get together enough to make the crossing worth whilefor what was there in respectability without money in a day when respectability had ceased to mean anything but money
Ida wished to take her to Mrs Thurston and get her a favored place on the list
Susan thanked her but said Not yetnot quite yet
Ida suggested that they go out together as two young married women whose husbands had gone on the road
Susan put her off from day to day
Ida finally offered to introduce her to one of the regulars Hes a nice fellowknows how to treat a lady in a gentlemanly way
Not a bit coarse or familiar
Susan would not permit this generosity
And all this time her funds were sinking
She had paid a second weeks rent had bought cooking apparatus some food supplies some necessary clothing
She was down to a fivedollar bill and a little change
Look here Lorna said Ida between remonstrance and exasperation when are you going to start in
Susan looked fixedly at her said with a slow smile When I cant hold out another minute
Ida tossed her head angrily
Youve got brainsmore than I have she cried
Youve got every advantage for catching rich meneven a rich husband
Youre educated
You speak and act and look refined
Why you could pretend to be a howling fashionable swell
Youve got all the points
But what have you got em for
Not to use thats certain
You cant be as disgusted with me as I am
If youre going to do a thing why do it
Thats what I tell myself
ButI cant make a move
Ida gave a gesture of despair
I dont see whats to become of you
And you could do so well



Let me phone Mr Sterling
I told him about you
Hes anxious to meet you
Hes fond of bookslike you
Youd like him
Hed give up a lot to you because youre classier than I am
Susan threw her arms round Ida and kissed her
Dont bother about me she said
Ive got to act in my own foolish stupid way
Im like a child going to school
Ive got to learn a certain amount before Im ready to do whatever it is Im going to do
And until I learn it I cant do much of anything
I thought I had learned in the last few months
I see I havent
Do listen to sense Lorna pleaded Ida
If you wait till the last minute youll get left
The time to get the moneys when you have money
And Ive a feeling that youre not particularly flush
Ill do the best I can
And I cant move till Im ready
Meanwhile she continued to search for workwork that would enable her to live decently wages less degrading than the wages of shame
In a newspaper she read an advertisement of a theatrical agency
Advertisements of all kinds read well those of theatrical agencies readlike the fairy tales that they were
However she found in this particular offering of dazzling careers and salaries a peculiar phrasing that decided her to break the rule she had made after having investigated scores of this sort of offers
Rod was abroad anyhow enough time had elapsed
One of the most impressive features of the effect of New Yorkmeaning by New York only that small but significant portion of the four millions that thinksat least after a fashion and acts instead of being mere passive tools of whatever happens to turn upthe most familiar notable effect of this New York is the speedy distinction in the newcomer of those illusions and delusions about life and about human nature about good and evil that are for so many people the most precious and the only endurable and beautiful thing in the world
New York destroyer of delusions and cherished hypocrisies and pretenses therefore makes the broadly intelligent of its citizens hardy makes the others hardand between the hardy and hard between sense and cynicism yawns a gulf like that between Absalom and Dives
Susan a New Yorker now had got the habitin thought at leastof seeing things with somewhat less distortion from the actual
She no longer exaggerated the importance of the RodSusan episode
She saw that in New York where life is crowded with events everything in ones life except death becomes incident becomes episode where in regions offering less to think about each rare happening took on an aspect of vast importance
The RodSusan love adventure she now saw was not what it would have seemedtherefore would have beenin Sutherland but was mere episode of a New York life giving its light and shade to a certain small part of the long variedly patterned fabric of her life and of his not determining the whole
She saw that it was simply like a bend in the river giving a new turn to current and course but not changing the river itself and soon left far behind and succeeded by other bends giving each its equal or greater turn to the stream
Rod had passed from her life and she from his life
Thus she was free to begin her real careerthe stageif she could
She went to the suite of offices tenanted by Mr Josiah Ransome
She was ushered in to Ransome himself instead of halting with underlings
She owed this favor to advantages which her lack of vanity and of selfconsciousness prevented her from surmising
Ransomesmooth curly comfortable lookingreceived her with a delicate blending of the paternal and the gallant
After he had inspected her exterior with flattering attentiveness and had investigated her qualifications with a thoroughness that was convincing of sincerity he said Most satisfactory
I can make you an exceptional assurance
If you register with me I can guarantee you not less than twentyfive a week
Susan hesitated long and asked many questions before she finallywith reluctance paid the five dollars
She felt ashamed of her distrust but might perhaps have persisted in it had not Mr Ransome said I dont blame you for hesitating my dear young lady
And if I could Id put you on my list without payment
But you can see how unbusinesslike that would be
I am a substantial oldestablished concern
Youno doubt you are perfectly reliable
But I have been fooled so many times
I must not let myself forget that after all I know nothing about you
As soon as Susan had paid he gave her a list of vaudeville and musical comedy houses where girls were wanted
You cant fail to suit one of them said he
If not come back here and get your money
After two weary days of canvassing she went back to Ransome
He was just leaving
But he smiled genially opened his desk and seated himself
At your service said he
What luck
None replied Susan
I couldnt live on the wages they offered at the musical comedy places even if I could get placed
And the vaudeville people
When I said I could only sing and not dance they looked discouraged
When I said I had no costumes they turned me down
Excellent
cried Ransome
You mustnt be so easily beaten
You must take dancing lessonsperhaps a few singing lessons too
And you must get some costumes
But that means several hundred dollars
Three or four hundred said Ransome airily
A matter of a few weeks
But I havent anything like that said Susan
I havent so much as I comprehend perfectly interrupted Ransome
She interested him this unusual looking girl with her attractive mingling of youth and experience
Her charm that tempted people to give her at once the frankest confidences moved him to go out of his way to help her
You havent the money he went on
You must have it
SoI promised to place you and I will
I dont usually go so far in assisting my clients
Its not often necessaryand where its necessary its usually imprudent
HoweverIll give you the address of a flat where there is a ladya trustworthy square sort despite herher profession
She will put you in the way of getting on a sound financial basis
Ransome spoke in a matteroffact tone like a man stating a simple business proposition
Susan understood
She rose
Her expression was neither shock nor indignation but it was none the less a negative
Its the regular thing my dear urged Ransome
To make a start to get in right you cant afford to be squeamish
The way I suggest is the simplest and most direct of several that all involve the same thing
And the surest
You look steadyheadedselfreliant
You look sensible Susan smiled rather forlornly
But Im not said she
Not yet
Ransome regarded her with a sympathy which she felt was genuine
Im sorry my dear
Ive done the best I can for you
You may think it a very poor bestand it is
Buthe shrugged his shouldersI didnt make this world and its conditions for living
I may say also that Im not the responsible partythe party in charge
However To her amazement he held out a fivedollar bill
Heres your fee back
He laughed at her expression
Oh Im not a robber said he
I only wish I could serve you
I didnt think you were so his eyes twinkledso unreasonable let us say
Among those who dont know anything about life theres an impression that my sort of people are in the business of dragging women down
Perhaps one of us occasionally does as badabout a millionth part as badas the average employer of labor who skims his profits from the lifeblood of his employees
But as a rule we folks merely take those that are falling and help them to light easyor even to get up again
Susan felt ashamed to take her money
But he pressed it on her
Youll need it said he
I know how it is with a girl alone and trying to get a start
Perhaps later on youll be more in the mood where I can help you
Perhaps said Susan
But I hope not
Itll take uncommon luck to pull you throughand I hope youll have it
Thank you said Susan
He took her hand pressed it friendlilyand she felt that he was a man with real good in him more good than many who would have shrunk from him in horror
She was waiting for a thrust from fate
But fate disappointing as usual would not thrust
It seemed bent on the malicious pleasure of compelling her to degrade herself deliberately and with calculation like a woman marrying for support a man who refuses to permit her to decorate with any artificial floral concealments of fakedup sentiment the sordid truth as to what she is about
She searched within herself in vain for the scruple or sentiment or timidity or whatever it was that held her back from the course that was plainly inevitable
She had got down to the naked fundamentals of decency and indecency that are deep hidden by and for most of us under hypocrisies of conventionality
She had found out that a decent woman was one who respected her body and her soul that an indecent woman was one who did not and that marriage rites or the absence of them the absence of financial or equivalent consideration or its presence or its extent or its form were all irrelevant nonessentials
Yetshe hesitated knowing the while that she was risking a greater degradation and a stupid and fatal folly to boot by shrinking from the best course open to herunless it were better to take a dose of poison and end it all
She probably would have done that had she not been so utterly healthy therefore overflowing with passionate love of life
Except in fiction suicide and health do not go together however superhumanly sensitive the sore beset hero or heroine
Susan was sensitive enough whenever she did things incompatible with our false and hypocritical and unscientific notions of sensitiveness allowances should be made for her because of her superb and dauntless health
If her physical condition had been morbid her conduct might have been would have been very different
She was still hesitating when Saturday night came round againswiftly despite long disheartening days and wakeful awful nights
In the morning her rent would be due
She had a dollar and fortyfive cents
After dinner alone a pretense at dinnershe wandered the streets of the old Tenderloin until midnight
An icy rain was falling
Rains such as thisany rains except showerswere rare in the City of the Sun
That rain by itself was enough to make her downhearted
She walked with head down and umbrella close to her shoulders
No one spoke to her
She returned dripping she had all but ruined her one dress
She went to bed but not to sleep
About nineearly for that house she rose drank a cup of coffee and ate part of a roll
Her little stove and such other things as could not be taken along she rolled into a bundle marked it For Ida
On a scrap of paper she wrote this note Dont think Im ungrateful please
Im going without saying goodby because Im afraid if I saw you youd be generous enough to put up for me and Id be weak enough to accept
And if I did that Id never be able to get strong or even to hold my head up
Sogoodby
Ill learn sooner or laterlearn how to live
I hope it wont be too longand that the teacher wont be too hard on me
Yes Ill learn and Ill buy fine hats at your grand millinery store yet
Dont forget me altogether
She tucked this note into the bundle and laid it against the door behind which Ida and one of her regulars were sleeping peacefully
The odor of Idas powerful perfume came through the cracks in the door Susan drew it eagerly into her nostrils sobbed softly turned away It was one of the perfumes classed as immoral to Susan it was the aroma of a friendship as noble as disinterested as generous as human sympathy had ever breathed upon human woe
With her few personal possessions in a package she descended the stairs unnoticed went out into the rain
At the corner of Sixth Avenue she paused looked up and down the street
It was almost deserted
Now and then a streetwalker roused early by a lover with perhaps a family waiting for him hurried by looking piteous in the daylight which showed up false and dyed hair the layers of paint the sad tawdriness of battered finery from the cheapest bargain troughs
Susan went slowly up Sixth Avenue
Two blocks and she saw a girl enter the side door of a saloon across the way
She crossed the street pushed in at the same door went on to a small sittingroom with blinds drawn with round tables on every table a match stand
It was one of those places where streetwalkers rest their weary legs between strolls and sit for company on rainy or snowy nights and take shy men for sociabilitybreeding drinks and for the preliminary bargaining
The air of the room was strong with stale liquor and tobacco the lingering aroma of the nights vanished revels
In the far corner sat the girl she had followed a glass of raw whiskey and another of water stood on the table before her
Susan seated herself near the door and when the swollenfaced surly bartender came ordered whiskey
She poured herself a drinkfilled the glass to the brim
She drank it in two gulps set the empty glass down
She shivered like an animal as it is hit in the head with a poleax
The mechanism of life staggered hesitated went on with a sudden leaping acceleration of pace
Susan tapped her glass against the matchstand
The bartender came
Another said she
The man stared at her
Thehell
he ejaculated
You must be afraid o catchin cold
Or maybe youre looking for the menagerie
Susan laughed and so did the girl in the corner
Wont you have a drink with me
asked Susan
Thats very kind of you replied the girl in the manner of one eager to show that she too is a perfect lady in every respect used to the ways of the best society
She moved to a chair at Susans table
She and Susan inventoried each other
Susan saw a mere childhardly eighteenpossibly not seventeenbut much worn by drink and irregular livingevidently one of those who rush into the fast womans life with the idea that it is a career of gayetyand do not find out their error until looks and health are gone
Susan drank her second drink in three gulps several minutes apart
The girl was explaining in a thin common voice childish yet cracked that she had come there seeking a certain lady friend because she had an extra man and needed a side partner
Suppose you come with me she suggested
Its good money I think
Want to get next
When Ive had another drink said Susan
Her eyes were gorgeously brilliant
She had felt almost as reckless several times before but never had she felt this devilmaycare eagerness to see what the turn of the next card would bring
Youll take one
Sure
I feel like the devil
Been bumming round all night
My lady friend that I had with mea regular lady friendshe was suddenly took ill Appendicitis complicated with dt
s the ambulance guy said
The boys are waiting for me to come back sos we can go on
Theyve got some swell rooms in a hotel up in Fortysecond Street
Lets get a move on
The bartender served the third drink and Susan paid for them the other girl insisting on paying for the one she was having when Susan came
Susans head was whirling
Her spirits were spiraling up and up
Her pale lips were wreathed in a reckless smile
She felt courageous for adventureany adventure
Her capital had now sunk to three quarters and a fivecent piece
They issued forth talking without saying anything laughing without knowing or caring why
Life was a jokea coarse broad jokebut amusing if one drank enough to blunt any refinement of sensibility
And what was sensibility but a kind of snobbishness
And what more absurd than snobbishness in an outcast
Thats good whiskey they had back there said Susan
Good
Yesif you dont care what you say
If you dont want to care what you say or do explained Susan
Oh all booze is good for that said the girl
VI THEY went through to Broadway and there stood waiting for a car each under her own umbrella
Holy Gee
cried Susans new acquaintance
Aint this rain a soaker
It was coming in sheets bent and torn and driven horizontally by the wind
The umbrella sheltering the head somewhat gave a wholly false impression of protection
Both girls were soon sopping wet
But they were more than cheerful about it the whiskey made them indifferent to external ills as they warmed themselves by its bright fire
At that time a famous and much envied admired and respected captain of industry having looted the streetcar systems was preparing to loot them over again by the familiar trickery of the receivership and the reorganization
The masses of the people were too ignorant to know what was going on the classes were too busy each man of each of them about his own personal schemes for graft of one kind and another
Thus the streetcar service was a joke and a disgrace
However after four or five minutes a northbound car appeared
But it wont stop cried Susan
Its jammed
Thats why it will stop replied her new acquaintance
You dont suppose a New York conductord miss a chance to put his passengers more on the bum than ever
She was right at least as to the main point and the conductor with much free handling of their waists and shoulders added them to the dripping straining press of passengers enduring the discomforts the captain of industry put upon them with more patience than cattle would have exhibited in like circumstances
All the way up Broadway the new acquaintance enlivened herself and Susan and the men they were squeezed in among by her loud gay sallies which her young prettiness made seem witty
And certainly she did have an amazing and amusing acquaintance with the slang at the moment current
The worn look had vanished her rounded girlhood freshness had returned
As for Susan you would hardly have recognized her as the same person who had issued from the house in Twentyninth Street less than an hour before
Indeed it was not the same person
Drink nervifies every character here it transformed suppressing the characteristics that seemed perhaps were essential in her normal state and causing to bloom in sudden audacity of color and form the passions and gayeties at other times subdued by her intelligence and her sensitiveness
Her brilliant glance moved about the car full as boldly as her companions
But there was this difference Her companion gazed straight into the eyes of the men Susans glance shot past above or just below their eyes
As they left the car at Fortysecond Street the other girl gave her short skirt a dexterous upward flirt that exhibited her legs almost to the hips
Susan saw that they were well shaped legs surprisingly plump from the calves upward considering the slightness of her figure above the waist
I always do that when I leave a car said the girl
Sometimes it starts something on the trail
You forgot your packageback in the saloon
Then I didnt forget much laughed Susan
It appealed to her the idea of entering the new life emptyhanded
The hotel was one that must have been of the first class in its daynot a distant day for the expansion of New York in craving for showy luxury has been as sudden as the miraculous upward thrust of a steel skyscraper
It had now sunk to relying upon the trade of those who came in off Broadway for a few minutes
It was dingy and dirty the walls and plastering were peeling the servants were slovenly and fresh
The girl nodded to the evillooking man behind the desk who said Hello Miss Maud
Just in time
The boys were sending out for some others
Theyve got a nerve
laughed Maud
And she led Susan down a rather long corridor to a door with the letter B upon it
Maud explained This is the swellest suite in the house parlor bedroom bath
She flung open the door disclosing a sittingroom in disorder with two young men partly dressed seated at a small table on which were bottles siphons matches remains of sandwiches boxes of cigarettesa chaotic jumble of implements to dissipation giving forth a powerful stale odor
Maud burst into a stream of picturesque profanity which set the two men to laughing
Susan had paused on the threshold
The shock of this scene had for the moment arrested the triumphant march of the alcohol through blood and nerve and brain
Oh bite it off
cried the darker of the two men to Maud and have a drink
Aint you ashamed to speak so free before your innocent young lady friend
He grinned at Susan
What Sunday school do you hail from
inquired he
The other young man was also looking at Susan and it was an arresting and somewhat compelling gaze
She saw that he was tall and well set up
As he was dressed only in trousers and a pale blue silk undershirt the strength of his shoulders back and arms was in full evidence
His figure was like that of the wonderful young prizefighters she had admired at moving picture shows to which Drumley had taken her
He had a singularly handsome face blond yet remotely suggesting Italian
He smiled at Susan and she thought she had never seen teeth more beautifulpearlwhite regular even
His eyes were large and sensuous smiling though they were Susan was ill at easefor in them there shone the same untamed uncontrolled ferocity that one sees in the eyes of a wild beast
His youth his good looks his charm made the sinister savagery hinted in the smile the more disconcerting
He poured whiskey from a bottle into each of the two tall glasses filled them up with seltzer extended one toward Susan
Shut the door Queenie he said to her in a pleasant tone that subtly mingled mockery and admiration
And lets drink to love
Didnt I do well for you Freddie
cried Maud
Shes my longsought affinity declared Freddie with the same attractive mingling of jest and flattery
Susan closed the door accepted the glass laughed into his eyes
The whiskey was once more asserting its power
She took about half the drink before she set the glass down
The young man said Your names Queenie mines Freddie
He came to her holding her gaze fast by the piercing look from his handsome eyes
He put his arms round her and kissed her full upon the pale laughing lips
His eyes were still smiling in pleasant mockery yet his kiss burned and stung and the grip of his arm round her shoulders made her vaguely afraid
Her smile died away
The grave searching wondering expression reappeared in the violetgray eyes for a moment
Youre all right said he
Except those pale lips
Youre going to be my girl
That means if you ever try to get away from me unless I let you goIll kill youor worse
And he laughed as if he had made the best joke in the world
But she saw in his eyes a sparkle that seemed to her to have something of the malignance of the angry serpents
She hastily finished her drink
Maud was jerking off her clothes crying I want to get out of these nasty wet rags
The steam heat was full on the sittingroom the whole suite was intensely warm
Maud hung her skirt over the back of a chair close to the radiator took off her shoes and stockings and put them to dry also
In her chemise she curled herself on a chair lit a cigarette and poured a drink
Her feet were not bad but neither were they notably good she tucked them out of sight
She looked at Susan
Get off those wet things urged she or youll take your death
In a minute said Susan but not convincingly
Freddie forced another drink and a cigarette upon her
As a girl at home in Sutherland she had several timesshe and Ruthsmoked cigarettes in secrecy to try the new London and New York fashion announced in the newspapers and the novels
So the cigarette did not make her uncomfortable
Look at the way shes holding it
cried Maud and she and the men burst out laughing
Susan laughed also and Freddie helping practiced a less inexpert manner
Jim the dark young man with the sullen heavy countenance rang for more sandwiches and another bottle of whiskey
Susan continued to drink but ate nothing
Have a sandwich said Freddie
Im not hungry
Well they say that to eat and drink means to die of paresis while to only drink means dying of delirium tremens
I guess youre right
Id prefer the dts
Its quicker and livelier
Jim sang a ribald song with some amusing comedy business
Maud told several stories whose only claim to point lay in their frankness about things not usually spoken
Dont you tell any more Maudie advised Freddie
Why is it that a woman never takes up a story until every man on earth has heard it at least twice
The sandwiches disappeared the second bottle of whiskey ran low
Maud told story after story of how she had played this man and that for a suckerwas as full of such tales and as joyous and selfpleased over them as an honest salesman telling his delighted respectable pewholding employer how he has stuck this customer and that for a fancy price
Presently Maud again noticed that Susan was in her wet clothes and cried out about it
Susan pretended to start to undress
Freddie and Jim suddenly seized her
She struggled half laughing the whiskey was sending into her brain dizzying clouds
She struggled more fiercely
But it was in vain
Gee you have got a prize Freddie
exclaimed Jim at last angry
A regular tartar
A damn handsome one retorted Freddie
Shes even got feet
Susan amid the laughter of the others darted for the bedroom
Cowering in a corner trying to cover herself she ordered Freddie to leave her
He laughed seized her in his iron grip
She struck at him bit him in the shoulder
He gave a cry of pain and drove a savage blow into her cheek
Then he buried his fingers in her throat and the gleam of his eyes made her soul quail
Dont kill me
she cried in the clutch of cowardice for the first time
It was not death that she feared but the phantom of things worse than death that can be conjured to the imagination by the fury of a personality which is utterly reckless and utterly cruel
Dont kill me
she shrieked
What the hell are you doing
shouted Jim from the other room
Shut that door replied Freddie
Im going to attend to my lady friend
As the door slammed he dragged Susan by the throat and one arm to the bed flung her down
I saw you were a high stepper the minute I looked at you said he in a pleasant cooing voice that sent the chills up and down her spine
I knew youd have to be broke
Well the sooner its done the sooner well get along nicely
His blue eyes were laughing into hers
With the utmost deliberation he gripped her throat with one hand and with the other began to slap her each blow at his full strength
Her attempts to scream were only gasps
Quickly the agony of his brutality drove her into unconsciousness
Long after she had ceased to feel pain she continued to feel the impact of those blows and dully heard her own deep groans
When she came to her senses she was lying sprawled upon the far side of the bed
Her head was aching wildly her body was stiff and sore her face felt as if it were swollen to many times its normal size
In misery she dragged herself up and stood on the floor
She went to the bureau and stared at herself in the glass
Her face was indeed swollen but not to actual disfigurement
Under her left eye there was a small cut from which the blood had oozed to smear and dry upon her left cheek
Upon her throat were faint bluish finger marks
The damage was not nearly so great as her throbbing nerves reportedthe damage to her body
Buther soulit was a crushed trampled degraded thing lying prone and bleeding to death
Shall I kill myself
she thought
And the answer came in a fierce protest and refusal from every nerve of her intensely vital youth
She looked straight into her own eyeswithout horror without shame without fear
You are as low as the lowest she said to her imagenot to herself but to her image for herself seemed spectator merely of that body and soul aching and bleeding and degraded
It was the beginning of selfconsciousness with hera curious kind of selfconsciousnessher real self aloof and far removed observing calmly critically impersonally the adventures of her body and the rest of her surface self
She turned round to look again at the man who had outraged them
His eyes were open and he was gazing dreamily at her as smiling and innocent as a child
When their eyes met his smile broadened until he was showing his beautiful teeth
You are a beauty
said he
Go into the other room and get me a cigarette
She continued to look fixedly at him
Without change of expression he said gently Do you want another lesson in manners
She went to the door opened it entered the sittingroom
The other two had pulled open a folding bed and were lying in it Jims head on Mauds bosom her arms round his neck
Both were asleep
His black beard had grown out enough to give his face a dirty and devilish expression
Maud looked far more youthful and much prettier than when she was awake
Susan put a cigarette between her lips lit it carried a box of cigarettes and a stand of matches in to Freddie
Light one for me said he
She obeyed held it to his lips
Kiss me first
Her pale lips compressed
Kiss me he repeated far down in his eyes the vicious gleam of that boundlessly ferocious cruelty which is mothered not by rage but by pleasure
She kissed him on the cheek
On the lips he commanded
Their lips met and it was to her as if a hot flame terrible yet thrilling swept round and embraced her whole body
Do you love me
he asked tenderly
She was silent
You love me
he asked commandingly
You can call it that if you like
I knew you would
I understand women
The way to make a woman love is to make her afraid
She gazed at him
I am not afraid she said
He laughed
Oh yes
Thats why you do what I sayand always will
No replied she
I dont do it because I am afraid but because I want to live
I should think



Youll be all right in a day or so said he after inspecting her bruises
Now Ill explain to you what good friends were going to be
He propped himself in an attitude of lazy grace puffed at his cigarette in silence for a moment as if arranging what he had to say
At last he began I havent any regular business
I wasnt born to work
Only damn fools workand the clever man waits till theyve got something then he takes it away from em
You dont want to work either
I havent been able to make a living at it said the girl
She was sitting crosslegged a cover draped around her
Youre too pretty and too clever
Besides as you say you couldnt make a living at itnot whats a living for a woman brought up as youve been
No you cant work
So were going to be partners
No said Susan
Im going to dress now and go away
Freddie laughed
Dont be a fool
Didnt I say we were to be partners



You want to keep on at the sporting business dont you
Hers was the silence of assent
Wella womanespecially a young one like youis no good unless she has someonesome manbehind her
Married or single respectable or lively working or sportingN G without a man
A woman alone doesnt amount to any more than a rich mans son
There had been nothing in Susans experience to enable her to dispute this
Now Im going to stand behind you
Ill see that you dont get pinched and get you out if you do
Ill see that you get the best the citys got if youre sickand so on
Ive got a pull with the organization
Im one of Finnegans lieutenants
Some daywhen Im older and have served my apprenticeshipIll pull off something good
MeanwhileI manage to live
I always have managed itand I never did a stroke of real work since I was a kidand never shall
God was mighty good to me when he put a few brains in this nut of mine
He settled his head comfortably in the pillow and smiled at his own thoughts
In spite of herself Susan had been not only interested but attracted
It is impossible for any human being to contemplate mystery in any form without being fascinated
And here was the profoundest mystery she had ever seen
He talked well and his mode of talking was that of education of refinement even
An extraordinary man certainlyand in what a strange way
Yes said he presently looking at her with his gentle friendly smile
Well be partners
Ill protect you and well divide what you make
What a strange creature
Had hethis kindly handsome youthdone that frightful thing
Nono
It was another instance of the unreality of the outward life
He had not done it any more than sheher real selfhad suffered it
Her reply to his restatement of the partnership was No thank you
I want nothing to do with it
Youre dead slow said he with mild and patient persuasion
How would you get along at your business in this town if you didnt have a backer
Why youd be taking turns at the Island and the gutter within six months
Youd be giving all your money to some rotten cop or fly cop who couldnt protect you at that
Or youd work the street for some cheap cadet whod beat you up oftener than hed beat up the men who welched on you
Ill look out for myself persisted she
Bless the baby
exclaimed he immensely amused
How lucky that you found me
Im going to take care of you in spite of yourself
Not for nothing of course
You wouldnt value me if you got me for nothing
Im going to help you and youre going to help me
You need me and I need you
Why do you suppose I took the trouble to tame you
What you want doesnt go
Its what I want
He let her reflect on this a while
Then he went on You dont understand about fellows like Jim and methough Jims a small potato beside me as youll soon find out
Suppose you didnt obey ordersjust as I do what Finnegan tells mejust as Finnegan does what the big shout down below says
Suppose you didnt obeywhat then
I dont know confessed Susan
Well its time you learned
Well say you act stubborn
You dress and say goodby to me and start out
Do you think Im wicked enough to let you make a fool of yourself
Well Im not
You wont get outside the door before your good angel here will get busy
Ill be telephoning to a fly cop of this district
And whatll he do
Why about the time you are halfway down the block hell pinch you
Hell take you to the station house
And in Police Court tomorrow the Judgell give you a week on the Island for being a streetwalker
Susan shivered
She instinctively glanced toward the window
The rain was still falling changing the City of the Sun into a city of desolation
It looked as though it would never see the sun againand her life looked that way also
Freddie was smiling pleasantly
He went on You do your little stretch on the Island
When your times up I send you word where to report to me
Well say you dont come
The minute you set foot on the streets again alone back to the Island you go



Now do you understand Queenie
And he laughed and pulled her over and kissed her and smoothed her hair
Youre a very superior articleyou are he murmured
Im stuck on you
Susan did not resist
She did not care what happened to her
The more intelligent a trapped animal is the less resistance it offers once it realizes
Helplessabsolutely helpless
No moneyno friends
No escape but death
The sun was shining
Outside lay the vast world across the street on a flagpole fluttered the banner of freedom
Freedom
Was there any such thing anywhere
Perhaps if one had plenty of moneyor powerful friends
But not for her any more than for the masses whose fate of squalid and stupid slavery she was trying to escape
Not for her so long as she was helpless she would simply move from one land of slavery to another
Helpless
To struggle would not be courageous but merely absurd
If you dont believe me ask Maud said Freddie
I dont want you to get into trouble
As I told you Im stuck on you
With his cigarette gracefully loose between those almost too beautifully formed lips of his and with one of his strong smooth white arms about his head he looked at her an expression of content with himself of admiration for her in his handsome eyes
You dont realize your good luck
But you will when you find how many girls are crazy to get on the good side of me
This is a great old town and nobody amounts to anything in it unless hes got a pull or is next to somebody else that has
Susans slow reflective nod showed that this statement explained or seemed to explain certain mysteries of life that had been puzzling her
Youve got a lot in you continued he
Thats my opinion and Im a fair judge of yearlings
Youre liable to land somewhere some day when youve struck your gait



If I had the mon Id be tempted to set you up in a flat and keep you all to myself
But I cant afford it
It takes a lot of cash to keep me going



Youll do well
You wont have to bother with any but classy gents
Ill see that the cops put you wise when theres anyone round throwing his money away
And I can help you myself
Ive got quite a line of friends among the rich chappies from Fifth Avenue
And I always let my girls get the benefit of it
My girls
Susans mind recovering now from its daze seized upon this phrase
And soon she had fathomed how these two young men came to be so luxuriously dressed so well supplied with money
She had heard of this system under which the girls in the streets were exploited as thoroughly as the girls in the houses
In all the earth was there anyone who was suffered to do for himself or herself without there being a powerful idle someone else to take away all the proceeds but a bare living
Helpless
Helpless
How many girls have you
she asked
Jealous already
And he laughed and blew a cloud of smoke into her face
She took the quarters he directeda plain clean room two flights up at seven dollars a week in a furnished room house on West Fortythird Street near Eighth Avenue
She was but a few blocks from where she and Rod had lived
New Yorkto a degree unrivaled among the cities of the worldillustrates in the isolated lives of its never isolated inhabitants how little relationship there is between space and actualities of distance
Wherever on earth there are as many as two human beings one may see an instance of the truth
That an infinity of spiritual solitude can stretch uncrossable even between two locked in each others loving arms
But New Yorks solitudes its separations extend to the surface things
Susan had no sense of the apparent nearness of her former abode
Her life again lay in the same streets but there again came the sense of strangeness which only one who has lived in New York could appreciate
The streets were the same but to her they seemed as the streets of another city because she was now seeing in them none of the things she used to see was seeing instead kinds of people aspects of human beings modes of feeling and acting and existing of which she used to have not the faintest knowledge
There were as many worlds as kinds of people
Thus though we all talk to each other as if about the same world each of us is thinking of his own kind of world the only one he sees
And that is why there can never be sympathy and understanding among the children of men until there is some approach to resemblance in their various lots for the lot determines the man
The house was filled with women of her own kind
They were allowed all privileges
There was neither bath nor stationary washstand but the landlady supplied tin tubs on request
Oh Mr Palmers recommendation said she Ill give you two days to pay
My terms are in advance
But Mr Palmers a dear friend of mine
She was a short woman with a monstrous bust and almost no hips
Her thin hair was dyed and frizzled and her voice sounded as if it found its way out of her fat lips after a long struggle to pass through the fat of her throat and chest
Her second chin lay upon her bosom in a soft swollen bag that seemed to be suspended from her ears
Her eyes were hard and evil of a brownish gray
She affected suavity and elaborate politeness but if the least thing disturbed her she became red and coarse of voice and vile of language
The vile language and the nature of her business and her private life aside she would have compared favorably with anyone in the class of those who dealas merchants as landlords as boardinghouse keeperswith the desperately different classes of uncertain income
She was reputed rich
They said she stayed on in business to avoid lonesomeness and to keep in touch with all that was going on in the life that had been hers from girlhood
And shes a mixer said Maud to Susan
In response to Susans look of inquiry she went on to explain A mixers a white woman that keeps a colored man
Maud laughed at Susans expression of horror
You are a greenie she mocked
Why its all the rage
Nearly all the girls dofrom the headliners that are kept by the young Fifth Avenue millionaires down to nine out of ten of the girls of our set that you see in Broadway
No Im not lying
Its the truth
I dont do itat least not yet
I may get round to it
After the talk with Maud about the realities of life as it is lived by several hundred thousand of the inhabitants of Manhattan Island Susan had not the least disposition to test by defiance the truth of Freddie Palmers plain statement as to his powers and her duties
He had told her to go to work that very Sunday evening and Jim had ordered Maud to call for her and to initiate her
And at halfpast seven Maud came
At once she inspected Susans swollen face
Might be a bit worse she said
With a veil on no oned notice it
But I havent a veil said Susan
Ive got mine with mepinned to my garter
I havent been home since this afternoon
And Maud produced it
But I cant wear a veil at night objected Susan
Why not
said Maud
Lots of the girls do
A veils a dandy hider
Besides even where a girls got nothing to hide and has a face thats all to the good still its not a bad idea to wear a veil
Men like what they cant see
One of the ugliest girls I know makes a lot of moneyall with her veil
She fixes up her figure something grand
Then she puts on that veilone of the kind you think you can see a face through but you really cant
And she never lifts it till the come on has given up his cash
Then Maud laughed
Gee but she has had some hot runins after she hoists her curtain
Why dont you wear a veil all the time
asked Susan
Maud tossed her head
What do you take me for
Ive got too good an opinion of my looks for that
Susan put on the veil
It was not of the kind that is a disguise
Still diaphanous though it seemed it concealed astonishingly the swelling in Susans face
Obviously then it must at least haze the features would do something toward blurring the marks that go to make identity
I shall always wear a veil said Susan
Oh I dont know deprecated Maud
I think youre quite prettythough a little too proper and serious looking to suit some tastes
Susan had removed veil and hat was letting down her hair
What are you doing that for
cried Maud impatiently
Were late now and I dont like the way my hairs done cried Susan
Why it was all rightreal swellgood as a hairdresser could have done
But Susan went on at her task
Ever since she came East she had worn it in a braid looped at the back of her head
She proceeded to change this radically
With Maud forgetting to be impatient in admiration of her swift fingers she made a coiffure much more elaboratewide waves out from her temples and a big round loose knot behind
She was well content with the resultespecially when she got the veil on again and it was assisting in the change
What do you think
she said to Maud when she was ready
My but you look different
exclaimed Maud
A lot dressierand sportier
Moremore Broadway
Thats itBroadway said Susan
She had always avoided looking like Broadway
Now she would take the opposite tack
Not loud toiletsfor they would defeat her purpose
Not loud butjust common
But added Maud you do look swell about the feet
Where do you get your shoes
No I guess its the feet
As they sallied forth Maud said First Ill show you our hotel
And they went to a Raines Law hotel in Fortysecond Street near Eighth Avenue
The proprietors a heeler of Finnegans
I guess Freddie comes in for some rakeoff
He gives us twentyfive cents of every dollar the man spends explained she
And if the man opens wine we get two dollars on every bottle
The best way is to stay behind when the man goes and collect right away
That avoids rowsthough theyd hardly dare cheat you being as youre on Freddies staff
Freddies got a big pull
Hes way up at the top
I wish to God I had him instead of Jim
Freddies giving up fast
They say hes got some things a lot bettern this now and that hes likely to quit this and turn respectable
You ought to treat me mighty white seeing what I done for you
Ive put you in rightand thats everything in this here life
Susan looked all roundlooked along the streets stretching away with their morning suggestion of freedom to fly freedom to escapehelpless
Cant I get a drink
asked she
There was a strained look in her eyes a significant nervousness of the lips and hands
I must have a drink
Of course
Max has been on a vacation but I hear hes back
When I introduce you hell probably set em up
But I wouldnt drink if I were you till I went off duty
I must have a drink replied Susan
Itll get you down
It got me down
I used to have a fine suckergave me a hundred a week and paid my flat rent
But I had nothing else to do so I took to drinking and I got so reckless that I let him catch me with my lover that time
But I had to have somebOdy to spend the money on
Anyhow its no fun having a John
A John
said Susan
Whats that
You are an innocent
laughed Maud
A Johns a suckera fellow that keeps a girl
Well itd be no fun to have a John unless you fooled himwould it
They now entered the side door of the hotel and ascended the stairs
A dyspeptic looking man with a red nose that stood out the more strongly for the sallowness of his skin and the smallness of his sunken brown eyes had his hands spread upon the office desk and was leaning on his stiff arms
Hello Max said Maud in a fresh condescending way
Hows business
Slow
Always slack on Sundays
How goes it with you Maudie
Soso
I manage to pick up a living in spite of the damn chippies
I dont see why the hell they dont go into the business regular and make something out of it instead of loving free
Im down on a girl thats neither the one thing nor the other
This is my lady friend Miss Queenie
She turned laughingly to Susan
I never asked your last name
Brown
My what a strange name
cried Maud
Then as the proprietor laughed with the heartiness of tradesman at good customers jest she said Going to set em up Max
He pressed a button and rang a bell loudly
The responding waiter departed with orders for a whiskey and two lithias
Maud explained to Susan Max used to be a prizefighter
He was middleweight champion
Ive been a lot of things in my days said Max with pride
So Ive heard joked Maud
They say theyve got your picture at headquarters
Thats neither here nor there said Max surlily
Dont get too flip
Susan drank her whiskey as soon as it came and the glow rushed to her ghastly face
Said Max with great politeness Youre having a little neuralgia aint you
I see your face is swhole some
Yes said Susan
Neuralgia
Maud laughed hilariously
Susan herself had ceased to brood over the incident
In conventional lives visited but rarely by perilous storms by disaster such an event would be what is called concise
But in life as it is lived by the masses of the peoplelife in which awful disease death maiming eviction fire violent event of any and every kind is part of the daily routine in that life of the masses there is no time for lingering upon the weathered storm or for bothering about and repairing its ravages
Those who live the comparatively languid the sheltered life should not use their own standards of what is delicate and refined what is conspicuous and strong when they judge their fellow beings as differently situated
Nevertheless they dowith the result that we find the puny mud lark criticizing the eagle battling with the hurricane
When Susan and Maud were in the street again Susan declared that she must have another drink
I cant offer to pay for one for you said she to Maud
Ive almost no money
And I must spend what Ive got for whiskey before Icancanstart in
Maud began to laugh looked at Susan and was almost crying instead
I can lend you a fiver she said
Lifes hellaint it
My father used to have a good businesstobacco
The trust took it away from himand then he drankand mother she drank too
And one day he beat her so she diedand he ran away
Oh its all awful
But Ive stopped caring
Im stuck on Jimand another little fellow he dont know about
For Gods sake dont tell him or hed have me pinched for doing business free
I get full every night and raise old Nick
Sometimes I hate Jim
Ive tried to kill him twice when I was loaded
But a girls got to have a backer with a pull
And Jim lets me keep a bigger share of what I make than some fellows
Freddies pretty good too they sayexcept when hes losing on the races or gets stuck on some actress thats too classy to be shanghaiedlike you wasand that makes him cough up
Maud went on to disclose that Jim usually let her have all she made above thirty dollars a week and in hard weeks had sometimes let her beg off with fifteen
Said she I can generally count on about fifteen or twenty for myself
Us girls that has backers make a lot more money than the girls that hasnt
Theyre always getting pinched toothough theyre careful never to speak first to a man
We can go right up and brace men with the cops looking on
A cop thatd touch us would get brokeunless we got too gay or robbed somebody with a pull
But none of our class of girls do any robbing
Theres nothing in it
You get caught sooner or later and then youre down and out
While Susan was having two more drinks Maud talked about Freddie
She seemed to know little about him though he was evidently one of the conspicuous figures
He had started in the lower East Sidehad been leader of one of those gangs that infest tenement districtsthe young men who refuse to submit to the common lot of stupid and badly paid toil and try to fight their way out by the quick methods of violence instead of the slower but surer methods of robbing the poor through a store of some kind
These gangs were thieves blackmailers kidnapers of young girls for houses of prostitution repeaters
Most of them graduated into habitual jailbirds a fewthe cleverestbecame saloonkeepers and politicians and highclass professional gamblers and race track men
Freddie Maud explained was not much over twentyfive yet was already well up toward the place where successful gang leaders crossed over into the respectable classthat is grafted in big figures
He was a great reader said Maud and had taken courses at some college
They say he and his gang used to kill somebody nearly every night
Then he got a lot of money out of one of his jobssome say it was a bank robbery and some say they killed a miner who was drunk with a big roll on him
Anyhow Freddie got next to Finneganhes worth several millions that he made out of policy shops and poolrooms and contracts and such political things
So hes in rightand hes got the brains
Hes a good one for working out schemes for making people work hard and bring him their money
And everybodys afraid of him because he wont stop at nothing and is too slick to get caught
Maud broke off abruptly and rose warned by the glazed look in Susans eyes
Susan was so far gone that she had difficulty in not staggering and did not dare speak lest her uncertain tongue should betray her
Maud walked her up and down the block several times to give the fresh air a chance then led her up to a man who had looked at them in passing and had paused to look back
Want to go have a good time sweetheart
said Maud to the man
He was well dressed middleaged with a full beard and spectacles looked as if he might be a banker or perhaps a professor in some college
How much
asked he
Five for a little while
Come along sporty
Take me or my lady friend
How much for both of you
Ten
We dont cut rates
Take us both dearie
I know a hotel where itd be all right
No
I guess Ill take your lady friend
He had been peering at Susan through his glasses
And if she treats me well Ill take her again
Youre sure youre all right
Im a married man
Weve both been home visiting for a month and walking the chalk
My but mas strict
We got back tonight said Maud glibly
Go ahead Queenie
Ill be chasing up and down here waiting
In a lower tone Get through with him quick
Strike him for five more after you get the first five
Hes a blob
When Susan came slinking through the office of the hotel in the wake of the man two hours later Maud sprang from the little parlor
How much did you get
she asked in an undertone
Susan looked nervously at the back of the man who was descending the stairway to the street
He said hed pay me next time she said
I didnt know what to do
He was polite and Maud seized her by the arm
Come along
she cried
As she passed the desk she said to the clerk A dirty bilker
Tryin to kiss his way out
Give him hell said the clerk
Maud still gripping Susan overtook the man at the sidewalk
What do you mean by not paying my lady friend
she shouted
Get out
said the man in a low tone with an uneasy glance round
If you annoy me Ill call the police
If you dont cough up mighty damn quick cried Maud so loudly that several passersby stopped Ill do the calling myself you bum and have you pinched for insulting two respectable working girls
And she planted herself squarely before him
Susan drew back into the shadow of the wall
Up stepped Max who happened to be standing outside his place
Whats the row about
he demanded
These women are trying to blackmail me said the man sidling away
Maud seized him by the arm
Will you cough up or shall I scream
she cried
Stand out of the way girls said Max savagely and let me take a crack at the
The man dived into his pocket produced a bill thrust it toward Susan
Maud saw that it was a five
Thats only five she cried
Wheres the other five
Five was the bargain whined the man
Do you want me to push in your blinkers you damned old bilk you
cried Max seizing him violently by the arm
The man visited his pocket again found another five extended the two
Maud seized them
Now clear out
said Max
I hate to let you go without a swift kick in the pants
Maud pressed the money on Susan and thanked Max
Said Max Dont forget to tell Freddie what I done for his girl
Shell tell him all right Maud assured him
As the girls went east through Fortysecond Street Susan said Im afraid that manll lay for us
Lay for us laughed Maud
Hell run like a cat afire if he ever sights us again
I feel queer and faint said Susan
I must have a drink
WellIll go with you
But Ive got to get busy
I want a couple of days off this week for my little fellow so I must hustle
You let that dirty dog keep you too long
Half an hours plenty enough
Always make em cough up in advance then hustle em through
And dont listen to their guff about wanting to see you again if you treat em right
Theres nothing in it
They went into a restaurant bar near Broadway
Susan took two drinks of whiskey raw in rapid succession Maud took one drinka green mint with ice
While you was fooling away time with that thief said she I had two mengot five from one three from the other
The fivedollar man took a threedollar roomthat was seventyfive for me
The threedollar man wouldnt stand for more than a dollar roomso I got only a quarter there
But he set em up to two rounds of drinksa quarter more for me
So I cleared nine twentyfive
And youd a got only your twentyfive cents commission on the room if it hadnt been for me
You forgot to collect your commission
Well you can get it next time
Only I wouldnt ask for it Max was so nice in helping out
Hell give you the quarter
When Susan had taken her second stiff drink her eyes were sparkling and she was laughing recklessly
I want a cigarette she said
You feel bully dont you
Im ready for anything declared she giddily
I dont give a damn
Im over the line
Idontgiveadamn
I used to hate the men I went up with said Maud but now I hardly look at their faces
Youll soon be that way
Then youll only drink for fun
Drinkand dopethey are about the only fun we havethem and caring about some fellow
How many girls has Freddie got
Search me
Not many that hed speak to himself
Jims his wardmandoes his collecting for him
Freddies above most of the men in this business
The others are about like Jimtough straight through but Freddies a kind of a pullman
The other meneven Jimhate him for being such a snare and being able to hide it that hes in such a low business
Theyd have done him up long ago if they could
But hes to wise for them
Thats why they have to do what he says
I tell you youre in right for sure
Youll have Freddie eating out of your hand if you play a cool hand
Susan ordered another drink and a package of Egyptian cigarettes
They dont allow ladies to smoke in here said Maud
Well go to the washroom
And in the washroom they took a few hasty puffs before sallying forth again
Usually Sunday night was dull all the men having spent their spare money the night before and it being a bad night for married men to make excuses for getting away from home
Maud explained that except outoftowners the married men were the chief support of their professionand most of the cornhuskers are married men too
But Susan had the novices luck
When she and Maud met Mauds little gentleman friend Harry Tucker at midnight and went to Considines for supper Susan had taken in presents and commissions twentynine dollars and a half
Maud had not done so badly herself her net receipts were twentytwo fifty
She would not let Susan pay any part of the supper bill but gave Harry the necessary money
Heres a five said she pressing the bill into his hand and keep the change
And she looked at him with loving eyes of longing
He was a pretty commonlooking fellow a mere boy who clerked in a haberdashery in the neighborhood
As he got only six dollars a week and had to give five to his mother who sewed he could not afford to spend money on Maud and she neither expected nor wished it
When she picked him up he like most of his fellowclerks had no decent clothing but the suit he had to have to make a front at the store
Maud had outfitted him from the skin with the cheap but showy stuff exhibited for just such purposes in the Broadway windows
She explained confidentially to Susan It makes me sort of feel that I own him
Then too in love there oughtnt to be any money
If he paid Id be as cold to him as I am to the rest
The only reason I like Jim at all is I like a good beating once in a while
Its exciting
Jimhe treats me like the dirt under his feet
And thats what we aredirt under the mens feet
Every woman knows it when it comes to a showdown between her and a man
As my pop used to say the world was made for men not for women
Still our graft aint so bum at thatif we work it right
Freddie called on Susan about noon the next day
She was still in bed
He was dressed in the extreme of fashion was wearing a chinchillalined coat
He looked the idle sportively inclined son of some rich man in the Fifth Avenue district
He was having an affair with a much admired young actresswas engaged in it rather as a matter of vanity and for the fashionable halfworld associations into which it introduced him rather than from any present interest in the lady
He stood watching Susan with a peculiar expressionone he might perhaps have found it hard to define himself
He bent over her and carelessly brushed her ear with his lips
How did your royal highness make out
inquired he
The moneys in the top bureau drawer replied she the covers up to her eyes and her eyes closed
He went to the bureau opened the drawer with his gloved hands counted the money
As he counted his eyes had a look in them that was strangely like jealous rage
He kept his back toward her for some time after he had crossed to look at the money
When he spoke it was to say Not bad
And when you get dressed up a bit and lose your stage fright youll do a smashing business
Ill not take my share of this
I had a good run with the cards last night
Anyhow youve got to pay your rent and buy some clothes
Ive got to invest something in my new property
Its badly run down
Youll get busy again tonight of course
Never lay off lady unless the weathers bad
Youll find you wont average more than twenty good business days a month in summer and fall and only about ten in winter and spring when its cold and often lots of bad weather in the afternoons and evenings
That means hustle
No sign from Susan
He sat on the bed and pulled the covers away from her face
What are you so grouchy about pet
he inquired chucking her under the chin
Nothing
Too much booze Ill bet
Well sleep your grouch off
Ive got a date with Finnegan
The elections coming on and I have to worklining up the vote and getting the repeaters ready
It all means good money for me
Look out about the booze lady
Itll float you into troubletrouble with me I mean
And he patted her bare shoulders laughed gently went to the door
He paused there struggled with an impulse to turndeparted
VII BUT she did not look out about the booze
Each morning she awoke in a state of depression so horrible that she wondered why she could not bring herself to plan suicide
Why was it
Her marriage
Yesand she paid it its customary tribute of a shudder
Yes her marriage had made all things thereafter possible
But what else
Lack of courage
Lack of selfrespect
Was it not always assumed that a woman in her position if she had a grain of decent instinct would rush eagerly upon death
Was she so much worse than others
Or was what everybody said about these thingseverybody who had experiencewas it false like nearly everything else she had been taught
She did not understand she only knew that hope was as strong within her as health itselfand that she did not want to dieand that at present she was helpless
One evening the man she was witha goodlooking and unusually interesting young chapsuddenly said What a heart action you have got
Let me listen to that again
Is it all wrong
asked Susan as he pressed his ear against her chest
You ask that as if you rather hoped it was
I doand I dont
Well said he after listening for a third time youll never die of heart trouble
I never heard a heart with such a grand actionlike a big powerful pump built to last forever
Youre never ill are you
Not thus far
And youll have a hard time making yourself ill Health
Why your health must be perfect
Let me see
And he proceeded to thump and press upon her chest with an expertness that proclaimed the student of medicine
He was all interest and enthusiasm took a pencil and spreading a sheet upon her chest over her heart drew its outlines
There
he cried
What is it
asked Susan
I dont understand
The young man drew a second and much smaller heart within the outline of hers
This he explained is about the size of an ordinary heart
You can see for yourself that yours is fully onefourth bigger than the normal
What of it
said Susan
Why health and strengthand vitalitycouragehopeall onefourth above the ordinary allowance
Yes more than a fourth
I envy you
You ought to live long stay young until youre very oldand get pretty much anything you please
You dont belong to this life
Some accident I guess
Every once in a while I run across a case something like yours
Youll go back where you belong
This is a dip not a drop
You sound like a fortuneteller
She was smiling mockingly
But in truth she had never in all her life heard words that thrilled her so that heartened her so
I am
A scientific fortuneteller
And what that kind says comes true barring accidents
As youre not ignorant and careless this life of yours isnt physiologically bad
On the contrary youre out in the open air much of the time and get the splended exercise of walkinga much more healthful life in the essential ways than respectable women lead
Theyre always stuffing and rumping it
They never move if they can help
No nothing can stop you but deathunless youre far less intelligent than you look
Oh yesdeath and one other thing
Drink
And he looked shrewdly at her
But drink she must
And each day as soon as she dressed and was out in the street she began to drink and kept it up until she had driven off the depression and had got herself into the mood of recklessness in which she found a certain sardonic pleasure in outraging her own sensibilities
There is a stage in a drinking career when the man or the woman becomes depraved and ugly as soon as the liquor takes effect
But she was far from this advanced stage
Her disposition was if anything more sweet and generous when she was under the influence of liquor
The whiskeyshe almost always drank whiskeyseemed to act directly and only upon the nerves that ached and throbbed when she was sober the nerves that made the life she was leading seem loathsome beyond the power of habit to accustom
With these nerves stupefied her natural gayety asserted itself and a fondness for quiet and subtle mockeryher indulgence in it did not make her popular with vain men sufficiently acute to catch her meaning
By observation and practice she was soon able to measure the exact amount of liquor that was necessary to produce the proper state of intoxication at the hour for going on duty
That gayety of hers was of the surface only
Behind it her real self remained indifferent or somber or sardonic according to her mood of the day
And she had the sense of being in the grasp of a hideous fascinating nightmare of being dragged through some dreadful probation from which she would presently emerge to ascend to the position she would have earned by her desperate fortitude
The pastunreal
The presenta waking dream
But the futureah the future
He has not candidly explored far beneath the surface of things who does not know the strange allure charm even that many loathsome things possess
And drink is peculiarly fitted to bring out this perverse qualitydrink that blurs all the conventionalities even those built up into moral ideas by centuries and ages of unbroken custom
The human animal for all its pretenses of inflexibility is almost infinitely adaptablethat is why it has risen in several million years of evolution from about the humblest rank in the mammalian family to overlordship of the universe
Still it is doubtful if without drink to help her a girl of Susans intelligence and temperament would have been apt to endure
She would probably have chosen the alternativedeath
Hundreds perhaps thousands of girls at least her equals in sensibility are caught in the same calamity every year tens of thousands ever more and more as our civilization transforms under the pressure of industrialism are caught in the similar calamities of souldestroying toil
And only the few survive who have perfect health and abounding vitality
Susans iron strength enabled her to live but it was drink that enabled her to endure
Beyond question one of the greatest blessings that could now be conferred upon the race would be to cure it of the drink evil
But at the same time if drink were taken away before the causes of drink were removed there would be an appalling increase in suicidein insanity in the general total of human misery
For while drink retards the growth of intelligent effort to end the stupidities in the social system does it not also help men and women to bear the consequences of those stupidities
Our crude and undeveloped new civilization strapping men and women and children to the machines and squeezing all the energy out of them all the capacity for vital life casts them aside as soon as they are useless but long before they are dead
How unutterably wretched they would be without drink to give them illusions
Susan grew fond of cigarettes fond of whiskey to the rest she after a few weeks became numbno new or strange phenomenon in a world where people with a cancer or other hideous running sore or some gross and frightful deformity of fat or excrescence are seen laughing joining freely and comfortably in the company of the unafflicted
In her affliction Susan at least saw only those affected like herselfand that helped not a little helped the whiskey to confuse and distort her outlook upon life
The old Cartesian formulaI think therefore I amwould come nearer to expressing a truth were it reversedI am therefore I think
Our characters are compressed and our thoughts bent by our environment
And most of us are unconscious of our slavery because our environment remains unchanged from birth until death and so seems the whole universe to us
In spite of her life in spite of all she did to disguise herself there persisted in her faceeven when she was dazed or giddied or stupefied with drinkthe expression of the woman on the right side of the line
Whether it was something in her character whether it was not rather due to superiority of breeding and intelligence would be difficult to say
However there was the different look that irritated many of the other girls interfered with her business and made her feel a hypocrite
She heard so much about the paleness of her lips that she decided to end that comment by using paintthe durable kind Ida had recommended
When her lips flamed carmine a strange and striking effect resulted
The sad sweet pensiveness of her eyesthe pallor of her clear skinthen that splash of bright red artificial bold defiantthe contrast of the combination seemed somehow to tell the story of her life her past no less than her present
And when her beauty began to come backfor hard though her life was it was a life of good food of plenty of sleep of much open air so it put no such strain upon her as had the life of the factory and the tenementwhen her beauty came back the effect of that contrast of scarlet splash against the sad purity of pallid cheeks and violetgray eyes became a mark of individuality of distinction
It was not long before Susan would have as soon thought of issuing forth with her body uncovered as with her lips unrouged
She turned away from men who sought her a second time
She was difficult to find she went on duty only enough days each week to earn a low average of what was expected from the girls by their protectors
Yet she got many unexpected presentsand so had money to lend to the other girls who soon learned how easy she was
Maud sometimes at her own prompting sometimes prompted by Jim who was prompted by Freddiewarned her every few days that she was skating on the thinnest of ice
But she went her way
Not until she accompanied a girl to an opium joint to discover whether dope had the merits claimed for it as a deadener of pain and a producer of happinessnot until then did Freddie come in person
I hear said he and she wondered whether he had heard from Max or from loosetongued Maudthat you come into the hotel so drunk that men sometimes leave you right away againgo without paying you
I must drink said Susan
You must stop drink retorted he amiable in his terrible way
If you dont Ill have you pinched and sent up
Thatll bring you to your senses
I must drink said Susan
Then I must have you pinched said he with his mocking laugh
Dont be a fool he went on
You can make money enough to soon buy the right sort of clothes so that I can afford to be seen with you
Id like to take you out once in a while and give you a swell time
But whatd we look like togetherwith you in those cheap things out of bargain troughs
Not that you dont look wellfor you do
But the rest of you isnt up to your feet and to the look in your face
The whole things got to be right before a lady can sit opposite me in Murrays or Rectors
All I ask is to be let alone said Susan
That isnt playing squareand youve got to play square
What I want is to set you up in a nice parlor tradechaps from the college and the swell clubs and hotels
But I cant do anything for you as long as you drink this way
Youll have to stay on the streets
Thats where I want to stay
Well theres something to be said for the streets Freddie admitted
If a woman dont intend to make sporting her life business she dont want to get up among the swells of the profession where shed become known and find it hard to sidestep
Still even in the street you ought to make a hundred easyand not go with any man that doesnt suit you
Any man that doesnt suit me said Susan
And after a pause she said it again Any man that doesnt suit me
The young man with his shrewdness of the streetgraduate and his sensitiveness of the Italian gave her an understanding glance
You look as if you couldnt decide whether to laugh or cry
Id try to laugh if I was you
She had laughed as he spoke
Freddie nodded approval
That sounded good to me
Youre getting broken in
Dont take yourself so seriously
After all what are you doing
Why learning to live like a man
She found this new point of view interestingand true too
Like a manlike all men except possibly a fewnot enough exceptions to change the rule
Like a man getting herself hardened up to the point where she could take part in the cruel struggle on equal terms with the men
It wasnt their difference of body any more than it was their difference of dress that handicapped women it was the idea behind skirt and sexand she was getting rid of that



The theory was admirable but it helped her not at all in practice
She continued to keep to the darkness to wait in the deep doorways so far as she could in her business hours and to repulse advances in the day time or in public placesand to drink
She did not go again to the opium joint and she resisted the nightly offers of girls and their gentlemen friends to try cocaine in its various forms
Dope she saw was the medicine of despair
And she was far from despair
Had she not youth
Had she not health and intelligence and good looks
Some day she would have finished her apprenticeship
Thenthe career
Freddie let her alone for nearly a month though she was earning less than fifty dollars a weekwhich meant only thirty for him
He had never collected from her directly but always through Jim and she had now learned enough of the methods of the system of which she was one of the thousands of slaves to appreciate that she was treated by Jim with unique consideration
Not only by the surly and brutal Jim but also by the police who oppressed in petty ways wherever they dared because they hated Freddies system which took away from them a part of the graft they regarded as rightfully theirs
Yes rightfully theirs
And anyone disposed to be critical of police moralityor of Freddie Palmer moralityin this matter of graft would do well to pause and consider the source of his own income before he waxes too eloquent and too virtuous
Graft is one of those general words that mean everything and nothing
What is graft and what is honest income
Just where shall we draw the line between rightful exploitation of our fellowbeings through their necessities and their ignorance of their helplessness and wrongful exploitation
Do attempts to draw that line resolve down to making virtuous whatever I may appropriate and vicious whatever is appropriated in ways other than mine
And if so are not the police and the Palmers entitled to their day in the moral court no less than the tariffbaron and marketcornerer the herder and driver of wage slaves the retail artists in cold storage filth short weight and shoddy goods
However we must draw the line somewhere or there will be no such thing as morality under our social system
So why not draw it at anything the other fellow does to make money
In adopting this simple rule we not only preserve the moralities from destruction but also establish our own virtue and the other fellows villainy
Truly never is the human race so delightfully so unconsciously amusing as when it discusses right and wrong
When she saw Freddie again he was far from sober
He showed it by his way of beginning
Said he Ive got to hand you a line of rough talk Queenie
I took on this jag for your especial benefit said he
Im a fool about you and you take advantage of it
Thats bad for both of us



Youre drinking as much as ever
More replied she
It takes more and more
How can you expect to get on
cried he exasperated
As I told you I couldnt make a cent if I didnt drink
Freddie stared moodily at her then at the floorthey were in her room
Finally he said You get the best class of men
I put my swell friends on to where you go slipping by up and down in the shadowand its all they can do to find you
The best class of menmen all the swell respectable girls in town are crazy to hook up withthose of em that aint married already
If youre good enough for those chaps they ought to be good enough for you
Yet some of em complain to me that they get thrown downand others kick because you were too fulland damn it you act so queer that you scare em away
What am I to do about it
She was silent
I want you to promise me youll take a brace
No answer
You wont promise
Nobecause I dont intend to
Im doing the best I can
You think Im a good thing
You think Ill take anything off you because Im stuck on youand appreciate that you aint on the same level with the rest of these heifers
WellIll not let any woman con me
I never have
I never will
And Ill make you realize that youre not square with me
Ill let you get a taste of life as it is when a girl hasnt got a friend with a pull
As you please said Susan indifferently
I dont in the least care what happens to me
Well see about that cried he enraged
Ill give you a week to brace up in
The look he shot at her by way of finish to his sentence was menacing enough
But she was not disturbed these signs of anger tended to confirm her in her sense of security from him
For it was wholly unlike the Freddie Palmer the rest of the world knew to act in this irresolute and stormy way
She knew that Palmer in his fashion cared for herbetter still liked herliked to talk with her liked to showand to developthe aspiring side of his interesting unusual nature for her benefit
A week passed during which she did not see him
But she heard that he was losing on both the cards and the horses and was drinking wildly
A weekten daysthen One night as she came out of a saloon a block or so down Seventh Avenue from Fortysecond a fly cop seized her by the arm
Come along said he roughly
Youre drinking and soliciting
Ive got to clear the streets of some of these tarts
Its got so decent people cant move without falling over em
Susan had not lived in the tenement districts where the ignorance and the helplessness and the lack of a voice that can make itself heard among the ruling classes make the sway of the police absolute and therefore tyrannicalshe had not lived there without getting something of that dread and horror of the police which to people of the upper classes seems childish or evidence of secret criminal hankerings
And this nervousness had latterly been increased to terror by what she had learned from her fellowoutcaststhe hideous tales of oppression of robbery of bodily and moral degradation
But all this terror had been purely fanciful as any emotion not of experience proves to be when experience evokes the reality
At that touch at the sound of those rough wordsat that reality of the terror she had imagined from the days when she went to work at Matsons and to live with the Brashears she straightway lost consciousness
When her senses returned she was in a cell lying on a wooden bench
There must have been some sort of wild struggle for her clothes were muddy her hat was crushed into shapelessness her veil was so torn that she had difficulty in arranging it to act as any sort of concealment
Though she had no mirror at which to discover the consolation she need have had no fear of being recognized so distorted were all her features by the frightful paroxysms of grief that swept and ravaged her body that night
She fainted again when they led her out to put her in the wagon
She fainted a third time when she heard her nameQueenie Brownbellowed out by the court officer
They shook her into consciousness led her to the courtroom
She was conscious of a stifling heat of a curious crowd staring at her with eyes which seemed to bore red hot holes into her flesh
As she stood before the judge with head limp upon her bosom she heard in her ear a rough voice bawling Youre discharged
The judge says dont come here again
And she was pushed through an iron gate
She walked unsteadily up the aisle between two masses of those burningeyed human monsters
She felt the cold outside air like a vast drench of icy water flung upon her
If it had been raining she might have gone toward the river
But thansic that day New York had never been more radiantly the City of the Sun
How she got home she never knew but late in the afternoon she realized that she was in her own room
Hour after hour she lay upon the bed body and mind inert
Helplessno escapeno courage to liveyet no wish to die
How much longer would it last
Surely the waking from this dream must come soon
About noon the next day Freddie came
I let you off easy said he sitting on the bed upon which she was lying dressed as when she came in the day before
Have you been drinking again
No she muttered
Welldont
Next time a week on the Island



Did you hear
Yes
Dont turn me against you
Id hate to have to make an awful example of you
I must drink she repeated in the same stolid way
He abruptly but without shock lifted her to a sitting position
His arm held her body up her head was thrown back and her face was looking calmly at him
She realized that he had been drinkingdrinking hard
Her eyes met his terrible eyes without flinching
He kissed her full upon the lips
With her open palm she struck him across the cheek bringing the red fierily to its smooth fair surface
The devil leaped into his eyes the devil of cruelty and lust
He smiled softly and wickedly
I see youve forgotten the lesson I gave you three months ago
Youve got to be taught to be afraid all over again
I am not afraid said she
I was not afraid
You cant make me afraid
Well see murmured he
And his fingers began to caress her round smooth throat
If you ever strike me again she said quietly Ill kill you
His eyes flinched for an instantlong enough to let her know his innermost secret
I want youI want youdamn you he said between his clinched teeth
Youre the first one I couldnt get
Theres something in you I cant get
Thats me she replied
You hate me dont you
No
Then you love me
No
I care nothing about you
He let her drop back to the bed went to the window stood looking out moodily
After a while he said without turning My mother kept a book shopon the lower East Side
She brought me up at home
At home
And he laughed sardonically
She hated me because I looked like my father
Silence then he spoke again Youve never been to my flat
Ive got a swell place
I want to cut out this part of the game
I can get along without it
Youre going to move in with me and stop this street business
I make good money
You can have everything you want
I prefer to keep on as I am
Whats the difference
Arent you mine whenever I want you
I prefer to be free
Free Why youre not free
Cant I send you to the Island any time I feel like itjust as I can the other girls
Yesyou can do that
But Im free all the same
No more than the other girls
Yes
What do you mean
Unless you understand I couldnt make you see it she said
She was sitting on the edge of the bed doing up her hair which had partly fallen down
I think you do understand
What in the hell do you want anyhow
he demanded
If I knewdo you suppose Id be here
He watched her with baffled longing eyes
What is it he muttered thats so damn peculiar about you
It was the question every shrewd observant person who saw her put to himself in one way or another and there was excellent reason why this should have been
Life has a certain set of moldslawyer financier gambler preacher fashionable woman prostitute domestic woman laborer clerk and so on through a not extensive list of familiar types with which we all soon become acquainted
And to one or another of these patterns life fits each of us as we grow up
Not one in ten thousand glances into human faces is arrested because it has lit upon a personality that cannot be immediately located measured accounted for
The reason for this sterility of variety which soon makes the world rather monotonous to the seeing eye is that few of us are born with any considerable amount of personality and what little we have is speedily suppressed by a system of training which is throughout based upon an abhorrence of originality
We obey the law of natureand nature so abhors variety that whenever a variation from a type happens she tries to kill it and that failing reproduces it a myriad times to make it a type
When an original man or woman appears and all the strenuous effort to suppress him or her fails straightway spring up a thousand imitators and copiers and the individuality is lost in the school the fashion the craze
We have not the courage to be ourselves even where there is anything in us that might be developed into something distinctive enough to win us the rank of real identity
Individualitydistinctionwhere it does exist almost never shows until experience brings it outjust as up to a certain stage the embryo of any animal is like that of every other animal though there is latent in it the most positive assertion of race and sex of family type and so on
Susan had from childhood possessed certain qualities of physical beauty of spiritedness of facility in mind and bodythe not uncommon characteristic of the child that is the flower of passionate love
But now there was beginning to show in her a radical difference from the rest of the crowd pouring through the streets of the city
It made the quicker observers in the passing throng turn the head for a second and wondering glance
Most of them assumed they had been stirred by her superiority of face and figure
But striking faces and figures of the various comely types are frequent in the streets of New York and of several other American cities
The truth was that they were interested by her expressionan elusive expression telling of a soul that was being moved to its depths by experience which usually finds and molds mere passive material
This expression was as evident in her mouth as in her eyes in her profile as in her full face
And as she sat there on the edge of the bed twisting up her thick dark hair it was this expression that disconcerted Freddie Palmer for the first time in all his contemptuous dealings with the female sex
In his eyes was a ferocious desire to seize her and again try to conquer and to possess
She had become almost unconscious of his presence
He startled her by suddenly crying Oh you go to hell
and flinging from the room crashing the door shut behind him
Maud had grown tired of the haberdashers clerk and his presumptions upon her frank fondness which he wholly misunderstood
She had dropped him for a rough looking waitersinger in a basement drinking place
He was beating her and taking all the money she had for herself and was spending it on another woman much older than Maud and homelyand Maud knew and complained of him bitterly to everyone but himself
She was no longer hanging round Susan persistently having been discouraged by the failure of her attempts at intimacy with a girl who spent nearly all her spare time at reading or at plays and concerts
Maud was now chumming with a woman who preyed upon the patrons of a big Broadway hotelshe picked them up near the entrance robbed them and when they asked the hotel detectives to help them get back their stolen money the detectives who divided with her frightened them off by saying she was a mulatto and would compel them to make a public appearance against her in open court
This woman older and harder than most of the girls though of quiet and refined appearance and manner was rapidly dragging Maud down
Also Mauds looks were going because she ate irregularly all kinds of trash and late every night ate herself full to bursting and drank herself drunk to stupefaction
Susans first horror of the men she metmen of all classeswas rapidly modified into an inconsistent therefore characteristically human mingling of horror and tolerance
Nobody nothing was either good or bad but all veered like weathercocks in the shifting wind
She decided that people were steadily good only where their lot happened to be cast in a place in which the good wind held steadily and that those who were usually bad simply had the misfortune to have to live where the prevailing winds were bad
For instance there was the handsome well educated well mannered young prizefighter Ned Ballou who was Estelles friend
Ballou big and gentle and as incapable of bad humor as of constancy or of honesty about money matters fought under the name of Joe Geary and was known as Upper Cut Joe because usually in the third round never later than the fifth he gave the knockout to his opponent by a cruelly swift and savage uppercut
He had educated himself marvelously well
But he had been brought up among thieves and had by some curious freak never learned to know what a moral sense was which is oneand a not unattractivestep deeper down than those who know what a moral sense is but never use it
At supper in Gaffneys he related to Susan and Estelle how he had won his greatest victorythe victory of Terry the Cyclone that had lifted him up into the class of secure moneymakers
He told how he always tried to rattle his opponent by talking to him by pouring out in an undertone a stream of gibes jeers insults
The afternoon of the fight Terrys firstborn had died but the money for the funeral expenses and to save the wife from the horrors and dangers of the free wards had to be earned
Joe Geary knew that he must win this fight or drop into the working or the criminal class
Terry was a hard one so circumstances compelled those desperate measures which great men from financiers and generals down to prizefighters do not shrink from else they would not be great but small
As soon as he was facing Terry in the ringJoe so he related with pride in his clevernessbegan to guyWell you Irish fakeso the kids deadeh
Who was its pa saythe dirty little bastardor does the wife know which one it was and so on
And Terry insane with grief and fury fought wildand Joe became a champion
As she listened Susan grew cold with horror and with hate
Estelle said Tell the rest of it Joe
Oh that was nothing replied he
When he strolled away to talk with some friends Estelle told the rest that was nothing
The championship secure Joe had paid all Terrys bills had supported Terry and his wife for a year had relapsed into old habits and pulled off a job of safecracking because the prizefighting happening to pay poorly he would have had a default on the payments for a month or so
He was caught did a year on the Island before his pull could get him out
And all the time he was in the pen he so arranged it with his friends that the invalid Terry and his invalid wife did not suffer
And all this he had done not because he had a sense of owing Terry but because he was of the set in which it is the custom to help anybody who happens to need it and aid begun becomes an obligation to see it through
It was an extreme case of the moral chaos about herthe chaos she had begun to discover when she caught her aunt and Ruth conspiring to take Sam away from her
What a world
If only these shifting usually evil winds of circumstance could be made to blow good
A few evenings after the arrest Maud came for Susan persuaded her to go out
They dined at about the only good restaurant where unescorted women were served after nightfall
Afterward they went on duty
It was fine overhead and the air was cold and bracingone of those marvelous New York winter nights which have the tonic of both sea and mountains and an exhilaration in addition from the intense brightburning life of the mighty city
For more than a week there had been a steady downpour of snow sleet and finally rain
Thus the women of the streets had been doing almost no business
There was not much money in sitting in drinking halls and the back rooms of saloons and picking up occasional men the best trade was the men who would not venture to show themselves in such frankly disreputable places but picked out women in the crowded streets and followed them to quiet dark places to make the arrangementsmen stimulated by good dinners or later on in the evening those who left parties of elegant respectability after theater or opera
On this first night of business weather in nearly two weeks the streets were crowded with women and girls
They were desperately hard up and they made open dashes for every man they could get at
All classes were made equally boldthe shop and factory and office and theater girls with wages too small for what they regarded as a decent living the women with young children to support and educate the protected professional regulars the miserable creatures who had to get along as best they could without protection and were prey to every blackmailing officer of an antivice society and to every policeman and flycop not above levying upon women who were too low to be allowed to live anyhow
Out from all kinds of shelters swarmed the women who were demonstrating how prostitution flourishes and tends to spread to every class of society whenever education develops tastes beyond the earning power of their possessors
And with clothes and food to buy rent to pay dependents to support these women so many days hampered in the one way that was open to them to get money made the most piteous appeals to the men
Not tearful appeals not appeals to sympathy or even to charity but to passion
They sought in every way to excite
They exhibited their carefully gottenup legs they made indecent gestures they said the vilest things they offered the vilest inducements they lowered their prices down and down
And such men as did not order them off with disdain listened with laughter made jokes at which the wretched creatures laughed as gayly as if they were not mad with anxiety and were not hating these men who were holding on to that which they must have to live
Too many out tonight said Maud as they walked their beatFortysecond between Broadway and Eighth Avenue
I knew it would be this way
Lets go in here and get warm
They went into the back room of a saloon where perhaps half a dozen women were already seated some of them gray with the cold against which their thin showy garments were no protection
Susan and Maud sat at a table in a corner Maud broke her rule and drank whiskey with Susan
After they had taken perhaps half a dozen drinks Maud grew really confidential
She always even in her soberest moments seemed to be telling everything she knew but Susan had learned that there were in her many deep secrets some of which not even liquor could unlock
Im going to tell you something she now said to Susan
You must promise not to give me away
Dont tell me replied Susan
She was used to being flatteredor victimized according to the point of viewwith confidences
She assumed Maud was about to confess some secret about her own self as she had the almost universal habit of never thinking of anyone else
Dont tell me said she
Im tired of being used to air awful secrets
It makes me feel like a tenement wash line
This is about you said Maud
If its ever found out that I put you wise Jimll have me killed
Yeskilled
Susan reckless by this time laughed
Oh trash
she said
No trash at all insisted Maud
When you know this town through and through youll know that murders something that can be arranged as easy as buying a drink
What risk is there in making one of us disappear
None in the world
I always feel that Jimll have me killed some dayunless I go crazy sometime and kill him
Hes stuck on meor at least hes jealous of meand if he ever found out I had a loversomebodyanybody that didnt paywhy itd be all up with me
Little Maud would go on the grill
She ordered and slowly drank another whiskey before she recalled what she had set out to confide
By way of a fresh start she said What do you think of Freddie
I dont know replied Susan
And it was the truth
Her instinctive belief in a modified kind of fatalism made her judgments of peopleeven of those who caused her to suffersingularly free from personal bitterness
Freddie a mere instrument of destiny had his good side his human side she knew
At his worst he was no worse than the others And aside from his queer magnetism there was a certain force in him that compelled her admiration at least he was not one of the petty instruments of destiny
He had in him the same quality she felt gestating within herself
I dont know what to think she repeated
Maud had been reflecting while Susan was casting about as she had many a time before for her real opinion of her master who was in turn the slave of Finnegan who was in his turn the slave of somebody higher up she didnt exactly know whoor whyor the why of any of itor the why of the grotesque savage purposeless doings of destiny in general
Maud now burst out I dont care
Im going to put you wise if I die for it
Dont said Susan
I dont want to know
But Ive got to tell you
Do you know what Freddies going to do
Susan smiled disdainfully
I dont care
You mustnt tell mewhen youve been drinking this way  Finnegans police judge is a man named Bennett
As soon as Bennett comes back to Jefferson Market Police Court Freddies going to have you sent up for three months
Susans glass was on the way to her lips
She set it down again
The drunken old wreck of an entertainer at the piano in the corner was bellowing out his favorite songI Am the King of the Vikings
Susan began to hum the air
Its gospel cried Maud thinking Susan did not believe her
Hes a queer one is Freddie
Theyre all afraid of him
Youd think he was a coward the way he bullies women and that
But somehow he aintnot a bit
Hell be a big man in the organization some day they all say
He never lets up till he gets square
And he thinks youre not squareafter all hes done for you
Perhaps notas he looks at it said Susan
And Jim says hes crazy in love with you and that he wants to put you where other men cant see you and where maybe he can get over caring about you
Thats the real reason
Hes a queer devil
But then all men are though none quite like Freddie
So Im to go to the Island for three months said Susan reflectively
You dont seem to care
Its plain you never was there



And youve got to go
Theres no way out of itunless you skip to another city
And if you did you never could come back here
Freddied see that you got yours as soon as you landed
Susan sat looking at her glass
Maud watched her in astonishment
Youre as queer as Freddie said she at length
I never feel as if I was acquainted with younot really
I never had a lady friend like that before
You dont seem to be a bit excited about what Freddies going to do
Are you in love with him
Susan lifted strange smiling eyes to Mauds curious gaze
Iin lovewith a man she said slowly
And then she laughed
Dont laugh that way cried Maud
It gives me the creeps
What are you going to do
What can I do
Nothing
Then if theres nothing to do Ill no nothing
Go to the Island for three months
Susan shrugged her shoulders
I havent gone yet
She rose
Its too stuffy and smelly in here said she
Lets move out
No
Ill wait
I promised to meet a gentleman friend here
Youll not tell that I tipped you off
Youd not have told me if you hadnt known I wouldnt
Thats so
Butwhy dont you make it up with Freddie
I couldnt do that
Hes dead in love
Im sure you could
Again Susans eyes became strange
Im sure I couldnt
Good night
She got as far as the door came back
Thank you for telling me
Oh thats all right murmured the girl
She was embarrassed by Susans manner
She was frightened by Susans eyes
You aint going to There she halted
What
To jump off
Kill yourself
Hardly said Susan
Ive got a lot to do before I die
She went directly home
Palmer was lying on the bed a cigarette between his lips a newspaper under his feet to prevent his boots from spoiling the spreadone of the many small indications of the prudence thrift and calculation that underlay the almost insane recklessness of his surface character and that would save him from living as the fool lives and dying as the fool dies
I thought you wouldnt slop round in these streets long said he as she paused upon the threshold
So I waited
She went to the bureau unlocked the top drawer took the tendollar bill she had under some undershirts there put it in her right stocking where there were already a five and a two
She locked the drawer tossed the key into an open box of hairpins
She moved toward the door
Where are you going
asked he still staring at the ceiling
Out
Ive made almost nothing this week
Sit down
I want to talk to you
She hesitated seated herself on a chair near the bed
He frowned at her
Youve been drinking
Yes
Ive been drinking myself but Ive got a nose like a hunting dog
What do you do it for
Whats the use of explaining
Youd not understand
Perhaps I would
Im onefourth Italianand they understand everything



Youre fond of reading arent you
It passes the time
While I was waiting for you I glanced at your new booksEmersonDickensZola
He was looking toward the row of paper backs that filled almost the whole length of the mantel
I must read them
I always like your books
You spend nearly as much time reading as I doand you dont need it for youve got a good education
What do you read for
To amuse yourself
No
To get away from yourself
No
Then why
persisted he
To find out about myself
He thought a moment turned his face toward her
You are clever
he said admiringly
Whats your game
My game
What are you aiming for
Youve got too much sense not to be aiming for something
She looked at him the expression that marked her as a person peculiar and apart was glowing in her eyes like a bed of redhot coals covered with ashes
What
he repeated
To get strong replied she
Women are born weak and bred weaker
Ive got to get over being a woman
For there isnt any place in this world for a woman except under the shelter of some man
And I dont want that
The underlying strength of her features abruptly came into view
And I wont have it she added
He laughed
But the menll never let you be anything but a woman
Well see said she smiling
The strong look had vanished into the soft contour of her beautiful youth
Personally I like you better when youve been drinking he went on
Youre sad when youre sober
As you drink you liven up
When I get over being sad if Im sober when I learn to take things as they come just like a mana strong man then Ill be She stopped
Be what
Ready
Ready for what
How do I know
He swung himself to a sitting position
Meanwhile youre coming to live with me
Ive been fighting against it but I give up
I need you
Youre the one Ive been looking for
Pack your traps
Ill call a cab and well go over to my flat
Then well go to Rectors and celebrate
She shook her head
Im sorry but I cant
Why not
I told you
Theres something in me that wont let me
He rose walked to her very deliberately
He took one of her hands from her lap drew her to her feet put his hands strongly on her shoulders
You belong to me he said his lips smiling charmingly but the devil in the gleam of his eyes and in the glistening of his beautiful cruel teeth
Pack up
You know that I wont
He slowly crushed her in his arms slowly pressed his lips upon hers
A low scream issued from her lips and she seized him by the throat with both hands one hand over the other and thrust him backward
He reeled fell upon his back on the bed she fell with him clung to himlike a bull dognot as if she would not but as if she could not let go
He clutched at her fingers failing to dislodge them he tried to thrust his thumbs into her eyes
But she seized his right thumb between her teeth and bit into it until they almost met
And at the same time her knees ground into his abdomen
He choked gurgled grew dark red then gray then a faint blackish blue lay limp under her
But she did not relax until the blue of his face had deepened to black and his eyes began to bulge from their sockets
At those signs that he was beyond doubt unconscious she cautiously relaxed her fingers
She unclenched her teeth his arm which had been held up by the thumb she was biting dropped heavily
She stood over him her eyes blazing insanely at him
She snatched out her hatpin flung his coat and waistcoat from over his chest felt for his heart
With the murderous eight inches of that slender steel poniard poised for the drive she began to sob flung the weapon away took his face between her hands and kissed him
You fiend
You fiend
she sobbed
She changed to her plainest dress
Leaving the bloodstained blouse on the bed beside him where she had flung it down after tearing it off she turned out the light darted down stairs and into the street
At Times Square she took the Subway for the Bowery
To change ones world one need not travel far in New York the ocean is not so wide as is the gap between the Tenderloin and the lower East Side
VIII SHE had thought of escape daily hourly almost for nearly five months
She had advanced not an inch toward it but she never for an instant lost hope
She believed in her destiny felt with all the strength of her health and vitality that she had not yet found her place in the world that she would find it and that it would be high
Nowshe was compelled to escape and this with only seventeen dollars and in the little time that would elapse before Palmer returned to consciousness and started in pursuit bent upon cruel and complete revenge
She changed to an express train at the Grand Central Subway station left the express on impulse at Fourteenth Street took a local to Astor Place there ascended to the street
She was far indeed from the Tenderloin in a region not visited by the people she knew
As for Freddie he never went below Fourtenth Street hated the lower East Side avoided anyone from that region of his early days now shrouded in a mystery that would not be dispelled with his consent
Freddie would not think of searching for her there and soon he would believe she was deaddrowned and at the bottom of river or bay
As she stepped from the exit of the underground she saw in the square before her under the Sunset Cox statue a Salvation Army corps holding a meeting
She heard a cry from the center of the crowd The wages of sin is death
She drifted into the fringe of the crowd and glanced at the little group of exhorters and musicians
The woman who was preaching had taken the life of the streets as her text
Well fed and well clad and certain of a clean room to sleep incertain of a good living she was painting the moral horrors of the street life
The wages of sin is death
she shouted
She caught Susans eye saw the cynicalbitter smile round her lips
For Susan had the feeling that unsuspected by the upper classes animates the masses as to clergy and charity workers of all kindsmuch the same feeling one would have toward the robbers messenger who came bringing from his master as a loving gift some worthless trifle from the stolen goods
Not from clergy not from charity worker not from the life of the poor as they take what is given them with hypocritical cringe and tear of thanks will the upper classes get the truth as to what is thought of them by the masses in this day of awakening intelligence and slow heaving of crusts so long firm that they have come to be regarded as bedrock of social foundation
Cried the woman in response to Susans satirical look You mock at that my lovely young sister
Your lips are painted and they sneer
But you know Im rightyes you show in your eyes that you know it in your aching heart
The wages of sin is death Isnt that so sister
Susan shook her head
Speak the truth sister
God is watching you
The wages of sin is death The wages of weakness is death retorted Susan
Butthe wages of sinwell its sometimes a house in Fifth Avenue
And then she shrank away before the approving laughter of the little crowd and hurried across into Eighth Street
In the deep shadow of the front of Cooper Union she paused as the meaning of her own impulsive words came to her
The wages of sin
And what was sin the supreme sin but weakness
It was exactly as Burlingham had explained
He had said that whether for good or for evil really to live one must be strong
Strong
What a good teacher he had beenone of the rare kind that not only said things interestingly but also said them so that you never forgot
How badly she had learned
She strolled on through Eighth Street across Third Avenue and into Second Avenue
It was ten oclock
The effects of the liquor she had drunk had worn away
In so much wandering she had acquired the habit of closing up an episode of life as a traveler puts behind him the railway journey at its end
She was less than half an hour from her life in the Tenderloin it was as completely in her past as it would ever be
The cards had once more been shuffled a new deal was on
A new deal
What
To fly to another citythat meant another Palmer or the miseries of the unprotected woman of the streets or slavery to the madman of what the French with cruel irony call a maison de joie
To return to work What was open to her educated as the comfortable classes educate their women
Work meant the tenements
She loathed the fast life but not as she loathed vermininfected tenements
To toil all day at a monotonous task the same task every day and all day long
To sleep at night with Tucker and the vermin
To her notion the sights and sounds and smells and personal contacts of the tenements were no less vicious werefor her at leastfar more degrading than anything in the Tenderloin and its like
And there she got money to buy whiskey that whirled her almost endurably sometimes even gayly over the worst thingsmoney to buy hours whole days of respite that could be spent in books in dreams and plannings in the freedom of a clean and comfortable room or at the theater or concert
There were degrees in horror she was paying a hateful price but not so hateful as she had paid when she worked
The wages of shame were not so hard earned as the wages of toil were larger brought her many of the things she craved
The wages of toil brought her nothing but the right to bare existence in filth and depravity and darkness
Also she felt that if she were tied down to some dull and exhausting employment she would be settled and done for
In a few years she would be an old woman with less wages or flung out diseased or maimedto live on and on like hundreds of wretched old creatures adrift everywhere in the tenement streets
No work had nothing to offer her except respectability
And what a mocking was respectability in rags and filth
Besides what had she the outcast born to do with this respectability
Nonot worknever again
So long as she was roving about there was hope and chance somehow to break through into the triumphant class that ruled the world that did the things worth whilewore the good clothes lived in the good houses ate the good food basked in the sunshine of art
Either she would soar above respectability or she would remain beneath it
Respectability might be an excellent thing surely there must be some merit in a thing about which there was so much talk after which there was so much hankering and to which there was such desperate clinging
But as a sole possession as a sole ambition it seemed thin and poor and even pitiful
She had emancipated herself from its tyranny she would not resume the yoke
Among so many lacks of the good things of life its good would not be missed
Perhaps when she had got a few other of the good things she might try to add it to themor might find herself able to get comfortably along without it as had George Eliot and Aspasia George Sand and Duse and Bernhardt and so many of the worlds company of selfelected women members of the triumphant class
A new deal
And a new deal meant at least even chance for good luck
As she drifted down the west side of Second Avenue her thoughts so absorbed her that she was oblivious of the slushy sidewalk even of the crossings where one had to pick ones way as through a shallow creek with stepping stones here and there
There were many women alone as in every other avenue and every frequented cross street throughout the citywomen made eager to desperation by the long stretch of impossible weather
Every passing man was hailed sometimes boldly sometimes softly
Again and again that grotesque phrase Lets go have a good time fell upon the ears
After several blocks when her absentmindedness had got her legs wet to the knees in the shallow shiny slush she was roused by the sound of musican orchestra playing and playing well a lively Hungarian dance
She was standing before the winter garden from which the sounds came
As she opened the door she was greeted by a rush of warm air pleasantly scented with fresh tobacco smoke the odors of spiced drinks and of food pastry predominating
Some of the tables were covered ready for those who would wish to eat but many of them were for the drinkers
The large lowceilinged room was comfortably filled
There were but a few women and they seemed to be wives or sweethearts
Susan was about to retreat when a waiterone of those Austrians whose heads end abruptly an inch or so above the eyebrows and whose chins soon shade off into neckadvanced smilingly with a polite We serve ladies without escorts
She chose a table that had several other vacant tables round it
On the recommendation of the waiter she ordered a burning devil he assured her she would find it delicious and the very thing for a cold slushy night
At the far end of the room on a low platform sat the orchestra
A man in an evening suit many sizes too large for him sang in a strong not disagreeable tenor a German song that drew loud applause at the end of each stanza
The burning devil camean almost black mixture in a large heavy glass
The waiter touched a match to it and it was at once wreathed in pale flickering flames that hovered like butterflies now rising as if to float away now lightly descending to flit over the surface of the liquid or to dance along the edge of the glass
What shall I do with it
said Susan
Wait till it goes out said the waiter
Then drink as you would anything else
And he was off to attend to the wants of a group of card players a few feet away
Susan touched her finger to the glass when the flame suddenly vanished
She found it was not too hot to drink touched her lips to it
The taste sweetish suggestive of coffee and of brandy and of burnt sugar was agreeable
She slowly sipped it delighting in the sensation of warmth of comfort of well being that speedily diffused through her
The waiter came to receive her thanks for his advice
She said to him Do you have women sing too
Oh yeswhen we can find a goodlooker with a voice
Our customers know music
I wonder if I could get a trial
The waiter was interested at once
Perhaps
You sing
I have sung on the stage
Ill ask the boss
He went to the counter near the door where stood a short thickset Jew of the East European snubnosed type in earnest conversation with a seated blonde woman
She showed that skill at clinging to youth which among the lower middle and lower classes pretty clearly indicates at least some experience at the fast life
For only in the upper and upper middle class does a respectable woman venture thus to advertise so suspicious a guest within as a desire to be agreeable in the sight of men
Susan watched the waiter as he spoke to the proprietor saw the proprietors impatient shake of the head sent out a wave of gratitude from her heart when her waiter friend persisted compelled the proprietor to look toward her
She affected an air of unconsciousness in fact she was posing as if before a camera
Her heart leaped when out of the corner of her eye she saw the proprietor coming with the waiter
The two paused at her table and the proprietor said in a sharp impatient voice Well ladywhat is it
I want a trial as a singer
The proprietor was scanning her features and her figure which was well displayed by the tightfitting jacket
The result seemed satisfactory for in a voice oily with the softening influence of feminine charm upon male he said Youve had experience
Yesa lot of it
But I havent sung in about two years
Sing German
Only ballads in English
But I can learn anything
Englishll doif you can sing
What costume do you wear
And the proprietor seated himself and motioned the waiter away
I have no costume
As I told you Ive not been singing lately
Weve got one that might fita short blue silk skirtlow neck and blue stockings
Slippers too but they might be tightI forget the number
I did wear threes
But Ive done a great deal of walking
I wear a five now
Susan thrust out a foot and ankle for she knew that despite the overshoe they were good to look at
The proprietor nodded approvingly and there was the note of personal interest in his voice as he said They can try your voice tomorrow morning
Come at ten oclock
If you decide to try me what pay will I get
The proprietor smiled slyly
Oh we dont pay anything to the singers
That man who sanghe gets his board here
He works in a factory as a bookkeeper in the daytime
Lots of theatrical and musical people come here
If a man or a girl can do any stunt worth while theres a chance
Id have to have something more than board said Susan
The proprietor frowned down at his stubby fingers whose black and cracked nails were drumming on the table
WellI might give you a bed
Theres a place I could put one in my daughters room
She sings and dances over at Louis Blancs garden in Third Avenue
Yes I could put you there
Butno privileges you understand
Certainly



Ill decide tomorrow
Maybe youll not want me
Oh yesif you can sing at all
Your looksd please my customers
Seeing the dubious expression in Susans face he went on When I say no privilege I mean only about the room
Of course its none of my business what you do outside
Lots of well fixed gents comes here
My girls have all had good luck
Ive been open two years and in that time one of my singers got an elegant delicatessen owner to keep her
Really said Susan in the tone that was plainly expected of her
Yesan elegant gentleman
Id not be surprised if he married her
And another married an electrician that cops out forty a week
Youll find it a splendid chance to make nice friendsgood spenders
And Im a practical man
I suppose there isnt any work I could do in the daytime
Not here
Perhaps Not nowhere so far as I know
That is work youd care to do
The factories and stores is hard on a woman and she dont get much
And besides they aint very classy to my notion
Of course if a woman aint got looks or sense or any tone to her if shes satisfied to live in a bum tenement and marry some dub that cant make nothing why thats different
But you look like a woman that had been used to something and wanted to get somewhere
I wouldnt have let my daughter go into no such low foolish life
She had intended to ask about a place to stop for the night
She now decided that the suggestion that she was homeless might possibly impair her chances
After some further conversationthe proprietor repeating what he had already said and repeating it in about the same languageshe paid the waiter fifteen cents for the drink and a tip of five cents out of the change she had in her purse and departed
It had clouded over and a misty dismal rain was trickling through the saturated air to add to the messiness of the churn of cold slush
Susan went on down Second Avenue
On a corner near its lower end she saw a Raines Law hotel with awnings indicating that it was not merely a blind to give a saloon a hotel license but was actually open for business
She went into the family entrance of the saloon was alone in a small clean sittingroom with a sliding window between it and the bar
A tough but not unpleasant young face appeared at the window
It was the bartender
Evening cutie said he
Whatll you have
Some rye whiskey replied Susan
May I smoke a cigarette here
Sure go as far as you like
Tencent whiskeyor fifteen
Fifteenunless its out of the same bottle as the ten
Call it tenseeing as you are a lady
Ive got a soft heart for you ladies
Ive got a wife in the business myself
When he came in at the door with the drink a young man followed hima goodlooking darkish youth well dressed in a ready made suit of the best sort
At second glance Susan saw that he was at least partly of Jewish blood enough to elevate his face above the rather dull type which predominates among clerks and merchants of the Christian races
He had small shifty eyes an attractive smile a manner of assurance bordering on insolence
He dropped into a chair at Susans table with a You dont mind having a drink on me
As Susan had no money to spare she acquiesced
She said to the bartender I want to get a room herea plain room
How much
Maybe this gentll help you out said the bartender with a grin and a wink
Hes got money to burnand burns it
The bartender withdrew
The young man struck a match and held it for her to light the cigarette she took from her purse
Then he lit one himself
Next time try one of mine said he
I get em of a fellow that makes for the swellest uptown houses
But I get em ten cents a package instead of forty
I havent seen you down here before
What a good skin youve got
Its been a long time since Ive seen a skin as fine as that except on a baby now and then
And that shape of yours is all right too
I suppose its the real goods
With that he leaned across the table and put his hand upon her bosom
She drew back indifferently
You dont give anything for nothingeh
laughed he
Been in the business long
It seems long
It aint what it used to be
The competitions getting to be something fierce
Looks as if all the respectable girls and most of the married women were coming out to look for a little extra money
Wellwhy not
Susan shrugged her shoulders
Why not
echoed she carelessly
She did not look forward with pleasure to being alone
The man was clean and well dressed and had an unusual amount of personal charm that softened his impertinence of manner
Evidently he has the habit of success with women
She much preferred him sitting with her to her own depressing society
So she accepted his invitation
She took one of his cigarettes and it was as good as he had said
He rattled on mingling frank coarse compliments with talk about the business from a standpoint so practical that she began to suspect he was somehow in it himself
He clearly belonged to those more intelligent children of the upper class tenement people the children who are too bright and too well educated to become working men and working women like their parents they refuse to do any kind of manual labor as it could never in the most favorable circumstances pay well enough to give them the higher comforts they crave the expensive comforts which every merchant is insistently and temptingly thrusting at a public for the most part too poor to buy so these cleverer children of the working class develop into shyster lawyers politicians sports prostitutes unless chance throws into their way some respectable means of getting money
Vaguely she wonderedwithout caring to question or guess what particular form of activity this young man had taken in avoiding monotonous work at small pay
After her second drink came she found that she did not want it
She felt tired and sleepy and wished to get her wet stockings off and to dry her skirt which for all her careful holding up had not escaped the fate of whatever was exposed to that abominable night
Im going along with you said the young man as she rose
Heres to our better acquaintance
Thanks but I want to be alone replied she affably
And not to seem unappreciative of his courtesy she took a small drink from her glass
It tasted very queer
She glanced suspiciously at the young man
Her legs grew suddenly and strangely heavy
her heart began to beat violently and a black fog seemed to be closing in upon her eyes
Through it she saw the youth grinning sardonically
And instantly she knew
What a fool I am
she thought
She had been trapped by another form of the slave system
This man was a recruiting sergeant for houses of prostitutionwas one of the cadets
They search the tenement districts for goodlooking girls and young women
They hang about the street corners flirting
They attend the balls where go the young people of the lower middle class and upper lower class
They learn to make love seductively they understand how to tempt a girls longing for finery for an easier life her dream of a husband above her class in looks and in earning power
And for each recruit broken in and hardened to the point of willingness to go into a sporting house they get from the proprietor ten to twentyfive dollars according to her youth and beauty
Susan knew all about the system had heard stories of it from the lips of girls who had been embarked through itembarked a little sooner than they would have embarked under the lash of want or of that other and almost equally compelling brute desire for the comforts and luxuries that mean decent living
Susan knew yet here she was because of an unguarded moment and because of a sense of security through experiencehere she was succumbing to knockout drops as easily as the most innocent child lured away from its mothers door to get a saucer of ice cream
She tried to rise to scream though she knew any such effort was futile
With a gasp and a sigh her head fell forward and she was unconscious
She awakened in a small rather dingy room
She was lying on her back with only stockings on
Beyond the foot of the bed was a little bureau at which a man back full to her stood in trousers and shirt sleeves tying his necktie
She saw that he was a rough looking man coarsely dressedan artisan or small shopkeeper
Used as she was to the profound indifference of men of all classes and degrees of education and intelligence to what the woman thoughtused as she was to this sensual selfishness which men at least in part conceal from their respectable wives Susan felt a horror of this man who had not minded her unconsciousness
Her head was aching so fiercely that she had not the courage to move
Presently the man turned toward her a kindly bearded face
But she was used to the man of general good character who with little shame and no hesitation became beast before her the free woman
Hello pretty
cried he genially
Slept off your jag have you
He was putting on his coat and waistcoat
He took from the waistcoat pocket a dollar bill
Youre a peach said he
Ill come again next time my old lady goes off guard
He made the bill into a pellet dropped it on her breast
A little present for you
Put it in your stocking and dont let the madam grab it
With a groan Susan lifted herself to a sitting position drew the spread about hera gesture of instinct rather than of conscious modesty
They drugged me and brought me here said she
I want you to help me get out
Good Lord
cried the man instantly all aquiver with nervousness
Im a married man
I dont want to get mixed up in this
And out of the room he bolted closing the door behind him
Susan smiled at herself satirically
After all her experience to make this silly appealshe who knew men
I must be getting feebleminded thought she
Then Her clothes
With a glance she swept the little room
No closet
Her own clothes gone
On the chair beside the bed a fasthouse parlor dress of pink cotton silk and a kind of abbreviated chemise
The stockings on her legs were not her own but were of pink cotton silk finished
A pair of pink satin slippers stood on the floor beside the two galvanized iron wash basins
The door opened and a burly man dressed in cheap readymade clothes but with an air of authority and prosperity was smiling at her
The madam told me to walk right in and make myself at home said he
Yes youre up to her account of you
Only she said you were dead drunk and would probably be asleep
Now honey you treat me right and Ill treat you right
Get out of here
cried Susan
Im going to leave this house
They drugged me and brought me here
Oh come now
Ive got nothing to do with your quarrels with the landlady
Cut those fairy tales out
You treat me right and A few minutes later in came the madam
Susan exhausted sick lay inert in the middle of the bed
She fixed her gaze upon the eyes looking through the hideous mask of paint and powder partially concealing the madams face
Well are you going to be a good girl now
said the madam
I want to sleep said Susan
All right my dear
She saw and snatched the fivedollar bill from the pillow
Itll go toward paying your board and for the parlor dress
God but you was drunk when they brought you up from the bar
When was that
asked Susan
About midnight
Its nearly four now
Weve shut the house for the night
Youre in a firstrate house my dear and if you behave yourself youll make moneya lot more than you ever could at a dive like Zeists
If you dont behave well well teach you how
This building belongs to one of the big men in politics and he looks after my interestsand he ought to considering the rent I payfive hundred a monthfor the three upper floors
The bars let separate
Would you like a nice drink
No said Susan
Trapped
Hopelessly trapped
And she would never escape until diseased her looks gone ruined in body and soul she was cast out into the hospital and the gutter
As I was saying ventured the madam you might as well settle down quietly
Im very well satisfied said Susan
I suppose youll give me a square deal on what I make
She laughed quietly as if secretly amused at something
In fact I know you will she added in a tone of amused confidence
As soon as youve paid up your twentyfive a week for room and board and the fifty for the parlor dress Susan interrupted her with a laugh
Oh come off said she
Ill not stand for that
Ill go back to Jim Finnegan
The old womans eyes pounced for her face instantly
Do you know Finnegan
Im his girl said Susan carelessly
She stretched herself and yawned
I got mad at him and started out for some fun
Hes a regular damn fool about me
But Im sick of him
Anything but a jealous man
And spied on everywhere I go
How much can I make here
Aint you from Zeists
demanded the madam
Her voice was quivering with fright
She did not dare believe the girl she did not dare disbelieve her
Zeists
Whats that
said Susan indifferently
The joint two blocks down
Hasnt Joe Bishop had you in there for a couple of months
Susan yawned
Lord how my head does ache
Whos Joe Bishop
Im dead to the world
I must have had an awful jag
She turned on her side drew the spread over her
I want to sleep
So long
Didnt you run away from home with Joe Bishop
demanded the madam shrilly
And didnt he put you to work for Zeist
Whos Joe Bishop
Wheres Zeists
Susan said cross and yawning
Ive been with Jim about a year
He took me off the street
I was broke in five years ago
The madam gave a kind of howl
And that Joe Bishop got twentyfive off me
she screamed
And youre Finnegans girl and hell make trouble for me
Hes got a nasty streak in him said Susan drowsily
He put me on the Island once for a little side trip I made
She laughed yawned
But he sent and got me out in two daysand gave me a present of a hundred
Its funny how a manll make a fool of himself about a woman
Put out the light
No I wont put out the light shrieked the madam
You cant work here
Im going to telephone Jim Finnegan to come and get you
Susan started up angrily as if she were halfcrazed by drink
If you do you old hag she cried Ill tell him you doped me and set these men on me
Ill tell him about Joe Bishop
And Jimll send the whole bunch of you to the pen
Ill not go back to him till I get good and ready
And that means I wont go back at all no matter what he offers me
She began to cry in a maudlin way
I hate him
Im tired of living as if I was back in the convent
The madam stood heaving to and fro and blowing like a chained elephant
I dont know what to do she whined
I wish Joe Bishop was in hell
Im going to get out of here shrieked Susan raving and blazing again and waving her arms
You dont know a good thing when you get it
What kind of a bumjoint is this anyway
Wheres my clothes
They must be dry by this time
Yesyestheyre dry my dear whined the madam
Ill bring em to you
And out she waddled returning in a moment with her arms full of the clothing
She found Susan in the bed and nestling comfortably into the pillows
Here are your clothes she cried
NoI want to sleep was Susans answer in a cross drowsy tone
I think Ill stay
You wont telephone Jim
But when he finds me Ill tell him to go to the devil
For Gods sake
wailed the madam
I cant let you work here
You dont want to ruin me do you
Susan sat up rubbed her eyes yawned brushed her hair back put a sly smiling look into her face
How muchll you give me to go
she asked
Wheres the fifteen that was in my stocking
Ive got it for you said the madam
How much did I make tonight
There was three at five apiece
Threenot only the two but a third while she lay in a dead stupor
Susan shivered
Your shares four dollars continued the madam
Is that all
cried Susan jeering
A bum joint
Oh theres my five the man gave me as a present
Yesyes quavered the madam
And another man gave me a dollar
She looked round
Where the devil is it
She found it in a fold of the spread
Then you owe me twenty altogether counting the money I had on me
She yawned
I dont want to go
she protested pausing halfway in taking off the second pink stocking
Then she laughed
Lord what hell Jim will raise if he finds I spent the night working in this house
Why is it that as soon as men begin to care for a woman they get prim about her
Do get dressed dear wheedled the madam
I dont see why I should go at this time of night objected Susan pettishly
Whatll you give me if I go
The madam uttered a groan
You say you paid Joe Bishop twentyfive Ill kill him
shrieked the madam
Hes ruined meruined me
Oh hes all right said Susan cheerfully
I like him
Hes a pretty little fellow
Ill not give him away to Jim
Joe was dead stuck on you cried the madam eagerly
I might a knowed he hadnt seen you before
I had to pay him the twentyfive right away to get him out of the house and let me put you to work
He wanted to stay on
Susan shivered laughed to hide it
Well Ill go for twentyfive
Twentyfive
shrieked the madam
Youll get it back from Joe
Maybe I wont
Hes a doga dirty dog
I think I told Joe about Jim said Susan reflectively
I was awful gabby downstairs
YesI told him
And her lowered eyes gleamed with satisfaction when the madam cried out You did
And after that he brought you here
Hes got it in for me
But Ill ruin him
Ill tear him up
Susan dressed with the utmost deliberation the madam urging her to make haste
After some argument Susan yielded to the madams pleadings and contented herself with the twenty dollars
The madam herself escorted Susan down to the outside door and slathered her with sweetness and politeness
The rain had stopped again
Susan went up Second Avenue slowly
Two blocks from the dive from which she had escaped she sank down on a stoop and fainted
IX THE dash of cold rain drops upon her face and the chill of moisture soaking through her clothing revived her
Throughout the whole range of life whenever we resist we suffer
As Susan dragged her aching cold wet body up from that stoop it seemed to her that each time she resisted the penalty grew heavier
Could she have been more wretched had she remained in that dive
From her first rebellion that drove her out of her uncles house had she ever bettered herself by resisting
She had gone from bad to worse from worse to worst
Worst
This must be the worst
she thought
Surely there can be no lower depth than where I am now
And then she shuddered and her soul reeled
Had she not thought this at each shelf of the precipice down which she had been falling
Has it a bottom
Is there no bottom
Wet through tired through she put up her umbrella and forced herself feebly along
Where am I going
Why do I not kill myself
What is it that drives me on and on
There came no direct answer to that last question
But up from those deep vast reservoirs of vitality that seemed sufficient whatever the drain upon themup from those reservoirs welled strength and that unfaltering will to live which breathes upon the corpse of hope and quickens it
And she had a sense of an invisible being a power that had her in charge a destiny walking beside her holding up her drooping strength compelling her toward some goal hidden in the fog and the storm
At Eighth Street she turned west at Third Avenue she paused waiting for chance to direct her
Was it not like the maliciousness of fate that in the city whose rarely interrupted reign of joyous sunshine made her call it the city of the Sun her critical turn of chance should have fallen in foul weather
Evidently fate was resolved on a thorough test of her endurance
In the open square near the Peter Cooper statue stood a huge allnight lunch wagon
She moved toward it for she suddenly felt hungry
It was drawn to the curb a short flight of ladder steps led to an interior attractive to sight and smell
She halted at the foot of the steps and looked in
The only occupant was the man in charge
In a white coat he was leaning upon the counter reading a newspaper which lay flat upon it
His bent head was extensively and roughly thatched with black hair so thick that to draw a comb through it would have been all but impossible
As Susan let down her umbrella and began to ascend he lifted his head and gave her a full view of a humorous young face bushy of eyebrows and mustache and darkly stained by his beard close shaven though it was
He looked like a Spaniard or an Italian but he was a black Irishman one of the West coasters who recall in their eyes and coloring the wrecking of the Armada
Good morning lady said he
Breakfast or supper
Both replied Susan
Im starved
The air was gratefully warm in the little restaurant on wheels
The dominant odor was of hot coffee but that aroma was carried to a still higher delight by a suggestion of pastry
The best thing Ive got said the restaurant man is hot corn beef hash
Its so good I hate to let any of it go
You can have griddle cakes tooand coffee of course
Very well said Susan
She was ascending upon a wave of reaction from the events of the night
Her headache had gone
The rain beating upon the roof seemed musical to her now in this warm shelter with its certainty of the food she craved
The young man was busy at the shiny compact stove the odors of the good things she was presently to have grew stronger and stronger stimulating her hunger bringing joy to her heart and a smile to her eyes
She wondered at herself
After what she had passed through how could she feel thus happyyes positively happy
It seemed to her this was an indication of a lack in her somewhereof seriousness of sensibility of she knew not what
She ought to be ashamed of that lack
But she was not ashamed
She was shedding her troubles like a childor like a philosopher
Do you like hash
inquired the restaurant man over his shoulder
Just as youre making it said she
Dry but not too dry
Brown but not too brown
You dont think youd like a poached egg on top of it
Exactly what I want
It isnt everybody that can poach an egg said the restaurant man
And it isnt every egg that can be poached
Now my eggs are the real thing
And I can poach em so youd think they was done with one of them poaching machines
I dont have em with the yellow on a slab of white
I do it so that the whites all round the yellow like in the shell
And I keep em tender too
Did you say one egg or a pair
Two said Susan
The dishes were thick but clean and whole
The hashdry but not too dry brown but not too brownwas artistically arranged on its platter and the two eggs that adorned its top were precisely as he had promised
The coffee boiled with the milk was real coffee too
When the restaurant man had set these things before her as she sat expectant on a stool he viewed his handiwork with admiring eyes
Delmonico couldnt beat it said he
No nor Oscar neither
Thatll take the tired look out of your face lady and bring the beauty back
Susan ate slowly listening to the music of the beating rain
It was like an oasis a restful halt between two stretches of desert journey she wished to make it as long as possible
Only those who live exposed to lifes buffetings ever learn to enjoy to the full the great little pleasures of lifethe halcyon pauses in the stormsthe few bright rays through the break in the clouds the joy of food after hunger of a bath after days of privation of a jest or a smiling face or a kind word or deed after darkness and bitterness and contempt
She saw the restaurant mans eyes on her a curious expression in them
Whats the matter
she inquired
I was thinking said he how miserable you must have been to be so happy now
Oh I guess none of us has any too easy a time said she
But its mighty hard on women
I used to think different before I had bad luck and got down to tending this lunch wagon
But now I understand about a lot of things
Its all very well for comfortable people to talk about what a man or a woman ought to do and oughtnt to do
But let em be slammed up against it
Theyd sing a different songwouldnt they
Quite different said Susan
The man waved a griddle spoon
I tell you we do what weve got to do
Yesthe thieves andandall of us
Somes used for foundations and some for roofing and some for inside fancy work and some for outside wall
And somes used for the rubbish heap
But alls used
They do what theyve got to do
I was a great hand at worrying what I was going to be used for
But I dont bother about it any more
He began to pour the griddle cake dough
I think Ill get there though said he doggedly as if he expected to be derided for vanity
You will said Susan
Im twentynine
But Ive been being got ready for something
They dont chip away at a stone as they have at me without intending to make some use of it
No indeed said the girl hope and faith welling up in her own heart
And whats more Ive stood the chipping
I aint become rubbish Im still a good stone
Thats promising aint it
Its a sure sign declared Susan
Sure for herself no less than for him
The restaurant man took from under the counter several wellworn schoolbooks
He held them up looked at Susan and winked
Good businesseh
She laughed and nodded
He put the books back under the counter finished the cakes and served them
As he gave her more butter he said It aint the best butternot by a long shot
But its goodas good as you get on the average farmor better
Did you ever eat the best butter
I dont know
Ive had some that was very good
Eighty cents a pound
Mercy no exclaimed Susan
Awful price isnt it
But worth the moneyyes sir
Some time when youve got a little change to spare go get half a pound at one of the swell groceries or dairies
And the best milk too
Twelve cents a quart
Wait till I get money
Ill show em how to live
I was born in a tenement
Never had nothing
Rags to wear and food one notch above a garbage barrel
I know said Susan
But even as a boy I wanted the highclass things
Its wanting the best that makes a man push his way up
Another customer camea keeper of a butcher shop on his way to market
Susan finished the cakes paid the forty cents and prepared to depart
Im looking for a hotel said she to the restaurant man one where theyll take me in at this time but one thats safe not a dive
Right across the square theres a Salvation Army sheltervery goodclean
I Dont know of any other place for a lady
Theres a hotel on the next corner put in the butcher suspending the violent smacking and sipping which attended his taking rolls and coffee
It aint neither the one thing nor the other
Its clean and cheap and theyll let you behave if you want to
Thats all I ask said the girl
Thank you
And she departed after an exchange of friendly glances with the restaurant man
I feel lots better said she
It was a good breakfast replied he
That was only part
Good luck
Same to you lady
Call again
Try my chops
At the corner the butcher had indicated Susan found the usual Raines Law hotel adjunct to a saloon and open to all comers however transient
But she took the butchers word for it engaged a dollarandahalf room from the halfasleep clerk was shown to it by a colored bellboy who did not bother to wake up
It was a nice little room with barely space enough for a bed a bureau a stationary washstand a chair and a small radiator
As she undressed by the light of a sad gray dawn she examined her dress to see how far it needed repair and how far it might be repaired
She had worn away from Fortythird Street her cheapest dress because it happened to be of an inconspicuous blue
It was one of those suits that look fairly well at a glance on the wax figure in the department store window that lose their bloom as quickly as a country bride and at the fourth or fifth wearing begin to make frank and sweeping confession of the cheapness of every bit of the material and labor that went into them
These suits are typical of all that poverty compels upon the poor all that they in their ignorance and inexperience of values accept without complaint fancying they are getting moneys worth and never dreaming they are more extravagant than the most prodigal of the rich
However as their poverty gives them no choice their ignorance saves them from futilities of angry discontent
Susan had bought this dress because she had to have another dress and could not afford to spend more than twelve dollars and it had been marked down from twentyfive
She had worn it in fair weather and had contrived to keep it looking pretty well
But this rain had finished it quite
Thereafter until she could get another dress she must expect to be classed as poor and seedytherefore on the way toward deeper povertytherefore an object of pity and of prey
If she went into a shop she would be treated insultingly by the shopgirls despising her as a poor creature like themselves
If a man approached her he would calculate upon getting her very cheap because a girl in such a costume could not have been in the habit of receiving any great sum
And if she went with him he would treat her with far less consideration than if she had been about the same business in smarter attire
She spread the dress on bureau and chair smoothing it wiping the mud stains from it
She washed out her stockings at the stationary stand got them as dry as her remarkably strong hands could wring them hung them on a rung of the chair near the hot little radiator
She cleaned her boots and overshoes with an old newspaper she found in a drawer and wet at the washstand
She took her hat to pieces and made it over into something that looked almost fresh enough to be new
Then ready for bed she got the office of the hotel on the telephone and left a call for halfpast nine oclockthree hours and a half away
When she was throwing up the window she glanced into the street
The rain had once more ceased
Through the gray dimness the men and women boys and girls on the way to the factories and shops for the days work were streaming past in funereal procession
Some of the young ones were lively
But the mass was sullen and dreary
Bodies wrecked or rapidly wrecking by ignorance of hygiene by the foul air and foul food of the tenements by the monotonous toil of factory and shopmindless toiltoil that took away mind and put in its place a distaste for all improvementtoil of the factories that distorted the body and enveloped the soul in sodden stupiditytoil of the shops that meant breathing bad air all day long meant stooped shoulders and varicose veins in the legs and the arches of the insteps broken down meant dull eyes bad skin female complaints meant the breeding of desires for the luxury the shops display the breeding of envy and servility toward those able to buy these luxuries
Susan lingered fascinated by this exhibit of the price to the many of civilization for the few
Work
Never
Not any more than she would
Work in a dive
Workeither branch of it factory and shop or dive meant the sale of all the body and all the soul her professionat least as she practiced itmeant that perhaps she could buy with part of body and part of soul the privilege of keeping the rest of both for her own self
If she had stayed on at work from the beginning in Cincinnati where would she be now
Living in some stinking tenement hole with hope dead
And how would she be looking
As dull of eye as the rest as pasty and mottled of skin as ready for any chance disease
Work
Never
Never
Not at anything thatd degrade me more than this life
Yesmore
And she lifted her head defiantly
To her hunger Life was thus far offering only a plate of rotten apples it was difficult to choose among thembut there was choice
She was awakened by the telephone bell and it kept on ringing until she got up and spoke to the office through the sender
Never had she so craved sleep and her mental and physical contentment of three hours and a half before had been succeeded by headache a general soreness a horrible attack of the blues
She grew somewhat better however as she washed first in hot water then in cold at the stationary stand which was quite as efficient if not so luxurious as a bathtub
She dressed in a rush but not so hurriedly that she failed to make the best toilet the circumstances permitted
Her hair went up unusually well the dress did not look so badly as she had feared it would
As its a nasty day she reflected it wont do me so much damage
My hat and my boots will make them give me the benefit of the doubt and think Im saving my good clothes
She passed through the office at five minutes to ten
When she reached Langes winter garden its clock said ten minutes past ten but she knew it must be fast
Only one of the four musicians had arrivedthe man who played the drums cymbals triangle and xylophonea fat discouraged old man who knew how easily he could be replaced
Neither Lange nor his wife had come her original friend the Austrian waiter was wiping off tables and cleaning match stands
He welcomed her with a smile of delight that showed how few teeth remained in the front of his mouth and how deeply yellow they were
But Susan saw only his eyesand the kind heart that looked through them
Maybe you havent had breakfast already
he suggested
Im not hungry thank you
Perhaps some coffeeyes
Susan thought the coffee would make her feel better
So he brought itVienna fashionan open china pot full of strong deliciously aromatic black coffee a jug of milk with whipped white of egg on top a basket of small sweet rolls powdered with sugar and caraway seed
She ate one of the rolls drank the coffee
Before she had finished the waiter stood beaming before her and said A cigaretteyes
Oh no replied Susan a little sadly
But yes urged he
It isnt against the rules
The bosss wife smokes
Many ladies who come here doreal ladies
It is the custom in Europe
Why not
And he produced a box of cigarettes and put it on the table
Susan lit one of them and once more with supreme physical content came a cheerfulness that put color and sprightliness into the flowers of hope
And the sun had won its battle with the storm the storm was in retreat
Sunshine was streaming in at the windows into her heart
The waiter paused in his work now and then to enjoy himself in contemplating the charming picture she made
She was thinking of what the wagon restaurant man had said
Yes Life had been chipping away at her but she had remained good stone had not become rubbish
About halfpast ten Lange came down from his flat which was overhead
He inspected her by daylight and finding that his electric light impressions were not delusion was highly pleased with her
He refused to allow her to pay for the coffee
Johann
he called and the leader of the orchestra approached and made a respectful bow to his employer
He had a solemn pompous air and the usual pompadour
He and Susan plunged into the music question found that the only song they both knew was Tostis Good Bye
Thatll do to try said Lange
Begin
And after a little tuning and voice testing Susan sang the Good Bye with full orchestra accompaniment
It was not good it was not even pretty good but it was not bad
Youll do all right said Lange
You can stay
Now you and Johann fix up some songs and get ready for tonight
And he turned away to buy supplies for restaurant and bar
Johann deeply sentimental by nature was much pleased with Susans contralto
You do not know how to sing said he
You sing in your throat and youve got all the faults of parlor singers
But the voice is thereand much expressivenessmuch temperament
Also you have intelligenceand that will make a very little voice go a great way
Before proceeding any further with the rehearsal he took Susan up to a shop where sheet music was sold and they selected three simple songs Gipsy Queen Star of My Life and Love in Dreams
They were to try Gipsy Queen that night with Good Bye and if the applause should compel Suwanee River
When they were back at the restaurant Susan seated herself in a quiet corner and proceeded to learn the words of the song and to get some notion of the tune
She had lunch with Mr and Mrs Lange and Katy whose hair was very golden indeed and whose voice and manner proclaimed the Bowery and its vaudeville stage
She began by being grand with Susan but had far too good a heart and far too sensible a nature to keep up long
It takes more vanity more solemn stupidity and more leisure than plain people have time for to maintain the force of fake dignity
Before lunch was over it was Katy and Lorna and Katy was distressed that her duties at the theater made it impossible for her to stay and help Lorna with the song
At the afternoon rehearsal Susan distinguished herself
To permit business in the restaurant and the rehearsal at the same time there was a curtain to divide the big room into two unequal parts
When Susan sang her song through for the first time complete the men smoking and drinking on the other side of the curtain burst into applause
Johann shook hands with Susan shook hands again kissed her hand patted her shoulder
But in the evening things did not go so well
Susan badly frightened got away from the orchestra lagged when it speeded to catch up with her
She made a pretty and engaging figure in the costume low in the neck and ending at the knees
Her face and shoulders her arms and legs the lines of her slender rounded body made a success
But they barely saved her from being laughed at
When she finished there was no applause so no necessity for an encore
She ran upstairs and with nerves all aquiver hid herself in the little room she and Katy were to share
Until she failed she did not realize how much she had staked upon this venture
But now she knew and it seemed to her that her only future was the streets
Again her chance had come again she had thrown it away
If there were anything in heranything but mere vain hopesthat could not have occurred
In her plight anyone with a spark of the divinity that achieves success would have scored
I belong in the streets said she
Before dinner she had gone out and had bought a ninetyfive cent nightdress and some toilet articles
These she now bundled together again
She changed to her street dress she stole down the stairs
She was out at the side door she was flying through the side street toward the Bowery
Hi
shouted someone behind her
Where you going
And overtaking her came her staunch friend Albert the waiter
Feeling that she must need sympathy and encouragement he had slipped away from his duties to go up to her
He had reached the hall in time to see what she was about and had darted bareheaded after her
Where you going
he repeated excitedly
A crowd began to gather
Oh goodby she cried
Im getting out before Im told to gothats all
I made a failure
Thank you Albert
She put out her hand she was still moving and looking in the direction of the Bowery
Now you mustnt be foolish said he holding on tightly to her hand
The boss says its all right
Tomorrow you do better
Id never dare try again
Tomorrow makes everything all right
You mustnt act like a baby
The first time Katy tried they yelled her off the stage
Now she gets eleven a week
Come back right away with me
The bossd be mad if you wont
You aint acting right Miss Lorna
I didnt think you was such a fool
He had her attention now
Unmindful of the little crowd they had gathered they stood there discussing until to save Albert from pneumonia she returned with him
He saw her started up the stairs then ventured to take his eye off her long enough to put his head into the winter garden and send a waiter for Lange
He stood guard until Lange came and was on his way to her
The next evening a Saturday before a crowded house she sang well as well as she had ever sung in her lifesang well enough to give her beauty of face and figure her sweetness her charm the opportunity to win a success
She had to come back and sing Suwanee River
She had to come for a second encore and flushed with her victory over her timidity she sang Tostis sad cry of everlasting farewell with all the tenderness there was in her
That song exactly fitted her passionate melancholy voice its words harmonized with the deep sadness that was her real self that is the real self of every sensitive soul this world has ever tried with its exquisite torments for flesh and spirit
The tears that cannot be shed were in her voice in her face as she stood there with her violetgray eyes straining into vacancy
But the men and the women shed tears and when she moved breaking the spell of silence they not only applauded they cheered
The news quickly spread that at Langes there was a girl singer worth hearing and still more worth looking at
And Lange had his opportunity to arrive
But several things stood in his way things a man of far more intelligence would have found it hard to overcome
Like nearly all saloonkeepers he was serf to a brewery and the particular brewery whose beer his mortgage compelled him to push did not make a beer that could be pushed
People complained that it had a disagreeably bitter aftertaste
In the second place Mrs Lange was a born sitter
She had married to restand she was resting
She was always piled upon a chair
Thus she was not an aid but a hindrance an encourager of the help in laziness and slovenliness
Again the cooking was distinctly bad the only really good thing the house served was coffee and that was good only in the mornings
Finally Lange was a saver by nature and not a spreader
He could hold tightly to any money he closed his stubby fingers upon he did not know how to plant money and make it grow but only how to hoard
Thus it came to pass that after the first spurt the business fell back to about where it had been before Susan came
Albert the Austrian waiter explained to Susan why it was that her popularity did the house apparently so little goodexplained with truth where she suspected kindhearted plotting that she had arrested its latterly swiftdownward slide
She was glad to hear what he had to say as it was most pleasant to her vanity but she could not get over the depression of the central factshe was not making the sort of business to justify asking Lange for more than board and lodging she was not in the way of making the money that was each day more necessary as her little store dwindled
The question of getting money to live on is usually dismissed in a princely way by writers about human life
It is in reality except with the few rich the everpresent questionas everpresent as the necessity of breathingand it is not like breathing a matter settled automatically
It dominates thought it determines action
To leave it out of account ever in writing a human history is to misrepresent and distort as utterly as would a portrait painter who neglected to give his subject eyes or a head even
With the overwhelming mass of us money is at all times all our lives long the paramount questionfor to be without it is destruction worse than death and we are almost all perilously near to being without it
Thus airily to pass judgment upon men and women as to their doings in getting money for necessaries for what the compulsion of custom and habit has made necessaries to themairily to judge them for their doings in such dire straits is like sitting calmly on shore and criticizing the conduct of passengers and sailors in a stormbeset sinking ship
It is one of the favorite pastimes of the comfortable classes it makes an excellent impression as to ones virtue upon ones audience it gives us a pleasing sense of superior delicacy and humor
But it is none the less mean and ridiculous
Instead of condemnation the world needs to bestir itself to remove the stupid and cruel creatures that make evil conduct necessary for can anyone not a prig say that the small part of the human race that does well does so because it is naturally better than the large part that does ill
Spring was slow in opening
Susans one dress was in a deplorable state
The lining hung in rags
The never good material was stretched out of shape was frayed and worn gray in spots was beyond being made up as presentable by the most careful pressing and cleaning
She had been forced to buy a hat shoes underclothes
She had only three dollars and a few cents left and she simply did not dare lay it all out in dress materials
Yet less than all would not be enough all would not be enough
Lange had from time to time more than hinted at the opportunities she was having as a public singer in his hall
But Susan for all her experience had remained one of those upon whom such opportunities must be thrust if they are to be accepted
So long as she had food and shelter she could not make advances she could not even go so far as passive acquiescence
She knew she was again violating the fundamental canon of success whatever ones business do it thoroughly if at all
But she could not overcome her temperament which had at this feeble and false opportunity at once resented itself
She knew perfectly that therein was the whole cause of her failure to make the success she ought to have made when she came up from the tenements and again when she fell into the clutches of Freddie Palmer
But it is one thing to know it is another thing to do
Susan ignored the attempts of the men she pretended not to understand Lange when they set him on to intercede with her for them
She saw that she was once more drifting to disasterand that she had not long to drift
She was exasperated against herself she was disgusted with herself
But she drifted on
Growing seedier looking every day she waited defying the plain teachings of experience
She even thought seriously of going to work
But the situation in that direction remained unchanged
She was seeing things the reasons for things more clearly now as experience developed her mind
She felt that to get on in respectability she ought to have been either more or less educated
If she had been used from birth to conditions but a step removed from savagery she might have been content with what offered might even have felt that she was rising
Or if she had been bred to a good trade and educated only to the point where her small earnings could have satisfied her desires then she might have got along in respectability
But she had been bred a lady a Chinese woman whose feet have been bound from babyhood until her fifteenth or sixteenth yearhow long it would be after her feet were freed before she could learn to walk at alland would she ever be able to learn to walk well
What is luxury for one is squalor for another what is elevation for one degrades another
In respectability she could not earn what was barest necessity for herwhat she was now getting at Langesdecent shelter passable food
Ejected from her own class that shelters its women and brings them up in unfitness for the unsheltered life she was dropping as all such women must and do dropwas going down down downstriking on this ledge and that and rebounding to resume her ever downward course
She saw her own plight only too vividly
Those whose outward and inward lives are wide apart get a strong sense of dual personality
It was thus with Susan
There were times when she could not believe in the reality of her external life
She often glanced through the columns on columns pages on pages of want ads in the papersnot with the idea of answering them for she had served her apprenticeship at that but simply to force herself to realize vividly just how matters stood with her
Those columns and pages of closely printed offerings of work
Dreary tasks all of themtasks devoid of interest of personal sense of usefulness tasks simply to keep degrading soul in degenerating body tasks performed in filthy factories in foulsmelling workrooms and shops in unhealthful surroundings
And this throughout civilization was the honest work so praisedby all who dont do it but live pleasantly by making others do it
Wasnt there something in the ideas of Ettas father old Tom Brashear
Couldnt sensible really loving people devise some way of making most tasks less repulsive of lessening the burdens of those tasks that couldnt be anything but repulsive
Was this stupid system so cruel so crushing and producing at the top such absurd results as flashy insolent autos and silly palaces and overfed overdressed women and dogs in jeweled collars and babies of wealth brought up by low menialswas this system really the best
If theyd stop canting about honest work they might begin to get somewhere
In the effort to prevent her downward drop from beginning again she searched all the occupations open to her
She could not find one that would not have meant only the most visionary prospect of some slight remote advancement and the certain and speedy destruction of what she now realized was her chief asset and hopeher personal appearance
And she resolved that she would not even endanger it ever again
The largest part of the little capital she took away from Fortythird Street had gone to a dentist who put in several fillings of her back teeth
She had learned to value every charmhair teeth eyes skin figure hands
She watched over them all because she felt that when her day finally cameand come it would she never allowed long to doubtshe must be ready to enter fully into her own
Her day
The day when fate should change the life her outward self would be compelled to live would bring it into harmony with the life of inward selfthe self she could control
Katy had struck up a friendship at once profitable and sentimental with her stage manager
She often stayed out all night
On one of these nights Susan alone in the tiny room and asleep was roused by feeling hands upon her
She started up half awake and screamed
Sh
came in Langes voice
Its me
Susan had latterly observed sly attempts on his part to make advances without his wife and daughters suspecting but she had thought her way of quietly ignoring was effective
You must go she whispered
Mrs Lange must have heard
I had to come said he hoarsely a mere voice in the darkness
I cant hold out no longer without you Lorna
Gogo urged Susan
But it was too late
In the doorway candle in hand appeared Mrs Lange
Despite her efforts at dressiness she was in her best hour homely and nearly shapeless
In night dress and released from corsets she was hideous and monstrous
I thought so
she shrieked
I thought so
I heard a burglar mother whined Lange an abject and guilty figure
Shut your mouth you loafer
shrieked Mrs Lange
And she turned to Susan
You gutter hussy get on your clothes and clear out
ButMrs Lange began Susan
Clear out
she shouted opening the outer hall
Dress mighty damn quick and clear out
Mother youll wake the people upstairs pleaded Langeand Susan had never before realized how afraid of his wife the little man was
For Gods sake listen to sense
After Ive thrown youinto the streets cried his wife beside herself with jealous fury
Get dressed I tell you
she shouted at Susan
And the girl hurried into her clothes making no further attempt to speak
She knew that to plead and to explain would be useless even if Mrs Lange believed still she would drive from the house the temptation to her husband
Lange in a quaking cowardly whine begged his wife to be sensible and believe his burglar story
But with each halfdozen words he uttered she interrupted to hurl obscene epithets at him or at Susan
The tenants of the upstairs flats came down
She told her wrongs to a dozen halfclad men women and children they took her side at once and with the women leading showered vile insults upon Susan
The uproar was rising rising
Lange cowered in a corner crying bitterly like a whipped child
Susan only partly dressed caught up her hat and rushed into the hall
Several women struck at her as she passed
She stumbled on the stairs almost fell headlong
With the most frightful words in tenement house vocabulary pursuing her she fled into the street and did not pause until she was within a few yards of the Bowery
There she sat down on a doorstep and halfcrazed by the horror of her sudden downfall laced her shoes and buttoned her blouse and put on her hat with fumbling shaking fingers
It had all happened so quickly that she would have thought she was dreaming but for the cold night air and the dingy waste of the Bowery with the streetwalkers and drunken bums strolling along under the elevated tracks
She had trifled with the opportunity too long
It had flown in disgust dislodging her as it took flight
If she would be over nice and critical would hesitate to take the only upward path fate saw fit to offer thenlet her seek the bottom
Susan peered down and shuddered
She went into the saloon at the corner into the little back room
She poured down drink after drink of the frightful poison sold as whiskey with the permission of a government owned by every interest that can make big money out of a race of free men and so can afford to pay big bribes
It is characteristic of this poison of the saloon of the tenement quarter that it produces in anyone who drinks it a species of quick insanity of immediate degenerationa desire to commit crime to do degraded acts
Within an hour of Susans being thrown into the streets no one would have recognized her
She had been drinking had been treating the two faded but young and decently dressed streetwalkers who sat at another table
The three fired and maddened by the poison were amusing themselves and two young men as recklessly intoxicated as they
Susan in an attitude she had seen often enough but had never dreamed of taking was laughing wildly at a coarse song was standing up skirts caught high and body swaying in drunken rhythm as she led the chorus
When the barkeeper announced closing time one of the young men said to her Which way
To hell laughed she
Ive been thrown out everywhere else
Want to go along
Ill never desert a perfect lady replied he
X SHE was like one who has fallen bleeding and broken into a cave who after a time gathers himself together and crawls toward a faint and far distant gleam of light who suddenly sees the light no more and at the same instant lurches forward and down into a deeper chasm
Occasionally sheer exhaustion of nerves made it impossible for her to drink herself again into apathy before the effects of the last doses of the poison had worn off
In these intervals of partial awakeningshe never permitted them to lengthen out as such sensation as she had was of one fallingfallingthrough empty spacewith whirling brain and strange sounds in the ears and strange distorted sights or hallucinations before the eyesfalling downdownwhitherto how great a depthor was there no bottom but simply presently a plunging on down into the black of deaths bottomless oblivion
Drinkalways drink
Yet in every other way she took care of her healtha strange mingling of prudence and subtle hope with recklessness and frank despair
All her refinement baffled in the moral ways concentrated upon the physical
She would be neat and well dressed she would not let herself be seized of the diseases on the pariah in those regionsthe diseases through dirt and ignorance and indifference
In the regions she now frequented recklessness was the keynote
There was the hilarity of the doomed there was the cynical or stolid indifference to heat or cold to rain or shine to rags to filth to jail to ejection for nonpayment of rent to insult of word or blow
The fire enginesthe ambulancethe patrol wagonthe city dead wagonthese were all ever passing and repassing through those swarming streets
It was the vastest the most populous tenement area of the city
Its inhabitants represented the common lotfor it is the common lot of the overwhelming mass of mankind to live near to nakedness to shelterlessness to starvation without ever being quite naked or quite roofless or quite starved
The masses are eager for the necessities the classes are eager for the comforts and luxuries
The masses are ignorant the classes are intelligentor at least shrewd
The unconscious and inevitable exploitation of the masses by the classes automatically and of necessity stops just short of the catastrophe pointfor the masses must have enough to give them the strength to work and reproduce
To go down through the social system as had Susan from her original place well up among the classes is like descending from the beautiful dining room of the palace where the meat is served in taste and refinement upon costly dishes by well mannered servants to attractively dressed peopledescending along the various stages of the preparation of the meat at each stage less of refinement and more of coarseness until one at last arrives at the slaughter pen
The shambles stinking and reeking blood and filth
The shambles with hideous groan or shriek or more hideous silent look of agony
The shambles of society where the beauty and grace and charm of civilization are created out of noisome sweat and savage toil out of the health and strength of men and women and children out of their ground up bodies out of their ground up souls
Susan knew those regions well
She had no theories about them no resentment against the fortunate classes no notion that any other or better system might be possible any other or better life for the masses
She simply accepted life as she found it lived it as best she could
Throughout the masses of mankind life is sustained by illusionsillusions of a better lot tomorrow illusions of a heaven beyond a grave where the nightmare life in the body will end and the reality life in the spirit will begin
She could not join the throngs moving toward church and synagogue to indulge in their dream that the present was a dream from which death would be a joyful awakening
She alternately pitied and envied them
She had her own dream that this dream the present would end in a joyful awakening to success and freedom and light and beauty
She admitted to herself that the dream was probably an illusion like that of the pious throngs
But she was as unreasonably tenacious of her dream as they were of theirs
She dreamed it because she was a human beingand to be human means to hope and to hope means to dream of a brighter future here or hereafter or both here and hereafter
The earth is peopled with dreamers she was but one of them
The last thought of despair as the black earth closes is a hope perhaps the most colossal of hopes delusions that there will be escape in the grave
There is the time when we hope and know it and believe in it
There is the time when we hope and know it but have ceased to believe in it
There is the time when we hope believing that we have altogether ceased to hope
That time had come for Susan
She seemed to think about the present
She moved about like a sleepwalker
What women did she knowwhat men
She only dimly remembered from day to dayfrom hour to hour
Blurred faces passed before her blurred voices sounded in her ears blurred personalities touched hers
It was like the jostling of a huge crowd in night streets
A vague sense of buffetingsof rude contactsof momentary sensations of pain of shame of disgust all blunted and soon forgotten
In estimating suffering physical or mental to fail to take into account a more important factorthe merciful paralysis or partial paralysis of any center of sensibilitythat is insistently assaulted
She no longer had headaches or nausea after drinking deeply
And where formerly it had taken many stiff doses of liquor to get her into the state of recklessness or of indifference she was now able to put herself into the mood in which life was endurable with two or three drinks often with only one
The most marked change was that never by any chance did she become gay the sky over her life was steadily graygray or black to gray againnever lighter
How far she had fallen
But swift descent or gradual she had adapted herselfhad in fact learned by much experience of disaster to mitigate the calamities to have something to keep a certain deeplying self of selfs intactunaffected by what she had been forced to undergo
It seemed to her that if she could get the chanceor could cure herself of the blindness which was always preventing her from seeing and seizing the chance that doubtless offered again and againshe could shed the surface her mode of life had formed over her and would find underneath a new real surface stronger sightly better able to bearlike the skin that forms beneath the healing wound
In these tenements as in all tenements of all degrees she and the others of her class were fiercely resented by the heads of families where there was any hope left to impel a striving upward
She had the best furnished room in the tenement
She was the best dressed womana marked and instantly recognizable figure because of her neat and finer clothes
Her profession kept alive and active the instincts for care of the person that either did not exist or were momentary and feeble in the respectable women
The slovenliness the scurrilousness of even the wives and daughters of the welltodo and the rich of that region would not have been tolerated in any but the lowest strata of her profession hardly even in those sought by men of the laboring class
Also the deep horror of disease which her intelligence never for an instant permitted to relax its hold made her particular and careful when in other circumstances drink might have reduced her to squalor
She spent all her leisure timefor she no longer readin the care of her person
She was watched with frightened yet longing and curious eyes by all the girls who were at work
The mothers hated her many of them spat upon the ground after she had passed
It was a heartbreaking struggle that of these mothers to save their daughters not from prostitution not from living with men outside marriage not from moral danger but from the practical danger the danger of bringing into the world children with no father to help feed and clothe them
In the opinion of these peoplean opinion often frankly expressed rarely concealed with any but the thinnest hypocrisythe life of prostitution was not so bad
Did the life of virtue offer any attractive alternative
Whether a woman was bad or good she must live in travail and die in squalor to be buried in or near the Potters Field
But if the girl still living at home were not good that would mean a baby to be taken care of would mean the girl herself not a contributor to the family support but a double burden
And if she went into prostitution would her family get the benefit
No
The mothers made little effort to save their sons they concentrated on the daughters
It was pitiful to see how in their ignorance they were unaware of the strongest forces working against them
The talk of all this motley humanityof good no less than bad women of steady workingmen of political heelers thieves and bums and runners for diveswas frankly often hideously obscene
The jammed together way of living made modesty impossible or scantest decencymade the pictures of it among the aspiring few usually for the benefit of religion or charitable visitors a pitiful grotesque hypocrisy
Indeed the prostitute class was the highest in this respect
The streetwalkers those who prospered had better masters learned something about the pleasures and charms of privacy also had more leisure in which to think in however crude a way about the refinements of life and more money with which to practice those refinements
The boys from the earliest age were on terms of licentious freedom with the girls
The favorite childrens games often played in the open street with the elders looking on and laughing were sex games
The very babies used foul languagethat is used the language they learned both at home and in the street
It was primitive man Susan was at the foundation of the world
To speak of the conditions there as a product of civilization is to show ignorance of the history of our race is to fancy that we are civilized today when in fact we arehistoricallyin a turbulent and painful period of transition from a better yesterday toward a tomorrow in which life will be worth living as it never has been before in all the ages of duration
In this today of movement toward civilization which began with the discovery of iron and will end when we shall have discovered how to use for the benefit of all the main forces of naturein this today of agitation incident to journeying we are in some respects better off in other respects worse off than the race was ten or fifteen thousand years ago
We have lost much of the freedom that was ours before the rise of governments and ruling classes we have gained muchnot so much as the ignorant and the unthinking and the uneducated imagine but still much
In the end we which means the masses of uswill gain infinitely
But gain or loss has not been in socalled morality
There is not a virtue that has not existed from time ages before record
Not a vice which is shallowly called effete or the product of overcivilization but originated before man was man
To speak of the conditions in which Susan Lenox now lived as savagery is to misuse the word
Every transitional stage is accompanied by a disintegration
Savagery was a settled state in which every man and every woman had his or her fixed position settled duties and rights
With the downfall of savagery with the beginning of the journey toward that hope of tomorrow civilization everything in the relations of men with men and men with women became unsettled
Such social systems as the world has known since have all been makeshift and temporarylike our social systems of today like the moral and extinct codes rising and sinking in power over a vast multitude of emigrants moving from a distant abandoned home toward a distant promised land and forced to live as best they can in the interval
In the historic days journey of perhaps fifteen thousand years our present time is but a brief second
In that second there has come a breaking up of the makeshift organization which long served the working multitudes fairly well
The result is an anarchy in which the strong oppress the weak in which the masses are being crushed by the burdens imposed upon them by the classes
And in that particular part of the human race en route into which fate had flung Susan Lenox conditions not of savagery but of primitive chaos were prevailing
A large part of the population lived off the unhappy workers by prostitution by thieving by petty swindling by politics by the various devices in coarse crude and small imitation of the devices employed by the ruling classes
And these petty parasites imitated the big parasites in their ways of spending their dubiously got gains
To have a good time was the ideal here as in idle Fifth Avenue and the notions of a good time in vogue in the two opposite quarters differed in degree rather than in kind
Nothing to think about but the appetites and their vices
Nothing to hope for but the next carouse
Susan had brought down with her from above one desire unknown to her associates and neighborsthe desire to forget
If she could only forget
If the poison would not wear off at times
She could not quite forget
And to be unable to forget is to rememberand to remember is to longand to long is to hope
Several times she heard of Freddie Palmer
Twice she chanced upon his name in the newspaperan incidental reference to him in connection with local politics
The other times were when men talking together in the drinking places frequented by both sexes spoke of him as a minor power in the organization
Each time she got a sense of her remoteness of her security
Once she passed in Grand Street a detective she had often seen with him in Considines at Broadway and Fortysecond
The bull looked sharply at her
Her heart stood still
But he went on without recognizing her
The sharp glance had been simply that official expression of seeall and knowall which is mere formality part of the official livery otherwise meaningless
However it is not to that detectives discredit that he failed to recognize her
She had adapted herself to her changed surroundings
Because she was of a different and higher class and because she picked and chose her company even when drink had beclouded her senses and instinct alone remained on drowsy guard she prospered despite her indifference
For that region had its aristocracy of rich merchants tenementowners politicians whose sons close imitators of the uptown aristocracies in manners and dress spent money freely in the amusements that attract nearly all young men everywhere
Susan made almost as much as she could have made in the more renowned quarters of the town
And presently she was able to move into a tenement which except for two workingmens families of a better class was given over entirely to fast women
It was much better kept much cleaner much better furnished than the tenements for workers chiefly they could not afford decencies much less luxuries
All that sort of thing was for the neighborhood concentrated in the saloons the dance halls the fast houses and the fast flats
Her walks in Grand Street and the Bowery repelling and capricious though she was with her alternating moods of cold moroseness and sardonic and mocking gayety were bringing her in a good sum of money for that region
Sometimes as much as twenty dollars a week rarely less than twelve or fifteen
And despite her drinking and her freehandedness with her fellowprofessionals less fortunate and with the street beggars and for tenement charities she had in her stockings a capital of thirtyone dollars
She avoided the tough places the hangouts of the gangs
She rarely went alone into the streets at nightand the afternoons were luckily best for business as well as for safety
She made no friends and therefore no enemies
Without meaning to do so and without realizing that she did so she held herself aloof without haughtiness through sense of loneliness not at all through sense of superiority
Had it not been for her scarlet lips a far more marked sign in that region than anywhere uptown she would have passed in the street for a more or less respectable womannot thoroughly respectable she was too well dressed too intelligently cared for to seem the good working girl
On one of the few nights when she lingered in the little back room of the saloon a few doors away at the corner as she entered the dark passageway of the tenement strong fingers closed upon her throat and she was borne to the floor
She knew at once that she was in the clutch of one of those terrors of tenement fast women the lobbygowsmen who live by lying in wait in the darkness to seize and rob the lonely friendless fast woman
She struggledand she was anything but weak
But not a sound could escape from her tightpressed throat
Soon she became unconscious
One of the workingmen returning drunk from the meeting of the union in the corner saloon stumbled over her gave her a kick in his anger
This roused her she uttered a faint cry
Thought it was a man mumbled he dragging her to a sitting position
He struck a match
Ohits you
Dont make any noise
If my old woman came out shed kill us both
Never mind me said Susan
I was only stunned
Oh I thought it was the booze
They say you hit it something fierce
Noa lobbygow
And she felt for her stockings
They were torn away from her garters
Her bosom also was bare for the lobbygow had searched there also
How much did he get
About thirtyfive
The hell he did
Want me to call a cop
No replied Susan who was on her feet again
Whats the use
Those damn cops
cursed the workingman
Theyd probably pinch youor both of us
Ten to one the lobbygows divide with them
I didnt mean that said Susan
The police were most friendly and most kind to her
She was understanding the ways of the world better now and appreciated that the police themselves were part of the same vast system of tyranny and robbery that was compelling her
The police made her pay because they dared not refuse to be collectors
They bound whom the mysterious invisible power compelled them to bind they loosed whom that same power bade them loose
She had no quarrel with the police who protected her from far worse oppressions and oppressors than that to which they subjected her
And if they tolerated lobbygows and divided with them it was because the overshadowing power ordained it so
Neednt be afraid Ill blow to the cop said the drunken artisan
You can damn the cops all you please to me
They make New York worse than Russia
I guess they do the best they canlike everybody else said the girl wearily
Ill help you upstairs
No thank you said she
Not that she did not need help but she wished no disagreeable scene with the workingmans wife who might open the door as they passed his familys flat
She went upstairs the man waiting below until she should be safeand out of the way
She staggered into her room tottered to the bed fell upon it
A girl named Clara who lived across the hall was sitting in a rockingchair in a nightgown reading a Bertha Clay novel and smoking a cigarette
She glanced up was arrested by the strange look in Susans eyes
Hellobeen hitting the pipe I see said she
Down in Gussies room
No
A lobbygow said Susan
Did he get much
About thirtyfive
The
cried Clara
Ill bet it was Gussies fellow
Ive suspected him
Him and her stay in hitting the pipe all the time
That costs money and she hasnt been out for I dont know how long
Lets go down there and raise hell
Whats the use
said Susan
You ought to a put it in the savings bank
Thats what I dowhen I have anything
Then when Im robbed they only get what Ive just made
Last time they didnt get nothingbut me
And she laughed
Her teeth were good in front but out on one side and beginning to be discolored on the other
How long had you been saving
Nearly six months
Gee
Isnt that hell
Presently she laughed
Six months work and only thirtyfive to show for it
Guess youre about as poor at hiving it up as I am
I give it to that loafer I live with
You give it away to anybody that wants a stake
Wellwhats the diff
It all goes
Give me a cigarette said Susan sitting up and inspecting the bruises on her bosom and legs
And get that bottle of whiskey from under the soiled clothes in the bottom of the washstand
It is something to celebrate isnt it
said Clara
My fellows gone to his club tonight so I didnt go out
I never do any more unless hes there to hang round and see that I aint done up
Youll have to get a fellow
Youll have to come to it as Im always telling you
Theyre expensive but theyre companyanybody you can count on for shining up even if it is for what they can get out of you is better than not having nobody nowhere
And they keep off bums and lobbygows and scare the bilkers into coughing up
Not for me replied Susan
The greater the catastrophe the longer the time before it is fully realized
Susans loss of the money that represented so much of savage if momentary horror and so much of unconscious hope this calamity did not overwhelm her for several days
Then she yielded for the first time to the lure of opium
She had listened longingly to the descriptions of the delights as girls and men told for practically all of them smokedor took cocaine
But to Claras or Gussies invitations to join the happy band of dreamers she had always replied Not yet
Im saving that
Now however she felt that the time had come
Hope in this world she had none
Before the black adventure why not try the world of blissful unreality to which it gave entrance
Why leave life until she had exhausted all it put within her reach
She went to Gussies room at midnight and flung herself down in a wrapper upon a couch opposite a sallow delicate young man
His great dark eyes were gazing unseeingly at her were perhaps using her as an outline sketch from which his imagination could picture a beauty of loveliness beyond human
Gussie taught her how to prepare the little ball of opium how to put it on the pipe and draw in its fumes
Her system was so well prepared for it by the poisons she had drunk that she had satisfactory results from the outset
And she entered upon the happiest period of her life thus far
All the hideousness of her profession disappeared under the gorgeous draperies of the imagination
Opiums magic transformed the vile the obscene into the lofty the romantic the exalted
The world she had been accustomed to regard as real ceased to be even the blur the poisonous liquors had made of it became a vague distant thing seen in a dream
Her opium world became the vivid reality
The life she had been leading had made her extremely thin had hardened and dulled her eyes had given her that sad shuddering expression of the face upon which have beaten a thousand mercenary and lustful kisses
The opium soon changed all this
Her skin always tending toward pallor became of the dead amberwhite of old ivory
Her thinness took on an ethereal transparency that gave charm even to her slight stoop
Her face became dreamy exalted rapt and her violetgray eyes looked from it like the vents of poetical fires burning without ceasing upon an altar to the god of dreams
Never had she been so beautiful never had she been so happynot with the coarser happiness of dancing eye and laughing lip but with the ecstasy of soul that is like the shimmers of a tranquil sea quivering rhythmically under the caresses of moonlight
In her descent she had now reached that long narrow shelf along which she would walk so long as health and looks should lastunless some accident should topple her off on the one side into suicide or on the other side into the criminal prostitute class
And such accidents were likely to happen
Still there was a fair chance of her keeping her balance until loss of looks and loss of healththe end of the shelfshould drop her abruptly to the very bottom
She could guess what was there
Every day she saw about the streets most wretched and most forlorn of its wretched and forlorn things the solitary old women bent and twisted wrapped in rotting rags picking papers and tobacco from the gutters and burrowing in garbage barrels seeking somehow to get the drink or the dope that changed hell into heaven for them
Despite liquor and opium and the degradations of the streetwomans life she walked that narrow ledge with curious steadiness
She was unconscious of the cause
Indeed selfconsciousness had never been one of her traits
The cause is interesting
In our egotism in our shame of what we ignorantly regard as the lowliness of our origin we are always seeking alleged lofty spiritual explanations of our doings and overlook the actual quite simple real reason
One of the strongest factors in Susans holding herself together in face of overwhelming odds was the nearly seventeen years of early training her Aunt Fanny Warham had given her in orderly and systematic waysa place for everything and everything in its place a time for everything and everything at its time neatness scrupulous cleanliness no neglecting of any of the small yet large matters that conserve the body
Susan had not been so apt a pupil of Fanny Warhams as was Ruth because Susan had not Ruths nature of the oldmaidish cutanddried conventional
But during the whole fundamentally formative period of her life Susan Lenox had been trained to order and system and they had become part of her being beyond the power of drink and opium and prostitution to disintegrate them until the general breakup should come
In all her wanderings every man or woman or girl she had met who was not rapidly breaking up but was offering more or less resistance to the assaults of bad habits was one who like herself had acquired in childhood strong good habits to oppose the bad habits and to fight them with
An enemy must be met with his own weapons or stronger
The strongest weapons that can be given a human animal for combating the destructive forces of the struggle for existence are not good sentiments or good principles or even pious or moral practicesfor bad habits can make short work of all thesebut are good habits in the practical material matters of life
They operate automatically they apply to all the multitude of small every day semiunconscious actions of the daily routine
They preserve the morale
And not morality but morals is the warp of characterthe part which once destroyed or even frayed cannot be restored
Susan unconsciously and tenaciously practicing her early training in order and system whenever she could and wherever she could had an enormous advantage over the mass of the girls both respectable and fast
And while their evidence was always toward going to pieces her tendency was always to repair and to put off the breakup
One June evening she was looking through the better class of dance halls and drinking resorts for Clara to get her to go up to Gussies for a smoke
She opened a door she had never happened to enter beforea dingy door with the glass frosted
Just inside there was a fetid little bar view of the rest of the room was cut off by a screen from behind which came the sound of a tuneless old piano
She knew Clara would not be in such a den but out of curiosity she glanced round the screen
She was seeing a lowceilinged room the walls almost dripping with the dirt of many and many a hard year
In a corner was the piano battered about to fall to pieces its ancient and horrid voice cracked by the liquor which had been poured into it by facetious drunkards
At the keyboard sat an old hunchback brokenjawed dressed in slimy rags his one eye instantly fixed upon her with a lecherous expression that made her shiver as it compelled her to imagine the embrace he was evidently imagining
His filthy fingers were pounding out a waltz
About the floor were tottering in the measure of the waltz a score of dreadful old women
They were in calico
They had each a little biscuit knot of white hair firmly upon the crown of the head
From their bleached seamed old faces gleamed the longings or the torments of all the passions they could no longer either inspire or satisfy
They were one time prostitutes one time young perhaps pretty women now descending to deathstill prostitutes in heart and mind but compelled to live as scrub women cleaners of all manner of loathsome messes in dives after the drunkards had passed on
They were now enjoying the reward of their toil the pleasures of which they dreamed and to which they looked forward as they dragged their stiff old knees along the floors in the wake of the brush and the cloth
They were drinking biting poisons from tin cupsfor those hands quivering with palsy could not be trusted with glassdancing with drunken diseaseswollen or twisted legsventing from ghastly toothless mouths strange cries of merriment that sounded like shrieks of damned souls at the licking of quenchless flames
Susan stood rooted to the threshold of that frightful scenethat vision of the future toward which she was hurrying
A few yearsa very few yearsand unless she should have passed through the Morgue here she would be abandoning her body to abominations beyond belief at the hands of degenerate oriental sailors to get a few pennies for the privileges of this dance hall
And she would laugh as did these would enjoy as did these would revel in the filth her senses had been trained to find sweet
No
No
she protested
Id kill myself first
And then she cowered again as the thought came that she probably would not any more than these had killed themselves
The descent would be gradualno matter how swift still gradual
Only the insane put an end to life
Yesshe would come here some day
She leaned against the wall her throat contracting in a fit of nausea
She grew cold all over her teeth chattered
She tried in vain to tear her gaze from the spectacle some invisible power seemed to be holding her head in a vise thrusting her struggling eyelids violently open
There were several men dead drunk asleep in old wooden chairs against the wall
One of these men was so near her that she could have touched him
His clothing was such an assortment of rags slimy and greasy as one sometimes sees upon the top of a filled garbage barrel to add its horrors of odor of long unwashed humanity to the stenches from vegetable decay
His wreck of a hard hat had fallen from his head as it dropped forward in drunken sleep
Something in the shape of the head made her concentrate upon this man
She gave a sharp cry stretched out her hand touched the mans shoulder
Rod
she cried
Rod
The head slowly lifted and the bleary blowsy wreck of Roderick Spensers handsome face was turned stupidly toward her
Into his gray eyes slowly came a gleam of recognition
Then she saw the red of shame burst into his hollow cheeks and the head quickly drooped
She shook him
Rod
Its you Get the hell out he mumbled
I want to sleep
You know me she said
I see the color in your face
Oh Rodyou neednt be ashamed before me
She felt him quiver under her fingers pressing upon his shoulder
But he pretended to snore
Rod she pleaded I want you to come along with me
I cant do you any harm now
The hunchback had stopped playing
The old women were crowding round Spenser and her were peering at them with eyes eager and ears acock for romancefor nowhere on this earth do the stars shine so sweetly as down between the precipices of shame to the black floor of the slums abyss
Spenser stooped and shaking rose abruptly thrust Susan aside with a sweep of the arm that made her reel bolted into the street
She recovered her balance and amid hoarse croakings of Thats right honey
Dont give him up
followed the shambling swaying figure
He was too utterly drunk to go far soon down he sank a heap of rags and filth against a stoop
She bent over him saw he was beyond rousing straightened and looked about her
Two honest looking young Jews stopped
Wont you help me get him home
she said to them
Sure
replied they in chorus
And with no outward sign of the disgust they must have felt at the contact they lifted up the sot in such fantastic contrast to Susans clean and even stylish appearance and bore him along trying to make him seem less the helpless whiskeysoaked dead weight
They dragged him up the two flights of stairs and as she pushed back the door deposited him on the floor
She assured them they could do nothing more thanked them and they departed
Clara appeared in her doorway
God Almighty Lorna
she cried
What have you got there
Howd it get in
Youve been advising me to take a fellow said Susan
Wellhere he is
Clara looked at her as if she thought her crazed by drink or dope
Ill call the janitor and have him thrown out
No hes my lover said Susan
Will you help me clean him up
Clara looking at Spensers face now saw those signs which not the hardest of the worlds hard uses can cut or tear away
Oh
she said in a tone of sympathy
He is down isnt he
But hell pull round all right
She went into her room to take off her street clothes and to get herself into garments as suitable as she possessed for one of those noisome tasks that are done a dozen times a day by the bath nurses in the receiving department of a charity hospital
When she returned Susan too was in her chemise and ready to begin the search for the man if man there was left deep buried in that muck
While Susan took off the stinking and rotten rags and flung them into the hall Clara went to the bathroom they and Mollie shared and filled the tub with water as hot as her hand could bear
With her foot Susan pushed the rags along the hall floor and into the garbage closet
Then she and Clara lifted the emaciated dirtstreaked filthsmeared body carried it to the bathroom let it down into the water
There were at hand plenty of those strong specially prepared soaps and other disinfectants constantly used by the women of their kind who still cling to cleanliness and health
With these they attacked him not as if he were a human being but as if he were some inanimate object that must be scoured before it could be used
Again and again they let out the water black full of dead and dying vermin again and again they rinsed him attacked him afresh
Their task grew less and less repulsive as the man gradually appeared a young man with a soft skin a wellformed body unusually good hands and feet a distinguished face despite its savage wounds from dissipation hardly the less handsome for the now fair and crisp beard which gave it a look of more years than Spenser had lived
If Spenser recovered consciousnessand it seems hardly possible that he did nothe was careful to conceal the fact
He remained limp inert apparently in a stupor
They gave him one final scrubbing one final rinsing one final thorough inspection
Now hes all right declared Clara
What shall we do with him
Put him to bed said Susan
They had already dried him off in the empty tub
They now rubbed him down with a rough towel lifted him Susan taking the shoulders Clara the legs and put him in Susans bed
Clara ran to her room brought one of the two nightshirts she kept for her fellow
When they had him in this and with a sheet over him they cleaned and straightened the bathroom then lit cigarettes and sat down to rest and to admire the work of their hands
Who is he
asked Clara
A man I used to know said Susan
Like all the girls in that life with a real story to tell she never told about her past self
Never tell
They never even remember if drink and drugs will do their duty
I dont blame you for loving him said Clara
Somehow the lower a man sinks the more a woman loves him
Its the other way with men
But then men dont know what love is
And a woman dont really know till shes been through the mill
I dont love him said Susan
Same thing replied the practical Clara with a wave of the bare arm at the end of which smoked the cigarette
Whatre you going to do with him
I dont know confessed Susan
She was not a little uneasy at the thought of his awakening
Would he despise her more than ever nowfly from her back to his filth
Would he let her try to help him
And she looked at the face which had been in that other life so long long ago dearer to her than any face her eyes had ever rested upon a sob started deep down within her found its slow and painful way upward shaking her whole body and coming from between her clenched teeth in a groan
She forgot all she had suffered from Rodforgot the truth about him which she had slowly puzzled out after she left him and as experience enabled her to understand actions she had not understood at the time
She forgot it all
That pastthat far dear dead past
Again she was a simple innocent girl upon the high rock eating that wonderful dinner
Again the evening light faded stars and moon came out and she felt the first sweet stirring of love for him
She could hear his voice the light clear entrancing melody of the Dukes song La Donna e mobile Qua penna al vento She burst into tearstears that drenched her soul as the rain drenches the blasted desert and makes the things that could live in beauty stir deep in its bosom
And Clara sobbing in sympathy kissed her and stole away softly closing the door
If a man die shall he live again
asked the old Arabian philosopher
If a woman die shall she live again


Shall not that which dies in weakness live again in strength


Looking at him as he lay there sleeping so quietly her being surged with the heaving of high longings and hopes
If they could only live again
Here they were together at the lowest depth at the rock bottom of life
If they could build on that rock build upon the very foundation of the world then would they indeed build in strength
Then nothing could destroynothing


If they could live again
If they could build
She had something to live forsomething to fight for
Into her eyes came a new light into her soul came peace and strength
Something to live forsomeone to redeem
XI SHE fell asleep her head resting upon her hand her elbow on the arm of the chair
She awoke with a shiver she opened her eyes to find him gazing at her
The eyes of both shifted instantly
Wouldnt you like some whiskey
she asked
Thanks replied he and his unchanged voice reminded her vividly of his old self obscured by the beard and by the dissipated look
She took the bottle from its concealment in the locked washstand drawer poured him out a large drink
When she came back where he could see the whiskey in the glass his eyes glistened and he raised himself first on his elbow then to a sitting position
His shaking hand reached out eagerly and his expectant lips quivered
He gulped the whiskey down
Thank you he said gazing longingly at the bottle as he held the empty glass toward her
More
I would like a little more said he gratefully
Again she poured him a large drink and again he gulped it down
Thats strong stuff said he
But then they sell strong stuff in this part of town
The other kind tastes weak to me now
He dropped back against the pillows
She poured herself a drink
Halfway to her lips the glass halted
Ive got to stop that thought she if Im going to do anything for him or for myself
And she poured the whiskey back and put the bottle away
The whole incident took less than five seconds
It did not occur that she was essaying and achieving the heroic that she had in that instant revealed her right to her dream of a career high above the common lot
Dont you drink
said he
Ive decided to cut it out replied she carelessly
Theres nothing in it
I couldnt live without itand wouldnt
It is a comfort when ones on the way down said she
But Im going to try the other directionfor a change
She held a box of cigarettes toward him
He took one then she she held the lighted match for him lit her own cigarette let the flame of the match burn on she absently watching it
Look out
Youll burn yourself
cried he
She started threw the match into the slop jar
How do you feel
inquired she
Like the devil he answered
But then I havent known what it was to feel any other way for several months except when I couldnt feel at all
A long silence both smoking he thinking she furtively watching him
You havent changed so much he finally said
At least not on the outside
More on the outside than on the inside said she
The inside doesnt change much
There Im almost as I was that day on the big rock
And I guess you are tooarent you
The devil I am
Ive grown hard and bitter
Thats all outside declared she
Thats the shelllike the scab that stays over the sore spot till it heals
Sore spot
Im nothing but sore spots
Ive been treated like a dog
And he proceeded to talk about the only subject that interested himhimself
He spoke in a defensive way as if replying to something she had said or thought
Ive not got down in the world without damn good excuse
I wrote several plays and they were tried out of town
But we never could get into New York
I think Brent was jealous of me and his influence kept me from a hearing
I know it sounds conceited but Im sure Im right
Brent
said she in a queer voice
Oh I think you must be mistaken
He doesnt look like a man who could do petty mean things
No Im sure hes not petty
Do you know him
cried Spenser in an irritated tone
No
Butsomeone pointed him out to me oncea long time agoone night in the Martin
And thenyoull rememberthere used to be a great deal of talk about him when we lived in Fortythird Street
You admired him tremendously
Well hes responsible said Spenser sullenly
The men on top are always trampling down those who are trying to climb up
He had it in for me
One of my friends who thought he was a decent chap gave him my best play to read
He returned it with some phrases about its showing talentone of those phrases that dont mean a damn thing
And a few weeks ago Spenser raised himself excitedlythe thieving hound produced a play that was a clean steal from mine
Id be laughed at if I protested or sued
But I know curse him
He fell back shaking so violently that his cigarette dropped to the sheet
Susan picked it up handed it to him
He eyed her with angry suspicion
You dont believe me do you
he demanded
I dont know anything about it replied she
Anyhow what does it matter
The man I met on that show boatthe Mr Burlingham Ive often talked abouthe used to say that the dog that stopped to lick his scratches never caught up with the prey
He flung himself angrily in the bed
You never did have any heartany sympathy
But who has
Even Drumley went back on melet em put a roast of my last play in the Heralda telegraphed roast from New Havensaid it was a dead failure
And who wrote it
Why some newspaper correspondent in the pay of the Syndicateand that means Brent
And of course it was a dead failure
SoI gave upand here I am



This your room
Yes
Wheres this nightshirt come from
It belongs to the friend of the girl across the hall
He laughed sneeringly
The hell it does
mocked he
I understand perfectly
I want my clothes
No one is coming said Susan
Theres no one to come
He was looking round the comfortable little room that was the talk of the whole tenement and was stirring wives and fast women alike to do a little fixing up
Said he A nice little nest youve made for him
You always were good at that
Ive made it for myself said she
I never bring men here
I want my clothes cried he
I havent sunk that low you
The word he used did not greatly disturb Susan
The shell she had formed over herself could ward off brutal contacts of languages no less than of the other kinds
It did however shock her a little to hear Rod Spenser use a word so crude
Give me my clothes he ordered waving his fists in a fierce feeble gesture
They were torn all to pieces
I threw them away
Ill get you some more in the morning
He dropped back again a scowl upon his face
Ive got no moneynot a damn cent
I did half a days work on the docks and made enough to quiet me last night
He raised himself
I can work again
Give me my clothes
Theyre gone said Susan
They were completely used up
This brought back apparently anything but dim memory of what his plight had been
Howd I happen to get so clean
Clara and I washed you off a little
You had fallen down
He lay silent a few minutes then said in a hesitating ashamed tone My troubles have made me a boor
I beg your pardon
Youve been tremendously kind to me
Oh it wasnt much
Dont you feel sleepy
Not a bit
He dragged himself from the bed
But you do
I must go
She laughed in the friendliest way
You cant
You havent any clothes
He passed his hand over his face and coughed violently she holding his head and supporting his emaciated shoulders
After several minutes of coughing and gagging gasping and groaning and spitting he was relieved by the spasm and lay down again
When he got his breath he saidwith rest between wordsId ask you to send for the ambulance but if the doctors catch me theyll lock me away
Ive got consumption
Oh Ill soon be out of it
Susan sat silent
She did not dare look at him lest he should see the pity and horror in her eyes
Theyll find a cure for it pursued he
But not till the day after Im gone
That is the way my luck runs
Still I dont see why I should care to stayand I dont
Have you any more of that whiskey
Susan brought out the bottle again gave him the last of the whiskeya large drink
He sat up sipping it to make it last
He noted the long row of books on the shelf fastened along the wall beside the bed the books and magazines on the table
Said he As fond of reading as ever I see
Fonder said she
It takes me out of myself
I suppose you read the sort of stuff you really like nownot the things you used to read to make old Drumley think you were cultured and intellectual
Nothe same sort replied she unruffled by his contemptuous unjust fling
Trash bores me
Come to think of it I guess you did have pretty good taste in books
But he was interested in himself like all invalids and like them he fancied his own intense interest could not but be shared by everyone
He talked on and on of himself after the manner of failurestold of his wrongs of how friends had betrayed him of the jealousies and enmities his talents had provoked
Susan was used to these hardluck stories was used to analyzing them
With the aid of what she had worked out as to his character after she left him she had no difficulty in seeing that he was deceiving himself was excusing himself
But after all she had lived through after all she had discovered about human frailty especially in herself she was not able to criticize much less condemn anybody
Her doubts merely set her to wondering whether he might not also be selfdeceived as to his disease
Why do you think youve got consumption
asked she
I was examined at the free dispensary up in Second Avenue the other day
Ive suspected what was the matter for several months
They told me I was right
But the doctors are always making mistakes
Id not give up if I were you
Do you suppose I would if I had anything to live for
I was thinking about that a while agowhile you were asleep
Oh Im all in
Thats a cinch
So am I said she
And as weve nothing to lose and no hope why trying to do something wont make us any worse off



Weve both struck the bottom
We cant go any lower
She leaned forward and with her earnest eyes fixed upon him said Rodwhy not trytogether
He closed his eyes
Im afraid I cant be of much use to you she went on
But you can help me
And helping me will make you help yourself
I cant get up alone
Ive tried
No doubt its my fault
I guess Im one of those women that arent hard enough or selfconfident enough to do whats necessary unless Ive got some man to make me do it
Perhaps Id get thethe strength or whatever it is when I was much older
But by that time in my caseI guess itd be too late
Wont you help me Rod
He turned his head away without opening his eyes
Youve helped me many timesbeginning with the first day we met
Dont he said
I went back on you
I did sprain my ankle but I could have come
That wasnt anything replied she
You had already done a thousand times more than you needed to do
His hand wandered along the cover in her direction
She touched it
Their hands clasped
I lied about where I got the money yesterday
I didnt work
I begged
Three of usfrom the saloon they call the Owls Chutetwo Yale menone of them had been a judgeand I
Weve been begging for a week
We were going out on the road in a few daysto rob
ThenI saw youin that old womens dance hallthe Venusberg they call it
Youve come down here for me Rod
Youll take me back
Youll save me from the Venusberg
I couldnt save anybody
Susie at bottom Im N G I always wasand I knew it
Weakvain
But you
If you hadnt been a womanand such a sweet considerate one youd have never got down here
Such a fool corrected Susan
But once I get up Ill not be so again
Ill fight under the rules instead of acting in the silly way they teach us as children
Dont say those hard things Susie
Arent they true
Yes but I cant bear to hear them from a woman



I told you that you hadnt changed
But after Id looked at you a while I saw that you have
Youve got a terrible look in your eyeswonderful and terrible
You had something of that look as a childthe first time I saw you
The day after my marriage said the girl tearing her face away
It was there then he went on
But nowitsits heartbreaking Susie when your face is in repose
Ive gone through a fire that has burned up every bit of me that can burn said she
Ive been wondering if whats left isnt strong enough to do something with
I believe soif youll help me
Help you
Ihelp anybody
Dont mock me Susie
I dont know about anybody else said she sweetly and gently but I do know about me
No usetoo late
Ive lost my nerve
He began to sob
Its because Im unstrung explained he
Dont think Im a poor contemptible fool of a whiner



Yes I am a whiner
Susie I ought to have been the woman and you the man
Weakweakweak
She turned the gas low bent over him kissed his brow caressed him
Lets do the best we can she murmured
He put his arm round her
I wonder if there is any hope he said
Nothere couldnt be
Lets not hope pleaded she
Lets just do the best we can
Whatfor instance
You know the theater people
You might write a little playa sketchand you and I could act it in one of the tencent houses
Thats not a bad idea
exclaimed he
A little comedyabout fifteen or twenty minutes
And he cast about for a plot found the beginnings of one the ancient but ever acceptable commonplace of a jealous quarrel between two loversIll lay the scene in Fifth Avenuetheres nothing low life likes so much as high life
He sketched she suggested
They planned until broad day then fell asleep she half sitting up his head pillowed upon her lap
She was awakened by a sense of a parching and suffocating heat
She started up with the idea of fire in her drowsy mind
But a glance at him revealed the real cause
His face was fiery red and from his lips came rambling sentences muttered whispered that indicated the delirium of a high fever
She had first seen it when she and the night porter broke into Burlinghams room in the Walnut Street House in Cincinnati
She had seen it many a time since for while she herself had never been ill she had been surrounded by illness all the time and the commonest form of it was one of these fevers outraged natures frenzied rise against the ever denser swarms of enemies from without which the slums sent to attack her
Susan ran across the hall and roused Clara who would watch while she went for a doctor
Youd better get Einstein in Grand Street Clara advised
Why not Sacci
asked Susan
Our doctor doesnt know anything but the one thingand he doesnt like to take other kinds of cases
No get Einstein



You know hes like all of themhe wont come unless you pay in advance
How much
asked Susan
Three dollars
Ill lend you if NoIve got it
She had eleven dollars and sixty cents in the world
Einstein pronounced it a case of typhoid
You must get him to the hospital at once
Susan and Clara looked at each other in terror
To them as to the masses everywhere the hospital meant almost certain death for they assumedand they had heard again and again accusations which warranted itthat the public hospital doctors and nurses treated their patients with neglect always with downright inhumanity often
Not a day passed without their hearing some story of hospital outrage upon poverty without their seeing someoneusually some childwho was paying a heavy penalty for having been in the charity wards
Einstein understood their expression
Nonsense
said he gruffly
You girls look too sensible to believe those silly lies
Susan looked at him steadily
His eyes shifted
Of course the pay service is better said he in a strikingly different tone
How much would it be at a pay hospital
asked Susan
Twentyfive a week including my services said Doctor Einstein
But you cant afford that
Will he get the best treatment for that
The very best
As good as if he were Rockefeller or the big chap uptown
In advance I suppose
Would we ever get our money out of people if we didnt get it in advance
Weve got to live just the same as any other class
I understand said the girl
I dont blame you
I dont blame anybody for anything
She said to Clara Can you lend me twenty
Sure
Come in and get it
When she and Susan were in the hall beyond Einsteins hearing she went on Ive got the twenty and youre welcome to it
ButLorna hadnt you better In the same sort of a case whatd you do
interrupted Susan
Clara laughed
Ohof course
And she gave Susan a roll of much soiled billsa five the rest ones and twos
I can get the ambulance to take him free said Einstein
Thatll save you five for a carriage
She accepted this offer
And when the ambulance went with Spenser burning and raving in the tightly wrapped blankets Susan followed in a street car to see with her own eyes that he was properly installed
It was arranged that she could visit him at any hour and stay as long as she liked
She returned to the tenement to find the sentiment of the entire neighborhood changed toward her
Not loss of money not loss of work not dispossession nor fire nor death is the supreme calamity among the poor but sickness
It is their most frequent visitorsickness in all its many frightful formsrheumatism and consumption cancer and typhoid and the rest of the monsters
Yet never do the poor grow accustomed or hardened
And at the sight of the ambulance the neighborhood had been instantly stirred
When the reason for its coming got about Susan became the object of universal sympathy and respect
She was not sending her friend to be neglected and killed at a charity hospital she was paying twentyfive a week that he might have a chance for lifetwentyfive dollars a week
The neighbors felt that her high purpose justified any means she might be compelled to employ in getting the money
Women who had scowled and spat as she walked by spoke friendlily to her and wiped their eyes with their filthy skirts and prayed in church and synagogue that she might prosper until her man was well and the old debt paid
Clara went from group to group relating the whole story and the tears flowed at each recital
Money they had none to give but what they had they gave with that generosity which suddenly transfigures rags and filth and makes foul and distorted bodies lift in the full dignity of membership in the human family
Everywhere in those streets were seen the ravages of diseaserheumatism and rickets and goiter wen and tumors and cancer children with only one arm or one leg twisted spines sunken chests distorted hips scrofulous eyes and necks all the sad markings of povertys supreme misery the ferocious penalties of ignorance stupidity and want
But Susans burden of sorrow was not on this account overlooked
Rafferty who kept the saloon at the corner and was chief lieutenant to OFrayne the District Leader sent for her and handed her a twenty
That may help some said he
Susan hesitatedgave it back
Thank you said she and perhaps later Ill have to get it from you
But I dont want to get into debt
I already owe twenty
This aint debt explained Rafferty
Take it and forget it
I couldnt do that said the girl
But maybe youll lend it to me if I need it in a week or so
Sure said the puzzled saloon manliquor store man he preferred to be called or politician
Any amount you want
As she went away he looked after her saying to his barkeeper What do you think of that Terry
I offered her a twenty and she sidestepped
Terrys brother had got drunk a few days before had killed a woman and was on his way to the chair
Terry scowled at the boss and said Shes got a right to aint she
Dont she earn her money honest without harmin anybody but herself
There aint many that can say thatnot any that runs factories and stores and holds their noses up as if they smelt their own sins damn em
Shes a nice girl said Rafferty sauntering away
He was a broad tolerant and goodhumored man he made allowances for an employee whose brother was in for murder
Susan had little time to spend at the hospital
She must now earn fifty dollars a weeknearly double the amount she had been averaging
She must pay the twentyfive dollars for Spenser the ten dollars for her lodgings
Then there was the seven dollars which must be handed to the police captains wardman in the darkness of some entry every Thursday night
She had been paying the patrolman three dollars a week to keep him in a good humor and two dollars to the janitors wife she might risk cutting out these items for the time as both janitors wife and policeman were sympathetic
But on the closest figuring fifty a week would barely meet her absolute necessitieswould give her but seven a week for food and other expenses and nothing toward repaying Clara
Fifty dollars a week
She might have a better chance to make it could she go back to the BroadwayFifth Avenue district
But however vague other impressions from the life about her might have been there had been branded into her a deep and terrible fear of the police an omnipotence as cruel as destiny itselfindeed the visible form of that sinister god at present
Once in the pariah class once with a police record and a man or woman would have to scale the steeps of respectability up to a far loftier height than Susan ever dreamed of again reaching before that malign and relentless power would abandon its tyranny
She did not dare risk adventuring a part of town where she had no pull and where even should she by chance escape arrest Freddie Palmer would hear of her would certainly revenge himself by having her arrested and made an example of
In the Grand Street district she must stay and she must stop the nonsense and play the gamemust be businesslike
She went to see the wardman ORyan who under the guise of being a plain clothes man or detective collected and turned in to the captain who took his bit and passed up the rest all the money levied upon saloons dives procuresses dealers in unlawful goods of any kind from opium and cocaine to girls for hock shops
ORyan was a huge brute of a man his great hard face bearing the scars of battles against pistol knife bludgeon and fist
He was a sour and savage brute hated and feared by everyone for his tyrannies over the helpless poor and the helpless outcast class
He had primitive masculine notions as to feminine virtue intact despite the latter day general disposition to concede toleration and even a certain respectability to prostitutes
But by some chance which she and the other girls did not understand he treated Susan with the utmost consideration made the gangs appreciate that if they annoyed her or tried to drag her into the net of tribute in which they had enmeshed most of the girls worth while he would regard it as a personal defiance to himself
Susan waited in the back room of the saloon nearest ORyans lodgings and sent a boy to ask him to come
The boy came back with the astonishing message that she was to come to ORyans flat
Susan was so doubtful that she paused to ask the janitress about it
Its all right said the janitress
Since his wife died three years ago him and his baby lives alone
Theres his old mother but shes gone out
Hes always at home when he aint on duty
He takes care of the baby himself though it howls all the time something awful
Susan ascended found the big policeman in his shirt sleeves trying to soothe the most hideous monstrosity she had ever seena misshapen hairy animal looking like a monkey like a rat like half a dozen repulsive animals and not at all like a human being
The thing was clawing and growling and grinding its teeth
At sight of Susan it fixed malevolent eyes on her and began to snap its teeth at her
Dont mind him said ORyan
Hes only acting up queer
Susan sat not daring to look at the thing lest she should show her aversion and not knowing how to state her business when the thing was so clamorous so fiendishly uproarious
After a time ORyan succeeded in quieting it
He seemed to think some explanation was necessary
He began abruptly his gaze tenderly on the awful creature his child lying quiet now in his arms My wifeshe died some time agodied when the baby here was born
You spend a good deal of time with it said Susan
All I can spare from my job
Im afraid to trust him to anybody he being kind of different
Then too I like to take care of him
You see its all Ive got to remember her by
Im kind o tryin to do what shed want did
His lips quivered
He looked at his monstrous child
Yes I like settin here thinkinand takin care of him
This brute of a slave driver this cruel tyrant over the poor and the helplessyet thus tender and gentlethus capable of the enormous sacrifice of a great pure love
Youve got a way of lookin out of the eyes thats like her he went onand Susan had the secret of his strange forbearance toward her
I suppose youve come about being let off on the assessment
Already he knew the whole story of Rod and the hospital
Yesthats why Im bothering you said she
You neednt pay but fivefifty
I can only let you off a dollar and a halfmy bit and the captains
We pass the rest on upand we dont dare let you off
Oh I can make the money Susan said hastily
Thank you Mr ORyan but I dont want to get anyone into trouble
Weve got the right to knock off one dollar and a half said ORyan
But if we let you off the other the word would get up toto wherever the graft goesand theyd send down along the line to have merry hell raised with us
The whole things done systematic and they wont take no excuses wont allow no breaks in the system nowhere
You can see for yourselfitd go to smash if they did
Somebody must get a lot of money said Susan
Oh its dribbled outand as you go higher up I dont suppose them that gets it knows where it comes from
The whole worlds nothing but graft anyhow
Sorry I cant let you off
The thing in his lap had recovered strength for a fresh fit of malevolence
It was tearing at its hairy hideous face with its claws and was howling and shrieking the big father gently trying to soothe itfor her sake
Susan got away quickly
She halted in the deserted hall and gave way to a spasm of dry sobbingan overflow of all the emotions that had been accumulating within her
In this world of noxious and repulsive weeds what sudden startling upshooting of what beautiful flowers
Flowers where you would expect to find the most noisome weeds of all and vilest weeds where you would expect to find flowers
What a world
Howeverthe fifty a week must be gotand she must be businesslike
Most of the girls who took to the streets came direct from the tenements of New York of the foreign cities or of the factory towns of New England
And the world over tenement house life is an excellent school for the life of the streets
It prevents modesty from developing it familiarizes the eye the ear the nerves to all that is brutal it takes away from a girl every feeling that might act as a restraining influence except fearfear of maternity of disease of prison
Thus practically all the other girls had the advantage over Susan
Soon after they definitely abandoned respectability and appeared in the streets frankly members of the profession they became bold and rapacious
They had an instinctive feeling that their business was as reputable as any other more reputable than many held in high repute that it would be most reputable if it paid better and were less uncertain
They respected themselves for all things talk to the contrary in the search for the sympathy and pity most human beings crave
They despised the men as utterly as the men despised them
They bargained as shamelessly as the men
Even those who did not steal still felt that stealing was justifiable for in the streets the sex impulse shows stripped of all disguise shows as a brutal male appetite and the female feels that her yielding to it entitles her to all she can compel and cozen and crib
Susan had been unfitted for her professionas for all active unsheltered lifeby her early training
The point of view given us in our childhood remains our point of view as to all the essentials of life to the end
Reason experience the influence of contact with many phases of the world may change us seemingly but the underinstinct remains unchanged
Thus Susan had never lost and never would lose her original repugnance not even drink had ever given her the courage to approach men or to bargain with them
Her shame was a false shame like most of the shame in the worlda lack of courage not a lack of desireand however we may pretend there can be no virtue in abstinence merely through cowardice
Still if there be merit in shrinking even when the cruelest necessities were goading that merit was hers in full measure
As a matter of reason and sense she admitted that the girls who respected themselves and practiced their profession like merchants of other kinds were right were doing what she ought to do
Anyhow it was absurd to practice a profession halfheartedly
To play your game whatever it might be for all there was in itthat was the obvious first principle of success
Yetshe remained laggard and squeamish
What she had been unable to do for herself to save herself from squalor from hunger from cold she was now able to do for the sake of anotherto help the man who had enabled her to escape from that marriage more hideous than anything she had endured since or ever could be called upon to endureto save him from certain neglect and probable death in the charity hospital
Not by merely tolerating the not too impossible men who joined her without sign from her and not by merely accepting what they gave could fifty dollars a week be made
She must dress herself in franker avowal of her profession must look as expensive as her limited stock of clothing supplemented by her own taste would permit
She must flirt must bargain must ask for presents must make herself agreeable must resort to the crude female artswhich however are subtle enough to convince the selfenchanted male even in face of the discouraging fact of the mercenary arrangement
She must crush down her repugnance must be active not simply passivemust get the extra dollars by stimulating male appetites instead of simply permitting them to satisfy themselves
She must seem rather the eager mistress than the reluctant and impatient wife
And she did abruptly change her manner
There was in her as her life had shown a power of endurance an ability to sacrifice herself in order to do the thing that seemed necessary and to do it without shuffling or whining
Whatever else her career had done for her it undoubtedly had strengthened this part of her nature
And now the result of her training showed
With her superior intelligence for the first time free to make the best of her opportunities she abruptly became equal to the most consummate of her sisters in that long line of her sisterpanders to male appetites which extends from the bought wife or mistress or fiancee of the rich grandee down all the social ranks to the wife or street girl cozening for a tipsy daylaborers earnings on a Saturday night and the work girl teasing her steady company toward matrimony on the park bench or in the dark entry of the tenement
She was able to pay Clara back in less than ten days
In Spensers second week at the hospital she had him moved to better quarters and better attendance at thirty dollars a week
Although she had never got rid of her most unprofessional habit of choosing and rejecting there had been times when need forced her into straits where her lot seemed to her almost as low as that of the slavelike wives of the tenements made her almost think she would be nearly as well off were she the wife companion butt servant and general vent to some one dull and distasteful provider of a poor living
But now she no longer felt either degraded or heart sick and heart weary
And when he passed the worst crisis her spirits began to return
And when Roderick should be well and the sketch writtenand an engagement gotAh then
Life indeedlife at last
Was it this hope that gave her the strength to fight down and conquer the craving for opium
Or was it the necessity of keeping her wits and of saving every cent
Or was it because the opium habit like the drink habit like every other habit is a matter of a temperament far more than it is a matter of an appetiteand that she had the appetite but not the temperament
No doubt this had its part in the quick and complete victory
At any rate fight and conquer she did
The strongest interest always wins
She had an interest stronger than love of opiuman interest that substituted itself for opium and for drink and supplanted them
Life indeedlife at last
In his third week Rod began to round toward health
Einstein observed from the nurses charts that Susans visits were having an unfavorably exciting effect
He showed her the readings of temperature and pulse and forbade her to stay longer than five minutes at each of her two daily visits
Also she must not bring up any topic beyond the sickroom itself
One day Spenser greeted her with Ill feel better now that Ive got this off my mind
He held out to her a letter
Take that to George Fitzalan
Hes an old friend of mineone Ive done a lot for and never asked any favors of
He may be able to give you something fairly good right away
Susan glanced penetratingly at him saw he had been brooding over the source of the money that was being spent upon him
Very well said she Ill go as soon as I can
Go this afternoon said he with an invalids fretfulness
And when you come this evening you can tell me how you got on
Very well
This afternoon
But you know Rod theres not a ghost of a chance
I tell you Fitzalans my friend
Hes got some gratitude
Hell do something
I dont want you to get into a mood where youll be awfully depressed if I should fail
But youll not fail
It was evident that Spenser untaught by experience and flattered into exaggerating his importance by the solicitude and deference of doctors and nurses to a paying invalid had restored to favor his ancient enemyoptimism the certain destroyer of any man who does not shake it off
She went away depressed and worried
When she should come back with the only possible news what would be the effect upon himand he still in a critical stage
As the afternoon must be given to business she decided to go straight uptown hoping to catch Fitzalan before he went out to lunch
And twenty minutes after making this decision she was sitting in the anteroom of a suite of theatrical offices in the Empire Theater building
The girl in attendance had as usual all the airs little people assume when they are in close if menial relations with a person who being important to them therefore fills their whole small horizon
She deigned to take in Susans name and the letter
Susan seated herself at the long table and with the seeming of calmness that always veiled her in her hours of greatest agitation turned over the pages of the theatrical journals and magazines spread about in quantity
After perhaps ten silent and uninterrupted minutes a man hurried in from the outside hall strode toward the frosted glass door marked Private
With his hand reaching for the knob he halted made an impatient gesture plumped himself down at the long tableat its distant opposite end
With a sweep of the arm he cleared a space wherein he proceeded to spread papers from his pocket and to scribble upon them furiously
When Susan happened to glance at him his head was bent so low and his straw hat was tilted so far forward that she could not see his face
She observed that he was dressed attractively in an extremely light summer suit of homespun his hands were large and strong and ruddythe hands of an artist in good health
Her glance returned to the magazine
After a few minutes she looked up
She was startled to find that the man was giving her a curious searching inspectionand that he was Brent the playwrightthe same fascinating face keen cynical amusedthe same seeing eyes that in the Cafe Martin long ago had made her feel as if she were being read to her most secret thought
She dropped her glance
His voice made her start
Its been a long time since Ive seen you he was saying
She looked up not believing it possible he was addressing her
But his gaze was upon her
Thus she had not been mistaken in thinking she had seen recognition in his eyes
Yes she said with a faint smile
A longer time for you than for me said he
A good deal has happened to me she admitted
Are you on the stage
No
Not yet
The girl entered by way of the private door
Miss Lenoxthis way please
She saw Brent became instantly all smiles and bows
OhMr Fitzalan doesnt know youre here Mr Brent she cried
Then to Susan Wait a minute
She was about to reenter the private office when Brent stopped her with Let Miss Lenox go in first
I dont wish to see Mr Fitzalan yet
And he stood up took off his hat bowed gravely to Susan said Im glad to have seen you again
Susan with some color forced into her oldivory skin by nervousness and amazement went into the presence of Fitzalan
As the now obsequious girl closed the door behind her she found herself facing a youngish man with a remnant of hair that was little more than fuzz on the top of his head
His features were sharp aggressive rather hard
He might have sat for the typical successful American young man of fortyso much younger in New York than is forty elsewhere in the United Statesand so much older
He looked at Susan with a pleasant sympathetic smile
So said he youre taking care of poor Spenser are you
Tell him Ill try to run down to see him
I wish I could do something for himsomething worth while I mean
Buthis request Really Ive nothing of the kind
I couldnt possibly place youat least not at presentperhaps later on I understand interrupted Susan
Hes very ill
It would help him greatly if you would write him a few lines saying youll give me a place at the first vacancy but that it may not be soon
Ill not trouble you again
I want the letter simply to carry him over the crisis
Fitzalan hesitated rubbed his fuzzy crown with his jeweled hand
Tell him that he said finally
Im rather careful about writing letters



Yes say to him what you suggested as if it was from me
The letter will make all the difference between his believing and not believing urged Susan
He has great admiration and liking for youthinks you would do anything for him
Fitzalan frowned she saw that her insistence had rousedor rather had strengthenedsuspicion
Reallyyou must excuse me
What Ive heard about him the past year has not But no matter I cant do it
Youll let me know how hes getting on
Good day
And he gave her that polite yet positive nod of dismissal which is a necessary part of the equipment of men of affairs constantly beset as they are and ever engaged in the battle to save their chief asset time from being wasted
Susan looked at hima straight glance from gray eyes a slight smile hovering about her scarlet lips
He reddened fussed with the papers before him on the desk from which he had not risen
She opened the door closed it behind her
Brent was seated with his back full to her and was busy with his scribbling
She passed him went on to the outer door
She was waiting for his voice she knew it would come
Miss Lenox
As she turned he was advancing
His figure tall and slim and straight had the ease of movement which proclaims the man who has been everywhere and so is at home anywhere
He held out a card
I wish to see you on business
You can come at three this afternoon
Yes said Susan
Thanks said he bowing and returning to the table
She went on into the hall the card between her fingers
At the elevator she stood staring at the nameRobert Brentas if it were an inscription in a forgotten language
She was so absorbed so dazed that she did not ring the bell
The car happened to stop at that floor she entered as if it were dark
And in the street she wandered many blocks down Broadway before she realized where she was
She left the elevated and walked eastward through Grand Street
She was filled with a new and profound dissatisfaction
She felt like one awakening from a hypnotic trance
The surroundings inanimate and animate that had become endurable through custom abruptly resumed their original aspect of squalor and ugliness of repulsion and tragedy
A strangerthe ordinary unobservant feebly imaginative person going along those streets would have seen nothing but tawdriness and poverty
Susan experienced imaginative saw allsaw what another would have seen only after it was pointed out and even then but dimly
And that day her vision was no longer staled and deadened by familiarity but with vision fresh and with nerves acute
The menthe womenand saddest most tragic of all the children
When she entered her room her reawakened sensitiveness the keener for its long repose for the enormous unconscious absorption of impressions of the life about herthis morbid sensitiveness of the soul aclash with its environment reached its climax
As she threw open the door she shrank back before the odorthe powerful sensual sweet odor of chypre so effective in covering the bad smells that came up from other flats and from the noisome back yards
The room itself was neat and clean and plain with not a few evidences of her personal tastein the blending of colors in the selection of framed photographs on the walls
The one she especially liked was the largesta nude woman lying at full length her head supported by her arm her face gazing straight out of the picture upon it a baffling expressionof sadness of cynicism of amusement perhaps of experience yet of innocence
It hung upon the wall opposite the door
When she saw this picture in the department store she felt at once a sympathy between that woman and herself felt she was for the first time seeing another soul like her own one that would have understood her strange sense of innocence in the midst of her own defiled and depraved selfa core of unsullied nature
Everyone else in the world would have mocked at this notion of a something withina true self to which all that seemed to be her own self was as external as her clothing this woman of the photograph would understand
So there she hungSusans one prized possession
The question of dressing for this interview with Brent was most important
Susan gave it much thought before she began to dress changed her mind again and again in the course of dressing
Through all her vicissitudes she had never lost her interest in the art of dress or her skill at itand despite the unfavorable surroundings she had steadily improved any woman anywhere would instantly have recognized her as one of those few favored and envied women who know how to get together a toilet
She finally chose the simplest of the half dozen summer dresses she had made for herselfa plain white lawn with a short skirt
It gave her an appearance of extreme youth despite her height and the slight stoop in her shouldersa mere drooping that harmonized touchingly with the young yet weary expression of her face
To go with the dress she had a large hat of black rough straw with a very little white trimming on it
With this large black hat bewitchingly set upon her gracefullydone dark wavy hair her sad dreamy eyes her pallid skin her sweetbitter mouth with its rouged lips seemed to her to show at their best
She felt that nothing was quite so effective for her skin as a white dress
In other colorsthough she did not realizethe woman of bought kisses showed more distinctlynever brazenly as in most of the girls but still unmistakably
In white she took on a glamour of melancholyand the human countenance is capable of no expression so universally appealing as the look of melancholy that suggests the sadness underlying all life the pain that pays for pleasure the pain that pays and gets no pleasure the sorrow of the passing of all things the faint foreshadow of the doom awaiting us all
She washed the rouge from her lips studied the effect in the glass
No she said aloud without it I feel like a hypocriteand I dont look half so well
And she put the rouge on againthe scarlet dash drawn startlingly across her strange pallid face
XII AT three that afternoon she stood in the vestibule of Brents small house in Park Avenue overlooking the oblong of green between East Thirtyseventh Street and East Thirtyeighth
A most reputable looking Englishman in evening dress opened the door from her reading and her theatergoing she knew that this was a butler
He bowed her in
The entire lower floor was given to an entrance hall done in plain black walnut almost lofty of ceiling and with a grand stairway leading to the upper part of the house
There was a huge fireplace to the right a mirror filled the entire back wall a broad low seat ran all round the room
In one corner an enormous urn of dark pottery in another corner a suit of armor the helmet the breastplate and the gauntlets set with gold of ancient lackluster
The butler left her there and ascended the polished but deadfinished stairway noiselessly
Susan had never before been in so grand a room
The best private house she had ever seen was Wrights in Sutherland and while everybody else in Sutherland thought it magnificent she had felt that there was something wrong what she had not known
The grandiose New York hotels and restaurants were more showy and more pretentious far than this interior of Brents
But her unerring instinct of those born with good taste knew at first view of them that they were simply costly there were beautiful things in them fine carvings and paintings and tapestries but personality was lacking
And without personality there can be no unity without unity there can be no harmonyand without harmony no beauty
Looking round her now she had her first deep draught of esthetic delight in interior decoration
She loved this quiet dignity this large simplicitynothing that obtruded nothing that jarred everything on the same scale of dark coloring and large size
She admired the way the mirror without pretense of being anything but a mirror enhanced the spaciousness of the room and doubled the pleasure it gave by offering another and different view of it
Last of all Susan caught sight of herselfa slim slightly stooped figure its white dress and its big black hat with white trimmings making it stand out strongly against the rather somber background
In a curiously impersonal way her own sad wistful face interested her
A human beings face is a summary of his career
No man can realize at a thought what he is can epitomize in just proportion what has been made of him by experience of the multitude of moments of which life is composed
But in some moods and in some lights we do get such an allcomprehending view of ourselves in looking at our own faces
As she had instinctively felt there was a world of meaning in the contrast between her pensive brow above melancholy eyes and the bloodred line of her rouged lips
The butler descended
Mr Brent is in his library on the fourth floor said he
Will you kindly step this way maam
Instead of indicating the stairway he went to the panel next the chimney piece
She saw that it was a hidden door admitting to an elevator
She entered the door closed the elevator ascended rapidly
When it came to a stop the door opened and she was facing Brent
Thank you for coming said he with almost formal courtesy
For all her sudden shyness she cast a quick but seeing look round
It was an overcast day the soft floods of liquid lightthe beautiful light of her beloved City of the Sunpoured into the big room through an enormous window of clear glass which formed the entire north wall
Round the other walls from floor almost to lofty ceiling were books in solid rows not books with ornamental bindings but books for use books that had been and were being used
By way of furniture there were an immense lounge wide and long and deep facing the left chimney piece an immense table desk facing the north light three great chairs with tall backs one behind the table one near the end of the table the third in the corner farthest from the window a grand piano open with music upon its rack and a long carved seat at its keyboard
The huge window had a broad sill upon which was built a generous window garden fresh and lively with bright flowers
The woodwork the ceiling the furniture were of mahogany
The master of this splendid simplicity was dressed in a blue house suit of some summer material like linen
He was smoking a cigarette and offered her one from the great carved wood box filled with them on the table desk
Thanks said she
And when she had lighted it and was seated facing him as he sat at his desk she felt almost at her ease
After all while his gaze was penetrating it was also understanding we do not mind being unmasked if the unmasker at once hails us as brother
Brents eyes seemed to say to her Humanlike me
She smoked and let her gaze wander from her books to window garden from window garden to piano
You play
said he
A very little
Enough for accompaniments to simple songs
You sing
Simple songs
Ive had but a few lessons from a smalltown teacher
Let me hear
She went to the piano laid her cigarette in a tray ready beside the music rack
She gave him the Gipsy Queen which she liked because it expressed her own passion of revolt against restraints of every conventional kind and her love for the open air and open sky
He somehow took away all feeling of embarrassment she felt so strongly that he understood and was big enough not to have it anywhere in him to laugh at anything sincere
When she finished she resumed her cigarette and returned to the chair near his
Its as I thought said he
Your voice can be trainedto speak I mean
I dont know as to its singing value



Have you good health
I never have even colds
Yes Im strong
Youll need it
I have needed it said she
Into her face came the sad bitter expression with its curious relief of a faint cynical smile
He leaned back in his chair and looked at her through a cloud of smoke
She saw that his eyes were not gray as she had thought but brown a hazel brown with points of light sparkling in the irises and taking away all the suggestion of weakness and sentimentality that makes pure brown eyes unsatisfactory in a man
He said slowly When I saw youin the Martinyou were on the way down
You went I see
She nodded
Im still there
You like it
You wish to stay
She shook her head smilingly
No but I can stay if its necessary
Ive discovered that Ive got the health and the nerves for anything
Thats a great discovery



Well youll soon be on your way up



Do you wish to know why I spoke to you this morningWhy I remembered you
Why
Because of the expression of your eyeswhen your face is in repose
She felt no shynessand no sense of necessity of responding to a compliment for his tone forbade any thought of flattery
She lowered her gaze to conceal the thoughts his words broughtthe memories of the things that had caused her eyes to look as Rod and now Brent said
Such an expression the playwright went on must mean character
I am sick and tired of the vanity of these actresses who can act just enough never to be able to learn to act well
Im going to try an experiment with you
Ive tried it several times butNo matter
Im not discouraged
I never give up



Can you stand being alone
I spend most of my time alone
I prefer it
I thought so
Yesyoull do
Only the few who can stand being alone ever get anywhere
Everything worth while is done alone
The big battleit isnt fought in the field but by the man sitting alone in his tent working it all out
The bridgethe tunnel through the great mountainsthe railwaythe huge business enterpriseall done by the man alone thinking plotting to the last detail
Its the same way with the novel the picture the statue the playwriting it acting itall done by someone alone shut in with his imagination and his tools
I saw that you were one of the lonely ones
All you need is a chance
Youd surely get it sooner or later
Perhaps I can bring it a little sooner



How much do you need to live on
I must have fifty dollars a weekif I go on atas I am now
If you wish to take all my timethen forty
He smiled in a puzzled way
The police she explained
I need ten Certainlycertainly cried he
I understandperfectly
How stupid of me
Ill want all your time
So its to be forty dollars a week
When can you begin
Susan reflected
I cant go into anything thatll mean a long time she said
Im waiting for a mana friend of mine to get well
Then were going to do something together
Brent made an impatient gesture
An actor
Well I suppose I can get him something to do
But I dont want you to be under the influence of any of these absurd creatures who think they know what acting iswhen they merely know how to dress themselves in different suits of clothes and strut themselves about the stage
Theyd rather die than give up their own feeble foolish little identities
Ill see that your actor friend is taken care of but you must keep away from himfor the time at least
Hes all Ive got
Hes an old friend
Youcare for him
I used to
And lately I found him againafter we had been separated a long time
Were going to help each other up
Ohhes down and out oh
Why
Drinkand hard luck
Not hard luck
That helps a man
It has helped you
It has made you what you are
What am I
asked Susan
Brent smiled mysteriously
Thats what were going to find out said he
Theres no human being who has ever had a future unless he or she had a pastand the severer the past the more splendid the future
Susan was attending with all her senses
This man was putting into words her own inarticulate instincts
A past he went on in his sharp dogmatic way either breaks or makes
You go into the crucible a mere ore a possibility
You come out slag or steel
He was standing now looking down at her with quizzical eyes
Youre about due to leave the pot said he
And Ive hopes that youre steel
If not He shrugged his shouldersYoull have had forty a week for your time and Ill have gained useful experience
Susan gazed at him as if she doubted her eyes and ears
What do you want me to do
she presently inquired
Learn the art of actingwhich consists of two parts
First you must learn to actthousands of the profession do that
Second you must learn not to actand so far I know there arent a dozen in the whole world whove got that far along
Ive written a play I think well of
I want to have it done properlyit and several other plays I intend to write
Im going to give you a chance to become famousbetter still great
Susan looked at him incredulously
Do you know who I am
she asked at last
Certainly
Her eyes lowered the faintest tinge of red changed the amberwhite pallor of her cheeks her bosom rose and fell quickly
I dont mean he went on that I know any of the details of your experience
I only know the results as they are written in your face
The details are unimportant
When I say I know who you are I mean I know that you are a woman who has suffered whose heart has been broken by suffering but not her spirit
Of where you came from or how youve lived I know nothing
And its none of my businessno more than its the publics business where I came from and how Ive learned to write plays
Well whether he was guessing any part of the truth or all of it certainly what she had said about the police and now this sweeping statement of his attitude toward her freed her of the necessity of disclosing herself
She eagerly tried to dismiss the thoughts that had been making her most uneasy
She said You think I can learn to act
That of course replied he
Any intelligent person can learn to actand also most persons who have no more intelligence in their heads than they have in their feet
Ill guarantee you some sort of career
What Im interested to find out is whether you can learn not to act
I believe you can
But He laughed in selfmockery
Ive made several absurd mistakes in that direction



You have led a life in which most women become the cheapest sort of liarsworse liars even than is the usual respectable person because they havent the restraint of fearing loss of reputation
Why is it you have not become a liar
Susan laughed
Im sure I dont know
Perhaps because lying is such a tax on the memory
May I have another cigarette
He held the match for her
You dont paintexcept your lips he went on though you have no color
And you dont wear cheap finery
And while you use a strong scent its not one of the cheap and nasty kindits sensual without being slimy
And you dont use the kind of words one always hears in your circle
Susan looked immensely relieved
Then you do know who I am
she cried
You didnt suppose I thought you fresh from a fashionable boarding school did you
Id hardly look there for an actress who could act
Youve got experienceexperienceexperiencewritten all over your facesadly satirically scornfully gayly bitterly
And what I want is experiencenot merely having been through things but having been through them understandingly
Youll help me in my experiment
He looked astonished then irritated when the girl instead of accepting eagerly drew back in her chair and seemed to be debating
His irritation showed still more plainly when she finally said That depends on him
And hehe thinks you dont like him
Whats his name
said Brent in his abrupt intense fashion
Whats his name
SpenserRoderick Spenser
Brent looked vague
He used to be on the Herald
He writes plays
Ohyes
I remember
Hes a weak fool
Susan abruptly straightened an ominous look in eyes and brow
Brent made an impatient gesture
Beg pardon
Why be sensitive about him
Obviously because you know Im right
I said fool not ass
Hes clever but ridiculously vain
I dont dislike him
I dont care anything about himor about anybody else in the world
No man does who amounts to anything
With a career its as Jesus saidleave father and mother husband and wifeland ox everythingand follow it
What for
said Susan
To save your soul
To be a somebody to be strong
To be able to give to anybody and everybodywhatever they need
To be happy
Are you happy
No he admitted
But Im growing in that direction



Dont waste yourself on StevensI beg pardon Spenser
Youre bigger than that
Hes a small man with large dreamsa hopeless misfit
Small dreams for small men large dreams for he laughedyou and meour sort
Susan echoed his laugh but faintheartedly
Ive watched your name in the papers she said sincerely unconscious of flattery
Ive seen you grow more and more famous
Butif there had been anything in me would I have gone down and down
How old are you
About twentyone
Only twentyone and that look in your face
Magnificent
I dont believe Im to be disappointed this time
You ask why youve gone down
You havent
Youve gone through
Down she insisted sadly
Nonsense
The sootll rub off the steel
She lifted her head eagerly
Her own secret thought put into words
You cant make steel without soot and dirt
You cant make anything without dirt
Thats why the nice prim silly worlds full of cabinets exhibiting little chips of raw material polished up neatly in one or two spots
Thats why there are so few men and womenand those few have had to make themselves or are made by accident
Youre an accident I suppose
The women who amount to anything usually are
The last actress I tried to do anything with might have become a somebody if it hadnt been for one thing She had a hankering for respectabilitya yearning to be a society personto be thought well of by society people
It did for her
Ill not sink on that rock said Susan cheerfully
No secret longing for social position
None
Even if I would I couldnt
Thats one heavy handicap out of the way
But Ill not let myself begin to hope until I find out whether youve got incurable and unteachable vanity
If you havethen no hope
If you haventtheres a fighting chance
You forget my compact Susan reminded him
Ohthe loverSpenser
Brent reflected strolled to the big window his hands deep in his pockets
Susan took advantage of his back to give way to her own feelings of utter amazement and incredulity
She certainly was not dreaming
And the man gazing out at the window was certainly flesh and blooda great man if voluble and eccentric
Perhaps to act and speak as one pleased was one of the signs of greatness one of its perquisites
Was he amusing himself with her
Was he perchance taken with her physically and employing these extraordinary methods as ways of approach
She had seen many peculiarities of sexapproach in mensome grotesque many terrible all beyond comprehension
Was this another such
He wheeled suddenly surprised her eyes upon him
He burst out laughing and she felt that he had read her thoughts
However he merely said Have you anything to suggestabout Spenser
I cant even tell him of your offer now
Hes very illand sensitive about you
About me
How ridiculous
Im always coming across men I dont know who are full of venom toward me
I suppose he thinks I crowded him
No matter
Youre sure youre not fancying yourself in love with him
No I am not in love with him
He has changedand so have I
He smiled at her
Especially in the last hour
he suggested
I had changed before that
I had been changing right along
But I didnt realize it fully until you talked with meno until after you gave me your card this morning
You saw a chancea hopeeh
She nodded
And at once became all nerves and courage



As to SpenserIll have some play carpenter sent to collaborate with him and set him up in the play business
You know its a business as well as an art
And the chromos sell better than the oil paintingsexcept the finest ones
Its my chromos that have earned me the means and the leisure to try oils
Hed never consent
Hes very proud
Vain you mean
Pride will consent to anything as a means to an end
Its vanity thats squeamish and haughty
He neednt know
But I couldnt discuss any change with him until hes much better
Ill send the play carpenter to himget Fitzalan to send one of his carpenters
Brent smiled
You dont think hell hang back because of the compact do you
Susan flushed painfully
No she admitted in a low voice
Brent was still smiling at her and the smile was cynical
But his tone soothed where his words would have wounded as he went on A man of his sortan average therearetwokindsofwomen goodandbad sort of manhas but one use for a woman of your sort
I know that said Susan
Do you mind it
Not much
Id not mind it at all if I felt that I was somebody
Brent put his hand on her shoulder
Youll do Miss Lenox he said with quiet heartiness
You may not be so big a somebody as you and I would like
But youll count as one all right
She looked at him with intense appeal in her eyes
Why
she said earnestly
Why do you do this
He smiled gravely down at heras gravely as Brent could smilewith the quizzical suggestion never absent from his handsome face so full of life and intelligence
Ive been observing your uneasiness said he
Now listen
It would be impossible for you to judge me to understand me
You are young and as yet small
I am forty and have lived twentyfive of my forty years intensely
So dont fall into the error of shallow people and size me up by your own foolish little standards
Do you see what I mean
Susans candid face revealed her guilt
Yes said she rather humbly
I see you do understand said he
And thats a good sign
Most people hearing what I said would have disregarded it as merely my vanity would have gone on with their silly judging would have set me down as a conceited ass who by some accident had got a reputation
But to proceedI have not chosen you on impulse
Long and patient study has made me able to judge character by the face as a horse dealer can judge horses by looking at them
I dont need to read every line of a book to know whether its wise or foolish worth while or not
I dont need to know a human being for years or for hours or for minutes even before I can measure certain things
I measured you
Its like astronomy
An astronomer wants to get the orbit of a star
He takes its position twiceand from the two observations he can calculate the orbit to the inch
Ive got three observations of your orbit
Enoughand to spare
I shant misunderstand again said Susan
One thing more insisted Brent
In our relations we are to be not man and woman but master and pupil
I shant waste your time with anyother matters
It was Susans turn to laugh
Thats your polite way of warning me not to waste any of your time withother matters
Precisely conceded he
A man in my positiona man in any sort of position for that matteris much annoyed by women trying to use their sex with him
I wished to make it clear at the outset that That I could gain nothing by neglecting the trade of actress for the trade of woman interrupted Susan
I understand perfectly
He put out his hand
I see that at least well get on together
Ill have Fitzalan send the carpenter to your friend at once
Today
exclaimed Susan in surprise and delight
Why not
He arranged paper and pen
Sit here and write Spensers address and your own
Your salary begins with today
Ill have my secretary mail you a check
And as soon as I can see you again Ill send you a telegram
Meanwhile He rummaged among a lot of paper bound plays on the table Heres Cavalleria Rusticana
Read it with a view to yourself as either Santuzzao or Lola
Study her first entrancewhat you would do with it
Dont be frightened
I expect nothing from younothing whatever
Im glad you know nothing about acting
Youll have the less to unlearn
They had been moving towards the elevator
He shook hands again and after adjusting the mechanism for the descent closed the door
As it was closing she saw in his expression that his mind had already dismissed her for some one of the many other matters that crowded his life
XIII THE Susan Lenox who left Delancey Street at half past two that afternoon to call upon Robert Brent was not the Susan Lenox who returned to Delancey Street at halfpast five
A man is wandering lost in a cave is groping this way and that in absolute darkness with flagging hope and fainting strengthhas reached the point where he wonders at his own folly in keeping on movingis persuading himself that the sensible thing would be to lie down and give up
He sees a gleam of light
Is it a reality
Is it an illusionone more of the illusions that have lured him on and on
He does not know but instantly a fire sweeps through him warming his dying strength into vigor
So it was with Susan
The pariah classthe real pariah classdoes not consist of merely the women formally put beyond the pale for violations of conventional morality and the men with the brand of thief or gambler upon them
Our social our industrial system has made it far vaster
It includes almost the whole populationall those who sell body or brain or soul in an uncertain market for uncertain hire to gain the days food and clothing the nights shelter
This vast mass floats hither and yon on the tides and currents of destiny
Now it halts resting sluggishly in a dead calm again it moves sometimes slowly sometimes under the lash of tempest
But it is ever the same vast inertia with no particle of it possessing an aim beyond keeping afloat and alive
Susan had been an atom a spray of weed in this Sargasso Sea
If you observe a huge unwieldy crowd so closely packed that nothing can be done with it and it can do nothing with itself you will note three different types
There are the entirely inertand they make up most of the crowd
They do not resist they helplessly move this way and that as the chance waves of motion prompt
Of this type is the overwhelming majority of the human race
Here and there in the mass you will see examples of a second type
These are individuals who are restive and resentful under the sense of helplessness and impotence
They struggle now gently now furiously
They thrust backward or forward or to one side
They thresh about
But nothing comes of their efforts beyond a brief agitation soon dying away in ripples
The inertia of the mass and their own lack of purpose conquer them
Occasionally one of these grows so angry and so violent that the surrounding inertia quickens into purposethe purpose of making an end of this agitation which is serving only to increase the general discomfort
And the agitator is trampled down disappears perhaps silently perhaps with groan or shriek
Continue to look at this crowd so pitiful so terrible such a melancholy waste of incalculable powercontinue to observe and you may chance upon an example of the third type
You are likely at first to confuse the third type with the second for they seem to be much alike
Here and there of the resentful strugglers will be one whose resentment is intelligent
He struggles but it is not aimless struggle
He has seen or suspected in a definite direction a point where he would be more or less free perhaps entirely free
He realizes how he is hemmed in realizes how difficult how dangerous will be his endeavor to get to that point
And he proceeds to try to minimize or overcome the difficulties the dangers
He struggles now gently now earnestly now violentlybut always toward his fixed objective
He is driven back to one side is almost overwhelmed
He causes commotions that threaten to engulf him and must pause or retreat until they have calmed
You may have to watch him long before you discover that where other strugglers have been aimless he aims and resolves
And little by little he gains makes progress toward his goaland once in a long while one such reaches that goal
It is triumph success
Susan young inexperienced dazed now too despondent now too hopeful now too gentle and again too infuriatedSusan had been alternating between inertia and purposeless struggle
Brent had given her the thing she lackedhad given her a definite concrete tangible purpose
He had shown her the place where if she should arrive she might be free of that hideous slavery of the miserable mass and he had inspired her with the hope that she could reach it
And that was the Susan Lenox who came back to the little room in Delancey Street at halfpast five
Curiously while she was thinking much about Brent she was thinking even more about Burlinghamabout their long talks on the show boat and in their wanderings in Louisville and Cincinnati
His philosophy his teachingsthe wisdom he had but was unable to applybegan to come back to her
It was not strange that she should remember it for she had admired him intensely and had listened to his every word and she was then at the time when the memory takes its clearest and strongest impressions
The strangeness lay in the suddenness with which Burlingham so long dead suddenly came to life changed from a sad and tender memory to a vivid possibility advising her helping her urging her on
Clara dressed to go to dinner with her lover was waiting to arrange about their meeting to make together the usual rounds in the evening
Ive got an hour before Im due at the hospital said Susan
Lets go down to Kellys for a drink
While they were going and as they sat in the clean little back room of Kellys well ordered and select corner saloon Clara gave her all the news she had gathered in an afternoon of visits among their acquaintanceshow because of a neighborhood complaint there was to be a fake raid on Gussies opium joint at midnight that Mazie had caught a frightful fever and that Nettie was dying in Governeur of the stab in the stomach her lover had given her at a ball three nights before that the police had raised the tariff for sporting houses and would collect seventyfive and a hundred a month protection money where the charge had been twentyfive and fiftythe plea was that the reformers just elected and hoping for one term only were compelling a larger fund from vice than the old steady yearinandyearout ruling crowd
And they may raise us to fifteen a week said Clara though I doubt it
Theyll not cut off their nose to spite their face
If they raised the rate for the streets theyd drive twothirds of the girls back to the factories and sweat shops
Youre not listening Lorna
Whats up
Nothing
Your fellows not had a relapse
Nonothing
Need some money
I can lend you ten
I did have twenty but I gave Sallie and that little Jew girl whos her side partner ten for the bail bondsman
They got pinched last night for not paying up to the police
Theyve gone crazy about that prize fighterat least he thinks he isthat Joe OMara and theyre giving him every cent they make
Its funny about Sallie
Shes a Catholic and goes to mass regular
And she keeps straight on Sundayno moneyll tempt herIve seen it tried
Do you want the ten
No
Ive got plenty
We must look in at that Jolly Rovers ball tonight
Therell be a lot of fellows with money there
We can sure pull off something pretty good
Anyhow well have fun
But you dont care for the dances
Well they are a waste of time
And because the men pay for a few bum drinks and dance with a girl they dont want to give up anything more
Hows she to live I want to know
Would you like to get out of this Clara
interrupted Susan coming out of her absentmindedness
Would I
But whats the use of talking
But I mean would you really Ohif there was something better
But is there
I dont see how Id be as well off respectable
As I said to the rescue woman what is there in it for a reclaimed girl as they call it
When they ask a man to reform they can offer him somethingand he can go on up and up
But not for girls
Nothing doing but charity and pity and the second table and the back door
I can make more money at this and have a better time as long as my looks last
And Ive turned down already a couple of chances to marrymen that wouldnt have looked at me if Id been in a store or a factory or living out
I may marry
Dont do that said Susan
Marriage makes brutes of men and slaves of women
You speak as if you knew
I do said Susan in a tone that forbade question
I aint exactly stuck on the idea myself pursued Clara
And if I dont why when my looks are gone where am I worse off than Id be at the same age as a working girl
If I have to get a job then I can get itand Ill not be broken down like the respectable women at thirtythose that work or those that slop round boozing and neglecting their children while their husbands work
Of course theres chances against you in this business
But so there is in every business
Suppose I worked in a factory and lost a leg in the machinery like that girl of Mantell the bricklayers
Suppose I get an awful diseaseto hear some people talk youd think there wasnt any chances of death or horrible diseases at respectable work
Why how could anybody be worse off than if they got lung trouble and boils as big as your fist like those girls over in the tobacco factory
You neednt tell me about work said Susan
The streets are full of wrecks from workand the hospitalsand the graveyard over on the Island
You can always go to that slavery
But I mean a respectable life with everything better
Has one of those swell women from uptown been after you
No
This isnt a pious pipe dream
You sound like it
One of them swell silk smarties got at me when I was in the hospital with the fever
She was a birdshe was
She handed me a line of grand talk and I being sort of weak with sickness took it in
Well when she got right down to business what did she want me to do
Be a dressmaker or a ladys maid
Me work twelve fourteen God knows how many hoursbe too tired to have any funtravel round with dead onesbe a doormat for a lot of cheap people that are tryin to make out they aint human like the rest of us
Me And when I said No thank you what do you think
Did she offer to get you a good home in the country
said Susan
That was it
The country The nerve of her
But I called her bluff all right all right
I says to her Are you going to the country to live
And she reared at me daring to question her and said she wasnt
Youd find it dead slow wouldnt you
says I
And she kind o laughed and looked almost human
Then says I no more am I going to the country
Ill take my chances in little old New York I says
I should think so
exclaimed Susan
Id like to be respectable if I could afford it
But theres nothing in that game for poor girls unless they havent got no looks to sell and have to sell the rest of themselves for some factory boss to get rich off of while they get poorer and weaker every day
And when they say God to me I say Whos he
He must be somebody that lives up on Fifth Avenue
We aint seen him down our way
I mean go on the stage resumed Susan
I wouldnt mind if I could get in right
Everything in this world depends on getting in right
I was born four flights up in a tenement and Ive been in wrong ever since
I was in wrong from the beginning too said Susan thoughtfully
In wrongthats it exactly
Claras eyes again became eager with the hope of a peep into the mystery of Susans origin
But Susan went on Yes Ive always been in wrong
Always
Oh no declared Clara
Youve got educationand mannersand ladylike instincts
Im at home here
I was never so well off in my life
Im you might say on my way up in the world
Most of us girls arelike the fellow that aint got nothing to eat or no place to sleep and gets into jailhes better off aint he
But youyou dont belong here at all
I belong anywhereand everywhereand nowhere said Susan
Yes I belong here
Ive got a chance uptown
If it pans out Ill let you in
Clara looked at her wistfully
Clara had a wicked temper when she was in liquor and had the ordinary human proneness to lying to mischievous gossip and to utter laziness
The life she led compelling cleanliness and neatness and a certain amount of thrift under penalty of instant ruin had done her much good in saving her from going to pieces and becoming the ordinary sloven and drag on the energies of some man
Lorna she now said I do believe you like me a little
More than that Susan assured her
Youve saved me from being hardhearted
I must go to the hospital
So long
How about this evening
asked Clara
Im staying in
Ive got something to do
WellI may be home earlyunless I go to the ball
Susan was refused admittance at the hospital
Spenser they said had received a caller had taxed his strength enough for the day
Nor would it be worth while to return in the morning
The same caller was coming again
Spenser had said she was to come in the afternoon
She received this cheerfully yet not without a certain sense of hurtwhich however did not last long
When she was admitted to Spenser the following afternoon she faced him guiltilyfor the thoughts Brent had set to bubbling and boiling in her
And her guilt showed in the tone of her greeting in the reluctance and forced intensity of her kiss and embrace
She had compressed into the five most receptive years of a human beings life an experience that was for one of her intelligence and education equal to many times five years of ordinary life
And this experience had developed her instinct for concealing her deep feelings into a fixed habit
But it had not made her a liarhad not robbed her of her fundamental courage and selfrespect which made her shrink in disdain from deceiving anyone who seemed to her to have the right to frankness
Spenser she felt as always had that rightthis though he had not been frank with her still that was a matter for his own conscience and did not affect her conscience as to what was courageous and honorable toward him
So had he been observing he must have seen that something was wrong
But he was far too excited about his own affairs to note her
My lucks turned
cried he after kissing her with enthusiasm
Fitzalan has sent Jack Sperry to me and were to collaborate on a play
I told you Fitz was the real thing
Susan turned hastily away to hide her telltale face
Whos Sperry
asked she to gain time for selfcontrol
Oh Hes a playsmithand a bear at it
He has knocked together half a dozen successes
Hell supply the trade experience that I lack and Fitzalan will be sure to put on our piece
Youre a lot betterarent you
Better
Im almost well
He certainly had made a sudden stride toward health
By way of doing something progressive he had had a shave and that had restored the look of youth to his faceor rather had uncovered it
A strong handsome face it wasmuch handsomer than Brentsand with the subtle moral weakness of optimistic vanity well concealed
Yes much handsomer than Brents which wasnt really handsome at allyet was superbly handsomer alsothe handsomeness that comes from being through and through a somebody
She saw again why she had cared for Rod so deeply but she also saw why she could not care again at least not in that same absorbed selfeffacing way
Physical attractionyes
And a certain remnant of the feeling of comradeship too
But never again utter belief worshipful admirationor any other degree of belief or admiration beyond the mild and critical
She herself had grown
Also Brents penetrating and just analysis of Spenser had put clearly before her precisely what he wasprecisely what she herself had been vaguely thinking of him
As he talked on and on of Sperrys visit and the new projects she listened looking at his character in the light Brent had turned upon itBrent who had in a few brief moments turned such floods of light upon so many things she had been seeing dimly or not at all
Moderate prosperity and moderate adversity bring out the best there is in a man the extreme of either brings out his worst
The actual man is the best there is in him and not the worst but it is one of the tragedies of life that those who have once seen his worst ever afterward have sense of it chiefly and cannot return to the feeling they had for him when his worst was undreamed of
Im not in love with Brent thought Susan
But having known him I cant ever any more care for Rod
He seems small beside Brentand he is small
Spenser in his optimistic dreaming aloud had reached a point where it was necessary to assign Susan a role in his dazzling career
Youll not have to go on the stage said he
Ill look out for you
By next week Sperry and I will have got together a scenario for the play and when Sperry reads it to Fitzalan well get an advance of at least five hundred
So you and I will take a nice room and bath uptownas a starterand well be happy againhappier than before
No Im going to support myself said Susan promptly
Trash
cried Spenser smiling tenderly at her
Do you suppose Id allow you to mix up in stage life
Youve forgotten how jealous I am of you
You dont know what Ive suffered since Ive been here sick brooding over what youre doing to She laid her fingers on his lips
Whats the use of fretting about anything that has to be
said she smilingly
Im going to support myself
You may as well make up your mind to it
Plenty of time to argue that out said he and his tone forecast his verdict on the arguing
And he changed the subject by saying I see you still cling to your fad of looking fascinating about the feet
That was one of the reasons I never could trust you
A girl with as charming feet and ankles as you have and so much pride in getting them up well simply cannot be trustworthy
He laughed
No you were made to be taken care of my dear
She did not press the matter
She had taken her stand that was enough for the present
After an hour with him she went home to get herself something to eat on her gas stove
Spensers confidence in the future did not move her even to the extent of laying out half a dollar on a restaurant dinner
Women have the habit of believing in the optimistic outpourings of egotistical men and often hasten men along the road to ruin by proclaiming this belief and acting upon it
But not intelligent women of experience that sort of woman by checking optimistic husbands fathers sons lovers has even put off ruinsometimes until death has had the chance to save the optimist from the inevitable consequence of his folly
When she finished her chop and vegetable instead of lighting a cigarette and lingering over a cup of black coffee she quickly straightened up and began upon the play Brent had given her
She had read it several times the night before and again and again during the day
But not until now did she feel sufficiently calmed down from her agitations of thought and emotion to attack the play understandingly
Thanks to defective education the most enlightened of us go through life much like a dimsighted man who has no spectacles
Almost the whole of the wonderful panorama of the universe is unseen by us or if seen is but partially understood or absurdly misunderstood
When it comes to the subtler things the things of science and art rarely indeed is there anyone who has the necessary training to get more than the crudest most imperfect pleasure from them
What little training we have is so limping that it spoils the charm of mystery with which savage ignorance invests the universe from blade of grass to star and does not put in place of that broken charm the profounder and loftier joy of understanding
To take for illustration the most widely diffused of all the higher arts and sciences reading How many socalled educated people can read understandingly even a novel the form of literature designed to make the least demand upon the mind
People say they have read but when questioned they show that they have got merely a glimmering of the real action the faintest hint of style and characterization have perhaps noted some stray epigram which they quote with evidently faulty grasp of its meaning
When the thing read is a play almost no one can get from it a coherent notion of what it is about
Most of us have nothing that can justly be called imagination our early training at home and at school killed in the shoot that finest plant of the minds garden
So there is no ability to fill in the picture which the dramatic author draws in outline
Susan had not seen Cavalleria Rusticana either as play or as opera
But when she and Spenser were together in Fortyfourth Street she had read plays and had dreamed over them the talk had been almost altogether of playsof writing plays of constructing scenes of productions of acting of all the many aspects of the theater
Spenser read scenes to her got her to help him with criticism and she was present when he went over his work with Drumley Riggs Townsend and the others
Thus reading a play was no untried art to her
She read Cavalleria through slowly taking about an hour to it
She saw now why Brent had given it to her as the primer lessonthe simple elemental story of a peasant girls ruin under promise of marriage of her lovers wearying of one who had only crude physical charm of his being attracted by a young married woman gay as well as pretty offering the security in intrigue that an unmarried woman could not offer
Such a play is at once the easiest and the hardest to actthe easiest because every audience understands it perfectly and supplies unconsciously almost any defect in the acting the hardest because any actor with the education necessary to acting well finds it next to impossible to divest himself or herself of the sophistications of education and get back to the elemental animal
Santuzza or Lola
Susan debated
Santuzza was the big and easy part Lola the smaller part was of the kind that is usually neglected
But Susan saw possibilities in the character of the woman who won Turiddu awaythe triumphant woman
The two women represented the two kinds of lovethe love that is serious the love that is light
And experience had taught her why it is that human nature soon tires of intensity turns to frivolity
She felt that if she could act she would try to show that not Turiddus fickleness nor his contempt of the woman who had yielded but Santuzzas sad intensity and Lolas butterfly gayety had cost Santuzza her lover and her lover his life
So it was not Santuzzas but Lolas first entrance that she studied
In the next mornings mail under cover addressed Miss Susan Lenox care of Miss Lorna Sackville as she had written it for Brent came the promised check for forty dollars
It was signed John P Garvey Secretary and was inclosed with a note bearing the same signature DEAR MADAM Herewith I send you a check for forty dollars for the first weeks salary under your arrangement with Mr Brent
No receipt is necessary
Until further notice a check for the same amount will be mailed you each Thursday
Unless you receive notice to the contrary please call as before at three oclock next Wednesday
It made her nervous to think of those five days before she should see Brent
He had assured her he would expect nothing from her but she felt she must be able to show him that she had not been wasting her timehis time the time for which he was paying nearly six dollars a day
She must work every waking hour except the two hours each day at the hospital
She recalled what Brent had said about the advantage of being contented aloneand how everything worth doing must be done in solitude
She had never thought about her own feelings as to company and solitude as it was not her habit to think about herself
But now she realized how solitary she had been and how it had bred in her habits of thinking and readingand how valuable these habits would be to her in her work
There was Rod for example
He hated being alone must have someone around even when he was writing and he had no taste for order or system
She understood why it was so hard for him to stick at anything to put anything through to the finish
With her fondness for being alone with her passion for reading and thinking about what she read surely she ought soon to begin to accomplish somethingif there was any ability in her
She found Rod in higher spirits
Several ideas for his play had come to him he already saw it acted successful drawing crowded houses bringing him in anywhere from five hundred to a thousand a week
She was not troubled hunting for things to talk about with himshe who could think of but one thing and that a secret from him
He talked his play a steady stream with not a seeing glance at her or a question about her
She watched the little clock at the side of the bed
At the end of an hour to the minute she interrupted him in the middle of a sentence
I must go now said she rising
Sit down he cried
You can stay all day
The doctor says it will do me good to have you to talk with
And Sperry isnt coming until tomorrow
I cant do it said she
I must go
He misunderstood her avoiding glance
Now Susiesit down there commanded he
Weve got plenty of money
Youyou neednt bother about it any more
Were not settled yet said she
Until we are Id not dare take the risk
She was subtly adroit by chance not by design
Risk
exclaimed he angrily
Theres no risk
Ive as good as got the advance money
Sit down
She hesitated
Dont be angry pleaded she in a voice that faltered
But I must go
Into his eyes came the gleam of distrust and jealousy
Look at me he ordered
With some difficulty she forced her eyes to meet his
Have you got a lover
No
Then where do you get the money were living on
He counted on her being too humiliated to answer in words
Instead of the hanging head and burning cheeks he saw clear steady eyes heard a calm gentle and dignified voice say In the streets
His eyes dropped and a look of abject shame made his face pitiable
Good Heavens he muttered
How low we are
Weve been doing the best we could said she simply
Isnt there any decency anywhere in you
he flashed out eagerly seizing the chance to forget his own shame in contemplating her greater degradation
She looked out of the window
There was something terrible in the calmness of her profile
She finally said in an even pensive voice You have been intimate with a great many women Rod
But you have never got acquainted with a single one
He laughed goodhumoredly
Oh yes I have
Ive learned that every woman is at heart a rake as Mr Jingle Pope says
She looked at him again her face now curiously lighted by her slow faint smile
Perhaps they showed you only what they thought youd be able to appreciate she suggested
He took this as evidence of her being jealous of him
Tell me Susan did you leave mein Fortyfourth Streetbecause you thought or heard I wasnt true to you
What did Drumley tell you
I asked him as you said in your note
He told me he knew no reason
So Drumley had decided it was best Rod should not know why she left
Well perhapsprobablyDrumley was right
But there was no reason why he shouldnt know the truth now
I left said she because I saw we were bad for each other
This amused him
She saw that he did not believe
It wounded her but she smiled carelessly
Her smile encouraged him to say I couldnt quite make up my mind whether the reason was jealousy or because you had the soul of a shameless woman
You see I know human nature and I know that a woman who once crosses the line never crosses back
Ill always have to watch you my dear
But somehow I like it
I guess you haveyou and I havea rotten streak in us
We were brought up too strictly
That always makes one either too firm or too loose
I used to think I liked good women
But I dont
They bore me
That shows Im rotten
Or that your idea of whats good isis mistaken
You dont pretend that you havent done wrong
cried Rod
I might have done worse replied she
I might have wronged others
No Rod I cant honestly say Ive ever felt wicked
Why what brought you here
She reflected a moment then smiled
Two things brought me down said she
In the first place I wasnt raised right
I was raised as a lady instead of as a human being
So I didnt know how to meet the conditions of life
In the second place her smile returned broadenedI was tootoo whats called good
Pity about you
mocked he
Being whats called good is all very well if youre independent or if youve got a husband or a father to do lifes dirty work for youor perhaps if you happen to be in some profession like preaching or teachingthough I dont believe the socalled goodness would let you get very far even as a preacher
In most lines to practice what were taught as children would be to go to the bottom like a stone
You know this is a hard world Rod
Its full of men and women fighting desperately for food and clothes and a roof to cover themfighting each other
And to get on youve got to have the courage and the indifference to your fellow beings thatll enable you to do it
Theres a lot of truth in that admitted Spenser
If Id not been such a good fellow as they call ita fellow everybody likedif Id been like Brent for instanceBrent who never would have any friends who never would do anything for anybody but himself who hadnt a thought except for his careerwhy Id be where he is
It was at the tip of Susans tongue to say Yesstrongable to help othersable to do things worth while
But she did not speak
Rod went on Im not going to be a fool any longer
Im going to be too busy to have friends or to help people or to do anything but push my own interests
Susan indifferent to being thus wholly misunderstood was again moving toward the door
Ill be back this evening as usual said she
Spensers face became hard and lowering Youre going to stay here now or youre not coming back said he
You can take your choice
Do you want me to know youve got the soul of a streetwalker
She stood at the foot of the bed gazing at the wall above his head
I must earn our expenses until were safe said she once more telling a literal truth that was yet a complete deception
Why do you fret me
exclaimed he
Do you want me to be sick again
Suppose you didnt get the advance right away urged she
I tell you I shall get it
And I wont have youdo as you are doing
If you go you go for keeps
She seated herself
Do you want me to read or take dictation
His face expressed the satisfaction small people find in small successes at asserting authority
Dont be angry said he
Im acting for your good
Im saving you from yourself
Im not angry replied she her strange eyes resting upon him
He shifted uncomfortably
Now what does that look mean
he demanded with an uneasy laugh
She smiled shrugged her shoulders
Sperrysmall and thin a weatherbeaten wooden face suggesting Mr Punch sly keen eyes theater in every tone and gesture Sperry pushed the scenario hastily to completion and was so successful with Fitzalan that on Sunday afternoon he brought two hundred and fifty dollars Spensers half of the advance money
Didnt I tell you
said Spenser to Susan in triumph
Well move at once
Go pack your traps and put them in a carriage and by the time youre back here Sperry and the nurses will have me ready
It was about three when Susan got to her room
Clara heard her come in and soon appeared bare feet in mules hair hanging every which way
Despite the softening effect of the white nightdress and of the framing of abundant hair her face was hard and coarse
She had been drunk on liquor and on opium the night before and the effects were wearing off
As she was only twenty years old the hard coarse look would withdraw before youth in a few hours it was there only temporarily as a foreshadowing of what Clara would look like in five years or so
Hello Lorna said she
Gee what a bun my fellow and I had on last night
Did you hear us scrapping when we came in about five oclock
No replied Susan
I was up late and had a lot to do and was kept at the hospital all day
I guess I must have fallen asleep
He gave me an awful beating pursued Clara
But I got one good crack at him with a bottle
She laughed
I dont think hell be doing much flirting till his cheek heals up
He looks a sight
She opened her nightdress and showed Susan a deep blueblack mark on her left breast
I wonder if Ill get cancer from that
said she
Itd be just my rotten luck
Ive heard of several cases of it lately and my father kicked my mother there and she got cancer
Lord how she did suffer
Susan shivered turned her eyes away
Her blood surged with joy that she had once more climbed up out of this deep dark wallow where the masses of her fellow beings weltered in darkness and drunkenness and diseasewas up among the favored ones who while they could not entirely escape the great ills of life at least had the intelligence and the means to mitigate them
How fortunate that few of these unhappy ones had the imagination to realize their own wretchedness
I dont care what becomes of me Clara was saying
What is there in it for me
I can have a good time only as long as my looks lastand thats true of every woman aint it
Whats a woman but a body
Aint I right
Thats why Im going to stop being a woman as soon as ever I can said Susan
Why youre packing up
cried Clara
Yes
My friends well enough to be moved
Were going to live uptown
Right away
This afternoon
Clara dropped into a chair and began to weep
Ill miss you something fierce
sobbed she
Youre the only friend in the world I give a damn for or that gives a damn for me
I wish to God I was like you
You dont need anybody
Oh yes I do dear cried Susan
But I mean you dont lean on anybody
I dont mean youre hardheartedfor you aint
Youve pulled me and a dozen other girls out of the hole lots of times
But youre independent
Cant you take me along
I can drop that bum across the hall
I dont give a hoot for him
But a girls got to make believe she cares for somebody or shed blow her brains out
I cant take you along but Im going to come for you as soon as Im on my feet said Susan
Ive got to get up myself first
Ive learned at least that much
Oh youll forget all about me
No said Susan
And Clara knew that she would not
Moaned Clara Im not fit to go
Im only a common streetwalker
You belong up there
Youre going back to your own
But I belong here
I wish to God I was like most of the people down here and didnt have any sense
No wonder you used to drink so
Im getting that way too
The only people that dont hit the booze hard down here are the muttonheads who dont know nothing and cant learn nothing



I used to be contented
But somehow being with you so much has made me dissatisfied
That means youre on your way up said Susan busy with her packing
It would if I had sense enough
Oh its torment to have sense enough to see and not sense enough to do
Ill come for you soon said Susan
Youre going up with me
Clara watched her for some time in silence
Youre sure youre going to win
said she at last
Sure replied Susan
Oh you cant be as sure as that
Yes but I can laughed she
Im done with foolishness
Ive made up my mind to get up in the worldwith my selfrespect if possible if not then without it
Im going to have everythingmoney comfort luxury pleasure
Everything
And she dropped a folded skirt emphatically upon the pile she had been making and gave a short sharp nod
I was taught a lot of things when I was littlethings about being sweet and unselfish and all that
Theyd be fine if the world was Heaven
But it isnt
Not exactly said Clara
Maybe theyre fine if you want to get to Heaven continued Susan
But Im not trying to get to Heaven
Im trying to live on earth
I dont like the game and I dont like its rules
Butits the only game and I cant change the rules
So Im going to follow themat least until I get what I want
Do you mean to say youve got any respect for yourself
said Clara
I havent
And I dont see how any girl in our line can have
I thought I hadnt was Susans reply until I talked withwith someone I met the other day
If you slipped and fell in the mudor were thrown into ityou wouldnt say Im dirty through and through
I can never get clean againwould you
But thats different objected Clara
Not a bit declared Susan
If you look around this world youll see that everybody who ever moved about at all has slipped and fallen in the mudor has been pushed in
Mostly pushed in
Mostly pushed in assented Susan
And those that have good sense get up as soon as they can and wash as much of the mud off asll come offmaybe alland go on
The foolsthey worry about the mud
But not Inot any more


And not you my dearwhen I get you uptown
Clara was now looking on Susans departure as a dawn of good luck for herself
She took a headache powder telephoned for a carriage and helped carry down the two big packages that contained all Susans possessions worth moving
And they kissed each other goodby with smiling faces
Susan did not give Clara the loosetongued her new address nor did Clara conscious of her own weakness ask for it
Dont put yourself out about me cried Clara in farewell
Get a good tight grip yourself first
Thats advice I need answered Susan
Goodby
Soonsoon The carriage had to move slowly through those narrow tenement streets so thronged were they with the people swarmed from hot little rooms into the open to try to get a little air that did not threaten to burn and choke as it entered the lungs
Susans nostrils were filled with the stenches of animal and vegetable decaystenches descending in heavy clouds from the open windows of the flats and from the fire escapes crowded with all manner of rubbish stenches from the rotting brimful garbage cans stenches from the groceries and butcher shops and bakeries where the poorest qualities of food were exposed to the contamination of swarms of disgusting fat flies of mangy verminharassed children and cats and dogs stenches from the never washed human bodies clad in filthy garments and drawn out of shape by disease and toil
Sore eyes scrofula withered arm or leg sagged shoulder hip out of jointThere crawling along the sidewalk was the boy whose legs had been cut off by the street car and the stumps were horribly ulcered
And there at the basement window drooled and cackled the fat idiot girl whose mother sacrificed everything always to dress her freshly in pink
What a worldwhere a few people such a very fewlived in health and comfort and cleanlinessand the millions lived in disease and squalor ignorant untouched of civilization save to wear its castoff clothes and to eat its castaway food and to live in its dark noisome cellarsAnd to toil unceasingly to make for others the good things of which they had none themselves
It made her heartsickthe sadder because nothing could be done about it
Stay and help
As well stay to put out a conflagration barehanded and alone
As the carriage reached wider Second Avenue the horses broke into a trot
Susan drew a long breath of the purer airthen shuddered as she saw the corner where the dive into which the cadet had lured her flaunted its telltale awnings
Lower still her spirits sank when she was passing a few blocks further on the music hall
There too she had had a chance had let hope blaze high
And she was going forwardintothe region where she had been a slave to Freddie Palmerno to the system of which he was a slave no less than she I must be strong
I must Susan said to herself and there was desperation in the gleam of her eyes in the set of her chin
This time I will fight
And I feel at last that I can
But her spirits soared no more that day
XIV SPERRY had chosen for Mr and Mrs Spenser the second floor rear of a house on the south side of West Fortyfifth Street a few doors off Sixth Avenue
It was furnished as a sittingroomelegant in red plush with oil paintings on the walls a fringed red silkplush dado fastened to the mantelpiece with bright brassheaded tacks elaborate imitation lace throws on the sofa and chairs and an imposing piece that might have been a cabinet organ or a pianola or a rolltop desk but was in fact a comfortable folding bed
There was a marble stationary washstand behind the handembroidered screen in the corner near one of the two windows
Through a deep clothes closet was a small but satisfactory bathroom
And its warm in winter said Mrs Norris the landlady to Susan
Dont you hate a cold bathroom
Susan declared that she did
Theres only one thing I hate worse said Mrs Norris and thats cold coffee
She had one of those large faces which look bald because the frame of hair does not begin until unusually far back
At fifty when her hair would be thin Mrs Norris would be homely but at thirty she was handsome in a bold strong way
Her hair was always carefully done her good figure beautifully corseted
It was said she was not married to Mr Norrisbecause New York likes to believe that people are living together without being married because Mr Norris came and went irregularly and because Mrs Norris was so particular about her toiletand everyone knows that when a woman has the man with whom shes satisfied securely fastened she shows her content or her virtuous indifference to other menor her lazinessby neglecting her hair and her hips and dressing in any old thing any which way
Whatever the truth as to Mrs Norriss domestic life she carried herself strictly and insisted upon keeping her house as respectable as can reasonably be expected in a large city
That is everyone in it was quiet was of steady and sedate habit was backed by references
Not until Sperry had thoroughly qualified as a responsible person did Mrs Norris accept his assurances as to the Spensers and consent to receive them
Downtown the apartment houses that admit persons of loose character are usually more expensive because that class of tenants have more and expect more than ordinary working people
Uptown the custom is the reverse to get into a respectable house you must pay more
The Spensers had to pay fourteen a week for their quartersand they were getting a real bargain Mrs Norris having a weakness for literature and art where they were respectable and paid regularly
Whats left of the two hundred and fifty will not last long said Spenser to Susan when they were established and alone
But well have another five hundred as soon as the plays done and thatll be in less than a month
Were to begin tomorrow
In less than two months the playll be on and the royalties will be coming in
I wonder how much I owe the doctor and the hospital
Thats settled said Susan
He glanced at her with a frown
How much was it
You had no right to pay
You couldnt have got either doctor or room without payment in advance
She spoke tranquilly with a quiet assurance of manner that was new in her the nervous and sensitive about causing displeasure in others
She added Dont be cross Rod
You know its only pretense
Dont you believe anybody has any decency
demanded he
It depends on what you mean by decency replied she
But why talk of the past
Lets forget it
I would that I could
exclaimed he
She laughed at his heroics
Put that in your play said she
But this isnt the melodrama of the stage
Its the farce comedy of life
How you have changed
Has all the sweetness all the womanliness gone out of your character
She showed how little she was impressed
Ive learned to take terrible thingsreally terrible thingswithout making a fussor feeling like making a fuss
You cant expect me to get excited over mere staginess
Theyre fond of fake emotions up in this part of town
But down where Ive been so long the real horrors come too thick and fast for there to be any time to fake
He continued to frown presently came out of a deep study to say Susie I see Ive got to have a serious talk with you
Wait till youre well my dear said she
Im afraid Ill not be very sympathetic with your seriousness
Notoday
Im not an invalid
And our relations worry me whenever I think of them
He observed her as she sat with hands loosely clasped in her lap there was an inscrutable look upon her delicate face upon the clearcut features so attractively framed by her thick dark hair brown in some lights black in others
Well
said she
To begin I want you to stop rouging your lips
Its the only sign ofof what you were
Id a little rather you didnt smoke
But as respectable women smoke nowadays why I dont seriously object
And when you get more clothes get quieter ones
Not that you dress loudly or in bad taste Thank you murmured Susan
What did you say
I didnt mean to interrupt
Go on
I admire the way you dress but it makes me jealous
I want you to have nice clothes for the house
I like things that show your neck and suggest your form
But I dont want you attracting mens eyes and their loose thoughts in the street



And I dont want you to look so damnably alluring about the feet
Thats your best trickand your worst
Why are you smilingin that fashion
You talk to me as if I were your wife
He gazed at her with an expression that was as affectionate as it was generousand it was most generous
Well you may be some dayif you keep straight
And I think you will
The artificial red of her lips greatly helped to make her sweetly smiling face the perfection of gentle irony
And you
said she
You know perfectly well its different about a man
I know nothing of the sort replied she
Among certain kinds of people that is the rule
But Im not of those kinds
Im trying to make my way in the world exactly like a man
So Ive got to be free from the rules that may be all very well for ladies
A woman cant fight with her hands tied any more than a man canand you know what happens to the men who allow themselves to be tied theyre poor downtrodden creatures working hard at small pay for the men who fight with their hands free
Ive taken you out of the unprotected woman class my dear he reminded her
Youre mine now and youre going back where you belong
Back to the cage its taken me so long to learn to do without
She shook her head
No RodI couldnt possibly do itnot if I wanted to



Youve got several false ideas about me
Youll have to get rid of them if were to get along
For instance
In the first place dont delude yourself with the notion that Id marry you
I dont know whether the man I was forced to marry is dead or whether hes got a divorce
I dont care
No matter how free I was I shouldnt marry you
He smiled complacently
She noted it without irritation
Truly small indeed is the heat of any kind that can be got from the warmedup ashes of a burntout passion
She went easily on You have nothing to offer meneither love nor money
And a womanunless shes a poor excuseinsists on one or the other
You and I fancied we loved each other for a while
We dont fool ourselves in that way now
At least I dont though I believe you do imagine Im in love with you
You wouldnt be here if you werent
Put that out of your head Rod
Itll only breed trouble
I dont like to say these things to you but you compel me to
I learned long ago how foolish it is to put off unpleasant things that will have to be faced in the end
The longer theyre put off the worse the final reckoning is
Most of my troubles have come through my being too weak or goodnaturedor whatever it wasto act as my good sense told me
Im not going to make that mistake any more
And Im going to start the new deal with absolute frankness with you
I am not in love with you
I know you better than you know yourself said he
For a little while after I found you again I did have a return of the old feelingor something like it
But it soon passed
I couldnt love you
I know you too well
He struggled hard with his temper as his vanity lashed at it
She saw struggled with her old sensitiveness about inflicting even necessary pain upon others went on I simply like you Rodand thats all
Were well acquainted
Youre physically attractive to menot wildly so but enoughmore than any other manprobably more than most husbands are to their wivesor most wives to their husbands
So as long as you treat me well and dont wander off to other women Im more than willing to stay on here
Really
said he in an intensely sarcastic tone
Really
Nowkeep your temper she warned
Didnt I keep mine when you were handing me that impertinent talk about how I should dress and the rest of it
Nolet me finish
In the second place and in conclusion my dear Rod Im not going to live off you
Ill pay my half of the room
Ill pay for my own clothesand rouge for my lips
Ill buy and cook what we eat in the room youll pay when we go to a restaurant
I believe thats all
Are you quite sure
inquired he with much satire
Yes I think so
Exceptif you dont like my terms Im ready to leave at once
And go back to the streets I suppose
jeered he
If it were necessaryyes
So long as Ive got my youth and my health Ill do precisely as I please
Ive no craving for respectabilitynot the slightest
II She tried to speak of her birth that secret shame of which she was ashamed
She had been thinking that Brents big fine way of looking at things had cured her of this bitterness
She found that it had notas yet
So she went on Id prefer your friendship to your ill willmuch prefer it as youre the only person I can look to for what a man can do for a woman and as I like you
But if I have to take tyranny along with the friendship she looked at him quietly and her tones were almost tender almost appealingthen its goodby Rod
She had silenced him for he saw in her eyes much more gray than violet though the suggestion of violet was there that she meant precisely what she said
He was astonished almost dazed by the change in her
This woman grown was not the Susie who had left him
Noand yet She had left him hadnt she
That showed a character completely hidden from him perhaps the character he was now seeing
He askedand there was no sarcasm and a great deal of uneasiness in his tone How do you expect to make a living
Ive got a place at forty dollars a week
Forty dollars a week
You
He scowled savagely at her
Theres only one thing anyone would pay you forty a week for
Thats what Id have said rejoined she
But it seems not to be true
My luck may not last but while it lasts Ill have forty a week
I dont believe you said he with the angry bluntness of jealousy
Then you want me to go
inquired she with a certain melancholy but without any weakness
He ignored her question
He demanded Whos giving it to you
Brent
Spenser leaned from the bed toward her in his excitement
Robert Brent
he cried
Yes
Im to have a part in one of his plays
Spenser laughed harshly
What rot
Youre his mistress
It wouldnt be strange for you to think Id accept that position for so little but you must know a man of his sort wouldnt have so cheap a mistress
Its simply absurd
He is to train me himself
You never told me you knew him
I dont
Who got you the job
He saw me in Fitzalans office the day you sent me there
He asked me to call and when I went he made me the offer
Absolute rot
What reason did he give
He said I looked as if I had the temperament he was in search of
You must take me for a fool
Why should I lie to you
God knows
Why do women lie to men all the time
For the pleasure of fooling them
Oh no
To get money Rodthe best reason in the world it being rather hard for a woman to make money by working for it
The mans in love with you
I wish he were said Susan laughing
Id not be here my dearyou may be sure of that
And Id not content myself with forty a week
Oh you dont know what tastes Ive got
Wait till I turn myself loose
Wellyou canin a few months said Spenser
Even as he had been protesting his disbelief in her story his manner toward her had been growing more respectfula change that at once hurt and amused her with its cynical suggestions and also pleased her giving her a confidencebreeding sense of a new value in herself
Rod went on with a kind of shamefaced mingling of jest and earnest You stick by me Susie old girl and the timell come when Ill be able to give you more than Brent
I hope so said Susan
He eyed her sharply
I feel like a fool believing such a fairy story as youve been telling me
Yet I do
Thats good laughed she
Now I can stay
If you hadnt believed me Id have had to go
And I dont want to do thatnot yet
His eyes flinched
Not yet
What does that mean
It means Im content to stay at present
Who can answer for tomorrow
Her eyes lit up mockingly
For instanceyou
Today you think youre going to be true to me dont you
Yet tomorrowor as soon as you get strength and street clothes I may catch you in some restaurant telling some girl shes the one youve been getting ready for
He laughed but not heartily
Sperry came and Susan went to buy at a department store a complete outfit for Rod who still had only nightshirts
As she had often bought for him in the old days she felt she would have no difficulty in fitting him nearly enough with her accurate eye supplementing the measurements she had taken
When she got back home two hours and a half later bringing her purchases in a cab Sperry had gone and Rod was asleep
She sat in the bathroom with the gas lighted and worked at Cavalleria until she heard him calling
He had awakened in high goodhumor
That was an awful raking you gave me before Sperry came began he
But it did me good
A man gets so in the habit of ordering women about that it becomes second nature to him
Youve made it clear to me that Ive even less control over you than you have over me
So dear Im going to be humble and try to give satisfaction as servants say
Youd better laughed Susan
At least until you get on your feet again
You say we dont love each other Rod went on a becoming brightness in his strong face
Wellmaybe so
Butwe suit each otherdont we
Thats why I want to stay said Susan sitting on the bed and laying her hand caressingly upon his
I could stand it to go for Ive been trained to stand anythingeverything
But Id hate it
He put his arm round her drew her against his breast
Arent you happy here
he murmured
Happier than any place else in the world replied she softly
After a while she got a small dinner for their two selves on the gas stove she had brought with her and had set up in the bathroom
As they ate she crosslegged on the bed opposite him they beamed contentedly at each other
Do you remember the dinner we had at the St Nicholas in Cincinnati
asked she
It wasnt as good as this declared he
Not nearly so well cooked
You could make a fortune as a cook
But then you do everything well
Even to rouging my lips
Oh forget it
laughed he
Im an ass
Theres a wonderful fascination in the contrast between the dash of scarlet and the pallor of that clear lovely skin of yours
Her eyes danced
You are getting well
she exclaimed
Im sorry I bought you clothes
Ill be uneasy every time youre out
You can trust me
I see Ive got to hustle to keep my job with you
Well thank God your friend Brents old enough to be your father
Is he
cried Susan
Do you know I never thought of his age
Yes hes forty at leastmore
Are you sure he isnt after you Susie
He warned me that if I annoyed him in that way hed discharge me
Do you like him
Idontknow was Susans slow reflective answer
Imafraid of hima little
Both became silent
Finally Rod said with an impatient shake of the head Lets not think of him
Lets try on your new clothes cried Susan
And when the dishes were cleared away they had a grand time trying on the things she had bought
It was amazing how near she had come to fitting him
You ought to feel flattered said she
Only a labor of love could have turned out so well
He turned abruptly from admiring his new suit in the glass and caught her in his arms
You do love meyou do
he cried
No woman would have done all youve done for me if she didnt
For answer Susan kissed him passionately and as her body trembled with the sudden upheaval of emotions long dormant or indulged only in debased hateful ways she burst into tears
She knew even in that moment of passion that she did not love him but not love itself can move the heart more deeply than gratitude and her bruised heart was so grateful for his words and tones and gestures of affection
Wednesday afternoon on the way to Brents house she glanced up at the clock in the corner tower of the Grand Central Station
It lacked five minutes of three
She walked slowly timed herself so accurately that as the butler opened the door a cathedral chime hidden somewhere in the upper interior boomed the hour musically
The man took her direct to the elevator and when it stopped at the top floor Brent himself opened the door as before
He was dismissing a short fat man whom Susan placed as a manager and a tall slim and most fashionably dressed woman with a beautiful insincere faceanyone would have at once declared her an actress probably a star
The woman gave Susan a searching feminine look which changed swiftly to superciliousness
Both the man and the woman were loath to go evidently had not finished what they had come to say
But Brent in his abrupt but courteous way said Tomorrow at four then
As you see my next appointment has begun
And he had them in the elevator with the door closed
He turned upon Susan the gaze that seemed to take in everything
You are in better spirits I see said he
Im sorry to have interrupted said she
I could have waited
But I couldnt replied he
Some day youll discover that your time is valuable and that to waste it is far sillier than if you were to walk along throwing your money into the gutter
Time ought to be used like moneyspent generously but intelligently
He talked rapidly on with his manner as full of unexpressed and inexpressible intensity as the voice of the violin with his frank egotism that had no suggestion of vanity or conceit
Because I systematize my time Im never in a hurry never at a loss for time to give to whatever I wish
I didnt refuse to keep you waiting for your sake but for my own
Now the next hour belongs to you and meand well forget about timeas if we were dining in a restaurant wed not think of the bill till it was presented
What did you do with the play
Susan could only look at him helplessly
He laughed handed her a cigarette rose to light a match for her
Settle yourself comfortably said he and say whats in your head
With hands deep in the trousers of his house suit he paced up and down the long room the cigarette loose between his lips
Whenever she saw his front face she was reassured but whenever she saw his profile her nerves trembledfor in the profile there was an expression of almost ferocious resolution of tragic sadness of the sternness that spares not
The full face was kind if keen was sympatheticwas the man as nature had made him
The profile was the great manthe man his career had made
And Susan knew that the profile was master
Which part did you like Santuzza or Lola
Lola replied she
He paused looked at her quickly
Why
Oh I dont sympathize with the womanor the manwhos deserted
I pity but I cant help seeing its her or his own fault
Lola explains why
Wouldnt you rather laugh than cry
Santuzza may have been attractive in the moments of passion but how she must have bored Turiddu the rest of the time
She was so intense so seriousso vain and selfish
Vain and selfish
Thats interesting
He walked up and down several times then turned on her abruptly
Wellgo on he said
Im waiting to hear why she was vain and selfish
Isnt it vain for a woman to think a man ought to be crazy about her all the time because he once has been
Isnt it selfish for her to want him to be true to her because it gives her pleasure even though she knows it doesnt give him pleasure
Men and women are all vain and selfish in love said he
But the women are meaner than the men replied she because theyre more ignorant and narrowminded
He was regarding her with an expression that made her uneasy
But that isnt in the playnone of it said he
Well it ought to be replied she
Santuzza is the oldfashioned conventional heroine
I used to like themuntil I had lived a little myself
She isnt true to life
But in Lola Yeswhat about Lola
he demanded
Oh she wasnt a heroine either
She was just humantaking happiness when it offered
And her gayetyand her capriciousness
A man will always break away from a solemn intense woman to get that sort of sunshine
Yesyesgo on said Brent
And her sour serious solemn husband explains why wives are untrue to their husbands
At least it seems so to me
He was walking up and down again
Every trace of indolence of relaxation was gone from his gait and from his features
His mind was evidently working like an engine at full speed
Suddenly he halted
Youve given me a big idea said he
Ill throw away the play I was working on
Ill do your play
Susan laughedpleased yet a little afraid he was kinder than she deserved
What I said was only common sensewhat my experience has taught me
Thats all that genius is my dear replied he
As soon as were born our eyes are operated on so that we shall never see anything as it is
The geniuses are those who either escape the operation or are reendowed with true sight by experience
He nodded approvingly at her
Youre going to be a personor rather youre going to show youre a person
But that comes later
You thought of Lola as your part
I tried to
But I dont know anything about acting except what Ive seen and the talk Ive heard
As I said the other day that means youve little to learn
Nowas to Lolas entrance
Oh I thought of a lot of things to doto show that she too loved Turiddu and that she had as much right to loveand to be lovedas Santuzza had
Santuzza had had her chance and had failed
Brent was highly amused
You seem to forget that Lola was a married womanand that if Santuzza didnt get a husband shed be the mother of a fatherless child
Never had he seen in her face such a charm of sweet melancholy as at that moment
I suppose the way I was born and the life Ive led make me think less of those things than most people do replied she
I was talking about natural heartswhat people think insidethe way they act when they have courage
When they have courage Brent repeated reflectively
But who has courage
A great many people are compelled to have it said she
I never had it until I got enough money to be independent
I never had it said Susan until I had no money
He leaned against the big table folded his arms on his chest looked at her with eyes that made her feel absolutely at ease with him
Said he You have known what it was to have no moneynone
Susan nodded
And no friendsno place to sleepworse off than Robinson Crusoe when the waves threw him on the island
I had toto suck my own blood to keep alive
You smile as you say that said he
If I hadnt learned to smile over such things she answered Id have been dead long ago
He seated himself opposite her
He asked Why didnt you kill yourself
I was afraid
Of the hereafter
Oh no
Of missing the coming true of my dreams about life
Love
Thatand more
Just love wouldnt satisfy me
I want to see the worldto know the worldand to be somebody
I want to try everything
She laughed gaylya sudden fascinating vanishing of the melancholy of eyes and mouth a sudden flashing out of young beauty
Ive been down about as deep as one can go
I want to explore in the other direction
Yesyes said Brent absently
You must see it all
He remained for some time in a profound reverie she as unconscious of the passing of time as he for if he had his thoughts she had his face to study
Try as she would she could not associate the idea of age with himany age
He seemed simply a grown man
And the more closely she studied him the greater her awe became
He knew so much he understood so well
She could not imagine him swept away by any of the petty emotionsthe vanities the jealousies the small rages the small passions and loves that made up the petty days of the small creatures who inhabit the world and call it theirs
Could he fall in love
Had he been in love
Yeshe must have been in love many timesfor many women must have taken trouble to please a man so well worth while and he must have passed from one woman to another as his whims or his tastes changed
Could he ever care about heras a woman
Did he think her worn out as a physical woman
Or would he realize that body is nothing by itself that unless the soul enters it it is cold and meaningless and worthlesslike the electric bulb when the filament is dark and the beautiful hot brilliant and intensely living current is not in it
Could she love him
Could she ever feel equal and at ease through and through with a man so superior
Youd better study the part of Lolalearn the lines said he when he had finished his reflecting
Thenthis day week at the same hourwe will begin
We will work all afternoonwe will dine togethergo to some theater where I can illustrate what I mean
Beginning with next Wednesday that will be the program every day until further notice
Until you see whether you can do anything with me or not
Just so
You are living with Spenser
Yes
Susan could have wished his tone less matteroffact
How is he getting on
He and Sperry are doing a play for Fitzalan
Really
Thats good
He has talent
If hell learn of Sperry and talk less and work more and steadily hell make a lot of money
You are not tied to him in any way
Nonot now that hes prospering
Except of course that Im fond of him
He shrugged his shoulders
Oh everybody must have somebody
Youve not seen this house
Ill show it to you as weve still fifteen minutes
A luxurious house it wasfilled with things curious and some of them beautifulthings gathered in excursions through Europe Susan assumed
The only absolutely simple room was his bedroom big and bare and so arranged that he could sleep practically out of doors
She saw servantstwo men besides the butler several women
But the house was a bachelors house with not a trace of feminine influence
And evidently he cared nothing about it but lived entirely in that wonderful world which so awed Susanthe world he had created within himself the world of which she had alluring glimpses through his eyes through his tones and gestures even
Small people strive to make and do make impression of themselves by laboring to show what they know and think
But the person of the larger kind makes no such effort
In everything Brent said and did and wore in all his movements gestures expressions there was the unmistakable hallmark of the man worth while
The social life has banished simplicity from even the most savage tribe
Indeed savages filled with superstitions their every movement the result of some notion of proper ceremonial are the most complex of all the human kind
The effort toward simplicity is not a movement back to nature for there savage and lower animal are completely enslaved by custom and instinct it is a movement upward toward the freedom of thought and action of which our best intelligence has given us a conception and for which it has given us a longing
Never had Susan met so simple a man and never had she seen one so far from all the silly ostentations of rudeness of unattractive dress of eccentric or coarse speech wherewith the cheap sort of man strives to proclaim himself individual and free
With her instinct for recognizing the best at first sight Susan at once understood
And she was like one who has been stumbling about searching for the right road and has it suddenly shown to him
She fairly darted along this right road
She was immediately busy noting the mistakes in her own ideas of manners and dress of good and bad taste
She realized how much she had to learn
But this did not discourage her
For she realized at the same time that she could learnand his obvious belief in her as a possibility was most encouraging
When he bade her goodby at the front door and it closed behind her she was all at once so tired that it seemed to her she would then and there sink down through sheer fatigue and fall asleep
For no physical exercise so quickly and utterly exhausts as real brain exercisethinking studying learning with all the concentrated intensity of a thoroughbred in the last quarter of the mile race
XV SPENSER had time and thought for his play only
He no longer tormented himself with jealousy of the abilities and income and fame of Brent and the other successful writers for the stage was not he about to equal them probably to surpass them
As a rule none of the mean emotions is able to thriveunless it has the noxious vapors from disappointment and failure to feed upon
Spenser in spirits and in hope again was content with himself
Jealousy of Brent about Susan had been born of dissatisfaction with himself as a failure and envy of Brent as a success it died with that dissatisfaction and that envy
His vanity assured him that while there might be possiblyways in which he was not without rivals certainly where women were concerned he simply could not be equaled the woman he wanted he could haveand he could hold her as long as he wished
The idea that Susan would give a sentimental thought to a man old enough to be her fatherBrent was fortyonewas too preposterous to present itself to his mind
She loved the handsome fascinating youthful Roderick Spenser she would soon be crazy about him
Rarely does it occur to a man to wonder what a woman is thinking
During courtship very young men attribute intellect and qualities of mystery and awe to the woman they love
But after men get an insight into the mind of woman and discover how trivial are the matters that of necessity usually engage it they become skeptical about feminine mentality they would as soon think of speculating on what profundities fill the brain of the kitten playing with a ball as of seeking a solution of the mystery behind a womans fits of abstraction
However there was in Susans face especially in her eyes an expression so unusual so arresting that Spenser selfcentered and convinced of womans intellectual deficiency though he was did sometimes inquire what she was thinking about
He asked this question at breakfast the morning after that second visit to Brent
Was I thinking
she countered
You certainly were not listening
You havent a notion what I was talking about
About your play
Of course
You know I talk nothing else laughed he
I must bore you horribly
No indeed protested she
No I suppose not
Youre not bored because you dont listen
He was cheerful about it
He talked merely to arrange his thoughts not because he expected Susan to understand matters far above one whom nature had fashioned and experience had trained to minister satisfyingly to the physical and sentimental needs of man
He assumed that she was as worshipful before his intellect as in the old days
He would have been even more amazed than enraged had he known that she regarded his play as mediocre claptrap false to life fit only for the unthinking sloppily sentimental crowd that could not see the truth about even their own lives their own thoughts and actions
There you go again
cried he a few minutes later
What are you thinking about
I forgot to ask how you got on with Brent
Poor chaphes had several failures in the past year
He must be horribly cut up
They say hes written out
What does he think hes trying to get at with you
Acting as I told you replied Susan
She felt ashamed for him making this pitiable exhibition of patronizing a great man
Sperry tells me he has had that twist in his brain for a long timethat he has tried out a dozen girls or moredrops them after a few weeks or months
He has a regular system about itruns away abroad stops the pay after a month or so
Well the forty a weeks clear gain while it lasts said Susan
She tried to speak lightly
But she felt hurt and uncomfortable
There had crept into her mind one of those disagreeable ideas that skurry into some dusky corner to hide and reappear from time to time making every fit of the blues so much the sadder and aggravating despondency toward despair
Oh I didnt mean to suggest that you wouldnt succeed Spenser hastened to apologize with more or less real kindliness
Sperry says Brent has some good ideas about acting
So youll learn somethingmaybe enough to enable me to put you in a good positionif Brent gets tired and if you still want to be independent as you call it
I hope so said Susan absently
Spenser was no more absorbed in his career than she in hers only she realized how useless it would be to try to talk it to himthat he would not give her so much as ears in an attitude of polite attention
If he could have looked into her head that morning and seen what thoughts were distracting her from hearing about the great play he would have been more amused and disgusted than ever with feminine frivolity of mind and incapacity in serious matters
For it so happened that at the moment Susan was concentrating on a new dress
He would have laughed in the face of anyone saying to him that this new dress was for Susan in the pursuit of her scheme of life quite as weighty a matter quite as worthy of the most careful attention as was his play for him
Yet that would have been the literal truth
Primarily mans appeal is to the ear womans to the eyethe reason by the way why the theaterpreeminently the place to seetends to be dominated by woman
Susan had made up her mind not only that she would rapidly improve herself in every way but also how she would go about the improving
She saw that for a woman at least dress is as much the prime essential as an arresting show window for a dealer in articles that display well
She knew she was far from the goal of which she dreamedthe position where she would no longer be a woman primarily but a personage
Dress would not merely increase her physical attractiveness it would achieve the far more important end of gaining her a large measure of consideration
She felt that Brent even Brent dealer in actualities and not to be fooled by pretenses would in spite of himself change his opinion of her if she went to him dressed less like a middle class working girl more like the woman of the upper classes
At best using all the advantages she had she felt there was small enough chance of her holding his interest for she could not make herself believe that he was not deceiving himself about her
However to strengthen herself in every way with him was obviously the wisest effort she could make
So she must have a new dress for the next meeting one which would make him better pleased to take her out to dinner
True if she came in rags he would not be disturbedfor he had nothing of the snob in him
But at the same time if she came dressed like a woman of his own class he would be impressed
Hes a man if he is a genius reasoned she
Vital though the matter was she calculated that she did not dare spend more than twentyfive dollars on this toilet
She must put by some of her forty a week Brent might give her up at any time and she must not be in the position of having to choose immediately between submitting to the slavery of the kept woman as Spensers dependent and submitting to the costly and dangerous and repulsive freedom of the woman of the streets
Thus to lay out twentyfive dollars on a single costume was a wild extravagance
She thought it over from every point of view she decided that she must take the risk
Late in the afternoon she walked for an hour in Fifth Avenue
After some hesitation she ventured into the waiting and dressingrooms of several fashionable hotels
She was in search of ideas for the dress which must be in the prevailing fashion
She had far too good sense and good taste to attempt to be wholly original in dress she knew that the woman who understands her business does not try to create a fashion but uses the changing and capricious fashion as the means to express a constant and consistent style of her own
She appreciated her limitations in such mattershow far she as yet was from the knowledge necessary to forming a permanent and selfexpressive style
She was prepared to be most cautious in giving play to an individual taste so imperfectly educated as hers had necessarily been
She felt that she had the natural instinct for the best and could recognize it on sightan instinct without which no one can go a step forward in any of the arts
She had long since learned to discriminate among the vast masses of offering most of them tasteless or commonplace to select the rare and few things that have merit
Thus she had always stood out in the tawdrily or drearily or fussily dressed throngs had been a pleasure to the eyes even of those who did not know why they were pleased
On that momentous day she finally saw a woman dressed in admirable taste who was wearing a costume simple enough for her to venture to think of copying the main points
She walked several blocks a few yards behind this woman then hurried ahead of her turned and walked toward her to inspect the front of the dress
She repeated this several times between the St Regis and Sherrys
The woman soon realized as women always do what the girl in the shirtwaist and short skirt was about
But she happened to be a goodnatured person and smiled pleasantly at Susan and got in return a smile she probably did not soon forget
The next morning Susan went shopping
She had it in mind to get the materials for a costume of a certain delicate shade of violet
A dress of that shade and a big hat trimmed in tulle to match or to harmonize with a bunch of silk violets fastened in the tulle in a certain way
Susan knew she had good looks knew what was becoming to her darkly and softly fringed violet eyes pallid skin to her rather tall figure slender not voluptuous yet suggesting voluptuousness
She could see herself in that violet costume
But when she began to look at materials she hesitated
The violet would be beautiful but it was not a wise investment for a girl with few clothes with but one best dress
She did not give it up definitely however until she came upon a sixteenyard remnant of soft gray China crepe
Gray was a really serviceable color for the best dress of a girl of small means
And this remnant certainly enough for a dress could be had for ten dollars where violet China crepe of the shade she wanted would cost her a dollar a yard
She took the remnant
She went to the millinery department and bought a large hat frame
It was of a good shape and she saw how it could be bent to suit her face
She paid fifty cents for this and two dollars and seventy cents for four yards of gray tulle
She found that silk flowers were beyond her means so she took a bunch of presentable looking violets of the cheaper kind at two dollars and a half
She happened to pass a counter whereon were displayed bargains in big buckles and similar odds and ends of steel and enamel
She fairly pounced upon a handsome gray buckle with violet enamel which cost but eightynine cents
For a pair of gray suede ties she paid two dollars for a pair of gray silk stockings ninety cents
These matters with some gray silk net for the collar gray silk for a belt linings and the like made her total bill twentythree dollars and sixtyseven cents
She returned home content and studied Cavalleria until her purchases arrived
Spenser was out now was working all day and in the evenings at Sperrys office high up in the Times Building
So Susan had freedom for her dressmaking operations
To get them off her mind that she might work uninterruptedly at learning Lolas part in Cavalleria she toiled all Saturday far into Sunday morning was astir before Spenser waked finished the dress soon after breakfast and the hat by the middle of the afternoon
When Spenser returned from Sperrys office to take her to dinner she was arrayed
For the first time he saw her in fashionable attire and it was really fashionable for despite all her disadvantages she who had real and rare capacity for learning had educated herself well in the chief business of woman the mancatcher in her years in New York
He stood rooted to the threshold
It would have justified a vanity less vigorous than Susan or any other normal human being possessed to excite such a look as was in his eyes
He drew a long breath by way of breaking the spell over speech
You are beautiful he exclaimed
And his eyes traveled from the bewitching hat set upon her head coquettishly yet without audacity to the soft crepe dress its round collar showing her perfect throat its graceful lines subtly revealing her alluring figure to the feet that men always admired whatever else of beauty or charm they might fail to realize
How you have grown
he ejaculated
Then How did you do it
By all but breaking myself
Its worth whatever it cost
If I had a dress suit wed go to Sherrys or the Waldorf
Im willing to go without the dress suit
No
Ive got everything ready for dinner at home
Then why on earth did you dress
To give me a treat
Oh I hate to go out in a dress Ive never worn
And a woman has to wear a hat a good many times before she knows how
What a lot of fuss you women do make about clothes
You seem to like it all the same
Of course
But its a trifle
It has got many women a good provider for life
And not paying attention to dress or not knowing how has made most of the old maids
Are those things trifles
Spenser laughed and shifted his ground without any sense of having been pressed to do so
Men are fools where women are concerned
Or women are wise where men are concerned
I guess they do know their businesssome of them he confessed
Still its a silly business you must admit
Nothing is silly thats successful said Susan
Depends on what you mean by success argued he
Success is getting what you want
Provided one wants whats worth while said he
And whats worth while
rejoined she
Why whatever one happens to want
To avoid any possible mischance to the grande toilette he served the dinner and did the dangerous part of the clearing up
They went to the theater Rod enjoying even more than she the very considerable admiration she got
When she was putting the dress away carefully that night Rod inquired when he was to be treated again
OhI dont know replied she
Not soon
She was too wise to tell him that the dress would not be worn again until Brent was to see it
The hat she took out of the closet from time to time and experimented with it reshaping the brim studying the different effects of different angles
It delighted Spenser to catch her at this foolishness he felt so superior and with his incurable delusion of the shallow that dress is an end not merely a means he felt more confident than ever of being able to hold her when he should have the money to buy her what her frivolous and feminine nature evidently craved beyond all else in the world
But When he bought a readytowear evening suit he made more stir about it than had Susan about her costumethis when dress to him was altogether an end in itself and not a shrewd and useful means
He spent more time in admiring himself in it before the mirror and looked at it and at himself in it with far more admiration and no criticism at all
Susan noted thisand after the manner of women who are wise or indifferentor bothshe made no comment
At the studio floor of Brents house the door of the elevator was opened for Susan by a small young man with a notably large head bald and bulging
His big smooth face had the expression of extreme amiability that usually goes with weakness and timidity
I am Mr Brents secretary Mr Garvey he explained
And Susanmade as accurate as quick in her judgments of character by the opportunities and the necessities of her experiencesaw that she had before her one of those nice feeble folk who either get the shelter of some strong personality as a bird hides from the storm in the thick branches of a great tree or are tossed and torn and ruined by life and exist miserably until rescued by death
She knew the type well it had been the dominant type in her surroundings ever since she left Sutherland
Indeed is it not the dominant type in the whole illequipped soretried human race
And does it not usually fail of recognition because so many of us who are in fact weak lookand feelstrong because we are sheltered by inherited money or by powerful friends or relatives or by chance lodgment in a nook unvisited of the high winds of life in the open
Susan liked Garvey at once they exchanged smiles and were friends
She glanced round the room
At the huge open window Brent his back to her was talking earnestly to a big hatchetfaced man with a black beard
Even as Susan glanced Brent closed the interview with an emphatic gesture of fist into palm he exclaimed And thats final
Goodby
The two men came toward her both bowed the hatchetfaced man entered the elevator and was gone
Brent extended his hand with a smile
You evidently didnt come to work today said he with a careless fleeting glance at the grande toilette
But we are prepared against such tricks
Garvey take her down to the rear dressingroom and have the maid lay her out a simple costume
To Susan Be as quick as you can
And he seated himself at his desk and was reading and signing letters
Susan crestfallen followed Garvey down the stairway
She had confidently expected that he would show some appreciation of her toilette
She knew she had never in her life looked so well
In the long glass in the dressingroom while Garvey was gone to send the maid she inspected herself again
Yesnever anything like so well
And Brent had noted her appearance only to condemn it
She was always telling herself that she wished him to regard her as a working woman a pupil in stagecraft
But now that she had proof that he did so regard her she was depressed resentful
However this did not last long
While she was changing to linen skirt and shirtwaist she began to laugh at herself
How absurd she had been thinking to impress this man who had known so many beautiful women who must have been satiated long ago with beautyshe thinking to create a sensation in such a man with a simple little costume of her own crude devising
She reappeared in the studio laughter in her eyes and upon her lips
Brent apparently did not glance at her yet he said Whats amusing you
She confessed all on one of her frequent impulses to candorthose impulses characteristic both of weak natures unable to exercise selfrestraint and of strong natures indifferent to petty criticism and misunderstanding and absent from vain mediocrity which always has itselfthat is appearanceson its mind
She described in amusing detail how she had planned and got together the costume how foolish his reception of it had made her feel
Ive no doubt you guessed what was in my head concluded she
You see everything
I did notice that you were looking unusually well and that you felt considerably set up over it said he
But why not
Vanitys an excellent thing
Like everything else its got to be used not misused
It can help us to learn instead of preventing
I had an excuse for dressing up she reminded him
You said we were to dine together
I thought you wouldnt want there to be too much contrast between us
Next time Ill be more sensible
Dress as you like for the present said he
You can always change here
Later on dress will be one of the main things of course
But not now
Have you learned the part
And they began
She saw at the far end of the room a platform about the height of a stage
He explained that Garvey with the book of the play would take the other parts in Lolas scenes and sent them both to the stage
Dont be nervous Garvey said to her in an undertone
He doesnt expect anything of you
This is simply to get started
But she could not suppress the trembling in her legs and arms the hysterical contractions of her throat
However she did contrive to go through the partGarvey prompting
She knew she was ridiculous she could not carry out a single one of the ideas of business which had come to her as she studied she was awkward inarticulate panicstricken
Rotten
exclaimed Brent when she had finished
Couldnt be worse therefore couldnt be better
She dropped to a chair and sobbed hysterically
Thats rightcry it out said Brent
Leave us alone Garvey
Brent walked up and down smoking until she lifted her head and glanced at him with a pathetic smile
Take a cigarette he suggested
Well talk it over
Now weve got something to talk about
She found relief from her embarrassment in the cigarette
You can laugh at me now she said
I shant mind
In fact I didnt mind though I thought I did
If I had Id not have let you see me cry
Dont think Im discouraged said Brent
The reverse
You showed that you have nerve a very different matter from impudence
Impudence fails when its most needed
Nerve makes one hang on regardless
In such a panic as yours was the average girl would have funked absolutely
You stuck it out
Now you and I will try Lolas first entrance
No dont throw away your cigarette
Lola might well come in smoking a cigarette
She did better
What Burlingham had once thoroughly drilled into her now stood her in good stead and Brents sympathy and enthusiasm gave her the stimulating sense that he and she were working together
They spent the afternoon on the one thingLola coming on singing her gay song her halt at sight of Santuzza and Turiddu her look at Santuzza at Turiddu her greeting
for each
They tried it twenty different ways
They discussed what would have been in the minds of all three
They built up business for Lola and for the two others to increase the significance of Lolas actions
As Ive already told you said he anyone with a voice and a movable body can learn to act
Theres no question about your becoming a good actress
But itll be some time before I can tell whether you can be what I hopean actress who shows no sign that shes acting
Susan showed the alarm she felt
Im afraid youll find at the end that youve been wasting your time said she
Put it straight out of your head replied he
I never waste time
To live is to learn
Already youve given me a new playdont forget that
In a month Ill have it ready for us to use
Besides in teaching you I teach myself
Hungry
Nothat is yes
I hadnt thought of it but Im starved
This sort of thing gives one an appetite like a field hand
He accompanied her to the door of the rear dressingroom on the floor below
Go down to the reception room when youre ready said he as he left her to go on to his own suite to change his clothes
Ill be there
The maid came immediately drew a bath for her afterward helped her to dress
It was Susans first experience with a maid her first realization how much time and trouble one saves oneself if free from the routine menial things
And then and there a maid was set down upon her secret list of the luxurious comforts to which she would treat herselfwhen The craving for luxury is always a part usually a powerful part of an ambitious temperament
Ambition is simply a variously manifested and variously directed impulse toward improvementa discomfort so keen that it compels effort to change to a position less uncomfortable
There had never been a time when luxury had not attracted her
At the slightest opportunity she had always pushed out for luxuriesfor better food better clothing more agreeable surroundings
Even in her worst hours of discouragement she had not really relaxed in the struggle against rags and dirt
And when moral horror had been blunted by custom and drink physical horror had remained acute
For human nature being a development upward through the physical to the spiritual when a process of degeneration sets in the topmost layers the spiritual wear away firstthen those in which the spiritual is a larger ingredient than the materialthen those in which the material is the largerand last of all those that are purely material
As life educated her as her intelligence and her knowledge grew her appreciation of luxury had grown apace and her desire for it
With most human beings the imagination is a heavy bird of feeble wing it flies low seeing only the things of the earth
When they describe heaven it has houses of marble and streets of gold
Their pretense to sight of higher things is either sheer pretense or sight at second hand
Susan was of the few whose fancy can soar
She saw the earthy things she saw the things of the upper regions also
And she saw the lower region from the altitudes of the higherand in their perspective
As she and Brent stood together on the sidewalk before his house about to enter his big limousine his smile told her that he had read her thoughther desire for such an automobile as her very own
I cant help it said she
Its my nature to want these things
And to want them intelligently said he
Everybody wants but only the few want intelligentlyand they get
The three worst things in the world are sickness poverty and obscurity
Your splendid health safeguards you against sickness
Your looks and your brains can carry you far away from the other two
Your one danger is of yielding to the temptation to become the wife or the mistress of some rich man
The prospect of several years of heartbreaking hard work isnt wildly attractive at twentytwo
You dont know me said Susanbut the boast was uttered under her breath
The auto rushed up to Delmonicos entrance came to a halt abruptly yet gently
The attentiveness of the personnel the staring and whispering of the people in the palm room showed how well known Brent was
There were several womenhandsome women of what is called the New York type though it certainly does not represent the average New York woman who is poorly dressed in flimsy readymade clothes and has the mottled skin that indicates bad food and too little sleep
These handsome women were dressed beautifully as well as expensively in models got innot fromParis
One of them smiled sweetly at Brent who responded so Susan thought rather formally
She felt dowdy in her homemade dress
All her pride in it vanished she saw only its defects
And the gracefully careless manner of these womenthe manners of those who feel sure of themselvesmade her feel green and out of place
She was disgusted with the folly that had caused her to thrill with pleasure when his order to his chauffeur at his door told her she was actually to be taken to one of the restaurants in which she had wished to exhibit herself with him
She heartily wished she had insisted on going where she would have been as well dressed and as much at home as anyone there
She lifted her eyes to distract her mind from these depressing sensations
Brent was looking at her with that amused mocking yet sympathetic expression which was most characteristic of him
She blushed furiously
He laughed
No Im not ashamed of your homemade dress said he
I dont care what is thought of me by people who dont give me any money
And anyhow you are easily the most unusual looking and the most tastefully dressed woman here
The rest of these women are doomed for life to commonplace obscurity
You Well see your name in letters of fire on the Broadway temples of fame
I know youre half laughing at me said Susan
But I feel a little better
Then Im accomplishing my object
Lets not think about ourselves
That makes life narrow
Lets keep the thoughts on our workon the big splendid dreams that come to us and invite us to labor and to dare
And as they lingered over the satisfactory dinner he had ordered they talked of actingof the different roles of Cavalleria as types of fundamental instincts and actionsof how best to express those meaningshow to fill out the skeletons of the dramatist into personalities actual and vivid
Susan forgot where she was forgot to be reserved with him
In her and Rods happiest days she had never been free from the constraint of his and her own sense of his great superiority
With Brent such trifles of the petty personal disappeared
And she talked more naturally than she had since a girl at her uncles at Sutherland
She was amazed by the fountain that had suddenly gushed forth in her mind at the conjuring of Brents sympathy
She did not recognize herself in this person so open to ideas so eager to learn so clear in the expression of her thoughts
Not since the Burlingham days had she spent so long a time with a man in absolute unconsciousness of sex
They were interrupted by the intrusion of a fashionable young man with the expression of assurance which comes from the possession of wealth and the knowledge that money will buy practically everything and everybody
Brent received him so coldly that after a smooth sentence or two he took himself off stammering and in confusion
I suppose said Brent when he was gone that young ass hoped I would introduce him to you and invite him to sit
But youll be tempted often enough in the next few years by rich men without my helping to put temptation in your way Ive never been troubled thus far laughed Susan
But you will now
You have developed to the point where everyone will soon be seeing what it took expert eyes to see heretofore
If I am tempted said Susan do you think Ill be able to resist
I dont know confessed Brent
You have a strong sense of honesty and thatll keep you at work with me for a while
Then If you have it in you to be great youll go on
If youre merely the ordinary woman a little more intelligent youll probablysell out
All the advice I have to offer is dont sell cheap
As youre not hampered by respectability or by inexperience you neednt
He reflected a moment then added And if you ever do decide that you dont care to go on with a career tell me frankly
I may be able to help you in the other direction
Thank you said Susan her strange eyes fixed upon him
Why do you put so much gratitude in your tone and in your eyes
asked he
I didnt put it there she answered
Itjust came
And I was grateful becausewell Im human you know and it was good to feelthatthat Go on said he as she hesitated
Im afraid youll misunderstand
What does it matter if I do
Wellyouve acted toward me as if I were a mere machine that you were experimenting with
And so you are
I understand that
But when you offered to help me if I happened to want to do something different from what you want me to do it made me feel that you thought of me as a human being too
The expression of his unseeing eyes puzzled her
She became much embarrassed when he said Are you dissatisfied with Spenser
Do you want to change lovers
Are you revolving me as a possibility
I havent forgotten what you said she protested
But a few words from me wouldnt change you from a woman into a sexless ambition
An expression of wistful sadness crept into the violetgray eyes in contrast to the bravely smiling lips
She was thinking of her birth that had condemned her to that farmer Ferguson full as much as of the life of the streets when she said I know that a man like you wouldnt care for a woman of my sort
If I were you said he gently Id not say those things about myself
Saying them encourages you to think them
And thinking them gives you a false point of view
You must learn to appreciate that youre not a sheltered woman with reputation for virtue as your one asset the thing thatll enable you to get some man to undertake your support
You are dealing with the world as a man deals with it
You must demand and insist that the world deal with you on that basis
There came a wonderful look of courage and hope into the eyes of Lorellas daughter
And the world will he went on
At least the only part of it thats important to youor really important in any way
The matter of your virtue or lack of it is of no more importance than is my virtue or lack of it
Do you really believe that way
asked Susan earnestly
It doesnt in the least matter whether I do or not laughed he
Dont bother about what I thinkwhat anyone thinksof you
The point here as always is that you believe it yourself
Theres no reason why a woman who is making a career should not be virtuous
She will probably not get far if she isnt more or less so
Dissipation doesnt help man or woman especially the ruinous dissipation of license in passion
On the other hand no woman can ever hope to make a career who persists in narrowing and cheapening herself with the notion that her virtue is her all
Shell not amount to much as a worker in the fields of action
Susan reflected sighed
Its very very hard to get rid of ones sex
Its impossible declared he
Dont try
But dont let it worry you either
Everyone cant be as strong as you areso absorbed in a career that they care for nothing else
This amused him
With forearms on the edge of the table he turned his cigarette slowly round between his fingers watching the smoke curl up from it
She observed that there was more than a light sprinkle of gray in his thick carefully brushed hair
She was filled with curiosity as to the thoughts just then in that marvelous brain of his nor did it lessen her curiosity to know that never would those thoughts be revealed to her
What women had he loved
What women had loved him
What follies had he committed
From how many sources he must have gathered his knowledge of human nature ofwoman nature
And no doubt he was still gathering
What woman was it now
When he lifted his glance from the cigarette it was to call the waiter and get the bill
Ive a supper engagement he said and its nearly eleven oclock
Eleven oclock
she exclaimed
Times does flydoesnt itwhen a man and a woman each an unexplored mystery to the other are dining alone and talking about themselves
It was my fault said Susan
His quizzical eyes looked into hersuncomfortably far
She flushed
You make me feel guiltier than I am she protested under cover of laughing glance and tone of raillery
Guilty
Of what
You think Ive been trying toto encourage you replied she frankly
And why shouldnt you if you feel so inclined
laughed he
That doesnt compel me to beencouraged
Honestly I havent said she the contents of seriousness still in the gay wrapper of raillery
At least not any more than You know a woman feels bound to encourage a man who piques her by seemingdifficult
Naturally youd not have objected to baptizing the new hat and dress with my hearts blood
She could not have helped laughing with him
Unfortunately for youor rather for the new toilettemy poor heart was bled dry long long ago
Im a busy man toobusy and a little tired
I deserve it all said she
Ive brought it on myself
And Im not a bit sorry I started the subject
Ive found out youre quite humanand thatll help me to work better
They separated with the smiling faces of those who have added an evening altogether pleasant to memorys store of the pasts happy hoursthat roomy storehouse which is all too empty even where the life has been what is counted happy
He insisted on sending her home in his auto himself taking a taxi to the Players where the supper was given
The moment she was alone for the short ride home her gayety evaporated like a delicious but unstable perfume
Why
Perhaps it was the sight of the girls on the stroll
Had she really been one of themand only a few days ago
Impossible
Not she not the real self 


and perhaps she would be back there with them before long
Nonever never in any circumstances


She had said Never
the first time she escaped from the tenements yet she had gone back


were any of those girls strolling alongwere again any of them Freddie Palmers
At the thought she shivered and quailed
She had not thought of him except casually in many months
What if he should see her should still feel vengefulhe who never forgot or forgavewho would dare anything
And she would be defenseless against him



She remembered what she had last read about him in the newspaper
He had risen in the world was no longer in the criminal class apparently had moved to the class of semicriminal wholly respectable contractorpolitician
No he had long since forgotten her vindictive Italian though he was
The auto set her down at home
Her tremors about Freddie departed but the depression remained
She felt physically as if she had been sitting all evening in a stuffy room with a dull company after a heavy badly selected dinner
She fell easy prey to one of those fits of the blues to which all imaginative young people are at least occasional victims and by which those cursed and hampered with the optimistic temperament are haunted and harassed and all but or quite undone
She had a sense of failure of having made a bad impression
She feared he recalling and reinspecting what she had said would get the idea that she was not in earnest was merely looking for a loverfor a chance to lead a life of luxurious irresponsibility
Would it not be natural for him who knew women well to assume from her mistakenly candid remarks that she was like the rest of the women both the respectable and the free
Why should he believe in her when she did not altogether believe in herself but suspected herself of a secret hankering after something more immediate more easy and more secure than the stage career
The longer she thought of it the clearer it seemed to her to be that she had once more fallen victim to too much hope too much optimism too much and too ready belief in her fellowbeingsshe who had suffered so much from these follies and had tried so hard to school herself against them
She fought this mood of depressionfought alone for Spenser did not notice and she would not annoy him
She slept little that night she felt that she could not hope for peace until she had seen Brent again
XVI TOWARD halfpast ten the next day a few minutes after Rod left for the theater she was in the bathroom cleaning the coffee machine
There came a knock at the door of the sittingroom bedroom
Into such disorder had her mood of depression worried her nerves that she dropped the coffee machine into the washbowl and jumped as if she were seeing a ghost
Several dire calamities took vague shape in her mind then the image of Freddie Palmer smiling sweetly cruelly
She wavered only a moment went to the door and after a brief hesitation that still further depressed her about herself she opened it
The maida goodnatured sloven who had become devoted to Susan because she gave her liberal fees and made her no extra workwas standing there in an attitude of suppressed excitement
Susan laughed for this maid was a born agitator a person who is always trying to find a thrill or to put a thrill into the most trivial event
What is it now Annie
Susan asked
Mr Spenserhes gone hasnt he
Yesa quarter of an hour ago
Annie drew a breath of deep relief
I was sure he had went said she producing from under her apron a note
I saw it was in a gentlemans writing so I didnt come up with it till he was out of the way though the boy brought it a little after nine
Oh bother
exclaimed Susan taking the note
Well Mrs Spenser Ive had my lesson replied Annie apologetic but firm
When I first came to New York green as the grass that grows along the edge of the spring what does I do but go to work and take up a note to a lady when her husband was there
Next thing I knew he went to work and hauled her round the floor by the hair and skinned outyes beat it for good
And my madam says to me Annie youre fired
Never give a note to a lady when her gent is by or to a gent when his ladys by
Thats the first rule of life in gay New York
And you can bet I never have sincenor never will
Susan had glanced at the address on the note had recognized the handwriting of Brents secretary
Her heart had straightway sunk as if the foreboding of calamity had been realized
As she stood there uncertainly Annie seized the opportunity to run on and on
Susan now said absently Thank you
Very well and closed the door
It was a minute or so before she tore open the envelope with an impatient gesture and read DEAR MRS SPENSER Mr Brent requests me to ask you not to come until further notice
It may be sometime before he will be free to resume
Yours truly JOHN C GARVEY
It was a fair specimen of Garveys official style with which she had become acquaintedthe style of the secretary who has learned by experience not to use frills or flourishes but to convey his message in the fewest and clearest words
Had it been a skillfully worded insult Susan in this mood of depression and distorted mental vision could not have received it differently
She dropped to a chair at the table and stared at the five lines of neat handwriting until her eyes became circled and her face almost haggard
Precisely as Rod had described
After a long long time she crumpled the paper and let it fall into the wastebasket
Then she walked up and down the roompresently drifted into the bathroom and resumed cleaning the coffee machine
Every few moments she would pause in the taskand in her dressing afterwardswould be seized by the fear the horror of again being thrust into that hideous underworld
What was between her and it to save her from being flung back into its degradation
Two men on neither of whom she could rely
Brent might drop her at any timeperhaps had already dropped her
As for Rodvain capricious faithless certain to become an unendurable tyrant if he got her in his powerRod was even less of a necessity than Brent
What a dangerous situation was hers
How slender her chances of escape from another catastrophe
She leaned against wall or table and was shaken by violent fits of shuddering
She felt herself slippingslipping
It was all she could do to refrain from crying out
In those moments no trace of the selfpossessed Susan the world always saw
Her fancy went mad and ran wild
She quivered under the actuality of coarse contactsMrs Tucker in bed with herthe men who had bought her body for an hourthe vermin of the tenementsthe brutal hands of policemen
Then with an exclamation of impatience or of anger she would shake herself together and go resolutely ononly again to relapse
Because I so suddenly cut off the liquor and the opium she said
It was the obvious and the complete explanation
But her heart was like lead and her sky like ink
This note the day after having tried her out as a possibility for the stage and as a woman
She stared down at the crumpled note in the wastbasket
That noteit was herself
He had crumpled her up and thrown her into the wastebasket where she no doubt belonged
It was nearly noon before she dressed with unconscious care stood in the street doorway looking about uncertainly as if she did not know which way to turn
She finally moved in the direction of the theater where Rods play was rehearsing
She had gone to none of the rehearsals because Rod had requested it
I want you to see it as a total surprise the first night explained he
Thatll give you more pleasure and also it will make your criticism more valuable to us
And she had acquiesced not displeased to have all her time for her own affairs
But now she dazed stunned almost convinced that it was all over for her with Brent instinctively turned to Rod to get human helpnot to ask for it but in the hope that somehow he would divine and would say or do something that would make the way ahead a little less forbiddingsomething that would hearten her for the few first steps anyhow
She turned back several timesnow because she feared Rod wouldnt like her coming again because her experienceenlightened good sensetold her that Rod wouldcouldnot help her that her sole reliance was herself
But in the end driven by one of those spasms of terror lest the underworld should be about to engulf her again she stood at the stage door
As she was about to negotiate the surly looking man on guard within Sperry came rushing down the long dark passageway
He was brushing past her when he saw who it was
Too late
he cried
Rehearsals over
I didnt come to the rehearsal explained Susan
I thought perhaps Rod would be going to lunch
So he is
Go straight back
Youll find him on the stage
Ill join you if youll wait a minute or so
And Sperry hurried on into the street
Susan advanced along the passageway cautiously as it was but one remove from pitch dark
Perhaps fifty feet and she came to a cross passage
As she hesitated a door at the far end of it opened and she caught a glimpse of a dressingroom and in the space made by the partly opened door a woman halfdressedan attractive glimpse
The womanwho seemed youngwas not looking down the passage but into the room
She was laughing in the way a woman laughs only when it is for a man for the manand was saying Now Rod you must go and give me a chance to finish dressing
A mans armRods armreached across the opening in the doorway
A handSusan recognized Rods wellshaped handwas laid strongly yet tenderly upon the pretty bare arm of the struggling laughing young womanand the door closedand the passage was sootdark again
All this a matter of less than five seconds
Susan ashamed at having caught him frightened lest she should be found where she had no business to be fled back along the main passage and jerked open the street door
She ran squarely into Sperry
II beg your pardon stammered he
I was in such a rushI ought to have been thinking where I was going
Did I hurt you
This last most anxiously
Im so sorry Its nothingnothing laughed Susan
You are the one thats hurt
And in fact she had knocked Sperry breathless
You dont look anything like so strong gasped he
Oh my appearance is deceptivein a lot of ways
For instance he could have got from her face just then no hint of the agony of fear torturing herfear of the drop into the underworld
Find Rod
asked he
He wasnt on the stage
SoI came out again
Wait here said Sperry
Ill hunt him up
Oh noplease dont
I stopped on impulse
Ill not bother him
She smiled mischievously
I might be interrupting
Sperry promptly reddened
She had no difficulty in reading what was in his mindthat her remark had reminded him of Rods affair and he was cursing himself for having been so stupid as to forget it for the moment and put his partner in danger of detection
II guess hes gone stammered Sperry
Lord but that was a knock you gave me
Better come to lunch with me
Susan hesitated a wistful forlorn look in her eyes
Do you really want me
asked she
Come right along said Sperry in a tone that left no doubt of his sincerity
Well go to the Knickerbocker and have something good to eat
Oh noa quieter place urged Susan
Sperry laughed
You mean less expensive
Theres one of the great big differences between you and the makebelieve ladies one bumps into in this part of town
You dont like to be troublesome or expensive
But well go to the Knickerbocker
I feel way down today and I intended to treat myself
You dont look any too gayhearted yourself
Ill admit I dont like the way the cards are running said Susan
Buttheyll run bettersooner or later
Sure
cried Sperry
You neednt worry about the play
Thats all right
How I envy women
Why
Ohyou have Rod between you and the fight
While IIve got to look out for myself
So have I said Susan
So has everyone for that matter
Believe me Mrs Spenser cried Sperry earnestly you can count on Rod
No matter what Please
protested Susan
I count on nobody
I learned long ago not to lean
Well leaning isnt exactly a safe position Sperry admitted
There never was a perfectly reliable crutch
Tell me your troubles
Susan smilingly shook her head
Thatd be leaning



No thank you
Ive got to think it out for myself
I believed I had arranged for a career for myself
It seems to have gone to pieces Thats all
Something else will turn upafter lunch
Not a doubt in the world replied he confidently
Meanwhiletheres Rod
Susans laugh of raillery made him blush guiltily
Yes said she theres Rod
She laughed again merrily
Theres Rodbut where is there
Youre the only woman in the world he has any real liking for said Sperry earnest and sincere
Dont you ever doubt that Mrs
Spenser
When they were seated in the cafe and he had ordered he excused himself and Susan saw him make his way to a table where sat Fitzalan and another man who looked as if he too had to do with the stage
It was apparent that Fitzalan was excited about something his lips his arms his head were in incessant motion
Susan noted that he had picked up many of Brents mannerisms she had got the habit of noting this imitativeness in menand in women toofrom having seen in the old days how Rod took on the tricks of speech manner expression thought even of whatever man he happened at the time to be admiring
May it not have been this trait of Rods that gave her the clue to his character when she was thinking him over after the separation
Sperry was gone nearly ten minutes
He came full of apologies
Fitz held on to me while he roasted Brent
Youve heard of Brent of course
Yes said Susan
Fitz has been seeing him off
And he says its Susan glanced quickly at him
Off
she said
To Europe
Susan had paused in removing her left glove
Rods description of Brents way of sidesteppingRods description to the last detail
Her hands fluttered uncertainlyfluttering fingers like a flock of birds flushed and confused by the bang of the gun
And Fitz says For Europe said Susan
She was drawing her fingers slowly one by one from the fingers of her glove
Yes
He sailed it seems on impulse barely time to climb aboard
Fitz always lays everything to a woman
He says Brent has been mixed up for a year or so with Oh it doesnt matter
I oughtnt to repeat those things
I dont believe emon principle
Every manor womanwho amounts to anything has scandal talked about him or her all the time
Good Lord
If Robert Brent bothered with half the affairs that are credited to him hed have no time or strengthnot to speak of brainsto do plays
I guess even the busiest man manages to fit a woman in somehow observed Susan
A woman or so
Sperry laughed
I guess yes said he
But as to Brent most of the scandal about him is due to a fad of hishunting for an undeveloped female genius who Ive heard of that interrupted Susan
The service is dreadfully slow here
How long is it since you ordered
Twenty minutesand here comes our waiter
And then being one of those who must finish whatever they have begun he went on
Well its true Brent does pick up and drop a good many ladies of one kind and another
And naturally every one of them is goodlooking and clever or hed not start in
Butyou may laugh at me if you likeI think hes strictly business with all of them
Hed have got into trouble if he hadnt been
And Fitz admits this one womanshes a society womanis the only one theres any real basis for talk about in connection with Brent
Susan had several times lifted a spoonful of soup to her lips and had every time lowered it untasted
And Brents mighty decent to those he tries and has to give up
I know of one woman he carried on his pay roll for nearly two years Lets drop Mr Brent cried Susan
Tell me aboutabout the play
Rod must be giving you an overdose of that
Ive not seen much of him lately
How was the rehearsal
Fairfair
And Sperry forgot Brent and talked on and on about the play not checking himself until the coffee was served
He had not observed that Susan was eating nothing
Neither had he observed that she was not listening but there was excuse for this oversight as she had set her expression at absorbed attention before withdrawing within herself to thinkand to suffer
She came to the surface again when Sperry complaining of the way the leading lady was doing her part said No wonder Brent drops one after another
Women arent worth much as workers
Their real minds always occupied with the search for a man to support em
Not always cried Susan quivering with sudden pain
Oh no Mr Sperrynot always
Yesthere are exceptions said Sperry not noting how he had wounded her
Butwell I never happened to run across one
Can you blame them
mocked Susan
She was ashamed that she had been stung into crying out
To be honestno said Sperry
I suspect Id throw up the sponge and sell out if I had anything a lady with cash wanted to buy
I only suspect myself
But I know most men would
No I dont blame the ladies
Why not have a nice easy time
Only one short lifeand thenthe worms
She was struggling with the rearoused insane terror of a fall back to the depths whence she had once more just comeand she felt that if she fell again it would mean the very end of hope
It must have been instinct or accident for it certainly was not any prompting from her calm expression that moved him to say Now tell me your troubles
Ive told you mine



You surely must have some
Susan forced a successful smile of raillery
None to speak of evaded she
When she reached home there was a telegramfrom Brent Compelled to sail suddenly
Shall be back in a few weeks
Dont mind this annoying interruption
R B
A very few minutes after she read these words she was at work on the play
Buta very few minutes thereafter she was sitting with the play in her lap eyes gazing into the black and menacing future
The misgivings of the night before had been fed and fattened into despairing certainties by the events of the day
The sun was shining never more brightly but it was not the light of her City of the Sun
She stayed in all afternoon and all evening
During those hours before she put out the light and shut herself away in the dark a score of Susans every one different from every other had been seen upon the little theater of that lodging house parlorbedroom
There had been a hopeful Susan a sad but resolved Susan a strong Susan a weak Susan there had been Susans who could not have shed a tear there had been Susans who shed many tearssome of them Susans all bitterness others Susans all humility and selfreproach
Any spectator would have been puzzled by this shifting of personality
Susan herself was completely confused
She sought for her real self among this multitude so contradictory
Each successive one seemed the reality yet none persisted
When we look in at our own souls it is like looking into a manysided room lined with mirrors
We see reflectionsrereflectionsviews at all anglesbut we cannot distinguish the soul itself among all these counterfeits all real yet all false because partial
What shall I do
What can I do
What will I do
that was her last cry as the day ended
And it was her first cry as her weary brain awakened for the new day
At the end of the week came the regular check with a note from Garveyless machinelike more human
He apologized for not having called said one thing and another had prevented and now illness of a near relative compelled him to leave town for a few days but as soon as he came back he would immediately call
It seemed to Susan that there could be but one reason why he should callthe reason that would make a timid softhearted man such as he put off a personal interview as long as he could find excuses
She flushed hot with rage and shame as she reflected on her position
Garvey pitying her
She straightway sat down and wrote DEAR MR GARVEY Do not send me any more checks until Mr Brent comes back and I have seen him
I am in doubt whether I shall be able to go on with the work he and I had arranged
She signed this Susan Lenox and dispatched it
At once she felt better in spite of the fact that she had with characteristic and fatal folly her good sense warned her cut herself off from all the income in sight or in prospect
She had debated sending back the check but had decided that if she did she might give the impression of pique or anger
No she would give him every chance to withdraw from a bargain with which he was not content and he would get the idea that it was she who was ending the arrangement would therefore feel no sense of responsibility for her
She would save her pride she would spare his feelings
She was taking counsel of Burlingham these dayswas recalling the lesson he had taught her was getting his aid in deciding her course
Burlingham protested vehemently against this sending back of the check but she let her pride her aversion to being an object of pity overrule him
A few days more and she was so desperate so harassed that she altogether lost confidence in her own judgment
While outwardly she seemed to be the same as always with Rod she had a feeling of utter alienation
Still there was no one else to whom she could turn
Should she put the facts before him and ask his opinion
Her intelligence said no her heart said perhaps
While she was hesitating he decided for her
One morning at breakfast he stopped talking about himself long enough to ask carelessly About you and Brenthes gone away
What are you doing
Nothing said she
Going to take that business up again when he comes back
I dont know
I wouldnt count on it if I were you



Youre so sensitive that Ive hesitated to say anything
But I think that chap was looking for trouble and when he found you were already engaged why he made up his mind to drop it
Do you think so
said Susan indifferently
More coffee
Yesa little
If my plays as good as your coffee Thats enough thanks



Do you still draw youryour His tone as he cast about for a fit word made her flush scarlet
NoI stopped it until we begin work again
He did not conceal his thorough satisfaction
Thats right
he cried
The only cloud on our happiness is gone
You know a man doesnt like that sort of thing
I know said Susan drily
And she understood why that very night he for the first time asked her to supper after the rehearsal with Sperry and Constance Francklyn the leading lady with whom he was having one of those affairs which as he declared to Sperry were absolutely necessary to a man of genius to keep him freshened upto keep the fire burning brightly
He had carefully coached Miss Francklyn to play the part of unsuspected understudySusan saw that before they had been seated in Jacks ten minutes
And she also saw that he was himself resolved to conduct himself like a gentleman
But after he had taken two or three highballs Susan was forced to engage deeply in conversation with the exasperated and alarmed Sperry to avoid seeing how madly Rod and Constance were flirting
She however did contrive to see nothingat least the other three were convinced that she had not seen
When they were back in their rooms Rodwhether through pretense or through sidetracked amorousness or from simple intoxicationbecame more demonstrative than he had been for a long time
No theres nobody like you he declared
Even if I wandered Id always come back to you
Really
said Susan with careless irony
Thats good
No I can unhook my blouse
I do believe youre growing cold
I dont feel like being messed with tonight
Oh very well said he sulkily
Then forgetting his ill humor after a few minutes of watching her graceful movements and gestures as she took off her dress and made her beautiful hair ready for the night he burst out in a very different tone You dont know how glad I am that youre dependent on me again
Youll not be difficult any more
A moments silence then Susan with a queer little laugh Men dont in the least minddo they
Mind what
Being loved for money
There was a world of sarcasm in her accent on that word loved
Oh nonsense
You dont understand yourself declared he with large confidence
Women never grow up
Theyre like babiesand babies you know love the person that feeds them
And dogsand catsand birdsand all the lower orders
She took a book and sat in a wrapper under the light
Come to bedplease dear pleaded he
No Ill read a while
And she held the book before her until he was asleep
Then she sat a long time her elbows on her knees her chin supported by her hands her gaze fixed upon his facethe face of the man who was her master now
She must please him must accept what treatment he saw fit to give must rein in her ambitions to suit the uncertain gait and staying power of his ability to achieve
She could not leave him he could leave her when he might feel so inclined
Her mastercapricious tyrannical a drunkard
Her sole relianceand the first condition of his protection was that she should not try to do for herself
A dependent condemned to become even more dependent
XVII SHE now spent a large part of every day in wandering like a derelict drifting aimlessly this way or that up into the Park or along Fifth Avenue
She gazed intently into shop windows apparently inspecting carefully all the articles on display but she passed on unconscious of having seen anything
If she sat at home with a book she rarely turned a page though her gaze was fastened upon the print as if she were absorbingly interested
What was she feeling
The coarse contacts of street life and tenement lifethe choice between monstrous defilements from human beings and monstrous defilements from filth and vermin
What was she seeing
The old women of the slumsthe forlorn aloof figures of shattered health and lookscreeping along the gutters dancing in the barrel houses sleeping on the floor in some vile hole in the wallsleeping the sleep from which one awakes bitten by mice and bugs and swarming with lice
She had entire confidence in Brents judgment
Brent must have discovered that she was without talent for the stagefor if he had thought she had the least talent would he not in his kindness have arranged or offered some sort of place in some theater or other
Since she had no stage talentthenwhat should she do
What could she do
And so her mind wandered as aimlessly as her wandering steps
And never before had the sweet melancholy of her eyes been so moving
But though she did not realize it there was a highly significant difference between this mood of profound discouragement and all the other similar moods that had accompanied and accelerated her downward plunges
Every time theretofore she had been cowed by the crushing mandate of destinyhad made no struggle against it beyond the futile threshings about of aimless youth
This time she lost neither strength nor courage
She was no longer a child she was no longer mere human flotsam and jetsam
She did not know which way to turn but she did know with all the certainty of a dauntless will that she would turn some wayand that it would not be a way leading back to the marshes and caves of the underworld
She wanderedshe wandered aimlessly but not for an instant did she cease to keep watch for the right directionthe direction that would be the best available in the circumstances
She did not know or greatly care which way it led so long as it did not lead back whence she had come
In all her excursions she hadnot consciously but by instinctkept away from her old beat
Indeed except in the company of Spenser or Sperry she had never ventured into the neighborhood of Long Acre
But one day she was deflected by chance at the Fortysecond Street corner of Fifth Avenue and drifted westward pausing at each book stall to stare at the titles of the bargain offerings in literature
As she stood at one of these stalls near Sixth Avenue she became conscious that two men were pressing against her one on either side
She moved back and started on her way
One of the men was standing before her
She lifted her eyes was looking into the cruel smiling eyes of a man with a big black mustache and the jaws of a prizefighter
His smile broadened
I thought it was you Queenie said he
Delighted to see you
She recognized him as a fly cop who had been one of Freddie Palmers handy men
She fell back a step and the other manshe knew him instantly as also a policemanlined up beside him of the black mustache
Both men were laughing
Weve been on the lookout for you a long time Queenie said the other
Theres a friend of yours that wants to see you mighty bad
Susan glanced from one to the other her face pale but calm in contrast to her heart where was all the fear and horror of the police which long and savage experience had bred
She turned away without speaking and started toward Sixth Avenue
Now what dye think of that
said Black Mustache to his side kick
I thought she was too much of a lady to cut an old friend
Guess wed better run her in Pete
Thats right assented Pete
Then we can keep her safe till F P can get the hooks on her
Black Mustache laughed laid his hand on her arm
Youll come along quietly said he
You dont want to make a scene
You always was a perfect lady
She drew her arm away
I am a married womanliving with my husband
Black Mustache laughed
Think of that Pete
And she soliciting us
Thatll be good news for your loving husband
Come along Queenie
Your records against you
Everybodyll know youve dropped back to your old ways
I am going to my husband said she quietly
You had better not annoy me
Pete looked uneasy but Black Mustaches sinister face became more resolute
If you wanted to live respectable why did you solicit us two
Come alongor do you want me and Pete to take you by the arms
Very well said she
Ill go
She knew the police knew that Palmers lieutenant would act as he saidand she also knew what her record would do toward carrying through the plot
She walked in the direction of the station house the two plain clothes men dropping a few feet behind and rejoining her only when they reached the steps between the two green lamps
In this way they avoided collecting a crowd at their heels
As she advanced to the desk the sergeant yawning over the blotter glanced up
Bless my soul
cried he all interest at once
If it aint F Ps Queenie
And up to her old tricks sergeant said Black Mustache
She solicited me and Pete
Susan was looking the sergeant straight in the eyes
I am a married woman said she
I live with my husband
I was looking at some books in Fortysecond Street when these two came up and arrested me
The sergeant quailed glanced at Pete who was guiltily hanging his headglanced at Black Mustache
There he got the support he was seeking
Whats your husbands name
demanded Black Mustache roughly
Whats your address
And Rods play coming on the next night but one
She shrank collected herself
I am not going to drag him into this if I can help it said she
I give you a chance to keep yourselves out of trouble
She was gazing calmly at the sergeant again
You know these men are not telling the truth
You know theyve brought me here because of Freddie Palmer
My husband knows all about my past
He will stand by me
But I wish to spare him
The sergeants uncertain manner alarmed Black Mustache
Shes putting up a good bluff scoffed he
The truth is she aint got no husband
Shed not have solicited us if she was living decent
You hear what the officer says said the sergeant taking the tone of great kindness
Youll have to give your name and addressand Ill leave it to the judge to decide between you and the officers
He took up his pen
Whats your name
Susan weak and trembling was clutching the iron rail before the deskthe rail worn smooth by the nervous hands of ten thousand of the social systems sick or crippled victims
Comewhats your name
jeered Black Mustache
Susan did not answer
Put her down Queenie Brown cried he triumphantly
The sergeant wrote
Then he said Age
No answer from Susan
Black Mustache answered for her About twentytwo now
She dont look it said the sergeant almost at ease once more
But brunettes stands the racket bettern blondes
Native parents
No answer
Native
You dont look Irish or Dutch or Dagothough you might have a dash of the Spinnitch or the Frogeaters
Ever arrested before
No answer from the girl standing rigid at the bar
Black Mustache said At least oncet to my knowledge
I run her in myself
Oh shes got a record
exclaimed the sergeant now wholly at ease
Why the hell didnt you say so
I thought you remembered
You took her pedigree
I do recollect now said the sergeant
Take my advice Queenie and drop that bluff about the officers lying
Swallow your medicineplead guiltyand youll get off with a fine
If you lie about the police the judgell soak it to you
It happens to be a good judgea friend of Freddies
Then to the policemen Take her along to court boys and get back here as soon as you can
I want her locked up objected Black Mustache
I want F P to see her
Ive got to hunt for him
Cant do it said the sergeant
If she makes a yell about police oppression our holding on to her would look bad
No put her through
Susan now straightened herself and spoke
I shant make any complaint said she
Anything rather than court
I cant stand that
Keep me here
Not on your life
cried the sergeant
Thats a trick
Shed have a good case against us
F Pll raise the devil if began Black Mustache
Then hunt him up right away
To court shes got to go
I dont want to get broke
The two men fell afoul each other with curse and abuse
They were in no way embarrassed by the presence of Susan
Her record made her of no account either as a woman or as a witness
Soon each was so well pleased with the verbal wounds he had dealt the other that their anger evaporated
The upshot of the hideous controversy was that Black Mustache said You take her to court Pete
Ill hunt up F P Keep her till the last
In after days she could recall starting for the street car with the officer Pete then memory was a blank until she was sitting in a stuffy room with a prison odorthe anteroom to the court
She and Pete were alone
He was walking nervously up and down pulling his little fair mustache
It must have been that she had retained throughout the impassive features which however stormy it was within gave her an air of strength and calm
Otherwise Pete would not presently have halted before her to say in a low agitated voice If you can make trouble for us dont do it
Ive got a wife and three babiesone come only last weekand my old mother paralyzed
You know how it is with us fellowsthat weve got to do what them higher up says or be broke
Susan made no reply
And F Phes right up next the big fellows nowadays
What he says goes
You can see for yourself how much chance against him thered be for a common lowdown cop
She was still silent not through anger as he imagined but because she had no sense of the reality of what was happening
The officer who had lost his nerve looked at her a moment in his animal eyes a humble pleading look then he gave a groan and turned away
Oh hell
he muttered
Again her memory ceased to record untilthe door swung open she shivered thinking it was the summons to court
Instead there stood Freddie Palmer
The instant she looked into his face she became as calm and strong as her impassive expression had been falsely making her seem
Behind him was Black Mustache his face ghastly sullen cowed
Palmer made a jerky motion of head and arm
Pete went and the door closed and she was alone with him
Ive seen the Judge and youre free said Freddie
She stood and began to adjust her hat and veil
Ill have those filthy curs kicked off the force
She was looking tranquilly at him
You dont believe me
You think I ordered it done
She shrugged her shoulders
No matter she said
Its undone now
Im much obliged
Its more than I expected
You dont believe meand I dont blame you
You think Im making some sort of grandstand play
You havent changedat least not much
Ill admit when you left I was wild and did tell em to take you in as soon as they found you
But that was a long time ago
And I never meant them to disturb a woman who was living respectably with her husband
There may have beenyes there was a time when Id have done thatand worse
But not any more
You say I havent changed
Well youre wrong
In some ways I have
Im climbing up as I always told you I wouldand as a man gets up he sees things differently
At least he acts differently
I dont do that kind of dirty work any more
Im glad to hear it murmured Susan for lack of anything else to say
He was as handsome as ever she sawhad the same charm of mannera charm owing not a little of its potency to the impression he made of the man who would dare as far as any man and then go on to dare a step fartherthe step from which all but the rare utterly unafraid man shrinks
His look at her could not but appeal to her vanity as woman and to her womans craving for being loved at the same time it agitated her with specters of the days of her slavery to him
He said Youve changeda lot
And all to the good
The only sign is rouge on your lips and that isnt really a sign nowadays
But then you never did look the professionaland you werent
His eyes were appealingly tender as he gazed at her sweet pensive face with its violetgray eyes full of mystery and sorrow and longing
And the clear pallor of her skin and the slender yet voluptuous lines of her form suggested a pale beautiful rose most delicate of flowers yet about the hardiest
Soyouve married and settled down
No replied Susan
Neither the one nor the other
Why you told Im supposed to be a married woman
Why didnt you give your name and address at the police station
said he
Theyd have let you go at once
Yes I know replied she
But the newspapers would probably have published it
SoI couldnt
As it is Ive been worrying for fear Id be recognized and the man would get a writeup
That was square said he
Yes itd have been a dirty trick to drag him in
It was the matterofcourse to both of them that she should have protected her friend
She had simply obeyed about the most stringent and least often violated article in the moral code of the world of outcasts
If Freddies worst enemy in that world had murdered him Freddie would have used his last breath in shielding him from the common foe the law
If youre not married to him youre free said Freddie with a sudden new kind of interest in her
I told you I should always be free
They remained facing each other a moment
When she moved to go he said I see youve still got your taste in dressonly more so
She smiled faintly glanced at his clothing
He was dressed with real fashion
He looked Fifth Avenue at its best and his expression bore out the appearance of the wellbred man of fortune
I can return the compliment said she
And you too have improved
At a glance all the old fear of him had gone beyond the possibility of return
For she instantly realized that like all those who give up war upon society and come in and surrender he was enormously agitated about his new status was impressed by the conventionalities to a degree that made him almost weak and mildly absurd
He was saying I dont think of anything else but improvingin every way
And the higher I get the higher I want to go



That was a dreadful thing I did to you
I wasnt to blame
It was part of the system
A mans got to do at every stage whatevers necessary
But I dont expect you to appreciate that
I know youll never forgive me
Im used to men doing dreadful things
You dont do them
Oh I was brought up badlybadly for the game I mean
But Im doing better and I shall do still better
I cant abolish the system
I cant stand out against itand live
So Im yieldingin my own foolish fashion
You dont lay up against me thetheyou know what I mean
The question surprised her so far as it aroused any emotion
She answered indifferently I dont lay anything up against anybody
Whats the use
I guess we all do the best we canthe best the systemll let us
And she was speaking the exact truth
She did not reason out the causes of a state of mind so alien to the experiences of the comfortable classes that they could not understand it would therefore see in it hardness of heart
In fact the heart has nothing to do with this attitude in those who are exposed to the full force of the cruel buffetings of the storms that incessantly sweep the wild and wintry sea of active life
They lose the sense of the personal
Where they yield to anger and revenge upon the instrument the blow fate has used it to inflict the resentment is momentary
The mood of personal vengeance is characteristic of stupid people leading uneventful livesof comfortable classes of remote rural districts
She again moved to go this time putting out her hand with a smile
He said with an awkwardness most significant in one so supple of mind and manner I want to talk to you
Ive got something to proposesomething thatll interest you
Will you give mesay about an hour
She debated then smiled
You will have me arrested if I refuse
He flushed scarlet
Youre giving me whats coming to me said he
The reasonone reasonIve got on so well is that Ive never been a liar
Noyou never were that
You too
Its always a sign of bravery and braverys the one thing I respect
Yes what I said Id do always I did
Thats the only way to get on in politicsand the crookeder the politics the more careful a man has to be about acting on the level
I can borrow a hundred thousand dollars without signing a paperand thats more than the crooks in Wall Street can dothe biggest and best of them
So when I told you how things were with me about you I was on the level
I know it said Susan
Where shall we go
I cant ask you to come home with me
We might go to tea somewhere Susan laughed outright
Tea
Freddie Palmer proposing tea
What a changed hooliganhow ridiculously changed
The other Freddie Palmerthe real onethe fascinating repelling mixture of all the barbaric virtues and vices must still be there
But how carefully hiddenand what strong provocation would be needed to bring that savage to the surface again
The Italian in him that was carrying him so far so cleverly enabled him instantly to understand her amusement
He echoed her laugh
Said he Youve no idea the kind of people Im traveling withnot political swells but the real thing
What do you say to the Brevoort
She hesitated
You neednt be worried about being seen with me no matter how high youre flying he hastened to say
I always did keep myself in good condition for the rise
Nothings known about me or ever will be
The girl was smiling at him again
I wasnt thinking of those things said she
Ive never been to the Brevoort
Its quiet and respectable
Susans eyes twinkled
Im glad its respectable said she
Are you quite sure you can afford to be seen with me Its true they dont make the fuss about right and wrong side of the line that they did a few years ago
Theyve gotten a metropolitan morality
StillIm not respectable and never shall be
Dont be too hasty about that protested he gravely
But wait till you hear my proposition
As they walked through West Ninth Street she noted that there was more of a physical change in him than she had seen at first glance
He was less athletic heavier of form and his face was fuller
You dont keep in as good training as you used said she
Its those infernal automobiles cried he
Theyre death to figureto health for that matter
But Ive got the habit and I dont suppose Ill ever break myself of it
Ive taken on twenty pounds in the past year and Ive got myself so upset that the doctor has ordered me abroad to take a cure
Then theres champagne
I cant let that alone either though I know its plain poison
And when they were in the restaurant of the Brevoort he insisted on ordering champagneand left her for a moment to telephone for his automobile
It amused her to see a man so masterful thus pettily enslaved
She laughed at him and he again denounced himself as a weak fool
Money and luxury are too much for me
They are for everybody
Im not as strong willed as I used to be he said
And it makes me uneasy
Thats another reason for my proposition
Welllets hear it said she
I happen to be in a position where Im fond of hearing propositionseven if I have no intention of accepting
She was watching him narrowly
The Freddie Palmer he was showing to her was a surprising but perfectly logical development of a side of his character with which she had been familiar in the old days she was watching for that other sidethe sinister and cruel side
But first he went on I must tell you a little about myself
I think I told you once about my mother and father
I remember said Susan
Well honestly do you wonder that I was what I used to be
No she answered
I wonder that you are what you seem to be
What I come pretty near being cried he
The part thats more or less put on today is going to be the real thing tomorrow
Thats the way it is with lifeyou put on a thing and gradually learn to wear it
AndI want you to help me
There fell silence between them he gazing at his glass of champagne turning it round and round between his long white fingers and watching the bubbles throng riotously up from the bottom
Yes he said thoughtfully I want you to help me
Ive been waiting for you
I knew youd turn up again
He laughed
Ive been true to you in a waya mans way
Ive hunted the town for women who suggested youa poor sort of makeshiftbutI had to do something
What were you going to tell me
Her tone was businesslike
He did not resent it but straightway acquiesced
Ill plunge right in
Ive been as you know a bad onebad all my life
I was born bad
You know about my mother and father
One of my sisters died in a disreputable resort
The otherwell the last I heard of her she was doing time in an English pen
Ive got a brotherhes a degenerate
Wellnot to linger over rotten smells I was the only one of the family that had brains
I soon saw that everybody who gets on in the world is badwhich simply means doing disturbing things of one kind and another
And I saw that the ordinary crooks let their badness run their brains while the geton kind of people let their brains run their badness
You can be rottenand sink lower and lower every day
Or you can gratify your natural taste for rottenness and at the same time get up in the world
I made up my mind to do the rotten things that get a man money and power
Respectability said Susan
Respectability exactly
So I set out to improve my brains
I went to night school and read and studied
And I didnt stay a private in the gang of toughs
I had the brains to be leader but the leaders got to be a fighter too
I took up boxing and made good in the ring
I got to be leader
Then I pushed my way up where I thought out the dirty work for the others to do and I stayed under cover and made em bring the big share of the profits to me
And they did it because I had the brains to think out jobs that paid well and that could be pulled off without getting pinchedat least not always getting pinched
Palmer sipped his champagne looked at her to see if she was appreciative
I thought youd understand said he
I neednt go into details
You remember about the women
Yes I remember said Susan
That was one step in the ladder up
It got me the money to make my first play for respectability
I couldnt have got it any other way
I had extravagant tastesand the leader has to be always giving up to help this fellow and that out of the hole
And I never did have luck with the cards and the horses
Why did you want to be respectable
she asked
Because thats the best graft explained he
It means the most money and the most influence
The coyotes that raid the sheep fold dont get the big sharethough they may get a good deal
No its the shepherds and the owners that pull off the most
Ive been leader of coyotes
Im graduating into shepherd and proprietor
I see said Susan
You make it beautifully clear
He bowed and smiled
Thank you kindly
Then Ill go on
Im deep in the contracting business now
Ive got a pot of money put away
Ive cut out the cardsexcept a little gentlemens game now and then to help me on with the right kind of people
Horses the same way
Ive got my political pull copperriveted
Its as good with the Republicans as with Democrats and as good with the reform crowd as with either
My next move is to cut loose from the gang
Ive put a lot of lieutenants between me and them instead of dealing with them direct
Im putting in several more fellows Im not ashamed to be seen with in Delmonicos
Whats become of Jim
asked Susan
Deada kike shot him all to pieces in a joint in Seventh Avenue about a month ago
As I was saying how do these big multimillionaires do the trick
They dont tell somebody to go steal what they happen to want
They tell somebody they want it and that somebody else tells somebody else to get it and that somebody else passes the word along until it reaches the poor devils who must steal it or lose their jobs
I studied it all out and Ive framed up my game the same way
Nowadays every dollar that comes to me has been thoroughly cleaned long before it drops into my pocket
But youre wondering where you come in
Women are only interested in whats coming to them said Susan
Sensible men are the same way
The men who arentthey work for wages and salaries
If youre going to live off of other people as women and the rich do youve got to stand steady day and night for Number One
And now heres where you come in
Youve no objection to being respectable
Ive no objection to not being disreputable
Thats the right way to put it he promptly agreed
Respectable you know doesnt mean anything but appearances
People who are really respectable who let it strike in instead of keeping it on the outside where it belongsthey soon get poor and drop down and out
Palmers revelation of himself and of a philosophy which life as it had revealed itself to her was incessantly urging her to adopt so grappled her attention that she altogether forgot herself
A man on his way to the scaffold who suddenly sees and feels a cataclysm rocking the world about him forgets his own plight
Unconsciously he was epitomizing unconsciously she was learning the whole story of the progress of the race upward from beast toward intellectthe brutal and bloody building of the highway from the caves of darkness toward the peaks of light
The source from which springs and ever has sprung the cruelty of man toward man is the struggle of the ambition of the few who see and insist upon better conditions with the inertia and incompetence of the many who have little sight and less imagination
Ambition must use the inert massmust persuade it if possible must compel it by trick or force if persuasion fails
But Palmer and Susan Lenox were naturally not seeing the thing in the broad but only as it applied to themselves
Ive read a whole lot of history and biography  Freddie went on and Ive thought about what I read and about whats going on around me
I tell you the worlds full of cant
The people who get there dont act on what is always preached
The preaching isnt all liesat least I think not
But it doesnt fit the facts a man or a woman has got to meet
I realized that long ago said Susan
Theres a saying that you cant touch pitch without being defiled
Wellyou cant build without touching pitchat least not in a world where moneys king and where those with brains have to live off of those without brains by making em work and showing em what to work at
Its a hell of a world but I didnt get it up
And weve got to live in it said she and get out of it the things we want and need
Thats the talk
cried Palmer
I see youre on
Nowto make a long story shortyou and I can get what we want
We can help each other
You were better born than I amyouve had a better training in manners and dress and all the classy sort of things
Ive got the moneyand brains enough to learn withand I can help you in various ways
SoI propose that we go up together
Weve gotpasts said Susan
Who hasnt that amounts to anything
Mighty few
No one thats made his own pile Ill bet you
Im in a position to do favors for peoplethe people wed need
And Ill get in a position to do more and more
As long as they can make something out of usor hope todo you suppose theyll nose into our pasts and root things up thatd injure them as much as us
It would be an interesting game wouldnt it
said Susan
She was reflectively observing the handsome earnest face before heran incarnation of intelligent ambition a Freddie Palmer who was somehow divesting himself of himselfwas growing upaway from the rotten soil that had nourished himup into the airwas growing stronglyyes splendidly
And weve got everything to gain and nothing to lose pursued he
Wed not be adventurers you see
Adventurers are people who havent any money and are looking round to try to steal it
Wed have money
So wed be building solid right on the rock
The handsome young manthe strongest the most intelligent the most purposeful she had ever met except possibly Brentlooked at her with an admiring tenderness that moved her the forlorn derelict adrift on the vast lonely treacherous sea
The reason Ive waited for you to invite you in on this scheme is that I tried you out and I found that you belong to the mighty few people who do what they say theyll do good bargain or bad
Itd never occur to you to shuffle out of trying to keep your word
It hasntso far said Susan
Wellthats the only sort of thing worth talking about as morality
Believe me for Ive been through the whole game from chimney pots to cellar floor
Theres another thing too said the girl
Whats that
Not to injure anyone else
Palmer shook his head positively
Its believing that and acting on it that has kept you down in spite of your brains and looks
That I shall never do said the girl
It may be weaknessI guess it is weakness
ButI draw the line there
But Im not proposing that you injure anyoneor proposing to do it myself
As I said Ive got up where I can afford to be good and kind and all that
And Im willing to jump you up over the stretch of the climb that cant be crossed without beingwell anything but good and kind
She was reflecting
Youll never get over that stretch by yourself
Itll always turn you back
Just what do you propose
she asked
It gave her pleasure to see the keen delight her question with its implication of hope aroused in him
Said he That we go to Europe together and stay over there several yearsas long as you like as long as its necessary
Stay till our pasts have disappearedwork ourselves in with the right sort of people
You say youre not married
Not to the man Im with
To somebody else
I dont know
I was
Wellthatll be looked into and straightened out
And then well quietly marry
Susan laughed
Youre too fast said she
Ill admit Im interested
Ive been looking for a roadone that doesnt lead toward where weve come from
And this is the first road that has offered
But I havent agreed to go in with you yethavent even begun to think it over
And if I did agreewhich I probably wontwhy still Id not be willing to marry
Thats a serious matter
Id want to be very very sure I was satisfied
Palmer nodded with a return of the look of admiration
I understand
You dont promise until you intend to stick and once youve promised all hell couldnt change you
Another thingvery unfortunate too
It looks to me as if Id be dependent on you for money
Freddies eyes wavered
Oh wed never quarrel about that said he with an attempt at careless confidence
No replied she quietly
For the best of reasons
Id not consider going into any arrangement where Id be dependent on a man for money
Ive had my experience
Ive learned my lesson
If I lived with you several years in the sort of style youve suggestedno not several years but a few monthsyoud have me absolutely at your mercy
Youd thought of that hadnt you
His smile was confession
Id develop tastes for luxuries and theyd become necessities
Susan shook her head
Nothat would be foolishvery foolish
He was watching her so keenly that his expression was covert suspicion
What do you suggest
he asked
Not what you suspect replied she amused
Im not making a play for a gift of a fortune
I havent anything to suggest
There was a long silence he turning his glass slowly and from time to time taking a little of the champagne thoughtfully
She observed him with a quizzical expression
It was apparent to her that he was debating whether he would be making a fool of himself if he offered her an independence outright
Finally she said Dont worry Freddie
Id not take it even if you screwed yourself up to the point of offering it
He glanced up quickly and guiltily
Why not
he said
Youd be practically my wife
I can trust you
Youve had experience so you cant blame me for hesitating
Money puts the devil in anybody who gets itman or woman
But Ill trust you he laughedsince Ive got to
No
The most Id take would be a salary
Id be a sort of companion
Anything you like cried he
This last suspicion born of a life of intimate dealings with his fellowbeings took flight
Itd have to be a big salary because youd have to dress and act the part
What do you say
Is it a go
Oh I cant decide now
When
She reflected
I can tell you in a week
He hesitated said All righta week
She rose to go
Ive warned you the chances are against my accepting
Thats because you havent looked the ground over replied he rising
Then after a nervous moment Is theis the He stopped short
Go on said she
We must be frank with each other
If the idea of living with me isis disagreeable And again he stopped greatly embarrassedan amazing indication of the state of mind of such a man as heof the depth of his infatuation of his respect of his newsprung awe of conventionality
I hadnt given it a thought replied she
Women are not especially sensitive about that sort of thing
Theyre supposed to be
And I rather thought you were
She laughed mockingly
No more than other women said she
Look how they marry for a homeor moneyor social positionand such men
And look how they live with men year after year hating them
Men never could do that
Dont you believe it replied he
They can and they do
The kept manin and out of marriageis quite a feature of life in our chaste little village
Susan looked amused
Wellwhy not
said she
Everybodys simply got to have money nowadays
And working for it is slow and mighty uncertain
Her face clouded
She was seeing the sad wretched past from filthy tenement to foul workshop
She said Where shall I send you word
Ive an apartment at Sherrys now
Thena week from today
She put out her hand
He took it and she marveled as she felt a tremor in that steady hand of his
But his voice was resolutely careless as he said So long
Dont forget how much I want or need you
And if you do forget that think of the advantagesseeing the world with plenty of moneyand all the rest of it
Wherell you get such another chance
Youll not be fool enough to refuse
She smiled said as she went You may remember I used to be something of a fool
But that was some time ago
Youve learned a lot since thensurely
Well see
Ive becomeI thinka good deal of aof a New Yorker
That means frank about doing what the rest of the world does under a stack of lies
Its a lovely world isnt it
If I had made it laughed Susan Id not own up to the fact
She laughed but she was seeing the old women of the slumswas seeing them as one sees in the magic mirror the vision of ones future self
And on the way home she said to herself It was a good thing that I was arrested today
It reminded me
It warned me
But for it I might have gone on to make a fool of myself
And she recalled how it had been one of Burlinghams favorite maxims that everything is for the best for those who know how to use it
XVIII SHE wrote Garvey asking an appointment
The reply should have come the next day or the next day but one at the farthest for Garvey had been trained by Brent to the supreme courtesy of promptness
It did not come until the fourth day before she opened it Susan knew about what she would readthe stupidly obvious attempt to put off facing herthe cowardice of a kindhearted weak fellow
She really had her answerwas left without a doubt for hope to perch upon
But she wrote again insisting so sharply that he came the following day
His large telltale face was a restatement of what she had read in his delay and between the lines of his note
He was effusively friendly with a sort of mortuary suggestion like one bearing condolences that tickled her sense of humor far though her heart was from mirth
Something has happened began she that makes it necessary for me to know when Mr Brent is coming back
Really Mrs Spencer Miss Lenox she corrected
YesMiss Lenox I beg your pardon
But reallyin my positionI know nothing of Mr Brents plansand if I did Id not be at liberty to speak of them
I have written him what you wrote me about the checkandandthat is all
Mr Garvey is he everhas he Susan desperate burst out with more than she intended to say I care nothing about it one way or the other
If Mr Brent is politely hinting that I wont do Ive a right to know it
I have a chance at something else
Cant you tell me
I dont know anything about ithonestly I dont Miss Lenox cried he swearing profusely
You put an accent on the know said Susan
You suspect that Im right dont you
Ive no ground for suspectingthat isno I havent
He said nothing to menothing
But he never does
Hes very peculiar and uncertain 


and I dont understand him at all
Isnt this his usual way with the failureshis way of letting them down easily
Susans manner was certainly light and cheerful an assurance that he need have no fear of hysterics or despair or any sort of scene trying to a soft heart
But Garvey could take but the one view of the favor or disfavor of the god of his universe
He looked at her like a dog that is getting a whipping from a friend
Now Miss Lenox youve no right to put me in this painful Thats true said Susan done since she had got what she sought
I shant say another word
When Mr Brent comes back will you tell him I sent for you to ask you to thank him for meand say to him that I found something else for which I hope Im better suited
Im so glad said Garvey hysterically
Im delighted
And Im sure he will be too
For Im sure he liked you personallyand I must say I was surprised when he went
But I must not say that sort of thing
Indeed I know nothing Miss LenoxI assure you And please tell him interrupted Susan that Id have written him myself only I dont want to bother him
Oh nono indeed
Not that Miss Lenox
Im so sorry
But Im only the secretary
I cant say anything
It was some time before Susan could get rid of him though he was eager to be gone
He hung in the doorway ejaculating disconnectedly dropping and picking up his hat perspiring profusely shaking hands again and again and so exciting her pity for his misery of the goodhearted weak that she was for the moment forgetful of her own plight
Long before he went he had greatly increased her already strong belief in Brents generosity of characterfor thought she hed have got another secretary if he hadnt been too kind to turn adrift so helpless and foolish a creature
Wellhe should have no trouble in getting rid of her
She was seeing little of Spenser and they were saying almost nothing to each other
When he came at night always very late she was in bed and pretended sleep
When he awoke she got breakfast in silence they read the newspapers as they ate
And he could not spare the time to come to dinner
As the decisive moment drew near his fears dried up his confident volubility
He changed his mind and insisted on her coming to the theater for the final rehearsals
But Shattered Lives was not the sort of play she cared for and she was wearied by the profane and tedious wranglings of the stage director and the authors by the stupidity of the actors who had to be told every little intonation and gesture again and again
The agitation the labor seemed grotesquely out of proportion to the triviality of the matter at issue
At the first night she sat in a box from which Spenser in a high fever and twitching with nervousness watched the play gliding out just before the lights were turned up for the intermission
The play went better than she had expected and the enthusiasm of the audience convinced her that it was a success before the fall of the curtain on the second act
With the applause that greeted the chief climaxthe end of the third actSpenser Sperry and Fitzalan were convinced
All three responded to curtain calls
Susan had never seen Spenser so handsome and she admired the calmness and the cleverness of his brief speech of thanks
That line of footlights between them gave her a new point of view on him made her realize how being so close to his weaknesses had obscured for her his strong qualitiesfor unfortunately while a mans public life is determined wholly by his strong qualities his intimate life depends wholly on his weaknesses
She was as fond of him as she had ever been but it was impossible for her to feel any thrill approaching love
Why
She looked at his fine face and manly figure she recalled how many good qualities he had
Why had she ceased to love him
She thought perhaps some mystery of physical lack of sympathy was in part responsible then there was the fact that she could not trust him
With many women trust is not necessary to love on the contrary distrust inflames love
It happened not to be so with Susan Lenox
I do not love him
I can never love him again
And when he uses his power over me I shall begin to dislike him
The lost illusion
The dead love
If she could call it back to life
But nothere it lay coffined the gray of death upon its features
Her heart ached
After the play Fitzalan took the authors and the leading lady Constance Francklyn and Miss Lenox to supper in a private room at Rectors
This was Miss Francklyns first trial in a leading part
She had small ability as an actress having never risen beyond the primer stage of mere posing and declamation in which so many players are halted by their vanitythe universal human vanity that is content with small triumphs or with purely imaginary triumphs
But she had a notable figure of the lank serpentine kind and a bad sensual face that harmonized with it
Especially in artificial light she had an uncanny allure of the elemental the wild animal in the jungle
With every disposition and effort to use her physical charms to further herself she would not have been still struggling at twentyeight had she had so much as a thimbleful of intelligence
Several times said Sperry to Susan as they crossed Long Acre together on the way to Rectors yes at least half a dozen times to my knowledge Constance had had success right in her hands
And every time she has gone crazy about some cheap actor or sport and has thrown it away
But shell get on now said Susan
Perhaps was Sperrys doubting reply
Of course shes got no brains
But it doesnt take brains to actthat is to act well enough for cheap machinemade plays like this
And nowadays playwrights have learned that its useless to try to get actors who can act
They try to write parts that are actorproof
You dont like your play
said Susan
Like it
I love it
Isnt it going to bring me in a pot of money
But as a playSperry laughed
I know Spenser thinks its great buttheres only one of us who can write plays and thats Brent
It takes a clever man to write a clever play
But it takes a genius to write a clever play thatll draw the damn fools who buy theater seats
And Robert Brent now and then does the trick
How are you getting on with your ambition for a career
Susan glanced nervously at him
The question coming upon the heels of talk about Brent filled her with alarm lest Rod had broken his promise and had betrayed her confidence
But Sperrys expression showed that she was probably mistaken
My ambition
said she
OhIve given it up
The thought of work was too much for youeh
Susan shrugged her shoulders
A sardonic grin flitted over Sperrys Punchlike face
The more I see of women the less I think of em said he
But I suppose the mend be lazy and worthless too if nature had given em anything thatd sell or rent



Somehow Im disappointed in you though
That ended the conversation until they were sitting down at the table
Then Sperry said Are you offended by my frankness a while ago
No replied Susan
The contrary
Some day your saying that may help me
Its quite true theres something about youa looka mannerit makes one feel you could do things if you tried
Im afraid that something is a fraud said she
No doubt it was that something that had misled Brentthat had always deceived her about herself
No she must not think herself a selfdeceived dreamer
Even if it was so still she must not think it
She must say to herself over and over again Brent or no Brent I shall get onI shall get on until she had silenced the last disheartening doubt
Miss Francklyn with Fitzalan on her left and Spenser on her right was seated opposite Susan
About the time the third bottle was being emptied the attempts of Spenser and Constance to conceal from her their doings became absurd
Long before the supper was over there had been thrust at her all manner of proofs that Spenser was again untrue that he was whirling madly in one of those cyclonic infatuations which soon wore him out and left him to return contritely to her
Sperry admired Susans manners as displayed in her unruffled serenityan admiration which she did not in the least deserve
She was in fact as deeply interested as she seemed in his discussion of plays and acting illustrated by Brents latest production
By the time the party broke up Susan had in spite of herself collected a formidable array of incriminating evidence including the stealing of one of Constances jeweled show garters by Spenser under cover of the tablecloth and a swift kiss in the hall when Constance went out for a moment and Spenser presently suspended his drunken praises of himself as a dramatist and appointed himself a committee to see what had become of her
At the door of the restaurant Spenser said Susan you and Miss Francklyn take a taxicab
Shell drop you at our place on her way home
Fitz and Sperry and I want one more drink
Not for me said Sperry savagely with a scowl at Constance
But Fitzalan whose arm Susan had seen Rod press remained silent
Come on my dear cried Miss Francklyn smiling sweet insolent treachery into Susans face
Susan smiled sweetly back at her
As she was leaving the taxicab in Fortyfifth Street she said Send Rod home by noon wont you
And dont tell him I know
Miss Francklyn who had been drinking greedily began to cry
Susan laughed
Dont be a silly she urged
If Im not upset why should you be
And how could I blame you two for getting crazy about each other
I wouldnt spoil it for worlds
I want to help it on
Dont you love himreally
cried Constance face and voice full of the most thrilling theatricalism
Im very fond of him replied Susan
Were old old friends
But as to loveIm where youll be a few months from now
Miss Francklyn dried her eyes
Isnt it the devil
she exclaimed
Why cant it last
Why indeed said Susan
Good nightand dont forget to send him by twelve oclock
And she hurried up the steps without waiting for a reply
She felt that the time for action had again comethat critical moment which she had so often in the past seen come and had let pass unheeded
He was in love with another woman he was prosperous assured of a good income for a long time though he wrote no more successes
No need to consider him
For herself thenwhat
Clearly there could be no future for her with Rod
Clearly she must go
Must gomust take the only road that offered
Up before heras in every mood of deep depressionrose the vision of the old women of the slumsthe solitary bent broken forms clad in rags feet wrapped in ragsshuffling along in the gutters peering and poking among filth among garbage to get together stuff to sell for the price of a drink
The old women of the tenements the old women of the gutters the old women drunk and dancing as the lecherouseyed hunchback played the piano
She must not this time wait and hesitate and hope this time she must take the road that offeredand since it must be taken she must advance along it as if of all possible roads it was the only one she would have freely chosen
Yet after she had written and sent off the note to Palmer a deep sadness enveloped hera grief not for Rod but for the association the intimacy their life together its sorrows and storms perhaps more than the pleasures and the joys
When she left him before she had gone sustained by the feeling that she was doing it for him was doing a duty
Now she was going merely to save herself to further herself
Life life in that great and hard school of practical living New York had given her the necessary hardiness to go aided by Rods unfaithfulness and growing uncongeniality
But not while she lived could she ever learn to be hard
She would do what she mustshe was no longer a fool
But she could not help sighing and crying a little as she did it
It was not many minutes after noon when Spenser came
He looked so sheepish and uncomfortable that Susan thought Constance had told him
But his opening sentence of apology was I took too many nightcaps and Fitz had to lug me home with him
Really
said Susan
How disappointed Constance must have been
Spenser was not a good liar
His face twisted and twitched so that Susan laughed outright
Why you look like a caught married man cried she
You forget were both free
Whatever put that crazy notion in your headabout Miss Francklyn
demanded he
When you take me or anyone for that big a fool Rod you only show how foolish you yourself are said she with the utmost good humor
The best way to find out how much sense a person has is to see what kind of lies he thinksll deceive another person
Nowdont get jealous Susie soothed he
You know how a man is
The tone was correctly contrite but Susan felt underneath the confidence that he would be forgiventhe confidence of the egotist giddied by a triumph
Said she Dont you think mines a strange way of acting jealous
But youre a strange woman
Susan looked at him thoughtfully
Yes I suppose I am said she
And youll think me stranger when I tell you what Im going to do
He started up in a panic
And the fear in his eyes pleased her at the same time that it made her wince
She nodded slowly
Yes RodIm leaving
Ill drop Constance cried he
Ill have her put out of the company
Nogo on with her till youve got enoughor she has
Ive got enough this minute declared he with convincing energy and passion
You must know dearest that to me Constanceall the women Ive ever seenarent worth your little finger
Youre all that they are and a whole lot more besides
He seized her in his arms
You wouldnt leave meyou couldnt
You understand how men arehow they get these fits of craziness about a pair of eyes or a figure or some trick of voice or manner
But that doesnt affect the mans heart
I love you Susan
I adore you
She did not let him see how sincerely he had touched her
Her eyes were of their deepest violet but he had never learned that sign
She smiled mockingly the fingers that caressed his hair were trembling
Weve tided each other over Rod
The plays a success
Youre all right againand so am I
Nows the time to part
Is it Brent Susie
I quit him last week
Theres no one else
Youre going because of Constance
She did not deny
Youre free and so am I said she practically
Im going
Solets part sensibly
Dont make a silly scene
She knew how to deal with himhow to control him through his vanity
He drew away from her chilled and sullen
If you can live through it I guess I can said he
Youre making a damn fool of yourselfleaving a man thats fond of youand leaving when hes successful
I always was a fool you know said she
She had decided against explaining to him and so opening up endless and vain argument
It was enough that she saw it was impossible to build upon or with him saw the necessity of trying elsewhereunless she would riskno invitefinding herself after a few months or years back among the drift back in the underworld
He gazed at her as she stood smiling gently at himsmiling to help her hide the ache at her heart the terror before the vision of the old women of the tenement gutters earning the wages not of sin not of vice not of stupidity but of indecision of overhopefulnessof weakness
Here was the kind of smile that hurts worse than tears that takes the place of tears and sobs and moans
But he who had never understood her did not understand her now
Her smile infuriated his vanity
You can laugh he sneered
Wellgo to the filth where you belong
You were born for it
And he flung out of the room went noisily down the stairs
She heard the front doors distant slam it seemed to drop her into a chair
She sat there all crouched together until the clock on the mantel struck two
This roused her hastily to gather into her trunk such of her belongings as she had not already packed
She sent for a cab
The man of all work carried down the trunk and put it on the box
Dressed in a simple blue costume as if for traveling she entered the cab and gave the order to drive to the Grand Central Station
At the corner she changed the order and was presently entering the Beaux Arts restaurant where she had asked Freddie to meet her
He was there smoking calmly and waiting
At sight of her he rose
Youll have lunch
said he
No thanks
A small bottle of champagne
YesIm rather tired
He ordered the champagne
And said he itll be the real thingwhich mighty few New Yorkers get even at the best places
When it came he sent the waiter away and filled the glasses himself
He touched the brim of his glass to the bottom of hers
To the new deal said he
She smiled and nodded and emptied the glass
Suddenly it came to her why she felt so differently toward him
She saw the subtle yet radical change that always transforms a man of force of character when his position in the world notably changes
This man before her so slightly different in physical characteristics from the man she had fled was wholly different in expression
When shall we sail
asked he
Tomorrow
Firsttheres the question of money said she
He was much amused
Still worrying about your independence
No replied she
Ive been thinking it out and I dont feel any anxiety about that
Ive changed my scheme of life
Im going to be sensible and practice what life has taught me
It seems theres only one way for a woman to get up
Through some man
Freddie nodded
By marriage or otherwise but always through a man
So Ive discovered continued she
So Im going to play the game
And I think I can win now
With the aid of what Ill learn and with the chances Ill have I can keep my feeling of independence
You see if you and I dont get on well together Ill be able to look out for myself
Somethingll turn up
Orsomebodyeh
Or somebody
Thats candid
Dont you want me to be candid
But even if you dont Ive got to be
Yestruthespecially disagreeable truthis your long suit said he
Not that Im kicking
Im glad you went straight at the money question
We can settle it and never think of it again
And neither of us will be plotting to take advantage of the other or fretting for fear the other is plotting
Sometimes I think nearly all the trouble in this world comes through failure to have a clear understanding about money matters
Susan nodded
Said she thoughtfully I guess thats why I cameone of the main reasons
You are wonderfully sensible and decent about money
And the other chap isnt
Oh yesand no
He likes to make a woman feel dependent
He thinksbut that doesnt matter
Hes all right
Nowfor our understanding with each other said Palmer
You can have whatever you want
The other day you said you wanted some sort of a salary
But if youve changed Nothats what I want
So much a year
So much a week replied she
I want to feel and I want you to feel that we can call it off at any time on seven days notice
But that isnt what I want said heand she watching him closely if furtively saw the strong lines deepen round his mouth
She hesitated
She was seeing the old womans dance hall was hearing the piano as the hunchback played and the old horrors reeled about making their palsy rhythmic
She was seeing this yet she dared
Then you dont want me said she so quietly that he could not have suspected her agitation
Never had her habit of concealing her emotion been so useful to her
He sat frowning at his glassdebating
Finally he said I explained the other day what I was aiming for
Such an arrangement as you suggest wouldnt help
You see that
Its all I can doat present replied she firmly
And she was now ready to stand or fall by that decision
She had always accepted the other previous termsor whatever terms fate offered
Resulteach time disaster
She must make no more fatal blunders
This time her own terms or not at all
He was silent a long time
She knew she had convinced him that her terms were final
So his delay could only mean that he was debating whether to accept or to go his way and leave her to go hers
At last he laughed and said Youve become a true New Yorker
You know how to drive a hard bargain
He looked at her admiringly
You certainly have got courage
I happen to know a lot about your affairs
Ive ways of finding out things
And I know youd not be here if you hadnt broken with the other fellow first
So if I turned your proposition down youd be up against itwouldnt you
Yes said she
ButI wont in any circumstances tie myself
I must be free
Youre right said he
And Ill risk your sticking
Im a good gambler
If I were bound but didnt want to stay would I be of much use
Of no use
You can quit on seven minutes notice instead of seven days
And you also said she
Laughingly they shook hands
She began to like him in a new and more promising way
Here was a man who at least was cast in a big mold
Nothing small and cheap about himand Brent had made small cheap men forever intolerable to her
Yes here was a man of the big sort and a big man couldnt possibly be a bad man
No matter how many bad things he might do he would still be himself at least a scorner of the pettiness and sneakiness and cowardice inseparable from villainy
And now said he lets settle the last detail
How much a week
How would five hundred strike you
Thats more than twelve times the largest salary I ever got
Its many times as much as I made in the No matter he hastily interposed
Its the least you can hold down the job on
Youve got to spend moneyfor clothes and so on
Two hundred is the most I can take said she
Its the outside limit
He insisted but she remained firm
I will not accustom myself to much more than I see any prospect of getting elsewhere explained she
Perhaps later on Ill ask for an increaselater on when I see how things are going and what my prospects elsewhere would be
But I must begin modestly
Well let it go at two hundred for the present
Ill deposit a years salary in a bank and you can draw against it
Is that satisfactory
You dont want me to hand you two hundred dollars every Saturday do you
No
That would get on my nerves said she
Nowits all settled
When shall we sail
Theres a girl Ive got to look up before I go
Maud
You neednt bother about her
Shes married to a piker from up the statea shoe manufacturer
Shes got a baby and is fat enough to make two or three like what she used to be
No not Maud
One you dont know
I hoped we could sail tomorrow
Why not take a taxi and go after her now
It may be a long search
Shes a
He did not need to finish his sentence in order to make himself understood
Susan nodded
Oh let her I promised interrupted she
Thenof course
Freddie drew from his trousers pocket a huge roll of bills
Susan smiled at this proof that he still retained the universal habit of gamblers politicians and similar loose characters of large income precariously derived
He counted off three hundreds and four fifties and held them out to her
Let me in on it said he
Susan took the money without hesitation
She was used to these careless generosities of the men of that classgenerosities passing with them and with the unthinking for evidences of goodness of heart when in fact no generosity has any significance whatever beyond selfish vanity unless it is a sacrifice of necessitiesreal necessities
I dont think Ill need money said she
But I may
Youve got a trunk and a bag on the cab outside he went on
Ive told them at Sherrys that Im to be married
Susan flushed
She hastily lowered her eyes
But she need not have feared lest he should suspect the cause of the blush 


a strange absurd resentment of the idea that she could be married to Freddie Palmer
Live with himyes
But marrynow that it was thus squarely presented to her she found it unthinkable
She did not pause to analyze this feeling indeed could not have analyzed it had she tried
It was however a most interesting illustration of how she had been educated at last to look upon questions of sex as a man looks on them
She was like the man who openly takes a mistress whom he in no circumstances would elevate to the position of wife
So he proceeded you might as well move in at Sherrys
No objected she
Lets not begin the new deal until we sail
The wisdom of this was obvious
Then well take your things over to the Manhattan Hotel said he
And well start the search from there
But after registering at the Manhattan as Susan Lenox she started out alone
She would not let him look in upon any part of her life which she could keep veiled
XIX SHE left the taxicab at the corner of Grand Street and the Bowery and plunged into her former haunts afoot
Once again she had it forced upon her how meaningless in the life history are the words time and space
She was now hardly any distance as measurements go from her present world and she had lived here only a yesterday or so ago
Yet what an infinity yawned between
At the Delancey Street apartment house there was already a new janitress and the kinds of shops on the ground floor had changed
Only after two hours of going up and down stairs of knocking at doors of questioning and crossquestioning did she discover that Clara had moved to Allen Street to the tenement in which Susan herself had for a few weeks livedthose vague besotted weeks of despair
When we go out into the streets with bereavement in mind we see nothing but people dressed in mourning
And a similar thing occurs whatever the emotion that oppresses us
It would not have been strange if Susan on the way to Allen Street afoot had seen only women of the streets for they swarm in every great thoroughfare of our industrial cities
They used to come out only at night
But with the passing of the feeling against them that existed when they were a rare unfamiliar mysteriously terrible minor feature of life they issue forth boldly by day like all the other classes making a living as best they can
But on that day Susan felt as if she were seeing only the broken down and castout creatures of the classthe old women old in body rather than in years picking in the gutters fumbling in the garbage barrels poking and peering everywhere for odds and ends that might pile up into the price of a glass of the poison sold in the barrel houses
The old womenthe hideous lonely old womenand the diseased crippled children worse off than the cats and the dogs for cat and dog were not compelled to wear filthsoaked rags
Prosperous civilized New York
A group of these children were playing some rough game in imitation of their elders that was causing several to howl with pain
She heard a woman being shown about by a settlement worker or some such person say Really not at all badly dressedfor street games
I must confess I dont see signs of the misery they talk so much about
A wave of fury passed through Susan
She felt like striking the woman full in her vain supercilious patronizing facestriking her and saying You smug liar
What if you had to wear such clothes on that fat overfed body of yours
Youd realize then how filthy they are
She gazed in horror at the Allen Street house
Was it possible that she had lived there
In the filthy doorway sat a child eating a dill picklea scrawny ragged little girl with much of her hair eaten out by the mange
She recalled this little girl as the formerly pretty and lively youngster the daughter of the janitress
She went past the child without disturbing her knocked at the janitress door
It presently opened disclosing in a small and foul room four prematurely old women all in the family way two with babies in arms
One of these was the janitress
Though she was not a Jewess she was wearing one of the wigs assumed by orthodox Jewish women when they marry
She stared at Susan with not a sign of recognition
I am looking for Miss Clara said Susan
The janitress debated shifted her baby from one arm to the other glanced inquiringly at the other women
They shook their heads she looked at Susan and shook her head
There aint a Clara said she
Perhaps shes took another name
Perhaps conceded Susan
And she described Clara and the various dresses she had had
At the account of one with flounces on the skirts and lace puffs in the sleeves the youngest of the women showed a gleam of intelligence
You mean the girl with the cancer of the breast said she
Susan remembered
She could not articulate she nodded
Oh yes said the janitress
She had the third floor back and was always kicking because Mrs Pfister kept a guinea pig for her rheumatism and the smell came through
Has she gone
asked Susan
Couple of weeks
Where
The janitress shrugged her shoulders
The other women shrugged their shoulders
Said the janitress Her feller stopped coming
The cancer got awful bad
Ive saw a good manytheyre quite plentiful down this way
I never see a worsen hers
She didnt have no money
Up to the hospital they tried a new cure on her that made her gallopin worse
The day before I was going to have to go to work and put her outshe left
Cant you give me any idea
urged Susan
She didnt take her things said the janitress meaningly
Not a stitch
Thethe river
The janitress shrugged her shoulders
She always said she would and I guess Again the fat stooped shoulders lifted and lowered
She was most crazy with pain
There was a moments silence then Susan murmured Thank you and went back to the hall
The house was exhaling a frightful stenchthe odor of cheap kerosene of things that passed there for food of animals human and lower of death and decay
On her way out she dropped a dollar into the lap of the little girl with the mange
A parrot was shrieking from an upper window
On the topmost fire escape was a row of geraniums blooming sturdily
Her taxicab had moved up the street pushed out of place by a hearsea white hearse with polished mountings the horses caparisoned in white netting and tossing white plumes
A babys funeralthis mockery of a ride in state after a brief life of squalor
It was summer and the babies were dying like lambs in the shambles
In winter the grown people were slaughtered in summer the children
Across the street a few doors up the city dead wagon was taking away another bodyin a plain pine boxto the Potters Field where find their way for the final rest one in every ten of the people of the rich and splendid city of New York
Susan hurried into her cab
Drive fast she said
When she came back to sense of her surroundings she was flying up wide and airy Fifth Avenue with gorgeous sunshine bathing its palaces with wealth and fashion and ease all about her
Her dear City of the Sun
But it hurt her now was hateful to look upon
She closed her eyes her life in the slums her life when she was sharing the lot that is really the lot of the human race as a race passed before herits sights and sounds and odors its hideous heat its still more hideous cold its contacts and associations its dirt and disease and degradation
And through the roar of the city there came to her a sound faint yet intenselike the still small voice the prophet heardbut not the voice of God rather the voice of the multitude of aching hearts aching in hopeless povertyhearts of men of women of children The children
The multitudes of children with hearts that no sooner begin to beat than they begin to ache
She opened her eyes to shut out these sights and that sound of heartache
She gazed round drew a long breath of relief
She had almost been afraid to look round lest she should find that her escape had been only a dream
And now the road she had chosenor rather the only road she could takethe road with Freddie Palmerseemed attractive even dazzling
What she could not like she would ignoreand how easily she after her experience could do that
What she could not ignore she would tolerate would compel herself to like
Poor ClaraHappy Clarabetter off in the dregs of the river than she had ever been in the dregs of New York
She shuddered
Then as so often the sense of the grotesque thrust in as out of place as jester in cap and bells at a bierand she smiled sardonically
Why thought she in being squeamish about Freddie Im showing that Im more respectable than the respectable women
Theres hardly one of them that doesnt swallow worse doses with less excuse or no excuse at alland without so much as a wry face
XX IN the ten days on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Mr and Mrs Palmer as the passenger list declared them planned the early stages of their campaign
They must keep to themselves must make no acquaintances no social entanglements of any kind until they had effected the exterior transformation which was to be the first strideand a very long one they felttoward the conquest of the world that commands all the other worlds
Several men aboard knew Palmer slightlyknew him vaguely as a big politician and contractor
They had a hazy notion that he was reputed to have been a thug and a grafter
But New Yorkers have few prejudices except against guilelessness and failure
They are well aware that the wisest of the wise Hebrew race was never more sagacious than when he observed that he who hasteth to be rich shall not be innocent
They are too well used to unsavory pasts to bother much about that kind of odor and where in the civilized worldor in that which is not civilizedis there an odor from reputationor characterwhose edge is not taken off by the strong sweet hypnotic perfume of money
Also Palmers appearance gave the lie direct to any scandal about him
It could not beit simply could not bethat a man of such splendid physical build a man with a countenance so handsome had ever been a low wicked fellow
Does not the devil always at once exhibit his hoofs horns tail and malevolent smile that all men may know who and what he is
A frank manly young leader of menthat was the writing on his countenance
And his Italian blood put into his good looks an ancient and aristocratic delicacy that made it incredible that he was of low origin
He spoke good English he dressed quietly he did not eat with his knife he did not retire behind a napkin to pick his teeth but attended to them openly if necessity compelledand splendid teeth they were set in a wide clean mouth notably attractive for a mans
No Freddie Palmers past would not give him any trouble whatever in a few years it would be forgotten would be romanced about as the heroic struggles of a typical American rising from poverty
Thank God said Freddie I had sense enough not to get a jail smell on me
Susan colored painfullyand Palmer the sensitive colored also
But he had the tact that does not try to repair a blunder by making a worse one he pretended not to see Susans crimson flush
Her past would not be an easy matterif it should ever rise to face her publicly
Therefore it must not rise till Freddie and she were within the walls of the world they purposed to enter by stealth and had got themselves well intrenched
Then she would be Susan Lenox of Sutherland Indiana who had come to New York to study for the stage and after many trials from all of which she had emerged with unspotted virtue whatever vicious calumny might in envy say had captured the heart and the name of the handsome rich young contractor
There would be nasty rumors dreadful stories perhaps
But in these loose and cynical days with the women more and more audacious and independent with the universal craving for luxury beyond the reach of laboriously earned incomes with marriage decaying in city life among the better classesin these easygoing days who was not suspected hinted about attacked
And the very atrociousness of the stories would prevent their being believed
One glance at Susan would be enough to make doubters laugh at their doubts
The familiar types of fast women of all degrees come from the poorest kinds of farms and from the tenements
In America practically not until the panics and collapses of recent years which have tumbled another and better section of the middle class into the abyss of the underworldnot until then did there appear in the city streets and houses of ill repute any considerable number of girls from good early surroundings
Before that time the clamor for luxurythe luxury that civilization makes as much a necessity as foodhad been satisfied more or less by the incomes of the middle class and any girl of that class with physical charm and shrewdness enough to gain a living as outcast woman was either supported at home or got a husband able to give her at least enough of what her tastes craved to keep her in the ranks of the reputable
Thus Susans beauty of refinement her speech and manner of the lady made absurd any suggestion that she could ever have been a fallen woman
The crimson splash of her rouged lips did not suggest the cocotte but the lady with a dash of gayety in her temperament
This because of the sweet sensitive seriousness of her small pallid face with its earnest violetgray eyes and its frame of abundant dark hair simply and gracefully arranged
She was of the advance guard of a type which the swift downfall of the middle class the increasing intelligence and restlessness and love of luxury among women and the decay of formal religion with its exactions of chastity as womans one diamondfine jewel are now making familiar in every city
The demand for the luxurious comfort which the educated regard as merely decent existence is far outstripping the demand for and the education of women in lucrative occupations other than prostitution
Luckily Susan had not been arrested under her own name there existed no court record which could be brought forward as proof by some nosing newspaper
Susan herself marveled that there was not more trace of her underworld experience in her face and in her mind
She could not account for it
Yet the matter was simple enough to one viewing it from the outside
It is what we think what we feel about ourselves that makes up our expression of body and soul
And never in her lowest hour had her soul struck its flag and surrendered to the idea that she was a fallen creature
She had a temperament that estimated her acts not as right and wrong but as necessity
Men all the rest of the world might regard her as nothing but sex symbol she regarded herself as an intelligence
And the filth slipped from her and could not soak in to change the texture of her being
She had no more the feeling or air of the cocotte than has the married woman who lives with her husband for a living
Her expression her way of looking at her fellow beings and of meeting their looks was that of the woman of the world who is for whatever reason above that slavery to opinion that fear of being thought bold or forward which causes women of the usual run to be sensitive about staring or being stared at
Sometimesin cocottes in stage women in fashionable womenthis expression is selfconscious or supercilious
It was not so with Susan for she had little selfconsciousness and no snobbishness at all
It merely gave the charm of worldly experience and expertness to a beauty which without it might have been too melancholy
Susan become by sheer compulsion philosopher about the vagaries of fat did not fret over possible future dangers
She dismissed them and put all her intelligence and energy to the business in handto learning and to helping Palmer learn the ways of that world which includes all worlds
Toward the end of the voyage she said to him About my salaryor allowanceor whatever it is Ive been thinking things over
Ive made up my mind to save some money
My only chance is that salary
Have you any objection to my saving itas much of it as I can
He laughed
Tuck away anything and everything you can lay your hands on said he
Im not one of those fools who try to hold women by being close and small with them
Id not want you about if you were of the sort that could be held that way
NoIll put by only from my salary said she
I admit Ive no right to do that
But Ive become sensible enough to realize that I mustnt ever risk being out again with no money
It has got on my mind so that Id not be able to think of much else for worryingunless I had at least a little
Do you want me to make you independent
No replied she
Whatever you gave me Id have to give back if we separated
That isnt the way to get on my dear said he
Its the best I can doas yet replied she
And its quite an advance on what I was
Yes I am learningslowly
Save all your salary then said Freddie
When you buy anything charge it and Ill attend to the bill
Her expression told him that he had never made a shrewder move in his life
He knew he had made himself secure against losing her for he knew what a force gratitude was in her character
Her mind was now freefree for the educational business in hand
She appreciated that he had less to learn than she
Civilization the science and art of living of extracting all possible good from the few swift years of life has beensince the downfall of woman from hardship ten or fifteen thousand years agothe creation of the man almost entirely
Until recently among the higher races such small development of the intelligence of woman as her seclusion and servitude permitted was sporadic and exotic
Nothing intelligent was expected of herand it is only under the compulsion of peremptory demand that any human being ever is roused from the natural sluggishness
But civilization created by man was created for woman
Woman has to learn how to be the civilized being which man has ordained that she shall behow to use for mans comfort and pleasure the ingenuities and the graces he has invented
It is easy for a man to pick up the habits tastes manners and dress of male citizens of the world if he has as keen eyes and as discriminating taste as had Palmer clever descendant of the supple Italian
But to become a female citizen of the world is not so easy
For Susan to learn to be an example of the highest civilization from her inmost thoughts to the outermost penumbra of her surroundingsthat would be for her a labor of love but still a labor
As her vanity was of the kind that centers on the advantages she actually had instead of being the more familiar kind that centers upon nonexistent charms of mind and person her task was possible of accomplishmentfor those who are sincerely willing to learn who sincerely know wherein they lack can learn can be taught
As she had given these matters of civilization intelligent thought she knew where to beginat the humble material foundation despised and neglected by those who talk most loudly about civilization art culture and so on
They aspire to the clouds and the stars at onceand arrive nowhere except in talk and pretense and flaunting of illfitting borrowed plumage
They flap their gaudy artificial wings there is motion but no ascent
Susan wished to buildand build solidly
She began with the socalled trifles
When they had been at Naples a week Palmer said Dont you think wed better push on to Paris
I cant go before Saturday replied she
Ive got several fittings yet
Its pretty dull here for mewith you spending so much time in the shops
I suppose the womens shops are goodhesitatinglybut Ive heard those in Paris are better
The shops here are rotten
Italian women have no taste in dress
And the Paris shops are the best in the world
Then lets clear out cried he
Im bored to death
But I didnt like to say anything you seemed so busy
I am busy
Andcan you stand it three days more
But youll only have to throw away the stuff you buy here
Why buy so much
Im not buying much
Two readytowear Paris dressesmodels they call themand two hats
Palmer looked alarmed
Why at that rate protested he itll take you all winter to get together your winter clothes and no time left to wear em
You dont understand said she
If you want to be treated right in a shopbe shown the best thingshave your orders attended to youve got to come looking as if you knew what the best is
Im getting ready to make a good first impression on the dressmakers and milliners in Paris
Oh youll have the money and thatll make em step round
Dont you believe it replied she
All the money in the world wont get you fashionable clothes
at the most fashionable place
Itll only get you costly clothes
Maybe thats so for womens things
It isnt for mens
Im not sure of that
When we get to Paris well see
But certainly its true for women
If I went to the places in the rue de la Paix dressed as I am now itd take several years to convince them that I knew what I wanted and wouldnt be satisfied with anything but the latest and best
So Im having these miserable dressmakers fit those dresses on me until theyre absolutely perfect
Its wearing me out but Ill be glad I did it
Palmer had profound respect for her as a woman who knew what she was about
So he settled himself patiently and passed the time investigating the famous Neapolitan political machine with the aid of an interpreter guide whom he hired by the day
He was enthusiastic over the dresses and the hats when Susan at last had them at the hotel and showed herself to him in them
They certainly did work an amazing change in her
They were the first real Paris models she had ever worn
Maybe its because I never thought much about womens clothes before said Freddie but those things seem to be the best ever
How they do show up your complexion and your figure
And I hadnt any idea your hair was as grand as all that
Im a little afraid of you
Weve got to get acquainted all over again
These clothes of mine look pretty poor dont they
Yet I paid all kinds of money for em at the best place in Fifth Avenue
He examined her from all points of view going round and round her getting her to walk up and down to give him the full effect of her slender yet voluptuous figure in that beautifully fitted coat and skirt
He felt that his dreams were beginning to come true
Well do the trick
cried he
Dont you think about money when youre buying clothes
Its a joy to give up for clothes for you
You make em look like something
Wait till Ive shopped a few weeks in Paris said Susan
Lets start tonight cried he
Ill telegraph to the Ritz for rooms
When she began to dress in her old clothes for the journey he protested
Throw all these things away he urged
Wear one of the new dresses and hats
But theyre not exactly suitable for traveling
Peoplell think you lost your baggage
I dont want ever to see you again looking any way except as you ought to look
No I must take care of those clothes said she firmly
Itll be weeks before I can get anything in Paris and I must keep up a good front
He continued to argue with her until it occurred to him that as his own clothes were not what they should be he and she would look much better matched if she dressed as she wished
He had not been so much in jest as he thought when he said to her that they would have to get acquainted all over again
Those new clothes of hers brought out startlinglyso clearly that even his vanity was made uneasythe subtle yet profound difference of class between them
He had always felt this difference and in the old days it had given him many a savage impulse to degrade her to put her beneath him as a punishment for his feeling that she was above him
Now he had his ambition too close at heart to wish to rob her of her chief distinction he was disturbed about it though and looked forward to Paris with uneasiness
You must help me get my things said he
Id be glad to said she
And you must be frank with me and tell me where I fall short of the best of the women we see
He laughed
The idea that he could help her seemed fantastic
He could not understand ithow this girl who had been brought up in a jay town away out West who had never had what might be called a real chance to get in the know in New York could so quickly pass him who had been born and bred in New York had spent the last ten years in cultivating style and all the other luxurious tastes
He did not like to linger on this puzzle the more he worked at it the farther away from him Susan seemed to get
Yet the puzzle would not let him drop it
They came in at the Gare de Lyon in the middle of a beautiful October afternoon
Usually from late September or earlier until May or later Paris has about the vilest climate that curses a civilized city
It is one of the bitterest ironies of fate that a people so passionately fond of the sun of the outdoors should be doomed for twothirds of the year to live under leaden icily leaking skies with rarely a ray of real sunshine
And nothing so well illustrates the exuberant vitality the dauntless spirit of the French people as the way they have built in preparation for the enjoyment of every bit of the light and warmth of any chance ray of sunshine
That year it so fell that the winter rains did not close in until late and Paris reveled in a long autumn of almost New York perfection
Susan and Palmer drove to the Ritz through Paris the lovely the gay
This is the real thingisnt it
said he thrilled into speech by that spectacle so inspiring to all who have the joy of life in their veinsthe Place de lOpera late on a bright afternoon
Its the first thing Ive ever seen that was equal to what I had dreamed about it replied she
They had chosen the Ritz as their campaign headquarters because they had learned that it was the most fashionable hotel in Pariswhich meant in the world
There were hotels more grand the interpreterguide at Naples had said there were hotels more exclusive
There were even hotels more comfortable
But for fashion said he it is the summit
There you see the most beautiful ladies most beautifully dressed
There you see the elegant world at tea and at dinner
At first glance they were somewhat disappointed in the quiet unostentatious general rooms
The suite assigned themat a hundred and twenty francs a daywas comfortable was the most comfortable assemblage of rooms either had ever seen
But there was nothing imposing
This impression did not last long however
They had been misled by their American passion for looks
They soon discovered that the guide at Naples had told the literal truth
They went down for tea in the garden which was filled as the day was summer warm
Neither spoke as they sat under a striped awning umbrella she with tea untasted before her he with a glass of whiskey and soda he did not lift from the little table
Their eyes and their thoughts were too busy for speech one cannot talk when one is thinking
About them were people of the world of which neither had before had any but a distant glimpse
They heard English American French Italian
They saw men and women with that air which no one can define yet everyone knows on sightthe assurance without impertinence the politeness without formality the simplicity that is more complex than the most elaborate ornamentation of dress or speech or manner
Susan and Freddie lingered until the departure of the last couplea plainly dressed man whose clothes on inspection revealed marvels of fineness and harmonious color a quietly dressed woman whose costume from tip of plume to tip of suede slipper was a revelation of how fine a fine art the toilet can be made
Wellwere right in it for sure said Freddie dropping to a sofa in their suite and lighting a cigarette
Yes said Susan with a sigh
In itbut not of it
I almost lost my nerve as I sat there
And for the life of me I cant tell why
Those people know how replied Susan
Wellwhat theyve learned we can learn
Sure said he energetically
Its going to take a lot of practicea lot of time
But Im game
His expression its suggestion of helplessness and appeal was a clear confession of a feeling that she was his superior
Were both of us ignorant she hastened to say
But when we get our bearingsin a day or twowell be all right
Lets have dinner up here in the sittingroom
I havent got the nerve to face that gang again today Nonsense
laughed she
We mustnt give way to our feelingsnot for a minute
Therell be a lot of people as badly off as we are
I saw some this afternoonand from the way the waiters treated them I know they had money or something
Put on your evening suit and youll be all right
Im the one that hasnt anything to wear
But Ive got to go and study the styles
I must begin to learn what to wear and now to wear it
Weve come to the right place Freddie
Cheer up
He felt better when he was in evening clothes which made him handsome indeed bringing out all his refinement of feature and coloring
He was almost cheerful when Susan came into the sittingroom in the pale gray of her two new toilettes
It might be as she insisted that she was not dressed properly for fashionable dining but there would be no more delicate no more ladylike loveliness
He quite recovered his nerve when they faced the company that had terrified him in prospect
He saw many commonplace looking people not a few who were downright dowdy
And presently he had the satisfaction of realizing that not only Susan but he also was getting admiring attention
He no longer floundered panicstricken his feet touched bottom and he felt foolish about his sensations of a few minutes before
After all the world over dining in a restaurant is nothing but dining in a restaurant
The waiter and the head waiter spoke English were gracefully tactfully polite and as he ordered he found his selfconfidence returning with the surging rush of a turned tide on a low shore
The food was wonderful and the champagne English taste was the best he had ever drunk
Halfway through dinner both he and Susan were in the happiest frame of mind
The other people were drinking too were emerging from caste into humanness
Women gazed languorously and longingly at the handsome young American men sent stealthy or open smiles of adoration at Susan whenever Freddies eyes were safely averted
But Susan was more careful than a woman of the world to which she aspired would have been she ignored the glances and without difficulty assumed the air of wife
I dont believe well have any trouble getting acquainted with these people said Freddie
We dont want to yet replied she
Oh I feel well soon be ready for them said he
Yesthat said she
But that amounts to nothing
This isnt to be merely a matter of clothes and acquaintancesat least not with me
What then
inquired he
Ohwell see as we get our bearings
She could not have put into words the plans she was formingplans for educating and in every way developing him and herself
She was not sure at what she was aiming but only of the direction
She had no idea how far she could go herselfor how far he would consent to go
The wise course was just to work along from day to daykeeping the direction
All right
Ill do as you say
Youve got this game sized up better than I
Is there any other people that works as hard as do the Parisians
Other peoples work with their bodies but the Parisians all classes and masses too press both mind and body into service
Other peoples if they think at all think how to avoid work the Parisians think incessantly always how to provide themselves with more to do
Other peoples drink to stupefy themselves lest peradventure in a leisure moment they might be seized of a thought Parisians drink to stimulate themselves to try to think more rapidly to attract ideas that might not enter and engage a sober and therefore somewhat sluggish brain
Other peoples meet a new idea as if it were a mortal foe the Parisians as if it were a longlost friend
Other peoples are agitated chiefly each man or woman about themselves the Parisians are full of their work their surroundings bother little about themselves except as means to what they regard as the end and aim of lifeto make the world each moment as different as possible from what it was the moment before to transform the crass and sordid universe of things with the magic of ideas
Being intelligent they prefer good to evil but they have Gods own horror of that which is neither good nor evil and spew it out of their mouths
At the moment of the arrival of Susan and Palmer the world that labors at amusing itself was pausing in Paris on its way from the pleasures of sea and mountains to the pleasures of the Riviera and Egypt
And as the weather held fine day after day the streets the cafes the restaurants offered the young adventurers an incessant dazzling panorama of all they had come abroad to seek
A week passed before Susan permitted herself to enter any of the shops where she intended to buy dresses hats and the other and lesser paraphernalia of the woman of fashion
I mustnt go until Ive seen said she
Id yield to the temptation to buy and would regret it
And Freddie seeing her point restrained his impatience for making radical changes in himself and in her
The fourth day of their stay at Paris he realized that he would buy and would wish to buy none of the things that had tempted him the first and second days
Secure in the obscurity of the crowd of strangers he was losing his extreme nervousness about himself
That sort of emotion is most characteristic of Americans and gets them the reputation for profound snobbishness
In fact it is not snobbishness at all
In no country on earth is ignorance in such universal disrepute as in America
The American eager to learn eager to be abreast of the foremost is terrified into embarrassment and awe when he finds himself in surroundings where are things that he feels he ought to know aboutwhile a stupid fellow in such circumstances is calmly content with himself wholly unaware of his own deficiencies
Susan let full two weeks pass before she with much hesitation gave her first order toward the outfit on which Palmer insisted upon her spending not less than five thousand dollars
Palmer had been going to the shops with her
She warned him it would make prices higher if she appeared with a prosperous looking man but he wanted occupation and everything concerning her fascinated him now
His ignorance of the details of feminine dress was giving place rapidly to a knowledge which he thought profoundand it was profound for a man
She would not permit him to go with her to order however or to fittings
All she would tell him in advance about this first dress was that it was for evening wear and that its color was green
But not a greeny green said she
I understand
A green something like the tint in your skin at the nape of your neck
Perhaps admitted she
Yes
Well go to the opera the evening it comes home
Ill have my new evening outfit from Charvets by that time
It was about ten days after this conversation that she told him she had had a final fitting had ordered the dress sent home
He was instantly all excitement and rushed away to engage a good box for the opera
With her assistance he had got evening clothes that sent through his whole being a glow of selfconfidencefor he knew that in those clothes he looked what he was striving to be
They were to dine at seven
He dressed early and went into their sittingroom
He was afraid he would spoil his pleasure of complete surprise by catching a glimpse of the grande toilette before it was finished
At a quarter past seven Susan put her head into the sittingroomonly her head
At sight of his anxious face his tense manner she burst out laughing
It seemed and was grotesque that one so imperturbable of surface should be so upset
Can you stand the strain another quarter of an hour
said she
Dont hurry he urged
Take all the time you want
Do the thing up right
He rose and came toward her with one hand behind him
You said the dress was green didnt you
Yes
Wellheres something you may be able to fit in somewhere
And he brought the concealed hand into view and held a jewel box toward her
She reached a bare arm through the crack in the door and took it
The box the arm the head disappeared
Presently there was a low cry of delight that thrilled him
The face reappeared
OhFreddie
she exclaimed radiant
You must have spent a fortune on them
No
Twelve thousandthats all
It was a bargain
Go on dressing
Well talk about it afterward
And he gently pushed her head backgetting a kiss in the palm of his handand drew the door to
Ten minutes later the door opened part way again
Brace yourself she called laughingly
Im coming
A breathless pause and the door swung wide
He stared with eyes amazed and bewitched
There is no more describing the effects of a harmonious combination of exquisite dress and exquisite woman than there is reproducing in words the magic and the thrill of sunrise or sunset of moonlights fanciful amorous play or of starry sky
As the girl stood there her eyes starlike with excitement her lips crimson and sensuous against the clear oldivory pallor of her small face in its frame of glorious dark hair it seemed to him that her soul more beautiful counterpart of herself had come from its dwelling place within and was hovering about her body like an aureole
Round her lovely throat was the string of emeralds
Her shoulders were bare and also her bosom over nearly half its soft girlish swell
And draped in light and clinging grace about her slender sensuous form was the most wonderful garment he had ever seen
The great French designers of dresses and hats and materials have a genius for taking an ideaa pure poetical abstractionand materializing it making it visible and tangible without destroying its spirituality
This dress of Susans did not suggest matter any more than the bar of music suggests the rosined string that has given birth to it
She was carrying the train and a pair of long gloves in one hand
The skirt thus drawn back revealed her slim narrow foot a slender slipper of pale green satin a charming instep with a rosiness shimmering through the gossamer web of pale green silk the outline of a long slender leg whose perfection was guaranteed by the beauty of her bare arm
His expression changed slowly from bedazzlement to the nearest approach to the old slumbrous smiling wickedness she had seen since they started
And her sensitive instinct understood it was the menace of an insane jealousy sprung from fearfear of losing her
The look vanished and once again he was Freddie Palmer the delighted the generous and almost romantically considerate because everything was going as he wished
No wonder I went crazy about you he said
Then youre not disappointed
He came to her unclasped the emeralds stood off and viewed her again
Noyou mustnt wear them said he
Oh
she cried protesting
Theyre the best of all
Not tonight said he
They look cheap
They spoil the effect of your neck and shoulders
Another time when youre not quite so wonderful but not tonight
As she could not see herself as he saw her she pleaded for the jewels
She loved jewels and these were the first she had ever had except two modest little birthday rings she had left in Sutherland
But he led her to the long mirror and convinced her that he was right
When they descended to the diningroom they caused a stir
It does not take much to make fashionable people stare but it does take something to make a whole room full of them quiet so far toward silence that the discreet and refined handling of dishes in a restaurant like the Ritz sounds like a vulgar clatter
Susan and Palmer congratulated themselves that they had been at the hotel long enough to become acclimated and so could act as if they were unconscious of the sensation they were creating
When they finished dinner they found all the little tables in the long corridor between the restaurant and the entrance taken by people lingering over coffee to get another and closer view
And the men who looked at her sweet dreaming violetgray eyes said she was innocent those who looked at her crimson lips said she was gay those who saw both eyes and lips said she was innocentas yet
A few very dimsighted and very wise retained their reason sufficiently to say that nothing could be told about a woman from her looksespecially an American woman
She put on the magnificent cloak white silk ermine lined which he had seen at Paquins and had insisted on buying
And they were off for the opera in the aristocratic looking auto he was taking by the week
She had a second triumph at the operawas the center that drew all glasses the instant the lights went up for the intermission
There were a few minutes when her head was quite turned when it seemed to her that she had arrived very near to the highest goal of human ambitionsaid goal being the one achieved and so selfcomplacently occupied by these luxurious fashionable people who were paying her the tribute of interest and admiration
Were not these people at the top of the heap
Was she not among them of them by right of excellence in the things that made them distinguished them
Ambition drunk and heavy with luxury flies sluggishly and low
And her ambition wasfor the momentin danger of that fate
During the last intermission the door of their box opened
At once Palmer sprang up and advanced with beaming face and extended hand to welcome the caller
Hello Brent I am glad to see you
I want to introduce you to Mrs Palmerthat name pronounced with the unconscious pride of the possessor of the jewel
Brent bowed
Susan forced a smile
We Palmer hastened on are on a sort of postponed honeymoon
I didnt announce the marriagedidnt want to have my friends out of pocket for presents
Besides theyd have sent us stuff fit only to furnish out a saloon or a hoteland wed have had to use it or hurt their feelings
My wifes a Western girlfrom Indiana
She came on to study for the stage
Buthe laughed delightedlyI persuaded her to change her mind
You are from the West
said Brent in the formal tone one uses in addressing a new acquaintance
So am I
But thats more years ago than you could count
I live in New Yorkwhen I dont live here or in the Riviera
The moment had passed when Susan could without creating an impossible scene admit and compel Brent to admit that they knew each other
What did it matter
Was it not best to ignore the past
Probably Brent had done this deliberately assuming that she was beginning a new life with a clean slate
Been here long
said Brent to Palmer
As he and Palmer talked she contrasted the two men
Palmer was much the younger much the handsomer
Yet in the comparison Brent had the advantage
He looked as if he amounted to a great deal as if he had lived and had understood life as the other man could not
The physical difference between them was somewhat the difference between look of lion and look of tiger
Brent looked strong Palmer dangerous
She could not imagine either man failing of a purpose he had set his heart upon
She could not imagine Brent reaching for it in any but an open direct daring way
She knew that the descendant of the supple Italians the graduate of the street schools of stealth and fraud would not care to have anything unless he got it by skill at subtlety
She noted their dress
Brent was wearing his clothes in that elegantly careless way which it was one of Freddies dreamsone of the vain onesto attain
Brents voice was much more virile was almost harsh and in pronouncing some words made the nerves tingle with a sensation of mingled irritation and pleasure
Freddies voice was manly enough but soft and dangerous suggestive of hidden danger
She compared the two men as she knew them
She wondered how they would seem to a complete stranger
Palmer she thought would be able to attract almost any woman he might want it seemed to her that a woman Brent wanted would feel rather helpless before the onset he would make
It irritated her this untimely intrusion of Brent who had the curious quality of making all other men seem less in the comparison
Not that he assumed anything or forced comparisons on the contrary no man could have insisted less upon himself
Not that he compelled or caused the transfer of all interest to himself
Simply that with him there she felt less hopeful of Palmer less confident of his ability to become what he seemedand go beyond it
There are occasional men who have this same quality that Susan was just then feeling in Brentmen whom women never love yet who make it impossible for them to begin to love or to continue to love the other men within their range
She was not glad to see him
She did not conceal it
Yet she knew that he would lingerand that she would not oppose
She would have liked to say to him You lost belief in me and dropped me
I have begun to make a life for myself
Let me alone
Do not upset medo not force me to see what I must not see if I am to be happy
Go away and give me a chance
But we do not say these frank childlike things except in moments of closest intimacyand certainly there was no suggestion of intimacy no invitation to it but the reverse in the man facing her at the front of the box
Then you are to be in Paris some time
said Brent addressing her
I think so said Susan
Sure cried Palmer
This is the town the world revolves round
I felt like singing Home Sweet Home as we drove from the station
I like it better than any place on earth said Brent
Better even than New York
Ive never been quite able to forgive New York for some of the things it made me suffer before it gave me what I wanted
I too said Freddie
My wife cant understand that
She doesnt know the side of life we know
Im going to smoke a cigarette
Ill leave you here old man to entertain her
When he disappeared Susan looked out over the house with an expression of apparent abstraction
Brentshe was consciousstudied her with those seeing eyeshazel eyes with not a bit of the sentimentality and weakness of brown in them
You and Palmer know no one here
Not a soul
Ill be glad to introduce some of my acquaintances to youFrench people of the artistic set
They speak English
And youll soon be learning French
I intend to learn as soon as Ive finished my fall shopping
You are not coming back to America
Not for a long time
Then you will find my friends useful
She turned her eyes upon his
You are very kind said she
But Id ratherwed rathernot meet anyone just yet
His eyes met hers calmly
It was impossible to tell whether he understood or not
After a few seconds he glanced out over the house
That is a beautiful dress said he
You have real taste if youll permit me to say so
I was one of those who were struck dumb with admiration at the Ritz tonight
Its the first grand dress I ever possessed said she
You love dressesand jewelsand luxury
As a starving man loves food
Then you are happy
Perfectly sofor the first time in my life
It is a kind of ecstasyisnt it
I remember how it was with me
I had always been poorI worked my way through prep school and college
And I wanted all the luxuries
The more I had to endurethe worse food and clothing and lodgingsthe madder I became about them until I couldnt think of anything but getting the money to buy them
When I got it I gorged myself



Its a pity the starving man cant keep on loving foodkeep on being always starving and always having his hunger satisfied
Ah but he can
He smiled mysteriously
You think so now
Wait till you are gorged
She laughed
You dont know
I could never get enoughnever
His smile became even more mysterious
As he looked away his profile presented itself to her viewan outline of sheer strength of tragic sadnessthe profile of those who have dreamed and dared and suffered
But the smile saying no to her confident assertion still lingered
Never
she repeated
She must compel that smile to take away its disquieting negation its relentless prophecy of the end of her happiness
She must convince him that he had come back in vain that he could not disturb her
You dont suggest to me the woman who can be content with just people and just things
You will always insist on luxury
But you will demand more
He looked at her again
And you will get it he added in a tone that sent a wave through her nerves
Her glance fell
Palmer came in bringing an odor of cologne and of fresh cigarette fumes
Brent rose
Palmer laid a detaining hand on his shoulder
Do stay on Brent and go to supper with us
I was about to ask you to supper with me
Have you been to the Abbaye
No
We havent got round to that yet
Is it lively
And the foods the best in Paris
Youll come
Brent was looking at Susan
Palmer not yet educated in the smallerand importantrefinements of politeness did not wait for her reply or think that she should be consulted
Certainly said he
On condition that you dine with us tomorrow night
Very well agreed Brent
And he excused himself to take leave of his friends
Just tell your chauffeur to go to the Abbayehell know he said as he bowed over Susans hand
Ill be waiting
I wish to be there ahead and make sure of a table
As the door of the box closed upon him Freddie burst out with that enthusiasm we feel for one who is in a position to render us good service and is showing a disposition to do so
Ive known him for years said he and hes the real thing
He used to spend a lot of time in a saloon I used to keep in Allen Street
Allen Street
ejaculated Susan shivering
I was twentytwo then
He used to want to study types as he called it
And I gathered in types for himthough really my place was for the swell crooks and their ladies
How long ago that seemsand how far away
Another life said Susan
Thats a fact
This is my second time on earth
Our second time
I tell you its fighting for a foothold that makes men and women the wretches they are
Nowadays I couldnt hurt a flycould you
But then you never were cruel
Thats why you stayed down so long
Susan smiled into the darkness of the auditoriumthe curtain was up and they were talking in undertones
She said as she smiled Ill never go down and stay down for that reason again
Her tone arrested his attention but he could make nothing of it or of her expression though her face was clear enough in the reflection from the footlights
Anyhow Brent and I are old pals continued he though we havent seen so much of each other since he made a hit with the plays
He always used to predict Id get to the top and be respectable
Now that its come true hell help me
Hell introduce us if we work it right
But we dont want that yet protested Susan
Youre ready and so am I declared Palmer in the tone she knew had the full strength of his will back of it
Faint angry hissing from the stalls silenced them but as soon as they were in the auto Susan resumed
I have told Mr Brent we dont want to meet his friends yet
Now what the hell did you do that for
demanded Freddie
It was the first time she had crossed him it was the first time he had been reminiscent of the Freddie she used to know
Because said she evenly I will not meet people under false pretenses
What rot
I will not do it replied she in the same quiet way
He assumed that she meant only one of the false pretensesthe one that seemed the least to her
He said Then well draw up and sign a marriage contract and date it a couple of years ago before the new marriage law was passed to save rich mens drunken sons from common law wives
I am already married said Susan
To a farmer out in Indiana
Freddie laughed
Well Ill be damned
You
You
He looked at her erminelined cloak and laughed again
An Indiana farmer
Then he suddenly sobered
Come to think of it said he thats the first thing you ever told me about your past
Or anybody else said Susan
Her body was quivering for we remember the past events with the sensations they made upon us at the time
She could smell that little room in the farmhouse
Allen Street and all the rest of her life in the underworld had for her something of the vagueness of dreamsnot only now but also while she was living that life
But not Ferguson not the night when her innocent soul was ravished as a wolf rips up and munches a bleating lamb
No vagueness of dreams about that but a reality to make her shudder and reel whenever she thought of ita reality vivider now that she was a woman grown in experiences and understanding
Hes probably deador divorced you long ago
I do not know
I can find outwithout stirring things up
What was his name
Ferguson
What was his first name
She tried to recall
I thinkit was Jim
Yes it was Jim
She fancied she could hear the voice of that ferocious sister snapping out that name in the miserable little coop of a general room in that hot foul farm cottage
Where did he live
His farm was at the edge of Zeke Warhams placenot far from Beecamp in Jefferson County
She lapsed into silence seemed to be watching the gay night streets of the Montmartre districtthe cafes the music halls the sidewalk shows the throngs of people every man and woman of them with his or her own individual variation upon the fascinating covertly terrible face of the Paris mob
What are you thinking about
he asked when a remark brought no answer
The past said she
And the future
Wellwell find out in a few days that your farmers got no claim on youand well attend to that marriage contract and everythingll be all right
Do you want to marry me
she asked turning on him suddenly
Were as good as married already replied he
Your tone sounds as if you didnt want to marry me
And he laughed at the absurdity of such an idea
I dont know whether I do or not said she slowly
He laid a gentle strong hand on her knee
Gentle though it was she felt its strength through the thickness of her cloak
When the time comes said he in the soft voice with the menace hidden in it youll know whether you do or dont
Youll know you doQueenie
The auto was at the curb before the Abbaye
And on the steps in furs and a top hat stood the tall experienced looking cynical looking playwright
Susans eyes met his he lifted his hat formal polite
Ill bet hes got the best table in the place said Palmer before opening the door and Ill bet it cost him a bunch
XXI BRENT had an apartment in the rue de Rivoli near the Hotel Meurice and high enough to command the whole Tuileries garden
From his balcony he could see to the east the ancient courts of the Louvre to the south the varied harmonious facades of the Quay dOrsay with the domes and spires of the Left Bank behind to the west the Obelisque the long broad reaches of the Champs Elysees with the Arc de Triomphe at the boundary of the horizon
On that balcony with the tides of traffic far below one had a sense of being at the heart of the world past present and to come
Brent liked to feel at home wherever he was it enabled him to go tranquilly to work within a few minutes after his arrival no matter how far he had journeyed or how long he had been away
So he regarded it as an economy an essential to good work to keep up the house in New York a villa in Petite Afrique with the Mediterranean washing its garden wall this apartment at Paris and a telegram a week in advance would reserve him the same quarters in the quietest part of hotels at Luzerne at St Moritz and at Biarritz
Susan admired as he explained his scheme of life to her and Palmer when they visited his apartment
Always profound tranquillity in the midst of intense activity
He could shut his door and he as in a desert he could open it and the most interesting of the sensations created by the actions and reactions of the whole human race were straightway beating upon his senses
As she listened she looked about her eyes taking in impressions to be studied at leisure
These quarters of his in Paris were fundamentally different from those in New York were the expression of a different side of his personality
It was plain that he loved them that they came nearer to expressing his realthat is his inmostself
Though I work harder in Paris than in New York he explained I have more leisure because it is all one kind of workwritingat which Im never interrupted
So I have time to make surroundings for myself
No one has time for surroundings in New York
She observed that of the scores of pictures on the walls tables shelves of the three rooms they were shown every one was a facefaces of all nationalities all ages all conditionsfaces happy and faces tragic faces homely faces beautiful faces irradiating the fascination of those abnormal developments of character good and bad which give the composite countenance of the human race its distinction as the characteristics themselves give it intensities of light and shade
She saw angels beautiful and ugly devils beautiful and ugly
When she began to notice this peculiarity of those rooms she was simply interested
What an amazing collection
How much time and thought it must have taken
How he must have searchedand what an instinct he had for finding the unusual the significant
As she sat there and then strolled about and then sat again her interest rose into a feverish excitement
It was as if the ghosts of all these personalities not one of them commonplace were moving through the rooms were pressing upon her
She understood why Brent had them therethat they were as necessary to him as cadavers and skeletons and physiological charts to an anatomist
But they oppressed suffocated her she went out on the balcony and watched the effects of the light from the setting sun upon and around the enormously magnified Arc
You dont like my rooms said Brent
They fascinate me replied she
But Id have to get used to these friends of yours
You made their acquaintance one or a few at a time
Its very upsetting being introduced to all at once
She felt Brents gaze upon herthat unfathomable look which made her uneasy yet was somehow satisfying too
He said after a while Palmer is to give me his photograph
Will you give me yours
He was smiling
Both of you belong in my gallery
Of course she will said Palmer coming out on the balcony and standing beside her
I want her to have some taken right awayin the evening dress she wore to the Opera last week
And she must have her portrait painted
When we are settled said Susan
Ive no time for anything now but shopping
They had come to inspect the apartment above Brents and had decided to take it Susan saw possibilities of making it over into the sort of environment of which she had dreamed
In novels the descriptions of interiors which weary most readers interested her more than story or characters
In her days of abject poverty she used these word paintings to construct for herself a room suites of rooms a whole house to replace when her physical eyes closed and her eyes of fancy opened wide the squalid and nauseous cell to which poverty condemned her
In the streets she would sometimes pause before a shop window display of interior furnishings a beautiful table or chair a design in wall or floor covering had caught her eyes had set her to dreamingdreaming on and onshe in dingy skirt and leaky shoes
Nowthe chance to realize her dreams had come
Palmer had got acquainted with some highclass sports American French and English at an American bar in the rue Volney
He was spending his afternoons and some of his evenings with themin the evenings winning large sums from them at cards at which he was now as lucky as at everything else
Palmer pleased by Brents manner toward Susanformal politeness indifference to sexwas glad to have him go about with her
Also Palmer was one of those men who not merely imagine they read human nature but actually can read it
He knew he could trust Susan
And it had been his habitas it is the habit of all successful mento trust human beings each one up to his capacity for resisting temptation to treachery
Brent doesnt care for womenas women said he
He never did
Dont you think hes queer
Hes different replied Susan
He doesnt care much for peopleto have them as intimates
I understand why
Love and friendship bore oneor fail oneand are unsatisfactoryand disturbing
But if one centers ones life about thingsbooks pictures art a careerwhy one is never bored or betrayed
He has solved the secret of happiness I think
Do you think a woman could fall in love with him
he asked with an air of the accidental and casual
If you mean could I fall in love with him said she I should say no
I think it would either amuse or annoy him to find that a woman cared about him
Amuse him most of all said Palmer
He knows the ladiesthat they love us men for what we can give them
Did you ever hear of anyone man or woman who cared about a person who couldnt give them anything
Freddies laugh was admission that he thought her right
The way to get on in politics observed he is to show men that its to their best interest to support you
And thats the way to get on in everything elseincluding love
Susan knew that this was the truth about life as it appeared to her also
But she could not divest herself of the human aversion to hearing the cold practical truth
She wanted sugar coating on the pill even though she knew the sugar made the medicine much less effective often neutralized it altogether
Thus Palmers brutally frank cynicism got upon her nerves whereas Brents equally frank cynicism attracted her because it was not brutal
Both men saw that life was a coarse practical joke
Palmer put the stress on the coarseness Brent upon the humor
Brent recommended and introduced to her a friend of his a young French Jew named Gourdain an architect on the way up to celebrity
You will like his ideas and he will like yours said Brent
She had acquiesced in his insistent friendship for Palmer and her but she had not lowered by an inch the barrier of her reserve toward him
His speech and actions at all times whether Palmer was there or not suggested that he respected the barrier regarded it as even higher and thicker than it was
Nevertheless she felt that he really regarded the barrier as nonexistent
She said But Ive never told you my ideas
I can guess what they are
Your surroundings will simply be an extension of your dress
She would not have let him seeshe would not have admitted to herselfhow profoundly the subtle compliment pleased her
Because a mans or a womans intimate personal taste is good it by no means follows that he or she will build or decorate or furnish a house well
In matters of taste the greater does not necessarily include the less nor does the less imply the greater
Perhaps Susan would have shown she did not deserve Brents compliment would have failed ignominiously in that first essay of hers had she not found a Gourdain sympathetic able to put into the concrete the rather vague ideas she had evolved in her dreaming
An architect is like a milliner or a dressmaker
He supplies the model product of his own individual taste
The person who employs him must remold that form into an expression of his own personalityfor people who deliberately live in surroundings that are not part of themselves are on the same low level with those who utter only borrowed ideas
That is the object and the aim of civilizationto encourage and to compel each individual to be frankly himselfherself
That is the profound meaning of freedom
The world owes more to bad morals and to bad taste that are spontaneous than to all the docile conformity to the standards of morals and of taste however good
Truthwhich simply means an increase of harmony a decrease of discord between the internal man and his environmenttruth is a product usually a byproduct of a ferment of action
Gourdainchiefly no doubt because Susans beauty of face and figure and dress fascinated himwas more eager to bring out her individuality than to show off his own talents
He took endless pains with her taught her the technical knowledge and vocabulary that would enable her to express herself then carried out her ideas religiously
You are right mon ami said he to Brent
She is an orchid and of a rare species
She has a glorious imagination like a bird of paradise balancing itself into an azure sky with every plume raining color and brilliancy
Somewhat exaggerated was Susans pleased laughing comment when Brent told her
Somewhat said Brent
But my friend Gourdain is stark mad about womens dressing well
That lilac dress you had on yesterday did for him
He was your servant he is your slave
Abruptlyfor no apparent cause as was often the caseSusan had that sickening sense of the unreality of her luxurious present of being about to awaken in Vine Street with Ettaor in the filthy bed with old Mrs Tucker
Absently she glanced down at her foot holding it out as if for inspection
She saw Brents look of amusement at her seeming vanity
I was looking to see if my shoes were leaky she explained
A subtle change came over his face
He understood instantly
Have you ever beencold
she asked looking at him strangely
One cold Februarycold and dampI had no underclothesand no overcoat
And dirty bedsfilthy roomsfilthy people
A tencent lodging house with a tramp for bedfellow
They were looking at each other with the perfect understanding and sympathy that can come only to two people of the same fiber who have braved the same storms
Each glanced hastily away
Her enthusiasm for doing the apartment was due full as much to the fact that it gave her definitely directed occupation as to its congeniality
That early training of hers from Aunt Fanny Warham had made it forever impossible for her in any circumstances to become the typical luxuriously sheltered woman whether legally or illegally keptthe lieabed woman the woman who dresses only to go out and show off the woman who wastes her life in petty piffling trifleswithout purpose without order or system without morals or personal selfrespect
She had never lost the systematic instinctthe instinct to use time instead of wasting itthat Fanny Warham had implanted in her during the years that determine character
Not for a moment even without distinctly definite aim was she in danger of the creeping paralysis that is epidemic among the rich enfeebling and slowing down mental and physical activity
She had a regular life she read she walked in the Bois she made the best of each day
And when this definite thing to accomplish offered she did not have to learn how to work before she could begin the work itself
All this was nothing new to Gourdain
He was born and bred in a country where intelligent discipline is the rule and the lack of it the rare exceptionamong all classeseven among the women of the welltodo classes
The finished apartment was a disappointment to Palmer
Its effects were too quiet too restrained
Within certain small limits those of the man of unusual intelligence but no marked originality he had excellent tasteor perhaps excellent ability to recognize good taste
But in the large he yearned for the grandiose
He loved the gaudy with which the rich surround themselves because good taste forbids them to talk of their wealth and such surroundings do the talking for them and do it more effectively
He would have preferred even a vulgar glitter to the unobtrusiveness of those rooms
But he knew that Susan was right and he was a very human arrant coward about admitting that he had bad taste
This is beautifulexquisite said he with feigned enthusiasm
Im afraid though itll be above their heads
What do you mean
inquired Susan
Palmer felt her restrained irritation hastened to explain
I mean the people wholl come here
They cant appreciate it
You have to look twice to appreciate thisand people the best of em look only once and a mighty blind look it is
But Susan was not deceived
You must tell me what changes you want said she
Her momentary irritation had vanished
Since Freddie was paying Freddie must have what suited him
Oh Ive got nothing to suggest
Now that Ive been studying it out I couldnt allow you to make any changes
It does grow on one doesnt it Brent
It will be the talk of Paris replied Brent
The playwrights tone settled the matter for Palmer
He was content
Said he Thank God she hasnt put in any of those dirty old tapestry ragsand the banged up broken furniture and the patched crockery
At the same time she had produced an effect of long tenancy
There was nothing that glittered nothing with the offensive sheen of the brand new
There was in that delicately toned atmosphere one suggestion which gave the same impression as the artificial crimson of her lips in contrast with the pallor of her skin and the sweet thoughtful melancholy of her eyes
This suggestion came from an allpervading odor of a heavy languorously sweet sensuous perfumethe same that Susan herself used
She had it made at a perfumers in the faubourg St Honore by mixing in a certain proportion several of the heaviest and most clinging of the familiar perfumes
You dont like my perfume
she said to Brent one day
He was in the library was inspecting her selections of books
Instead of answering her question he said How did you find out so much about books
How did you find time to read so many
One always finds time for what one likes
Not always said he
I had a hard stretch oncejust after I struck New York
I was a waiter for two months
Working people dont find time for readingand such things
That was one reason why I gave up work said she
Thatand the dirtand the poor wagesand the hopelessnessand a few other reasons said he
Why dont you like the perfume I use
Why do you say that
You made a queer face as you came into the drawingroom
Do you like it
What a queer question
she said
No other man would have asked it
The obvious said he shrugging his shoulders
I couldnt help knowing you didnt like it
Then why should I use it
His glance drifted slowly away from hers
He lit a cigarette with much attention to detail
Why should I use perfume I dont like
persisted she
Whats the use of going into that
said he
But I do like itin a way she went on after a pause
It isit seems to me the odor of myself
Yesit is he admitted
She laughed
Yet you made a wry face
I did
At the odor
At the odor
Do you think I ought to change to another perfume
You know I do not
Its the odor of your soul
It is different at different timessometimes inspiringly sweet as the incense of heaven as my metaphoric friend Gourdain would saysometimes as deadly sweet as the odors of the drugs men take to drag them to hellsometimes repulsively sweet making one heart sick for pure clean smellless air yet without the courage to seek it
Your perfume is many things but alwaysalways strong and tenacious and individual
A flush had overspread the pallor of her skin her long dark lashes hid her eyes
You have never been in love he went on
So you told me once before
It was the first time either had referred to their New York acquaintance
You did not believe me then
But you do now
For me there is no such thing as love replied she
I understand affectionI have felt it
I understand passion
It is a strong force in my lifeperhaps the strongest
No said he quiet but positive
Perhaps not replied she carelessly and went on with her more than manlike candor and in her manner of saying the most startling things in the calmest way I understand what is called lovefeebleness looking up to strength or strength pitying feebleness
I understand because Ive felt both those things
But lovetwo equal people united perfectly merged into a third person who is neither yet is boththat I have not felt
Ive dreamed it
Ive imagined itin some moments of passion
Butshe laughed and shrugged her shoulders and waved the hand with the cigarette between its fingersI have not felt it and I shall not feel it
I remain I
She paused considered added And I prefer that
You are strong said he absent and reflective
Yes you are strong
I dont know replied she
Sometimes I think so
Again She shook her head doubtfully
You would be dead if you were not
As strong in soul as in body
Probably admitted she
Anyhow I am sure I shall always bealone
I shall visitI shall linger on my threshold and talk
Perhaps I shall wander in perfumed gardens and dream of comradeship
But I shall return chez moi
He rosesighedlaughedat her and at himself
Dont delay too long said he
Delay
Your career
My career
Why I am in the full swing of it
Im at work in the only profession Im fit for
The profession of woman
Yesthe profession of female
He wincedand at this sign if she did not ask herself what pleased her she did not ask herself why
He said sharply I dont like that
But you have only to hear it
Think of poor me who have to live it
Have to
No said he
Surely youre not suggesting that I drop back into the laboring classes
No thank you
If you knew youd not say anything so stupid
I do know and I was not suggesting that
Under this capitalistic system the whole working class is degraded
They call what they do work but that word ought to be reserved for what a man does when he exercises mind and body usefully
What the working class is condemned to by capitalism is not work but toil
The toil of a slave said Susan
Its shallow twaddle or sheer want to talk about the dignity and beauty of labor under this system he went on
It is ugly and degrading
The fools or hypocrites who talk that way ought to be forced to join the gangs of slaves at their tasks in factory and mine and shop in the fields and the streets
And even the easier and better paid tasks even what the capitalists themselves dothose things arent dignified and beautiful
Capitalism divides all men except those of one classthe class to which I luckily belongdivides all other men into three unlovely classesslave owners slave drivers and slaves
But youre not interested in those questions
In wage slavery
No
I wish to forget about it
Any alternative to being a wage slave or a slave driveror a slave owner
Any alternative
You dont appreciate your own good fortune said he
Most human beingsall but a very fewhave to be in the slave classes in one way or another
They have to submit to the repulsive drudgery with no advancement except to slave driver
As for womenif they have to work what can they do but sell themselves into slavery to the machines to the capitalists
But youyou neednt do that
Nature endowed you with talentunusual talent I believe
How lucky you are
How superior to the great mass of your fellow beings who must slave or starve because they have no talent
TalentI
said Susan
For what pray
For the stage
She looked amused
You evidently dont think me vainor youd not venture that jest
For the stage he repeated
Thanks said she drily but Ill not appeal from your verdict
My verdict
What do you mean
I prefer to talk of something else said she coldly offended by his unaccountable disregard of her feelings
This is bewildering said he
And his manner certainly fitted the words
That I should have understood
Perhaps I shouldntat least not so quicklyif I hadnt heard how often you have been disappointed and how hard it has been for you to get rid of some of those you tried and found wanting
Believe meI was not disappointed in you
He spoke earnestly apparently with sincerity
The contrary
Your throwing it all up was one of the shocks of my life
She laughed mockinglyto hide her sensitiveness
One of the shocks of my life he repeated
She was looking at him curiouslywondering why he was thus uncandid
It puzzled me he went on
Ive been lingering on here trying to solve the puzzle
And the more Ive seen of you the less I understand
Why did you do it
How could you do it
He was walking up and down the room in a characteristic pose hands clasped behind his back as if to keep them quiet body erect head powerfully thrust forward
He halted abruptly and wheeled to face her
Do you mean to tell me you didnt get tired of work and drop it for he waved his arm to indicate her luxurious surroundingsfor this
No sign of her agitation showed at the surface
But she felt she was not concealing herself from him
He resumed his march presently to halt and wheel again upon her
But before he could speak she stopped him
I dont wish to hear any more said she the strange look in her eyes
It was all she could do to hide the wild burst of emotion that had followed her discovery
Then she had not been without a chance for a real career
She might have been free might have belonged to herself It is not too late cried he
Thats why Im here
It is too late she said
It is not too late repeated he harshly in his way that swept aside opposition
I shall get you back
Triumphantly The puzzle is solved
She faced him with a look of defiant negation
That ocean I crossedits as narrow as the East River into which I thought of throwing myself many a timeits as narrow as the East River beside the ocean between what I am and what I was
And Ill never go back
Never
She repeated the never quietly under her breath
His eyes looked as if they without missing an essential detail had swept the whole of that to which she would never go back
He said Go back
No indeed
Whos asking you to go back
Not I Im not asking you to go anywhere
Im simply saying that you willmustgo forward
If you were in love perhaps not
But you arent in love
I know from experience how men and women care for each otherhow they form these relationships
They find each other convenient and comfortable
But they care only for themselves
Especially young people
One must live quite a while to discover that thinking about oneself is living in a stuffy little cage with only a little light through slats in the top that give no view



Its an unnatural life for you
It cant last
Youcentering upon yourselfupon comfort and convenience
Absurd
I have chosen said she
Noyou cant do it he went on as if she had not spoken
You cant spend your life at dresses and millinery at chattering about art at thinking about eating and drinkingat being passively amusedat attending to your hair and skin and figure
You may think so but in reality you are getting ready for me 


for your career
You are simply educating yourself
I shall have you back
She held the cigarette to her lips inhaled the smoke deeply exhaled it slowly
I will tell you why he went on as if he were answering a protest
Every one of us has an individuality of some sort
And in spite of everything and anything except death or hopeless disease that individuality will insist upon expressing itself
Mine is expressing itself said she with a light smilethe smile of a light woman
You cant rest in this present life of yours
Your individuality is too strong
It will have its wayand for all your mocking smiling you know I am right
I understand how you were tempted into it She opened her lipschanged her mind and stopped her lips with her cigarette
I dont blame youand it was just as well
This life has taught youwill teach youwill advance you in your career



Tell me what gave you the idea that I was disappointed
She tossed her cigarette into the big ash tray
As I told you it is too late
She rose and looked at him with a strange sweet smile
Ive got any quantity of faults said she
But theres one I havent got
I dont whine
You dont whine assented he and you dont lieand you dont shirk
Men and women have been canonized for less
I understand that for some reason you cant talk about Then why do you continue to press me
said she a little coldly
He accepted the rebuke with a bow
Nevertheless said he with raillery to carry off his persistence I shall get you
If not sooner then when the specter of an obscureperhaps poorold age begins to agitate the rich hangings of youths banquet hall
Thatll be a good many years yet mocked she
And from her lovely young face flashed the radiant defiance of her perfect youth and health
Years that pass quickly retorted he unmoved
She was still radiant still smiling but once more she was seeing the hideous old women of the tenements
Into her nostrils stole the stench of the foul den in which she had slept with Mrs Tucker and Mrs Reardonand she was hearing the hunchback of the dive playing for the drunken dancing old cronies with their tin cups of whiskey
No danger of that now
How little she was saving of her salary from Palmer
She could not work menshe simply could not
She would never put by enough to be independent and every day her tastes for luxury had firmer hold upon her
No danger
As much danger as evera danger postponed but certain to threaten some dayand then a fall from a greater heighta certain fall
She was hearing the battered shattered piano of the dive
For pitys sake Mrs
Palmer
cried Brent in a low voice
She started
The beautiful room the environment of luxury and taste and comfort came back
Gourdain interrupted and then Palmer
The four went to the Cafe Anglais for dinner
Brent announced that he was going to the Riviera soon to join a party of friends
I wish you would visit me later said he with a glance that included them all and rested as courtesy required upon Susan
Theres room in my villabarely room
Weve not really settled here said Susan
And weve taken up French seriously
The weathers frightful said Palmer with a meaning glance at her
I think we ought to go
But her expression showed that she had no intention of going no sympathy with Palmers desire to use this excellent easy ladder of Brents offering to make the ascent into secure respectability
Next winter then said Brent who was observing her
Orin the early spring perhaps
Oh we may change our minds and come Palmer suggested eagerly
Im going to try to persuade my wife
Come if you can said Brent cordially
Ill have no one stopping with me
When they were alone Palmer sent his valet away and fussed about impatiently until Susans maid had unhooked her dress and had got her ready for bed
As the maid began the long process of giving her hair a thorough brushing he said Please let her go Susan
I want to tell you something
She does not know a word of English
But these French are so clever that they understand perfectly with their eyes
Susan sent the maid to bed and sat in a dressing gown brushing her hair
It was long enough to reach to the middle of her back and to cover her bosom
It was very thick and wavy
Now that the scarlet was washed from her lips for the night her eyes shone soft and clear with no relief for their almost tragic melancholy
He was looking at her in profile
Her expression was stern as well as sadthe soul of a woman who has suffered and has been made strong if not hard
I got a letter from my lawyers today he began
It was about that marriage
Ill read
At the word marriage she halted the regular stroke of the brush
Her eyes gazed into the mirror of the dressing table through her reflection deep into her life deep into the vistas of memory
As he unfolded the letter she leaned back in the low chair let her hands drop to her lap
As the inclosed documents show he read we have learned and have legally verified that Jebnot JamesFerguson divorced his wife Susan Lenox about a year after their marriage on the ground of desertion and two years later he fell through the floor of an old bridge near Brooksburg and was killed
The old bridgeshe was feeling its loose flooring sag and shift under the cautious hoofs of the horse
She was seeing Rod Spenser on the horse behind him a girl hardly more than a childunder the starry sky exchanging confidencestalking of their futures
So you see you are free said Palmer
I went round to an American lawyers office this afternoon and borrowed an old legal form book
And Ive copied out this form She was hardly conscious of his laying papers on the table before her
Its valid as Ive fixed things
The lawyer gave me some paper
It has a watermark five years old
Ive dated back two yearsquite enough
So when weve signed the marriage never could be contestednot even by ourselves
He took the papers from the table laid them in her lap
She started
What were you saying
she asked
Whats this
What were you thinking about
said he
I wasnt thinking she answered with her slow sweet smile of selfconcealment
I was feelinglivingthe past
I was watching the procession
He nodded understandingly
Thats a kind of timewasting that can easily be overdone
Easily she agreed
Still theres the lesson
I have to remind myself of it oftenalways when theres anything that has to be decided
Ive written out two of the forms said he
We sign both
You keep one I the other
Why not sign now
She read the formthe agreement to take each other as lawful husband and wife and to regard the contract as in all respects binding and legal
Do you understand it
laughed he nervously for her manner was disquieting
Perfectly
You stared at the paper as if it were a puzzle
It is said she
Come into the library and well sign and have it over with
She laid the papers on the dressing table took up her brush drew it slowly over her hair several times
Wake up cried he good humoredly
Come on into the library
And he went to the threshold
She continued brushing her hair
I cant sign said she
There was the complete absence of emotion that caused her to be misunderstood always by those who did not know her peculiarities
No one could have suspected the vision of the old women of the dive before her eyes the sound of the hunchbacks piano in her ears the smell of foul liquors and foul bodies and foul breaths in her nostrils
Yet she repeated NoI cant sign
He returned to his chair seated himself a slight cloud on his brow a wicked smile on his lips
Now what the devil
said he gently a jeer in his quiet voice
Whats all this about
I cant marry you said she
I wish to live on as we are
But if we do that we cant get up where we want to go
I dont wish to know anyone but interesting men of the sort that does thingsand women of my own sort
Those people have no interest in conventionalities
Thats not the crowd we set out to conquer said he
You seem to have forgotten
Its you who have forgotten replied she
YesyesI know he hastened to say
I wasnt accusing you of breaking your agreement
Youve lived up to itand more
But Susan the people you care about dont especially interest me
Brentyes
Hes a man of the world as well as one of the artistic chaps
But the otherstheyre beyond me
I admit its all fine and Im glad you go in for it
But the only crowd thats congenial to me is the crowd that weve got to be married to get in with
She saw his pointsaw it more clearly than did he
To him the world of fashion and luxurious amusement seemed the only world worth while
He accepted the scheme of things as he found it had the conventional ambitionsto make in succession the familiar goals of the conventional human successpower wealth social position
It was impossible for him to get any other idea of a successful life of ambitions worthy a mans labor
It was evidence of the excellence of his mind that he was able to tolerate the idea of the possibility of there being another mode of success worth while
Im helping you in your ambitionsin doing what you think is worth while said he
Dont you think you owe it to me to help me in mine
He saw the slight change of expression that told him how deeply he had touched her
If I dont go in for the high society game he went on Ill have nothing to do
Ill be adriftgambling drinking yawning about and going to pieces
A mans got to have something to work forand he cant work unless it seems to him worth doing
She was staring into the mirror her elbows on the table her chin upon her interlaced fingers
It would be difficult to say how much of his gentleness to her was due to her physical charm for him and how much to his respect for her mind and her character
He himself would have said that his weakness was altogether the result of the spell her physical charm cast over him
But it is probable that the other element was the stronger
Youll not be selfish Susan
urged he
Youll give me a square deal
YesI see that it does look selfish said she
A little while ago Id not have been able to see any deeper than the looks of it
Freddie there are some things no one has a right to ask of another and no one has a right to grant
The ugliness of his character was becoming less easy to control
This girl whom he had picked up practically out of the gutter and had heaped generosities upon was trying his patience too far
But he said rather amiably Certainly Im not asking any such thing of you in asking you to become a respectable married woman the wife of a rich man
Yesyou are Freddie replied she gently
If I married you Id be signing an agreement to lead your life to give up my ownan agreement to become a sort of woman Ive no desire to be and no interest in being to give up trying to become the only sort of woman I think is worth while
When we were discussing my coming with you you made this same proposal in another form
I refused it then
And I refuse it now
Its harder to refuse now but Im stronger
Stronger thanks to the money youve got from methe money and the rest of it sneered he
Havent I earned all Ive got
said she so calmly that he did not realize how the charge of ingratitude unjust though it was had struck into her
You have changed
said he
Youre getting as hard as the rest of us
So its all a matter of money of give and takeis it
None of the generosity and sentiment you used to be full of
Youve simply been using me
It can be put that way replied she
And no doubt you honestly see it that way
But Ive got to see my own interest and my own right Freddie
Ive learned at last that I mustnt trust to anyone else to look after them for me
Are you riding for a fallQueenie
At Queenie she smiled faintly
Im riding the way I always have answered she
It has carried me down
Butit has brought me up again
She looked at him with eyes that appealed without yielding
And Ill ride that way to the endup or down said she
I cant help it
Then you want to break with me
he askedand he began to look dangerous
No replied she
I want to go on as we are



Ill not be interfering in your social ambitions in any way
Over here itll help you to have a mistress who she saw her image in the glass threw him an arch glancewho isnt altogether unattractive wont it
And if you found you could go higher by marrying some woman of the grand worldwhy youd be free to do it
He had a way of looking at her that gave herand himselfthe sense of a delirious embrace
He looked at her so now
He said You take advantage of my being crazy about youdamn you
Heaven knows laughed she I need every advantage I can find
He touched herthe lightest kind of touch
It carried the sense of embrace in his look still more giddily upward
Queenie
he said softly
She smiled at him through half closed eyes that with a gentle and shy frankness confessed the secret of his attraction for her
There was however more of strength than of passion in her face as a whole
Said she Were getting on wellas we are arent we
I can meet the most amusing and interesting peoplemy sort of people
You can go with the people and to the places you like and youll not be bound
If you should take a notion to marry some woman with a big positionyoud not have to regret being tied toQueenie
ButI want youI want you said he
Ive got to have you
As long as you like said she
But on terms I can acceptalways on terms I can accept
Never on any othersnever
I cant help it
I can yield everything but that
Where she was concerned he was the primitive man only
The higher his passion rose the stronger became his desire for absolute possession
When she spoke of termsof the limitations upon his possession of hershe transformed his passion into fury
He eyed her wickedly abruptly demanded When did you decide to make this kickup
I dont know
Simplywhen you asked me to sign I found I couldnt
You dont expect me to believe that
Its the truth
She resumed brushing her hair
Look at me
She turned her face toward him met his gaze
Have you fallen in love with that young Jew
Gourdain
No
Have you a crazy notion that your looksll get you a better husband
A big fortune or a title
I havent thought about a husband
Havent I told you I wish to be free
But that doesnt mean anything
It might said she absently
How
I dont know
If one is always freeone is ready forwhatever comes
Anyhow I must be freeno matter what it costs
I see youre bent on dropping back into the dirt I picked you out of
Even that she said
I must be free
Havent you any desire to be respectabledecent
I guess not confessed she
What is there in that direction for me
A woman doesnt stay young and goodlooking long
No
She smiled faintly
But does she get old and ugly any slower for being married
He rose and stood over her looked smiling danger down at her
She leaned back in her chair to meet his eyes without constraint
Youre trying to play me a trick said he
But youre not going to get away with the goods
Im astonished that you are so rotten ungrateful
Because Im not for sale
Queenie balking at selling herself he jeered
And whats the least you ever did sell for
A halfdollar I think
Notwo drinks of whiskey one cold night
But what I sold was no more myself thanthan the coat Id pawned and drunk up before I did it
The plain calm way in which she said this made it so terrible that he winced and turned away
We have seen hellhavent we
he muttered
He turned toward her with genuine passion of feeling
Susan he cried dont be a fool
Lets push our luck now that things are coming our way
We need each otherwe want to stay togetherdont we
I want to stay
Im happy
Thenlets put the record straight
Lets keep it straight replied she earnestly
Dont ask me to go where I dont belong
For I cant Freddiehonestly I cant
A pause
Then You will
said he not in blustering fury but in that cool and smiling malevolence which had made him the terror of his associates from his boyhood days among the petty thieves and pickpockets of Grand Street
He laid his hand gently on her shoulder
You hear me
I say you will
She looked straight at him
Not if you kill me she said
She rose to face him at his own height
Ive bought my freedom with my body and with my heart and with my soul
Its all Ive got
I shall keep it
He measured her strength with an expert eye
He knew that he was beaten
He laughed lightly and went into his dressingroom
XXII THEY met the next morning with no sign in the manner of either that there had been a drawn battle that there was an armed truce
She knew that he like herself was thinking of nothing else
But until he had devised some way of certainly conquering her he would wait and watch and pretend that he was satisfied with matters as they were
The longer she reflected the less uneasy she becameas to immediate danger
In Paris the methods of violence he might have been tempted to try in New York were out of the question
What remained
He must realize that threats to expose her would be futile also he must feel vulnerable himself to that kind of attacka feeling that would act as a restraint even though he might appreciate that she was the sort of person who could not in any circumstances resort to it
He had not upon her a single one of the holds a husband has upon a wife
True he could break with her
But she must appreciate how easy it would now be for her in this capital of the idle rich to find some other man glad to protect a woman so expert at gratifying mans vanity of being known as the proprietor of a beautiful and fashionable woman
She had discovered how in the aristocracy of European wealth an admired mistress was as much a necessary part of the grandeur of great nobles great financiers great manufacturers or merchants as wife as heir as palace as equipage as chef as train of secretaries and courtiers
She knew how deeply it would cut to find himself without his show piece that made him the envied of men and the desired of women
Also she knew that she had an even stronger hold upon himthat she appealed to him as no other woman ever had that she had become for him a tenacious habit
She was not afraid that he would break with her
But she could not feel secure in former days she had seen too far into the mazes of that Italian mind of his she knew too well how patient how relentless how unforgetting he was
She would have taken murder into account as more than a possibility but for his intense and intelligent selfishness he would not risk his life or his liberty he would not deprive himself of his keenest pleasure
He was resourceful but in the circumstances what resources were there for him to draw upon
When he began to press upon her more money than ever and to buy her costly jewelry she felt still further reassured
Evidently he had been unable to think out any practicable scheme evidently he was for the time taking the course of appeal to her generous instincts of making her more and more dependent upon his liberality
Wellwas he not right
Love might fail passion might wane conscience aiding selfinterest with its usual servility might overcome the instincts of gratitude
But what power could overcome the loyalty resting upon money interest
No power but that of a longer purse than his
As she was not in the mood to make pretenses about herself to herself she smiled at this cynical selfmeasuring
But I shant despise myself for being so material said she to herself until I find a genuine case of a woman respectable or otherwise who has known poverty and escaped from it and has then voluntarily given up wealth to go back to it
I should not stay on with him if he were distasteful to me
And thats more than most women can honestly say
Perhaps even I should not stay on if it were not for a silly weak feeling of obligationbut I cant be sure of that
She had seen too much of men and women preening upon noble disinterested motives when in fact their real motives were the most calculatingly selfish she preferred doing herself less than justice rather than more
She had fiftyfive thousand francs on deposit at Munroesall her very own
She had almost two hundred thousand francs worth of jewels which she would be justified in keepingat least she hoped she would think soshould there come a break with Freddie
Yet in spite of this substantial prosperityor was it because of this prosperityshe abruptly began again to be haunted by the old visions by warnings of the dangers that beset any human being who has not that paying trade or profession which makes him or her independentgives him or her the only unassailable independence
The end with Freddie might be far away
But end she saw there would be the day when he would somehow get her in his power and so would drive her to leave him
For she could not again become a slave
Extreme youth utter inexperience no knowledge of real freedomthese had enabled her to endure in former days
But she was wholly different now
She could not sink back
Steadily she was growing less and less able to take orders from anyone
This fullgrown passion for freedom this intolerance of the least restrainthow dangerous if she should find herself in a position where she would have to put up with the caprices of some man or drop down and down
What real secure support had she
None
Her building was without solid foundations
Her struggle with Freddie was a revelation and a warning
There were days when driving about in her luxurious car she could do nothing but search among the crowds in the streets for the lonely old women in rags picking and peering along the refuse of the cafesweazened warped figures swathed in rags creeping along mumbling to themselves lips folded in and in over toothless gums
One day Brent saw again the look she often could not keep from her face when that vision of the dance hall in the slums was horrifying her
He said impulsively What is it
Tell mewhat is it Susan
It was the first and the last time he ever called her by her only personal name
He flushed deeply
To cover his confusionand her ownshe said in her most frivolous way I was thinking that if I am ever rich I shall have more pairs of shoes and stockings and take care of more orphans than anyone else in the world
A purpose
At last a purpose
laughed he
Now you will go to work
Through Gourdain she got a French teacherand her first woman friend
The young widow he recommended a Madame Clelie Deliere was the most attractive woman she had ever known
She had all the best French characteristicsa good heart a lively mind was imaginative yet sensible had good taste in all things
Like most of the attractive French women she was not beautiful but had that which is of far greater importancecharm
She knew not a word of English and it was perhaps Susans chief incentive toward working hard at French that she could not really be friends with this fascinating person until she learned to speak her language
Palmerpartly by nature partly through early experience in the polyglot tenement district of New Yorkhad more aptitude for language than had Susan
But he had been lazy about acquiring French in a city where English is spoken almost universally
With the coming of young Madame Deliere to live in the apartment he became interested
It was not a month after her coming when you might have seen at one of the fashionable gay restaurants any evening a party of fourGourdain was the fourthtalking French almost volubly
Palmers accent was better than Susans
She could notand felt she never couldget the accent of the transAlleghany region out of her voiceand so long as that remained she would not speak good French
But dont let that trouble you said Clelie
Your voice is your greatest charm
It is so honest and so human
Of the Americans I have met I have liked only those with that same tone in their voices
But I havent that accent said Freddie with raillery
Madame Clelie laughed
Noand I do not like you retorted she
No one ever did
You do not wish to be liked
You wish to be feared
Her lively brown eyes sparkled and the big white teeth in her generous mouth glistened
You wish to be fearedand you are feared Monsieur Freddie
It takes a clever woman to know how to flatter with the truth said he
Everybody always has been afraid of meand isexcept of course my wife
He was always talking of my wife now
The subject so completely possessed his mind that he aired it unconsciously
When she was not around he boasted of my wifes skill in the art of dress of my wifes taste of my wifes shrewdness in getting her moneys worth
When she was there he was using the favorite phrase my wife thismy wife thatmy wife the otheruntil it so got on her nerves that she began to wait for it and to wince whenever it camenever a wait of many minutes
At first she thought he was doing this deliberately either to annoy her or in pursuance of some secret deep design
But she soon saw that he was not aware of his inability to keep off the subject or of his obsession for that phrase representing the thing he was intensely wishing and willingchiefly she thought because it is something he cannot have
She was amazed at his display of such a weakness
It gave her the chance to learn an important truth about human naturethat selfindulgence soon destroys the strongest natureand she was witness to how rapidly an inflexible will disintegrates if incessantly applied to an impossibility
When a strong arrogant man unbalanced by long and successful selfindulgence hurls himself at an obstruction either the obstruction yields or the man is destroyed
One morning early in February as she was descending from her auto in front of the apartment house she saw Brent in the doorway
Never had he looked so young or so well
His color was fine his face had become almost boyish upon his skin and in his eyes was that gloss of perfect health which until these latter days of scientific hygiene was rarely seen after twentyfive in a woman or after thirty in a man
She gathered in all to the smallest detailsuch as the color of his shirtwith a single quick glance
She knew that he had seen her before she saw himthat he had been observing her
Her happiest friendliest smile made her small face bewitching as she advanced with outstretched hand
When did you come
she asked
About an hour ago
From the Riviera
No indeed
From St Moritzand skating and skiing and tobogganing
I rather hoped I looked it
Doing those things in that airits being born again
I felt well till I saw you said she
Now I feel dingy and half sick
He laughed his glance sweeping her from hat to boots
Certainly his eyes could not have found a more entrancing sight
She was wearing a beautiful dress of golden brown cloth sable hat short coat and muff brown suede boots laced high upon her long slender calves
And when she had descended from the perfect little limousine made to order for her he had seen a ravishing flutter of lingerie of pale violet silk
The sharp air had brought no color to her cheeks to interfere with the abrupt and fascinating contrast of their pallor with the long crimson bow of her mouth
But her skin seemed transparent and had the clearness of health itself
Everything about her every least detail was of Parisian perfection
Probably there are not in the world said he so many as a dozen women so well put together as you are
No not half a dozen
Few women carry the art of dress to the point of genius
I see they had only frumps at St Moritz this season laughed she
But he would not be turned aside
Most of the well dressed women stop short with being simply frivolous in spending so much time at less than perfectionlike the army of poets who write pretty good verse or the swarm of singers who sing pretty well
Ive heard of you many times this winter
You are the talk of Paris
She laughed with frank delight
It was indeed a pleasure to discover that her pains had not been in vain
It is always the outsider who comes to the great city to show it its own resources he went on
I knew you were going to do this
Still happy
Oh yes
But he had taken her by surprise
A faint shadow flitted across her face
Not so happy I see
You see too much
Wont you lunch with us
Well have it in about half an hour
He accepted promptly and they went up together
His glance traveled round the drawingroom and she knew he had noted all the changes she had made on better acquaintance with her surroundings and wider knowledge of interior furnishing
She saw that he approved and it increased her good humor
Are you hurrying through Paris on your way to somewhere else
she asked
No I stop hereI thinkuntil I sail for America
And that will be soon
Perhaps not until July
I have no plans
Ive finished a play a woman suggested to me some time ago
And Im waiting
A gleam of understanding came into her eyes
There was controlled interest in her voice as she inquired When is it to be produced
When the woman who suggested it is ready to act in it
Do I by any chance know her
You used to know her
You will know her again
She shook her head slowly a pensive smile hovering about her eyes and lips
Nonot again
I have changed
We do not change said he
We move but we do not change
You are the same character you were when you came into the world
And what you were then that you will be when the curtain falls on the climax of your last act
Your circumstances will changeand your clothesand your face hair figurebut not you
Do you believe that
I know it
She nodded slowly the violetgray eyes pensive
Birds in the strong windthats what we are
Driven this way or thator quite beaten down
But the wind doesnt change sparrow to eagleor eagle to gulldoes it
She had removed her coat and was seated on an oval lounge gazing into the open fire
He was standing before it looking taller and stronger than ever in a gray lounging suit
A cigarette depended loosely from the corner of his mouth
He said abruptly How are you getting on with your acting
She glanced in surprise
Gourdain Brent explained
He had to talk to somebody about how wonderful you are
So he took to writing metwo huge letters a weekall about you
Im fond of him
And hes fond of Clelie
Shes my I know all he interrupted
The tie between them is their fondness for you
Tell me about the acting
OhClelie and I have been going to the theater every few daysto help me with French
She is mad about acting and theres nothing I like better
Also you simply have to have occupation
She nodded
I wasnt brought up to fit me for an idler
When I was a child I was taught to keep busynot at nothing but at something
Freddies a lot better at it than I
Naturally said Brent
You had a home with order and a systeman oldfashioned American home
Hewell he hadnt
Clelie and I go at our makebelieve acting quite seriously
We have toif were to fool ourselves that its an occupation
Why this anxiety to prove to me that youre not really serious
Susan laughed mockingly for answer and went on You should see us do the two wives in LEnigmeor mother and daughter in that diary scene in LAutre Danger
I must



When are you going to resume your career
She rose strolled toward an open door at one end of the salon closed itstrolled toward the door into the hall glanced out returned without having closed it
She then said Could I study here in Paris
Triumph gleamed in his eyes
Yes
Boudrina splendid teacherspeaks English
Heand Ican teach you
Tell me what Id have to do
We would coach you for a small part in some play thats to be produced here
In French
Ill have an American girl written into a farce
Enough to get you used to the stageto give you practice in what hell teach youthe trade side of the art
And then
And then we shall spend the summer learning your part in my play
Two or three weeks of company rehearsals in New York in September
In Octoberyour name out over the Long Acre Theater in letters of fire
Could that be done
Even if you had little talent less intelligence and no experience
Properly taught the trade part of every art is easy
Teachers make it hard partly because theyre dull chiefly because thered be small money for them if they taught quickly and only the essentials
No journeyman actings no harder to learn than bricklaying or carpentering
And in Americaeverywhere in the world but a few theaters in Paris and Viennathere is nothing seen but journeyman acting
The art is in its infancy as an art
It even has not yet been emancipated from the swaddling clothes of declamation
Yes you can do well by the autumn
And if you develop what I think you have in you you can leap with one bound into fame
In America or England mind youbecause there the acting is all poor to pretty good
You are sure it could be done
NoI dont mean that
I mean is there really a chanceany chancefor me to make my own living
A real living
I guarantee said Brent
She changed from seriousness to a mocking kind of gayetythat is to a seriousness so profound that she would not show it
And she said You see I simply must banish my old womenand that hunchback and his piano
They get on my nerves
He smiled humorously at her
But behind the smile his gazegrave sympatheticpierced into her soul seeking the meaning he knew she would never put into words
At the sound of voices in the hall she said Well talk of this again
At lunch that day she for the first time in many a week listened without irritation while Freddie poured forth his unending praise of my wife
As Brent knew them intimately Freddie felt free to expatiate upon all the details of domestic economy that chanced to be his theme with the exquisite lunch as a text
He told Brent how Susan had made a study of that branch of the art of living how she had explored the unrivaled Parisian markets and groceries and shops that dealt in specialties how she had developed their breakfasts dinners and lunches to works of art
It is impossible for anyone however stupid to stop long in Paris without beginning to idealize the material side of lifefor the French who build solidly first idealize food clothing and shelter before going on to take up the higher side of lifeas a sane man builds his foundation before his first story and so on putting the observation tower on last of all instead of making an ass of himself trying to hang his tower to the stars
Our idealization goes forward haltingly and hypocritically because we try to build from the stars down instead of from the ground up
The place to seek the ideal is in the homely the commonplace and the necessary
An ideal that does not spring deeprooted from the soil of practical life may be a topic for a sermon or a novel or for idle conversation among silly and pretentious people
But what use has it in a world that must live and must be taught to live
Freddie was unaware that he was describing a further development of Susana course she was taking in the university of experienceshe who had passed through its common school its high school its college
To him her clever housekeeping offered simply another instance of her cleverness in general
His discourse was in bad taste
But its bad taste was tolerable because he was interestingfood like sex being one of those universal subjects that command and hold the attention of all mankind
He rose to no mean height of eloquence in describing their dinner of the evening beforethe game soup that brought to him visions of a hunting excursion he had once made into the wilds of Canada the way the barbue was cooked and served the incredible duckand the salad
Clelie interrupted to describe that salad as like a breath of summer air from fields and limpid brooks
He declared that the cheesewhich Susan had found in a shop in the Marche St Honorewas more wonderful than the most wonderful petit Suisse
And the coffee
he exclaimed
But youll see in a few minutes
We have coffee here
Quelle histoire exclaimed Brent when Freddie had concluded
And he looked at Susan with the ironic quizzical gleam in his eyes
She colored
I am learning to live said she
Thats what were on earth forisnt it
To learn to liveand then to live replied he
She laughed
Ah that comes a little later
Not much later rejoined he or theres no time left for it
It was Freddie who after lunch urged Susan and Clelie to show Brent what you can do at acting
Yesby all means said Brent with enthusiasm
And they gavein one end of the salon which was well suited for itthe scene between mother and daughter over the stolen diary in LAutre Danger
Brent said little when they finished so little that Palmer was visibly annoyed
But Susan who was acquainted with his modes of expression felt a deep glow of satisfaction
She had no delusions about her attempts she understood perfectly that they were simply crude attempts
She knew she had done wellfor herand she knew he appreciated her improvement
That would have gone finewith costumes and sceneryeh
demanded Freddie of Brent
Yes said Brent absently
Yesthat isYes
Freddie was dissatisfied with this lack of enthusiasm
He went on insistently I think she ought to go on the stageshe and Madame Clelie too
Yes said Brent between inquiry and reflection
What do you think
I dont think she ought replied Brent
I think she must
He turned to Susan
Would you like it
Susan hesitated
Freddie saidrather lamely Of course she would
For my part I wish she would
Then I will said Susan quietly
Palmer looked astounded
He had not dreamed she would assent
He knew her tonesknew that the particular tone meant finality
Youre joking cried he with an uneasy laugh
Why you wouldnt stand the work for a week
Its hard workisnt it Brent
About the hardest said Brent
And shes got practically everything still to learn
Shall we try Clelie
said Susan
Young Madame Deliere was pale with eagerness
Ahbut that would be worth while
cried she
Then its settled said Susan
To Brent Well make the arrangements at oncetoday
Freddie was looking at her with a dazed expression
His glance presently drifted from her face to the fire to rest there thoughtfully as he smoked his cigar
He took no part in the conversation that followed
Presently he left the room without excusing himself
When Clelie seated herself at the piano to wander vaguely from one piece of music to another Brent joined Susan at the fire and said in English Palmer is furious
I saw said she
I am afraid
ForI know him
She looked calmly at him
But I am not
Then you do not know him
The strangest smile flitted across her face
After a pause Brent said Are you married to him
Again the calm steady look
Then That is none of your business
I thought you were not said Brent as if she had answered his question with a clear negative
He added You know Id not have asked if it had been none of my business
What do you mean
If you had been his wife I could not have gone on
Ive all the reverence for a home of the man who has never had one
Id not take part in a homebreaking
Butsince you are free I shall never be anything else but free
Its because I wish to make sure of my freedom that Im going into this
Palmer appeared in the doorway
That night the four and Gourdain dined together went to the theater and afterward to supper at the Cafe de Paris
Gourdain and young Madame Deliere formed an interesting unusually attractive exhibit of the parasitism that is as inevitable to the rich as fleas to a dog
Gourdain was a superior man Clelie a superior woman
There was nothing of the sycophant or even of the courtier about either
Yet they already had in their faces that subtle indication of the dependent that is found in all professional people who habitually work for and associate with the rich only
They had no sense of dependence they were not dependents for they gave more than value received
Yet so corrupting is the atmosphere about rich people that Gourdain who had other rich clients no less than Clelie who got her whole living from Palmer was at a glance in the flea class and not in the dog class
Brent looked for signs of the same thing in Susans face
The signs should have been there but they were not
Not yet thought he
And never will be now
Palmers abstraction and constraint were in sharp contrast to the gayety of the others
Susan drank almost nothing
Her spirits were soaring so high that she did not dare stimulate them with champagne
The Cafe de Paris is one of the places where the respectable go to watch les autres and to catch a real gayety by contagion of a gayety that is mechanical and altogether as unreal as playacting
There is something fantastic about the official temples of Venus the pleasuremakers are so serious under their masks and the pleasuregetters so quaintly dazzled and deluded
That is Venuss temples are like those of so many other religions in reverence among mendisbelief and solemn humbuggery at the altar belief that would rather die than be undeceived in the pews
Palmer scarcely took his eyes from Susans face
It amused and pleased her to see how uneasy this made Brentand how her own laughter and jests aggravated his uneasiness to the point where he was almost showing it
She glanced round that brilliant room filled with men and women each of them carrying underneath the placidity of stiff evening shirt or the scantiness of audacious evening gown the most fascinating emotions and secretslove and hate and jealousy cold and monstrous habits and desires ruin impending or stealthily advancing fortune giddying to a gorgeous climax disease and shame and fearyet only signs of love and laughter and lightness of heart visible
And she wondered whether at any other table there was gathered so curious an assemblage of pasts and presents and futures as at the one over which Freddie Palmer was presiding somberly



Then her thoughts took another turn
She fell to noting how each man was accompanied by a womana gorgeously dressed woman a woman revealing proclaiming in every line in every movement that she was thus elaborately and beautifully toiletted to please man to appeal to his senses to gain his gracious approval
It was the world in miniature it was an illustration of the position of womanof her own position
Favorite pet
Not the equal of man but an appetizer a dessert
She glanced at herself in the glass mocked her own radiant beauty of face and form and dress
Not really a full human being merely a decoration
No more and no worse off than most of the women everywhere the favorites licensed or unlicensed of law and religion
But just as badly off and just as insecure
Free
No rest no full breath until freedom had been won
At any cost by straight way or deviousfree
Lets go home said she abruptly
Ive had enough of this
She was in a dressing gown all ready for bed and reading when Palmer came into her sittingroom
She was smoking her gaze upon her book
Her thick dark hair was braided close to her small head
There was delicate lace on her nightgown showing above the wadded satin collar of the dressing gown
He dropped heavily into a chair
If anyone had told me a year ago that a skirt could make a damn fool of me said he bitterly Id have laughed in his face
Yethere I am
How nicely I did drop into your trap todayabout the acting
Trap
Oh I admit I built and baited and set it myselfass that I was
But it was your trapyours and Brents all the same



A skirtand not a clean one at that
She lowered the book to her lap took the cigarette from between her lips looked at him
Why not be reasonable Freddie
said she calmly
Language had long since lost its power to impress her
Why irritate yourself and annoy me simply because I wont let you tyrannize over me
You know you cant treat me as if I were your property
Im not your wife and I dont have to be your mistress
Getting ready to break with me eh
If I wished to go Id tell youand go
Youd give me the shake would youwithout the slightest regard for all Ive done for you
She refused to argue that again
I hope Ive outgrown doing weak gentle things through cowardice and pretending its through goodness of heart
Youve gotten hardlike stone
Like yousomewhat
And after a moment she added Anything thats strong is hardisnt it
Can a man or a woman get anywhere without being able to be what you call hard and what I call strong
Where do you want to get
demanded he
She disregarded his question to finish saying what was in her mindwhat she was saying rather to give herself a clear look at her own thoughts and purposes than to enlighten him about them
Im not a sheltered woman pursued she
Ive got no one to save me from the consequences of doing nice sweet womanly things
Youve got me said he angrily
But why lean if Im strong enough to stand alone
Why weaken myself just to gratify your mania for owning and bossing
But let me finish what I was saying
I never got any quarter because I was a woman
No woman does as a matter of fact and in the end the more she uses her sex to help her shirk the worse her punishment is
But in my case I was brought up to play the weak female to use my sex as my shield
And that was taken from me andI neednt tell you how I was taught to give and take like a manno not like a manfor no man ever has to endure what a woman goes through if she is thrown on the world
Still Im not whining
Now that its all over Im the better for what Ive been through
Ive learned to use all a mans weapons and in addition Ive got a womans
As long as your looks last sneered he
That will be longer than yours said she pleasantly if you keep on with the automobiles and the champagne
And when my looks are gone my womans weapons


Why Ill still have the mans weapons leftshant Iknowledge and the ability to use it
His expression of impotent fury mingled with compelled admiration and respect made his face about as unpleasant to look at as she had ever seen it
But she liked to look
His confession of her strength made her feel stronger
The sense of strength was a new sensation with hernew and delicious
Nor could the feeling that she was being somewhat cruel restrain her from enjoying it
I have never asked quarter she went on
I never shall
If fate gets me down as it has many a time why Ill he able to take my medicine without weeping or whining
Ive never asked pity
Ive never asked charity
Thats why Im here Freddiein this apartment instead of in a filthy tenement atticand in these clothes instead of in ragsand with you respecting me instead of kicking me toward the gutter
Isnt that so
He was silent
Isnt it so
she insisted
Yes he admitted
And his handsome eyes looked the love so near to hate that fills a strong man for a strong woman when they clash and he cannot conquer
No wonder Im a fool about you he muttered
I dont purpose that any man or woman shall use me she went on in exchange for merely a few flatteries
I insist that if they use me they must let me use them
I shant be mean about it but I shant be altogether a fool either
And what is a woman but a fool when she lets men use her for nothing but being called sweet and loving and womanly
Unless thats the best she can do poor thing
You neednt sneer at respectable women
I dont replied she
Ive no sneers for anybody
Ive discovered a great truth Freddie the deepdown equality of all human beingsall of them birds in the same wind and battling with it each as best he can
As for myselfwith money with a career that interests me with position thatll give me any acquaintances and friends that are congenial I dont care what is said of me
As her plan unfolded itself fully to his understanding which needed only a hint to enable it to grasp all he forgot his rage for a moment in his interest and admiration
Said he Youve used me
Now youre going to use Brenteh
Wellwhat will you give him in exchange
He wants someone to act certain parts in certain plays
Is that all he wants
He hasnt asked anything else
And if he did
Dont be absurd
You know Brent
Hes not in love with you assented Palmer
He doesnt want you that way
Theres some woman somewhere Ive heardand he doesnt care about anybody but her
He was speaking in a careless casual way watching her out of the corner of his eye
And she taken off guard betrayed in her features the secret that was a secret even from herself
He sprang up with a bound sprang at her caught her up out of her chair the fingers of one hand clasping her throat
I thought so
he hissed
You love himdamn you
You love him
Youd better look out both of you
There came a knock at the door between her bedroom and that of Madame Clelie
Palmer released her stood panting with furious eyes on the door from which the sound had come
Susan called Its all right Clelie for the present
Then she said to Palmer I told Clelie to knock if she ever heard voices in this roomor any sound she didnt understand
She reseated herself began to massage her throat where his fingers had clutched it
Its fortunate my skin doesnt mar easily she went on
What were you saying
I know the truth now
You love Brent
Thats the milk in the cocoanut
She reflected on this apparently with perfect tranquillity apparently with no memory of his furious threat against her and against Brent
She said Perhaps I was simply piqued because theres another woman
You are jealous
I guess I wasa little
You admit that you love him you He checked himself on the first hissing breath of the foul epithet
She said tranquilly Jealousy doesnt mean love
Were jealous in all sorts of waysand of all sorts of things
Wellhe cares nothing about you
Nothing
And never will
Hed despise a woman who had been Dont hesitate
Say it
Im used to hearing it Freddieand to being it
And not had been but is
I still am you know
Youre not
he cried
And never wereand never could befor some unknown reason God knows why
She shrugged her shoulders lit another cigarette
He went on You cant get it out of your head that because hes interested in you hes more or less stuck on you
Thats the way with women
The truth is he wants you merely to act in his plays
And I want that too
You think Im going to stand quietly by and let this thing go ondo you
She showed not the faintest sign of nervousness at this repetition more carefully veiled of his threat against herand against Brent
She chose the only hopeful course she went at him boldly and directly
Said she with amused carelessness Why not
He doesnt want me
Even if I love him Im not giving him anything you want
How do you know what I want
cried he confused by this unexpected way of meeting his attack
You think Im simply a brutewith no fine instincts or feelings She interrupted him with a laugh
Dont be absurd Freddie said she
You know perfectly well you and I dont call out the finer feelings in each other
If either of us wanted that sort of thing wed have to look elsewhere
You mean Brenteh
She laughed with convincing derision
What nonsense
She put her arms round his neck and her lips close to his
The violetgray eyes were half closed the perfume of the smooth amberwhite skin of the thick wavy dark hair was in his nostrils
And in a languorous murmur she soothed his subjection to a deep sleep with As long as you give me what I want from you and I give you what you want from me why should we wrangle
And with a smile he acquiesced
She felt that she had ended the frightful dangerto Brent rather than to herselfthat suddenly threatened from those wicked eyes of Palmers
But it might easily come again
She did not dare relax her efforts for in the succeeding days she saw that he was like one annoyed by a constant pricking from a pin hidden in the clothing and searched for in vain
He was no longer jealous of Brent
But while he didnt know what was troubling him he did know that he was uncomfortable
XXIII IN but one important respect was Brents original plan modified
Instead of getting her stage experience in France Susan joined a London company making one of those dreary weary cheap and trashy tours of the smaller cities of the provinces with half a dozen plays by Jones Pinero and Shaw
Clelie stayed in London toiling at the language determined to be ready to take the small part of French maid in Brents play in the fall
Brent and Palmer accompanied Susan and every day for several hours Brent and the stage managerhis real name was Thomas Boil and his professional name was Herbert Streatherncoached the patient but most unhappy Susan line by line word by word gesture by gesture in the little parts she was playing
Palmer traveled with them making a pretense of interest that ill concealed his boredom and irritation
This for three weeks then he began to make trips to London to amuse himself with the sports amateur and professional with whom he easily made friendssome of them men in a position to be useful to him socially later on
He had not spoken of those social ambitions of his since Susan refused to go that way with himbut she knew he had them in mind as strongly as ever
He was the sort of man who must have an objective and what other objective could there be for him who cared for and believed in the conventional ambitions and triumphs onlythe successes that made the respectable world gape and grovel and envy
Youll not stick at this long he said to Susan
Im frightfully depressed she admitted
Its tiresomeand hardand so hideously uncomfortable
And Ive lost all sense of art or profession
Acting seems to be nothing but a trade and a poor cheap one at that
He was not surprised but was much encouraged by this candid account of her state of mind
Said he Its my private opinion that only your obstinacy keeps you from giving it up straight off
Surely you must see its nonsense
Drop it and come alongand be comfortable and happy
Why be obstinate
Theres nothing in it
Perhaps it is obstinacy said she
I like to think its something else
Drop it
You want to
You know you do
I want to but I cant replied she
He recognized the tone the expression of the eyes the sudden showing of strength through the soft young contour
And he desisted
Never again could there be comfort much less happiness until she had tried out her reawakened ambition
She had given up all that had been occupying her since she left America with Freddie she had abandoned herself to a life of toil
Certainly nothing could have been more tedious more tormenting to sensitive nerves than the schooling through which Brent was putting her
Its childishness revolted her and angered her
Experience had long since lowered very considerably the point at which her naturally sweet disposition ceased to be sweeta process through which every goodtempered person must pass unless he or she is to be crushed and cast aside as a failure
There were days many of them when it took all her good sense all her fundamental faith in Brent to restrain her from an outbreak
Streathern regarded Brent as a crank and had to call into service all his humility as a poor Englishman toward a rich man to keep from showing his contempt
And Brent seemed to beindeed wastesting her forbearance to the uttermost
He offered not the slightest explanation of his method
He simply ordered her blindly to pursue the course he marked out
She was sorely tempted to ask to demand explanations
But there stood out a quality in Brent that made her resolve ooze away as soon as she faced him
Of one thing she was confident
Any lingering suspicions Freddie might have had of Brents interest in her as a woman or even of her being interested in him as a man must have been killed beyond resurrection
Freddie showed that he would have hated Brent would have burst out against him for the unhuman inhuman way he was treating her had it not been that Brent was so admirably serving his design to have her finally and forever disgusted and done with the stage
Finally there came a performance in which the audiencethe gallery part of itbooed hernot the play not the other players but her and no other
Brent came along apparently by accident as she made her exit
He halted before her and scanned her countenance with those allseeing eyes of his
Said he You heard them
Of course replied she
That was for you said he and he said it with an absence of sympathy that made it brutal
For only me said shefrivolously
You seem not to mind
Certainly I mind
Im not made of wood or stone
Dont you think youd better give it up
She looked at him with a steely light from the violet eyes a light that had never been there before
Give up
said she
Not even if you give me up
This thing has got to be put through
He simply nodded
All right he said
It will be
That booingit almost struck me dead
When it didnt I for the first time felt sure I was going to win
He nodded again gave her one of his quick expressive fleeting glances that somehow made her forget and forgive everything and feel fresh and eager to start in again
He said When the booing began and you didnt break down and run off the stage I knew that what I hoped and believed about you was true
Streathern joined them
His large soft eyes were full of sympathetic tears
He was so moved that he braved Brent
He said to Susan It wasnt your fault Miss Lenox
You were doing exactly as Mr Brent ordered when the booing broke out
Exactly said Brent
Streathern regarded him with a certain nervousness and veiled pity
Streathern had been brought into contact with many great men
He had found them each and every one with this same streak of wild folly this habit of doing things that were to him obviously useless and ridiculous
It was a profound mystery to him why such men succeeded while he himself who never did such things remained in obscurity
The only explanation was the abysmal stupidity ignorance and folly of the masses of mankind
What a harbor of refuge that reflection has ever been for mediocritys shattered and sinking vanity
Yet the one indisputable fact about the great geniuses of long ago is that in their own country and age the common people heard them gladly
Streathern could not now close his mouth upon one last appeal on behalf of the clever and lovely and so amiable victim of Brents mania
I say Mr Brent pleaded he dont you thinkReally now if youll permit a chap not without experience to say soDont you think that by drilling her so much and soso beastly minutelyyoure making her woodenmachinelike
I hope so said Brent in a tone that sent Streathern scurrying away to a place where he could express himself unseen and unheard
In her fifth week she began to improve
She felt at home on the stage she felt at home in her part whatever it happened to be
She was giving what could really be called a performance
Streathern when he was sure Brent could not hear congratulated her
Its wonderfully plucky of you my dear said he quite amazingly pluckyto get yourself together and go straight ahead in spite of what your American friend has been doing to you
In spite of it
cried Susan
Why dont you see that its because of what hes been doing
I felt it all the time
I see it now
Oh reallydo you think so
said Streathern
His tone made it a polite and extremely discreet way of telling her he thought she had become as mad as Brent
She did not try to explain to him why she was improving
In that week she advanced by long strides and Brent was radiant
Now well teach you scales said he
Well teach you the mechanics of expressing every variety of emotion
Then well be ready to study a strong part
She had known in the broad from the outset what Brent was trying to accomplishthat he was giving her the trade side of the art was giving it to her quickly and systematically
But she did not appreciate how profoundly right he was until she was learning scales
Then she understood why most so called professional performances are amateurish haphazard without any precision
She was learning to posture and to utter every emotion so accurately that any spectator would recognize it at once
And in time your voice and your body said Brent will become as much your servants as are Paderewskis ten fingers
He doesnt rely upon any such rot as inspiration
Nor does any master of any art
A mind can be inspired but not a body
It must be taught
You must first have a perfect instrument
Then if you are a genius your genius having a perfect instrument to work with will produce perfect results
To ignore or to neglect the mechanics of an art is to hamper or to kill inspiration
Geniusesa fewand they not the greatesthave been too lazy to train their instruments
But anyone who is merely talented dares not take the risk
And youwed better assumeare merely talented
Streathern who had a deserved reputation as a coach was disgusted with Brents degradation of an art
As openly as he dared he warned Susan against the danger of becoming a mere machinea puppet responding stiffly to the pulling of strings
But Susan had got over her momentary irritation against Brent her doubt of his judgment in her particular case
She ignored Streatherns advice that she should be natural that she should let her own temperament dictate variations on his cut and dried formulae for expression
She continued to do as she was bid
If you are not a natural born actress said Brent at least you will be a good oneso good that most critics will call you great
And if you are a natural born genius at acting you will soon put color in the cheeks of these dolls Im giving youand ease into their bodiesand nerves and muscles and blood in place of the strings
In the seventh week he abruptly took her out of the company and up to London to have each day an hour of singing an hour of dancing and an hour of fencing
Youll ruin her health protested Freddie
Youre making her work like a ditch digger
Brent replied If she hasnt the health shes got to abandon the career
If she has health this training will give it steadiness and solidity
If theres a weakness anywhere itll show itself and can be remedied
And he piled the work on her dictated her hours of sleep her hours for rest and for walking her dietand little he gave her to eat
When he had her thoroughly broken to his regimen he announced that business compelled his going immediately to America
I shall be back in a month said he
I think Ill run over with you said Palmer
Do you mind Susan
Clelie and I shall get on very well she replied
She would be glad to have both out of the way that she might give her whole mind to the only thing that now interested her
For the first time she was experiencing the highest joy that comes to mortals the only joy that endures and grows and defies all the calamities of circumstancesthe joy of work congenial and developing
Yescome along said Brent to Palmer
Here youll be tempting her to break the rules
He added Not that you would succeed
She understands what it all means nowand nothing could stop her
Thats why I feel free to leave her
Yes I understand said Susan
She was gazing away into space at sight of her expression Freddie turned hastily away
On a Saturday morning Susan and Clelie after waiting on the platform at Euston Station until the long crowded train for Liverpool and the Lusitania disappeared went back to the lodgings in Half Moon Street with a sudden sense of the vastness of London of its loneliness and dreariness of its awkward inhospitality to the stranger under its pall of foggy smoke
Susan was thinking of Brents last words She had said Ill try to deserve all the pains youve taken Mr
Brent
Yes I have done a lot for you he had replied
Ive put you beyond the reach of any of the calamities of lifebeyond the need of any of its consolations
Dont forget that if the steamer goes down with all on board
And then she had looked at himand as Freddies back was half turned she hoped he had not seenin fact she was sure he had not or she would not have dared
And Brenthad returned her look with his usual quizzical smile but she had learned how to see through that mask
Thenshe had submitted to Freddies energetic embracehad given her hand to BrentGoodby she had said and Good luck he
Beyond the reach of any of the calamities
Beyond the need of any of the consolations
Yesit was almost literally true
She felt the big interestthe careergrowing up within her and expanding and already overstepping all other interests and emotions
Brent had left her and Clelie more to do than could be done thus they had no time to bother either about the absent or about themselves
Looking back in after years on the days that Freddie was away Susan could recall that from time to time she would find her mind wandering as if groping in the darkness of its own cellars or closets for a lost thought a missing link in some chain of thought
This even awakened her several times in the nightmade her leap from sleep into acute and painful consciousness as if she had recalled and instantly forgotten some startling and terrible thing
And when Freddie unexpectedly camehaving taken passage on the Lusitania for the return voyage after only six nights and five days in New Yorkshe was astonished by her delight at seeing him and by the kind of delight it was
For it rather seemed a sort of relief as from a heavy burden of anxiety
Why didnt you wait and come with Brent
asked she
Couldnt stand it replied he
Ive grown clear away from New Yorkat least from the only New York I know
I dont like the boys any more
They bore me
Theyoffend me
And I know if I stayed on a few days theyd begin to suspect
No it isnt Europe
Itsyou
Youre responsible for the change in me
He was speaking entirely of the internal change which indeed was great
For while he was still fond of all kinds of sporting it was not in his former crude way he had even become something of a connoisseur of pictures and was cultivating a respect for the purity of the English language that made him wince at Susans and Brents slang
But when he spoke thus frankly and feelingly of the change in him Susan looked at himand not having seen him in two weeks and three days she really saw him for the first time in many a month
She could not think of the internal change he spoke of for noting the external change
He had grown at least fifty pounds heavier than he had been when they came abroad
In one way this was an improvement it gave him a dignity an air of consequence in place of the boyish good looks of the days before the automobile and before the effects of high living began to show
But it made of him a different man in Susans eyesa man who now seemed almost a stranger to her
Yes you have changed replied she absently
And she went and examined herself in a mirror
You too said Freddie
You dont look olderas I do
Buttheres aaI cant describe it
Susan could not see it
Im just the same she insisted
Palmer laughed
You cant judge about yourself
But all this excitementand studyingand thinkingand God knows what Youre not at all the woman I came abroad with
The subject seemed to be making both uncomfortable they dropped it
Women are bred to attach enormous importance to their physical selvesso much so that many women have no other sense of selfrespect and regard themselves as possessing the entirety of virtue if they have chastity or can pretend to have it
The life Susan had led upsets all this and forces a woman either utterly to despise herself even as she is despised of men or to discard the sex measure of feminine selfrespect as ridiculously inadequate and to seek some other measure
Susan had sought this other measure and had found it
She was therefore not a little surprised to findafter Freddie had been back three or four daysthat he was arousing in her the same sensations which a strange man intimately about would have aroused in her in the long past girlhood of innocence
It was not physical repulsion it was not a sense of immorality
It was a kind of shyness a feeling of violated modesty
She felt herself blushing if he came into the room when she was dressing
As soon as she awakened in the morning she sprang from bed beside him and hastened into her dressingroom and closed the door resisting an impulse to lock it
Apparently the feeling of physical modesty which she had thought dead killed to the last root was not dead was once more stirring toward life
What are you blushing about
asked he when she passing through the bedroom came suddenly upon him very scantily dressed
She laughed confusedly and beat a hurried retreat
She began to revolve the idea of separate bedrooms she resolved that when they moved again she would arrange it on some pretextand she was looking about for a new place on the plea that their quarters in Half Moon Street were too cramped
All this close upon his return for it was before the end of the first week that she taking a shower bath one morning saw the door of the bathroom opening to admit him and cried out sharply Close that door
Its I Freddie called to make himself heard above the noise of the water
Shut off that water and listen
She shut off the water but instead of listening she said nervous but determined Please close the door
Ill be out directly
Listen I tell you he cried and she now noticed that his voice was curiously arrestingly shrill
Brenthas been hurtbadly hurt
She was dripping wet
She thrust her arms into her bathrobe flung wide the partly open door
He was standing there a newspaper in his trembling hand
This is a dispatch from New Yorkdated yesterday he began
Listen and he read During an attempt to rob the house of Mr Robert Brent the distinguished playwright early this morning Mr Brent was set upon and stabbed in a dozen places his butler James Fourget was wounded perhaps mortally and his secretary Mr J C Garvey was knocked insensible
The thieves made their escape
The police have several clues
Mr Brent is hovering between life and death with the chances against him
Susan leaning with all her weight against the door jamb saw Palmers white face going away from her heard his agitated voice less and less distinctlyfell to the floor with a crash and knew no more
When she came to she was lying in the bed about it or near it were Palmer her maid his valet Clelie several strangers
Her glance turned to Freddies face and she looked into his eyes amid a profound silence
She saw in those eyes only intense anxiety and intense affection
He said What is it dear
You are all right
Only a fainting spell
Was that true
she asked
Yes but hell pull through
The surgeons save everybody nowadays
Ive cabled his secretary Garvey and to my lawyers
Well have an answer soon
Ive sent out for all the papers
She must not be agitated interposed a medical looking man with stupid brown eyes and a thin brown beard sparsely veiling his gaunt and pasty face
Nonsense
said Palmer curtly
My wife is not an invalid
Our closest friend has been almost killed
To keep the news from her would be to make her sick
Susan closed her eyes
Thank you she murmured
Send them all awayexcept Clelie



Leave me alone with Clelie
Pushing the others before him Freddie moved toward the door into the hall
At the threshold he paused to say Shall I bring the papers when they come
She hesitated
No she answered without opening her eyes
Send them in
I want to read them myself
She lay quiet Clelie stroking her brow
From time to time a shudder passed over her
When in answer to a knock Clelie took in the bundle of newspapers she sat up in bed and read the meager dispatches
The long accounts were made long by the addition of facts about Brents life
The short accounts added nothing to what she already knew
When she had read all she sank back among the pillows and closed her eyes
A long long silence in the room
Then a soft knock at the door
Clelie left the bedside to answer it returned to say Mr Freddie wishes to come in with a telegram
Susan started up wildly
Her eyes were wide and staringa look of horror
Nono
she cried
Then she compressed her lips passed her hand slowly over her brow
Yestell him to come in
Her gaze was upon the door until it opened leaped to his face to his eyes the instant he appeared
He was smilinghopefully but not gayly
Garvey saysand he read from a slip of paper in his hand None of the wounds necessarily mortal
Doctors refuse to commit themselves but I believe he has a good chance
He extended the cablegram that she might read for herself and said Hell win my dear
He has luck and lucky people always win in big things
Her gaze did not leave his face
One would have said that she had not heard that she was still seeking what she had admitted him to learn
He sat down where Clelie had been and said Theres only one thing for us to do and that is to go over at once
She closed her eyes
A baffled puzzled expression was upon her deathly pale face
We can sail on the Mauretania Saturday continued he
Ive telephoned and there are good rooms
She turned her face away
Dont you feel equal to going
As you say we must
The trip cant do you any harm
His forced composure abruptly vanished and he cried out hysterically Good God
Its incredible
Then he got himself in hand again and went on No wonder it bowled you out
I had my anxiety about you to break the shock
But you How do you feel now
Im going to dress
Ill send you in some brandy
He bent and kissed her
A shudder convulsed hera shudder visible even through the covers
But he seemed not to note it and went on I didnt realize how fond I was of Brent until I saw that thing in the paper
I almost fainted myself
I gave Clelie a horrible scare
I thought you were having an attack said Clelie
My husband looked exactly as you did when he died that way
Susans strange eyes were gazing intently at himthe searching baffled persistently seeking look
She closed them as he turned from the bed
When she and Clelie were alone and she was dressing she said Freddie gave you a scare
I was at breakfast replied Clelie was pouring my coffee
He came into the room in his bathrobetook up the papers from the table opened to the foreign news as he always does
I happened to be looking at himClelie flushedhe is very handsome in that robeand all at once he dropped the papergrew whitestaggered and fell into a chair
Exactly like my husband
Susan seated at her dressingtable was staring absently out of the window
She shook her head impatiently drew a long breath went on with her toilet
XXIV A FEW minutes before the dinner hour she came into the drawing room
Palmer and Madame Deliere were already there near the fire which the unseasonable but by no means unusual coolness of the London summer evening made extremely comfortableand for Americans necessary
Palmer stood with his back to the blaze moodily smoking a cigarette
That evening his now almost huge form looked more degenerated than usual by the fat of high living and much automobiling
His fleshy face handsome still and of a refined type bore the traces of anxious sorrow
Clelie sitting at the corner of the fireplace and absently turning the leaves of an illustrated French magazine had in her own way an air as funereal as Freddies
As Susan entered they glanced at her
Palmer uttered and half suppressed an ejaculation of amazement
Susan was dressed as for opera or ballone of her best evening dresses the greatest care in arranging her hair and the details of her toilette
Never had she been more beautiful
Her mode of life since she came abroad with Palmer the thoughts that had been filling her brain and giving direction to her life since she accepted Brent as her guide and Brents plans as her career had combined to give her air of distinction the touch of the extraordinarythe touch that characterizes the comparatively few human beings who live the life above and apart from that of the common runthe life illuminated by imagination
At a glance one sees that they are not of the eaters drinkers sleepers and seekers after the shallow easy pleasures money provides readymade
They shine by their own light the rest of mankind shines either by light reflected from them or not at all
Looking at her that evening as she came into the comfortable oldfashioned English room with its somewhat heavy but undeniably dignified furniture and draperies the least observant could not have said that she was in gala attire because she was in gala mood
Beneath the calm of her surface expression lay something widely different
Her face slim and therefore almost beyond the reach of the attacks of time and worry was of the type to which a haggard expression is becoming
Her eyes large and dreamy seemed to be seeing visions of unutterable sadness and the scarlet streak of her mouth seemed to emphasize their pathos
She looked young very young yet there was also upon her features the stamp of experience the experience of suffering
She did not notice the two by the fire but went to the piano at the far end of the room and stood gazing out into the lovely twilight of the garden
Freddie who saw only the costume said in an undertone to Clelie What sort of freak is this
Said Madame Deliere An uncle of mine lost his wife
They were young and he loved her to distraction
Between her death and the funeral he scandalized everybody by talking incessantly of the most trivial detailsthe cards the mourning the flowers his own clothes
But the night of the funeral he killed himself
Palmer winced as if Clelie had struck him
Then an expression of terror of fear came into his eyes
You dont think shed do that
he muttered hoarsely
Certainly not replied the young Frenchwoman
I was simply trying to explain her
She dressed because she was unconscious of what she was doing
Real sorrow doesnt think about appearances
Then with quick tact she added Why should she kill herself
Monsieur Brent is getting well
Also while shes a devoted friend of his she doesnt love him but you
Im all upset said Palmer in confused apology
He gazed fixedly at Susana straight slim figure with the carriage and the poise of head that indicate selfconfidence and pride
As he gazed Madame Clelie watched him with fascinated eyes
It was both thrilling and terrifying to see such love as he was revealinga love more dangerous than hate
Palmer noted that he was observed abruptly turned to face the fire
A servant opened the doors into the diningroom Madame Deliere rose
Come Susan said she
Susan looked at her with unseeing eyes
Dinner is served
I do not care for dinner said Susan seating herself at the piano
Oh but you Let her alone said Freddie curtly
You and I will go in
Susan alone dropped listless hands into her lap
How long she sat there motionless and with mind a blank she did not know
She was aroused by a sound in the hallin the direction of the outer door of their apartment
She started up instantly all alive and alert and glided swiftly in the direction of the sound
A servant met her at the threshold
He had a cablegram on a tray
For Mr Palmer said he
But she not hearing took the envelope and tore it open
At a sweep her eyes took in the unevenly typewritten words Brent died at half past two this afternoon
GARVEY
She gazed wonderingly at the servant reread the cablegram
The servant said Shall I take it to Mr Palmer maam
No
That is all thanks replied she
And she walked slowly across the room to the fire
She shivered adjusted one of the shoulder straps of her lowcut pale green dress
She read the cablegram a third time laid it gently thoughtfully upon the mantel
Brent died at half past two this afternoon
Died
Yes there was no mistaking the meaning of those words
She knew that the message was true
But she did not feel it
She was seeing Brent as he had been when they said goodby
And it would take something more than a mere message to make her feel that the Brent so vividly alive so redolent of life of activity of energy of plans and projects the Brent of health and strength had ceased to be
Brent died at half past two this afternoon
Except in the great crises we all act with a certain theatricalism do the thing books and plays and the example of others have taught us to do
But in the great crises we do as we feel
Susan knew that Brent was dead
If he had meant less to her she would have shrieked or fainted or burst into wild sobs
But not when he was her whole future
She knew he was dead but she did not believe it
So she stood staring at the flames and wondering why when she knew such a frightful thing she should remain calm
When she had heard that he was injured she had felt now she did not feel at all
Her body her brain went serenely on in their routine
The part of her that was her very selfhad it died and not Brent
She turned her back to the fire gazed toward the opposite wall
In a mirror there she saw the reflection of Palmer at table in the adjoining room
A servant was holding a dish at his left and he was helping himself
She observed his every motion observed his fattened body his round and large face the forming roll of fat at the back of his neck
All at once she grew coldcold as she had not been since the night she and Etta Brashear walked the streets of Cincinnati
The ache of this cold like the cold of death was an agony
She shook from head to foot
She turned toward the mantel again looked at the cablegram
But she did not take it in her hands
She could seein the air before her eyesin clear sharp letteringBrent died at half past two this afternoon
Garvey
The sensation of cold faded into a sensation of approaching numbness
She went into the hallto her own rooms
In the dressingroom her maid Clemence was putting away the afternoon things she had taken off
She stood at the dressing table unclasping the string of pearls
She said to Clemence tranquilly Please pack in the small trunk with the broad stripes three of my plainest street dressessome underclothesthe things for a journeyonly necessaries
Some very warm things please Clemence Ive suffered from cold and I cant bear the idea of it
And please telephone to theto the Cecil for a room and bath
When you have finished I shall pay you what I owe and a months wages extra
I cannot afford to keep you any longer
But madameClemence fluttered in agitationMadame promised to take me to America
Telephone for the rooms for Miss Susan Lenox said Susan
She was rapidly taking off her dress
If I took you to America I should have to let you go as soon as we landed
But madame Clemence advanced to assist her
Please pack the trunk said Susan
I am leaving here at once
I prefer to go to America even if madame Very well
Ill take you
But you understand
Perfectly madame A sound of hurrying footsteps and Palmer was at the threshold
His eyes were wild his face distorted
His hair usually carefully arranged over the rapidly growing bald spot above his brow was disarranged in a manner that would have been ludicrous but for the terrible expression of his face
Go
he said harshly to the maid and he stood fretting the knob until she hastened out and gave him the chance to close the door
Susan calm and apparently unconscious of his presence went on with her rapid change of costume
He lit a cigarette with fingers trembling dropped heavily into a chair near the door
She seated on the floor was putting on boots
When she had finished one and was beginning on the other he said stolidly You think I did itnot a question but an assertion
I know it replied she
She was so seated that he was seeing her in profile
YesI did he went on
He settled himself more deeply in the chair crossed his leg
And I am glad that I did
She kept on at lacing the boot
There was nothing in her expression to indicate emotion or even that she heard
I did it continued he because I had the right
He invited it
He knew meknew what to expect
I suppose he decided that you were worth taking the risk
Its strange what fools menall menwe menare about women



Yes he knew it
He didnt blame me
She stopped lacing the boot turned so that she could look at him
Do you remember his talking about me one day
he went on meeting her gaze naturally
He said I was a survival of the Middle Ageshad a medieval Italian mindsaid I would do anything to gain my endand would have a clear conscience about it
Do you remember
Yes
But you dont see why I had the right to kill him
A shiver passed over her
She turned away again began again to lace the bootbut now her fingers were uncertain
Ill explain pursued he
You and I were getting along fine
He had had his chance with you and had lost it
Well he comes over herelooks us upputs himself between you and meproceeds to take you away from me
Not in a square manly way but under the pretense of giving you a career
He made you restlessdissatisfied
He got you away from me
Isnt that so
She was sitting motionless now
Palmer went on in the same harsh jerky way Now nobody in the worldnot even youknew me better than Brent did
He knew what to expectif I caught on to what was doing
And I guess he knew I would be pretty sure to catch on
He never said a word to me that you couldnt have heard said Susan
Of course not retorted Palmer
That isnt the question
It dont matter whether he wanted you for himself or for his plays
The point is that he took you away from mehe my friendand did it by stealth
You cant deny that
He offered me a chance for a careerthat was all said she
He never asked for my loveor showed any interest in it
I gave him that
He laughedhis oldtime gentle sweet wicked laugh
He said Wellitd have been better for him if you hadnt
All it did for him was to cost him his life
Up she sprang
Dont say that
she cried passionatelyso passionately that her whole body shook
Do you suppose I dont know it
I know that I killed him
But I dont feel that hes dead
If I did Id not be able to live
But I cant
I cant
For me he is as much alive as ever
Try to think thatif it pleases you sneered Palmer
The fact remains that it was you who killed him
Again she shivered
Yes she said I killed him
And thats why I hate you Palmer went on calm and deliberateexcept his eyes they were terrible
A few minutes agowhen I was exulting that he would probably diejust then I found that opened cable on the mantel
Do you know what it did to me
It made me hate you
When I read it Freddie puffed at his cigarette in silence
She dropped weakly to the chair at the dressing table
Curse it
he burst out
I loved him
Yes I was crazy about himand am still
Im glad I killed him
Id do it again
I had to do it
He owed me his life
But that doesnt make me forgive you
A long silence
Her fingers wandered among the articles spread upon the dressing table
He said Youre getting ready to leave
Im going to a hotel at once
Well you neednt
Im leaving
Youre done with me
But Im done with you
He rose bent upon her his wicked glance sneering and cruel
You never want to see me again
No more do I ever want to see you again
I wish to God I never had seen you
You cost me the only friend I ever had that I cared about
And whats a woman beside a frienda man friend
Youve made a fool of me as a woman always does of a manalways by God
If she loves him she destroys him
If she doesnt love him he destroys himself
Susan covered her face with her bare arms and sank down at the dressing table
For pitys sake she cried brokenly spare mespare me
He seized her roughly by the shoulder
Just flesh
he said
Beautiful fleshbut just female
And look what a fool youve made of meand the best man in the world deadover yonder
Spare you
Oh youll pull through all right
Youll pull through everything and anythingand come out stronger and better looking and better off
Spare you
Hell
Id have killed you instead of him if Id known I was going to hate you after Id done the other thing
Id do it yetyou dirty skirt
He jerked her unresisting form to its feet gazed at her like an insane fiend
With a sob he seized her in his arms crushed her against his breast sunk his fingers deep into her hair kissed it grinding his teeth as he kissed
I hate you damn youand I love you
He flung her back into the chairout of his life
Youll never see me again
And he fled from the roomfrom the house
XXV THE big ship issued from the Mersey into ugly watersinto the weather that at all seasons haunts and curses the coasts of Northern Europe
From Saturday until Wednesday Susan and Madame Deliere had true Atlantic seas and skies and the ship leaped and shivered and crashed along like a brave cavalryman in the rear of a routfighting and flying flying and fighting
Four days of hours whose every waking second lagged to record itself in a distinct pang of physical wretchedness four days in which all emotions not physical were suspended in which even the will to live most tenacious of primal instincts in a sane human being yielded somewhat to the general lassitude and disgust
Yet for Susan Lenox four most fortunate days for in them she underwent a mental change that enabled her to emerge delivered of the strain that threatened at every moment to cause a snap
On the fifth day her mind crutched by her resuming body took up again its normal routine
She began to dress herself to eat to exercisethe mechanical things first as alwaysthen to think
The grief that had numbed her seemed to have been left behind in England where it had suddenly struck her downEngland far away and vague across those immense and infuriated waters like the gulf of death between two incarnations
No doubt that grief was awaiting her at the other shores no doubt there she would feel that Brent was gone
But she would be better able to bear the discovery
The body can be accustomed to the deadliest poisons so that they become harmlesseven usefuleven a necessary aid to life
In the same way the mind can grow accustomed to the cruelest calamities tolerate them use them to attain a strength and power the hothoused soul never gets
When a human being is abruptly plunged into an unnatural unconsciousness by mental or physical catastrophes the greatest care is taken that the awakening to normal life again be slow gradual without shock
Otherwise the return would mean death or insanity or lifelong affliction with radical weakness
It may be that this sea voyage with its four days of agitations that lowered Susans physical life to a harmony of wretchedness with her mental plight and the succeeding days of gradual calming and restoration acted upon her to save her from disaster
There will be those readers of her story who judging her perhaps by themselvesas revealed in their judgments rather than in their professionswill think it was quite unnecessary to awaken her gradually they will declare her a hardhearted person caring deeply about no one but herself or one of those curiosities of human nature that are interested only in things not at all in persons even in themselves
There may also be those who will see in her a soft and gentle heart for which her intelligence finally taught her to construct a shieldmore or less effectiveagainst buffetings which would have destroyed or worse still maimed her
These will feel that the sea voyage the sea change suspending the normal human life the life on land tided her over a crisis that otherwise must have been disastrous
However this may beand who dares claim the definite knowledge of the mazes of human character and motive to be positive about the matterhowever it may be on Thursday afternoon they steamed along a tranquil and glistening sea into the splendor and majesty of New York Harbor
And Susan was again her calm sweet self as the violetgray eyes gazing pensively from the small stronglyfeatured face plainly showed
Herself again with the wounddeepest if not cruelest of her many woundscovered and with its poison under control
She was ready again to begin to liveready to fulfill our only certain mission on this earth for we are not here to succumb and to die but to adapt ourselves and live
And those who laud the succumbers and the diersyea even the blessed martyrs of sundry and divers fleeting issues usually delusionsmay be paying illdeserved tribute to vanity obstinacy lack of useful common sense passion for futile and untimely agitationor sheer cowardice
Truthand what is truth but right livingtruth needs no martyrs and the world needs not martyrs not corpses rotting in unmarked or monumented graves but intelligent men and women healthy in body and mind capable of leading the human race as fast as it is able to go in the direction of the best truth to which it is able at that time to aspire
As the ship cleared Quarantine Susan stood on the main deck well forward with Madame Clelie beside her
And up within her defying all rebuke surged the hope that cannot die in strong souls living in healthy bodies
She had a momentary sense of shame born of the feeling that it is basest most heartless selfishness to live to respond to the caress of keen air upon healthy skin of glorious light upon healthy eyes when there are others shut out and shut away from these joys forever
Then she said to herself But no one need apologize for being alive and for hoping
I must try to justify him for all he did for me
A few miles of beautiful water highway between circling shores of green and afar off through the mist Madame Clelies fascinated eyes beheld a city of enchantment
It appeared and disappeared reappeared only to disappear again as its veil of azure mist was blown into thick or thin folds by the light breeze
One moment the Frenchwoman would think there was nothing ahead but more and ever more of the bay glittering in the summer sunlight
The next moment she would see again that cityor was it a mirage of a citytowers mighty walls domes rising mass above mass summit above summit into the very heavens from the waters edge where there was a fringe of green
Surely the vision must be real yet how could tiny man out of earth and upon earth rear in such enchantment of line and color those enormous masses those peaklike piercings of the sky
Is thatit she asked in an awed undertone
Susan nodded
She too was gazing spellbound
Her beloved City of the Sun
But it is beautifulbeautiful beyond belief
And I have always heard that New York was ugly
It is beautifuland uglyboth beyond belief
replied Susan
No wonder you love it
YesI love it
I have loved it from the first moment I saw it
Ive never stopped loving itnot even She did not finish her sentence but gazed dreamily at the city appearing and disappearing in its veils of thin luminous mist
Her thoughts traveled again the journey of her life in New York
When she spoke again it was to say Yeswhen I first saw itthat spring eveningI called it my City of the Stars then for I didnt know that it belonged to the sunYes that spring evening I was happier than I ever had beenor ever shall be again
But you will be happy again dear said Clelie tenderly pressing her arm
A faint sad smilesad but still a smilemade Susans beautiful face lovely
Yes I shall be happynot in those waysbut happy for I shall be busy



No I dont take the tragic view of lifenot at all
And as Ive known misery I dont try to hold to it
Leave that said Clelie to those who have known only the comfortable makebelieve miseries that rustle in crepe and shed tearswhenever theres anyone by to see
Like the beggars who begin to whine and exhibit their aggravated sores as soon as a possible giver comes into view said Susan
Ive learned to accept what comes and to try to make the best of it whatever it is



I say Ive learned
But have I
Does one ever change
I guess I was born that sort of philosopher
She recalled how she put the Warhams out of her life as soon as she discovered what they really meant to her and she to themhow she had put Jeb Ferguson out of her lifehow she had conquered the grief and desolation of the loss of Burlinghamhow she had survived Ettas going away without herthe inner meaning of her episodes with Rodwith Freddie Palmer And now this last supreme testwith her soul rising up and gathering itself together and lifting its head in strength Yes I was born to make the best of things she repeated
Then you were born lucky sighed Clelie who was of those who must lean if they would not fall and lie where they fell
Susan gave a curious little laughwith no mirth with a great deal of mockery
Do you know I never thought so before but I believe youre right said she
Again she laughed in that queer way
If you knew my life youd think I was joking
But Im not
The fact that Ive survived and am what I am proves I was born lucky
Her tone changed her expression became unreadable
If its lucky to be born able to live
And if that isnt luck what is
She thought how Brent said she was born lucky because she had the talent that enables one to rise above the sordidness of that capitalism he so often denouncedthe sordidness of the lot of its slaves the sordidness of the lot of its masters
Brent
If it were he leaning beside herif he and she were coming up the bay toward the City of the Sun
A billow of heartsick desolation surged over her
Alonealways alone
And still alone
And always to be alone
Garvey came aboard when the gangway was run out
He was in black wherever black could be displayed
But the grief shadowing his large simple countenance had the stamp of the genuine
And it was genuine of the most approved enervating kind
He had done nothing but grieve since his masters deathhad left unattended all the matters the man he loved and grieved for would have wished put in order
Is it out of charity for the weakness of human nature and that we may think as well as possible of itis that why we admire and praise most enthusiastically the kind of love and the kind of friendship and the kind of grief that manifest themselves in obstreperous feeling and wordiness with no strength left for any attempt to do As Garvey greeted them the tears filled Clelies eyes and she turned away
But Susan gazed at him steadily in her eyes there were no tears but a look that made Garvey choke back sobs and bend his head to hide his expression
What he sawor feltbehind her calmness filled him with awe with a kind of terror
But he did not recognize what he saw as grief it did not resemble any grief he had felt or had heard about
He made a will just before he died he said to Susan
He left everything to you
Then she had not been mistaken
He had loved her even as she loved him
She turned and walked quickly from them
She hastened into her cabin closed the door and flung herself across the bed
And for the first time she gave way
In that storm her soul was like a little land bird in the clutch of a sea hurricane
She did not understand herself
She still had no sense that he was dead yet had his dead body been lying there in her arms she could not have been more shaken by paroxysms of grief without tears or sobsgrief that vents itself in shrieks and peals of horrible laughterlike screamsshe smothered them in the pillows in which she buried her face
Clelie came opened the door glanced in closed it
An hour passedan hour and a half
Then Susan appeared on deckamberwhite pallor calm beautiful the fashionable woman in traveling dress
I never before saw you with your lips not rouged
exclaimed Clelie
You will never see them rouged again said Susan
But it makes you look older
Not so old as I am replied she
And she busied herself about the details of the landing and the customs waving aside Garvey and his eager urgings that she sit quietly and leave everything to him
In the carriage on the way to the hotel she roused herself from her apparently tranquil reverie and broke the strained silence by saying How much shall I have
The question was merely the protruding end of a train of thought years long and pursued all that time with scarcely an interruption
It seemed abrupt to Garvey it sounded brutal
Off his guard he showed in flooding color and staring eye how profoundly it shocked him
Susan saw but she did not explain she was not keeping accounts in emotion with the world
She waited patiently
After a long pause he said in a tone that contained as much of rebuke as so mild a dependent dared express He left about thirty thousand a year Miss Lenox
The exultant light that leaped to Susans eye horrified him
It even disturbed Clelie though she better understood Susans nature and was not nearly so reverent as Garvey of the hypocrisies of conventionality
But Susan had long since lost the last trace of awe of the opinion of others
She was not seeking to convey an impression of grief
Grief was too real to her
She would as soon have burst out with voluble confession of the secret of her love for Brent
She saw what Garvey was thinking but she was not concerned
She continued to be herselfnatural and simple
And there was no reason why she should conceal as a thing to be ashamed of the fact that Brent had accomplished the purpose he intended had filled her with honest exultationnot with delight merely not with triumph but with that stronger and deeper joy which the unhoped for pardon brings to the condemned man
She must live on
The thought of suicide of any form of giving upthe thought that instantly possesses the weak and the diseasedcould not find lodgment in that young healthy body and mind of hers
She must live on and suddenly she discovered that she could live free Not after years of doubtful struggles of reverses of success so hardly won that she was left exhausted
But nowat oncefree The heavy shackles had been stricken off at a blow
She was freeforever free
Free forever free from the wolves of poverty and shame of want and rags and filth the wolves that had been pursuing her with swift hideous padded stride the wolves that more than once had dragged her down and torn and trampled her and lapped her blood
Free to enter of her own right the world worth living in the world from which all but a few are shut out the world which only a few of those privileged to enter know how to enjoy
Free to live the life worth while the life of leisure to work instead of slaving to make leisure and luxury and comfort for others
Free to achieve something beside food clothing and shelter
Free to live as she pleased instead of for the pleasure of a master or masters
Freefreefree
The ecstasy of it surged up in her for the moment possessing her and submerging even thought of how she had been freed
She who had never acquired the habit of hypocrisy frankly exulted in countenance exultant beyond laughter
She could conceal her feelings could refrain from expressing
But if she expressed at all it must be her true selfwhat she honestly felt
Garvey hung his head in shame
He would not have believed Susan could be so unfeeling
He would not let his eyes see the painful sight
He would try to forget would deny to himself that he had seen
For to his shallow conventional nature Susans expression could only mean delight in wealth in the opportunity that now offered to idle and to luxuriate in the dead mans money to realize the crude dreamings of those lesser minds whose initial impulses toward growth have been stifled by the routine our social system imposes upon all but the few with the strength to persist individual
Free
She tried to summon the haunting vision of the old women with the tin cups of whisky reeling and staggering in time to the hunchbacks playing
She could remember every detail but these memories would not assemble even into a vivid picture and the picture would have been far enough from the horror of actuality in the vision she formerly could not banish
As a menace as a prophecy the old women and the hunchback and the strumming piano had gone forever
Freesecure independentfree
After a long silence Garvey ventured stammeringly He said to mehe asked me to requesthe didnt make it a conditionjust a wisha hope Miss Lenoxthat if you could and felt it strongly enough Wished what
said Susan with a sharp impatience that showed how her nerves were unstrung
That youd go ongo on with the playswith the acting
The violet eyes expressed wonder
Go on
she inquired Go on
Then in a tone that made Clelie sob and Garveys eyes fill she said What else is there to live for now
ImIm glad for his sake stammered Garvey
He was disconcerted by her smile
She made no other answeraloud
For his sake
For her own sake rather
What other life had she but the life he had given her
And he knew I would she said to herself
He said that merely to let me know he left me entirely free
How like him to do that
At the hotel she shut herself in she saw no one not even Clelie for nearly a week
Thenshe went to workand worked like a reincarnation of Brent
She inquired for Sperry found that he and Rod had separated as they no longer needed each other she went into a sort of partnership with Sperry for the production of Brents playshe an excellent coach as well as stage director helping her to finish her formal education for the stage
She played with success half a dozen of the already produced Brent plays
At the beginning of her second season she appeared in what has become her most famous partRoxy in Brents last play The Scandal
With the opening night her career of triumph began
Even the criticstherefore not unnaturally suspicious of an actress who was so beautiful so beautifully dressed so well supported and so well outfitted with actorproof plays even the critics conceded her ability
She was worthy of the great character Brent had createdthe wayward manysided ever gay Roxy Grandon
When at the first night of The Scandal the audience lingered cheering Brents picture thrown upon a drop cheering Susan calling her out again and again refusing to leave the theater until it was announced that she could answer no more calls as she had gone homewhen she was thus finally and firmly established in her own rightshe said to Sperry Will you see to it that every sketch of me that appears tomorrow says that I am the natural daughter of Lorella Lenox
Sperrys Punchlike face reddened
Ive been ashamed of that fact she went on
It has made me ashamed to be alive in the bottom of my heart
Absurd said Sperry
Exactly replied Susan
Absurd
Even stronger than my shame about it has been my shame that I could be so small as to feel ashamed of it
Nowtonight she was still in her dressingroom
As she paused they heard the faint faraway thunders of the applause of the lingering audienceListen
she cried
I am ashamed no longer
Sperry Ich bin ein Ich I should say laughed he
All you have to say is Susan Lenox and you answer all questions
At last Im proud of it she went on
Ive justified myself
Ive justified my mother
I am proud of her and she would be proud of me
So see that its done Sperry
Sure said he
Youre right
He took her hand and kissed it
She laughed patted him on the shoulder kissed him on both cheeks in friendly sisterly fashion
He had just gone when a card was brought to herDr Robert Stevenswith Sutherland Indiana penciled underneath
Instantly she remembered and had him brought to herthe man who had rescued her from death at her birth
He proved to be a quiet elderly gentleman subdued and aged beyond his fiftyfive years by the monotonous life of the drowsy old town
He approached with a manner of embarrassed respect and deference stammering oldfashioned compliments
But Susan was the simple unaffected girl again so natural that he soon felt as much at ease as with one of his patients in Sutherland
She took him away in her car to her apartment for supper with her and Clelie who was in the company and Sperry
She kept him hour after hour questioning him about everyone and everything in the old town drawing him out insisting upon more and more details
The morning papers were brought and they read the accounts of play and author and players
For once there was not a dissent all the critics agreed that it was a great performance of a great play
And Susan made Sperry read aloud the finest and the longest of the accounts of Brent himselfhis life his death his work his lasting fame now peculiarly assured because in Susan Lenox there had been found a competent interpreter of his genius
After the reading there fell silence
Susan her pallid face and her luminous inquiring violet eyes inscrutable sat gazing into vacancy
At last Doctor Stevens moved uneasily and rose to go
Susan roused herself accompanied him to the adjoining room
Said the old doctor
Ive told you about everybody
But youve told me nothing about the most interesting Sutherlander of allyourself
Susan looked at him
And he saw the wound hidden from all the worldthe wound she hid from herself as much of the time as she could
He the doctor the professional confessor had seen such wounds often in all the world there is hardly a heart without one
He said Since sorrow is the common lot I wonder that men can be so selfish or so unthinking as not to help each other in every way to its consolations
Poor creatures that we arewandering in the dark fighting desperately not knowing friend from foe
But I am glad that you saved me said she
You have the consolationssuccessfamehonor
There is no consolation replied she in her grave sweet way
I had the best
Ilost him
I shall spend my life in flying from myself
After a pause she went on I shall never speak to anyone as I have spoken to you
You will understand all
I had the bestthe man who could have given me all a woman seeks from a manlove companionship sympathy the shelter of strong arms
I had that
I have lost it
So A long pause
Then she added Usually life is almost tasteless to me
Againfor an hour or two it is a little less sountil I remember what I have lost
Thenthe taste is very bittervery bitter
And she turned away
She is a famous actress reputed great
Some day she will be indeed greatwhen she has the stage experience and the years
Except for Clelie she is alone
Not that there have been no friendships in her life
There have even been passions
With men and women of her vigor and vitality passion is inevitable
But those she admits find that she has little to give and they go away she making no effort to detain them or she finds that she has nothing to give and sends them away as gently as may be
She has the reputation of caring for nothing but her artand for the great establishment for orphans up the Hudson into which about all her earnings go
The establishment is named for Brent and is dedicated to her mother
Is she happy
I do not know
I do not think she knows
Probably she isas long as she can avoid pausing to think whether she is or not
What better happiness can intelligent mortal have or hope for
Certainly she is triumphant is lifted high above the storms that tortured her girlhood and early youth the sordid woes that make life an unrelieved tragedy of calamity threatened and calamity realized for the masses of mankind
The last time I saw her It was a few evenings ago and she was crossing the sidewalk before her house toward the big limousine that was to take her to the theater
She is still young she looked even younger than she is
Her dress had the same exquisite quality that made her the talk of Paris in the days of her sojourn there
But it is not her dress that most interests me nor the luxury and perfection of all her surroundings
It is not even her beautythat is the whole of her beauty
Everything and every being that is individual in appearance has some one quality trait characteristic which stands out above all the rest to make a climax of interest and charm
With the rose it is its perfume with the bird perhaps the scarlet or snowy feathers upon its breast
Among human beings who have the rare divine dower of clear individuality the crown and cap of distinction differs
In herfor me at leastthe consummate fascination is not in her eyes though I am moved by the soft glory of their light nor in the lovely oval contour of her sweet healthily pallid face
No it is in her mouthsensitive strong yet gentle suggestive of all the passion and suffering and striving that have built up her life
Her mouththe curve of itI think it is that sends from time to time the mysterious thrill through her audiences
And I imagine those who know her best look always first at those strangely pale lips curved in a way that suggests bitterness melting into sympathy sadness changing into mirtha way that seems to say I have sufferedbut see
I have stood fast
Can a life teach any deeper lesson give any higher inspiration
As I was saying the last time I saw her she was about to enter her automobile
I halted and watched the graceful movements with which she took her seat and gathered the robes about her
And then I noted her profile by the light of the big lamps guarding her door
You know that profile
You have seen its same expression in every profile of successful man or woman who ever lived
Yes she may be happydoubtless is more happy than unhappy
ButI do not envy heror any other of the sons and daughters of men who is blessedand cursedwith imagination
And Freddieand Rodand Ettaand the people of Sutherlandand all the rest who passed through her life and out
What does it matter
Some went up some downnot without reason but alas
not for reason of desert
For the judgments of fate are for the most part not unlike blows from a lunatic striking out in the dark if they land where they should it is rarely and by sheer chance
Ruths parents are dead she is married to Sam Wright
He lost his fathers money in wheat speculation in Chicagoin one of the most successful of the plutocracys constantly recurring raids upon the hoardings of the middle class
They live in a little house in one of the back streets of Sutherland and he is head clerk in Arthur Sinclairs storea position he owes to the fact that Sinclair is his rich brotherinlaw
Ruth has children and she is happier in them than she realizes or than her discontented face and voice suggest
Etta is fat and contented the mother of many and fond of her fat fussy August the rich brewer
John Redmonda congressman a possession of the Beef Trust I believebut not so highly prized a possession as was his abler father
Freddie
I saw him a year ago at the races at Auteuil
He is huge and loose and coarse is in the way soon to die of Brights disease I suspect
There was a woman with himvery pretty very chic
I saw no other woman similarly placed whose eyes held so assiduously and without ever a wandering flutter to the face of the man who was paying
But Freddie never noticed her
He chewed savagely at his cigar looking about the while for things to grumble at or to curse
Rod
He is still writing indifferent plays with varying success
He long since wearied of Constance Francklyn but she clings to him and as she is a steady moneymaker he tolerates her
Brent
He is statelily ensconced up at Woodlawn
Susan has never been to his gravethere
His grave in her heartshe avoids that too when she can
But there are timesthere always will be times If you doubt it look at her profile
Yes she has learned to live
Butshe has paid the price
